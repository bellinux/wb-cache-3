Police indicated that the five arrested at the airport would be charged with drug trafficking, which carries the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would be charged with the lesser offence of drug possession, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. It was suggested that Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as drug mules – couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia – and offered them A$10,000 to A$15,000 each {{to carry out this}} task, and given A$5000 spending cash.|$|E

5|$|Smyth sent {{an outline}} and rough {{draft of the}} report to Groves for {{approval}} in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They {{felt that it was}} too technical for general readers, did not mention the names of enough participants, and dwelt too much on the activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving <b>people</b> <b>be</b> mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas, and William Shurcliff from Harvard University. They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript.|$|E

25|$|Al-Qaradawi {{says that}} Niqab (Veil) is not {{obligatory}} in Islam. He {{has pointed out}} that a woman's face is not an Awrah.

Those <b>people,</b> <b>be</b> it male or female at that time had to cover their faces from dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during sandstorm.

25|$|Ahad Ha'am {{believed}} that Zionism must bring Jews to Palestine gradually, while {{turning it into}} a cultural centre.

He did not believe that the impoverished settlers of his day would ever build a Jewish homeland. He saw the Hovevei Zion movement of which he was a member as a failure because the new villages were dependent on the largess of outside benefactors.|$|E
25|$|On March 20, 2017, {{the four}} hosts of SourceFeds primary channel at the time—Ava Gordy, Mike Falzone, Candace Carrizales, and Steven Suptic—released a video {{addressing}} {{the cancellation of}} SourceFed {{as well as its}} SourceFedNERD and <b>People</b> <b>Be</b> Like spinoffs.They also announced the schedule for the channel's final week; a podcast, a Comment Commentary episode, a usual white wall-styled video, and a live-streamed farewell video were announced for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, respectively. The announcement came as the main SourceFed channel had amassed just over 1.7 million subscribers and 906 million video views in its run.|$|E

25|$|That {{last part}} of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus. Some freed enslaved people were living on {{government}} aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers. Sojourner announces {{that this is not}} any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience. She then proposes that black people are given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored <b>people</b> <b>be</b> given land out west to build homes and prosper on.|$|E
25|$|Early 2016 saw Mike Falzone {{join the}} main channel {{as the host}} of a revised form of #TableTalk, which was brought back to SourceFed{'}s content output. SPF was shut down in April 2016, causing Suptic to {{temporarily}} released from the staff and Scully to return as a host on the NERD channel. In June, Yessica Hernandez-Cruz was introduced as William Haynes' on sister channel <b>People</b> <b>Be</b> Like (PBL). Scully, and additionally Garrett, would later leave NERD in August. Coinciding with their departures, Ava Gordy and Candance Carrizales were brought on in August to host on the main SourceFed channel, while recurring SourceFed guest Whitney Moore, and writer and comedian Filup Molina joined Bashor as full-time hosts on the NERD channel. Suptic was brought back on the staff in September.|$|E
25|$|In Predators (which {{deliberately}} distances {{itself from}} the prior Alien vs. Predator films), it is revealed {{that there are two}} warring Predator tribes: one group uses quadrupedal hunting beasts and elaborate traps to hunt, and the other hunts traditionally. An international group of soldiers and dangerous criminals from different locations from Earth are dropped onto a forested planet used as a Predator game reserve. After numerous skirmishes resulting in the deaths of two Predators and all but two of the captured humans, the last Predator manages to kill another member of his kind from a rival tribe, but is defeated in combat by the human survivors. The survivors then head off to seek a way back to their home, just in time to witness more <b>people</b> <b>be</b> dropped.|$|E

25|$|Ross Everett was {{introduced}} as the seventh on-camera host, after spending time as {{writer for the}} series. In April 2014, DeFranco announced he was moved back to his writing position. However, {{near the end of}} the month, Everett announced his complete departure from SourceFed, in a Tumblr blog post, which had less fanfare surrounded than Morgan's or Turney's departures. Amidst the 2014 departures of Everett, Morgan, and Turney, SourceFed brought on William Haynes, Matt Lieberman, and Reina Scully in March 2014, serving as the de facto replacements for the former. In 2015, all three would later help launch SourceFed sister projects, with Haynes hosting <b>People</b> <b>Be</b> Like (PBL), Lieberman—with fellow SourceFed host Bree Essrig—producing content on Nuclear Family, and Scully joining Steven Suptic in establishing Super Panic Frenzy. While Haynes and Lieberman stayed on with SourceFed through its cancellation, Scully left the company in August 2016.|$|E
25|$|During {{her years}} in Puerto Rico, Rodriguez-Trias {{became aware that}} unsuspecting Puerto Rican women were being sterilized and that Puerto Rico was {{being used by the}} United States as a {{laboratory}} for the development of birth control technology. In New York, after attending a conference on abortion at Barnard College in 1970, she focused on reproductive rights of women and became an advocate for women's reproductive rights, campaigning for change at a policy level. In 1970, Rodriguez-Trias was a founding member of Committee to End Sterilization Abuse and in 1971, {{a founding member of the}} Women's Caucus of the American Public Health Association. Rodriguez-Trias supported abortion rights, fought for the abolishment of enforced sterilization, and sought that neonatal care to underserved <b>people</b> <b>be</b> provided. In 1979, Rodriguez-Trias became a founding member of the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse and testified before the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for passage of federal sterilization guidelines. The guidelines, which she drafted, require a woman's written consent to sterilization, offered in a language they can understand, and set a waiting period between the consent and the sterilization procedure. She is credited with helping to expand the range of public health services for women and children in minority and low-income populations in the United States, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, <b>people</b> <b>be</b> offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E
