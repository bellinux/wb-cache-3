5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E
25|$|Supervised {{release is}} {{recommended}} by the Guidelines for most offenders who are serving a prison sentence {{of more than a}} year. The court has power to supervise the conduct of the probationer not only during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> but afterwards up to the time when the maximum sentence which could have been imposed would have expired. But the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> is not limited by the period of maximum sentence that might have been imposed. On the other hand, probation does not become a nullity if the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> was not specified in the sentence, since the probationary period is limited by the maximum term of the sentence.|$|E

25|$|One notable case {{led to a}} 26-minute {{film that}} PETA {{produced}} in 1984, Unnecessary Fuss. The film was based on 60 hours of researchers' footage obtained by the ALF during a raid on the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic. The footage showed researchers laughing at baboons as they inflicted brain damage on them with a hydraulic device intended to simulate whiplash. Laboratory animal veterinarian Larry Carbone writes that the researchers openly discussed how one baboon was awake before the head injury, despite protocols being in place for anesthesia. The ensuing publicity led to the suspension of funds from the university, the firing of its chief veterinarian, {{the closure of the}} lab, and a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> for the university.|$|E
500|$|Peggy Gallagher {{acquired}} a legal notice of separation {{from her husband}} in 1976. Six years later, she finally left him, taking the three boys with her. As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers (especially Noel) were regular truants, often getting into trouble with the police. When his mother took a job working in the school canteen, Gallagher ensured that he stopped by to visit her during lunch before skipping {{the rest of the}} day. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 for throwing a bag of flour over a teacher. He used to hang around with the football hooligan firms Maine Line Crew, Under-5s, and Young Guvnors in the 1980s, and at the age of 13, he received six months' probation for robbing a corner shop. It was during this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation,</b> with little else to do, that he first began to teach himself to play a guitar his father had left him, playing his favourite songs from the radio. Gallagher was particularly inspired by the debut of The Smiths on Top of the Pops in 1983, performing their single [...] "This Charming Man". He later reflected that [...] "from that day on ... wanted to be Johnny Marr". He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester Gaelic football outfit CLG Oisín at Croke Park, Dublin in 1983.|$|E

40|$|Many economists {{view the}} NCAA as a cartel {{in the market}} for college athletes. Financially, this cartel allows NCAA members to attract and retain college athletes {{for the price of a}} “grant-in-aid” without {{competitively}} bidding for the labor services of student-athletes, greatly reducing operating costs relative to a competitive market for athletes. A functioning cartel must have both monitoring of the members and an enforcement mechanism to punish violators. We investigate the factors that explain observed <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> in NCAA Division I-A football over the period 1978 - 2005. From 1978 - 1993, but not after, lagged winning percentage, unfilled stadium seats, and years of head coaching experience explain probation. The NCAA changed its enforcement policy in 1993, and football conference stability decreased as well during this period. These changes may explain the reduction in predictability <b>of</b> <b>probation.</b> NCAA, cartel, rule violations, monitoring...|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1819, Peacock was unexpectedly summoned to London for a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> with the East India Company who needed to reinforce their staff with talented people. They summoned to their service in the Examiner's office James Mill and three others. Peacock was included at the recommendation of Peter Auber, the company historian, whom he had known at school, though probably not as a school-fellow. Peacock's test papers earned the high commendation, [...] "Nothing superfluous and nothing wanting." [...] On 13 January 1819, he wrote from 5 York Street, Covent Garden: [...] "I now pass every morning at the India House, from half-past 10 to half-past 4, studying Indian affairs. My object is not yet attained, though I have little doubt but that it will be. It {{was not in the}} first instance of my own seeking, but was proposed to me. It will lead to a very sufficing provision for me in two or three years. It is not in the common routine of office, but is an employment of a very interesting and intellectual kind, connected with finance and legislation, in which it is possible to be of great service, not only to the Company, but to the millions under their dominion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The party {{over which}} the politburo held sway was not a mass party but, comporting with Leninist tradition, a smaller {{selective}} party of between three percent (e.g., Albania) and fourteen percent (e.g., Czechoslovakia) of the country's population who had accepted total obedience. [...] For example, a Polish communist described faith in the Polish United Workers' Party as that it [...] "means that his faith in it is uncritical at every stage, {{no matter what the}} party is saying. [...] It is a person with the ability to adapt his mentality and his conscience {{in such a way that}} he can unreservedly accept the dogma that the party is never wrong, even though it is wrong all the time." [...] Entry usually required a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation.</b> [...] Those who secured membership in this selective party received considerable rewards, such as access to special lower priced shops with a greater selection of goods, special schools, holiday facilities, cinemas, homes, furniture, works of art and official cars with special white license plates (instead of the usual black plates) so that police and others could identify these members from a distance. Envelopes containing banknotes, and sometimes foreign hard currency, were not infrequently passed out to certain party or politburo members. [...] After the confiscation through nationalizations from prior owners following Soviet occupation, the party at first possessed considerable additional property and real estate to give members. [...] All members possessed a party card or book in which were recorded attendance at meetings, service to the party and any deviation from party conduct. Periodically, these cards would be inspected, frequently as a prelude to a culling or purge of those considered undesirable or insufficiently committed.|$|E

5000|$|The 2001 {{season was}} not without controversy. Jeff Gordon pulled a [...] "bump and run" [...] on Stewart {{to gain a better}} {{finishing}} position at Bristol and Stewart retaliated in a post-race incident by spinning Gordon out on pit road. Stewart was fined and placed on NASCAR probation. He got into much bigger trouble in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona, where he confronted a Winston Cup official after ignoring a black flag, which he had received for an illegal pass on Dave Blaney. In the same race, he had an incident with a reporter, in which away he kicked a tape recorder. He confronted that same official during the Talladega race after he refused to wear a mandated head-and-neck restraint. Stewart was not allowed to practice until he wore one, and only managed to do so after his crew chief Greg Zipadelli intervened. Stewart's fines and <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> resulting from these incidents have earned him a reputation of having a hot-temper, and he became known as NASCAR's [...] "bad boy".|$|R

And in the brief conversations which she vouchsafed the Vicomte, they discussed his novels. In vain he pleaded, in caressing undertones, that she should ride with him.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into the new world <b>of</b> <b>probation.</b> For the past two decades the Probation Service has struggled to survive in a highly ambivalent social and political climate. During this <b>period,</b> the training <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> officers has separated from social work training and the service has adopted a more punishment-focused, coercive and managerialist stance in its work with offenders. Using a mixed methods approach that includes semi-structured interviews and case discussions, my research focuses on a sample <b>of</b> recently qualified <b>probation</b> officers with a view to exploring their experiences and perceptions of their working lives, and to construct a picture of the occupation from a newcomer perspective. In particular, given the shift in the ideological framework of the service, I wished to learn about the professional identity of the generation <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> officers who are now entering the service through an examination of their motivation and practices. Despite pressure to eradicate the welfare-oriented ethos of the service, a significant and unexpected discovery arising from my research has been the resilience of traditional values that are brought to the service in the aspirations and habitus of newcomers. My findings are contextualised in relation to the criminal justice system, the historical development <b>of</b> the <b>probation</b> service, the status <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> as a profession and my own 'insider' experience. In addition, the study is underpinned by a theoretical perspective that draws on the work of the French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu...|$|R
