25|$|In {{immunostaining}} methods, an antibody is used {{to detect}} a specific protein epitope. These antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal. Detection of this first or <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> can be accomplished in multiple ways.|$|E

50|$|Those {{particles}} {{themselves are}} biologically inactive except for serving as antigens against the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> or as carriers of the antigens. When antibodies {{are used in}} the preparation, they are bound to the erythrocyte or particles in their Fab regions. Thus the step follows requires the secondary <b>antibodies</b> against those <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies,</b> that is, the secondary antibodies must have binding specificity to the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> including to their Fc regions.|$|R
30|$|Bursal {{sections}} were examined to identify <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> for CD 79 (B-lymphocytes). <b>Primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> for CD 79 {{were obtained from}} Novus Biologicus company.

25|$|The confirmatory HIV test {{employs a}} western blot to detect anti-HIV {{antibody}} {{in a human}} serum sample. Proteins from known HIV-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above. Then, the serum to be tested is applied in the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> incubation step; free antibody is washed away, and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added. The stained bands then indicate the proteins to which the patient's serum contains antibody.|$|E
25|$|IM and ID DNA {{delivery}} initiate immune responses differently. In the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and Langerhans cells take up {{and express}} antigens and {{are responsible for}} inducing a <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> response. Transfected Langerhans cells migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle striated muscle cells are most frequently transfected, but seem to be unimportant in immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are transfected and then initiate an immune response. Transfected myocytes seem {{to act as a}} “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the probing {{process was}} {{performed}} in two steps because of the relative ease of producing primary and secondary antibodies in separate processes. This gives researchers and corporations huge advantages in terms of flexibility, and adds an amplification step to the detection process. Given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection, however, there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems {{that would allow the}} process to occur faster and with fewer consumables. This requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label, probes which are often available for known protein tags. The primary probe is incubated with the membrane {{in a manner similar to}} that for the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> in a two-step process, and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps.|$|E
5000|$|Different <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> with {{different}} constant regions are typically generated {{by raising the}} antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region ("rabbit anti-goat" [...] antibodies). The researcher may then create {{a second set of}} <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate [...] "donkey anti-mouse" [...] secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye-coupled antibodies in multiple experiments.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method for immunofluorescent detection of multiple antigens {{in a single}} paraffin-embedded tissue section. We hypothesized that if fluorescent dyes are resistant to heat treatment, then thermal inactivation of immunoglobulins during antigen detection procedures might {{make it possible to}} use multicolor immunofluorescence detection even if the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> are from the same species. We found that several fluorescent dyes, including fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Cy 3 and Cy 5, were resistant to heating at 90 degrees Celsius for 15 min, whereas the antigenicities of the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were lost completely. This novel method, which uses heat treatment between staining steps, has great advantages for multicolor immunofluorescence because unlabeled <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> from the same species can be used. Therefore, by using this method not only 3 unlabeled mouse monoclonal antibodies but also 3 unlabeled rabbit antisera can be used as <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> for multicolor immunofluorescence. </p...|$|R
30|$|For {{immunofluorescence}} staining, 10 -μm-thick cross-sections {{were prepared}} from excised aortas of ApoE-KO (n[*]=[*] 2) and control (n[*]=[*] 2) mice. Parallel sections were immunostained as previously described [19]. Briefly, slides were fixed with acetone, rehydrated in PBS, blocked with 10 % donkey serum and incubated for 3 [*]h with <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> diluted with 2.5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA). <b>Primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> include rat anti-mouse CD 68 (clone FA- 11, Bio-Rad) for macrophages and goat anti-mouse CD 206 antibody (clone MR 5 D 3, Bio-Rad) for MR. Corresponding secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa 488 and Cy 5. DAPI {{was used to}} stain DNA. For negative controls, staining was performed without <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Stained sections were analysed using a SP 8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany).|$|R
2500|$|After rinsing the {{membrane}} to remove unbound <b>primary</b> <b>antibody,</b> {{the membrane}} {{is exposed to}} another antibody, directed at a species-specific portion of the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures); an anti-mouse secondary will bind to almost any mouse-sourced <b>primary</b> <b>antibody,</b> which allows some cost savings by allowing an entire lab to share a single source of mass-produced antibody, and provides far more consistent results. This {{is known as a}} secondary antibody, and due to its targeting properties, tends to be referred to as [...] "anti-mouse", [...] "anti-goat", etc. [...] The secondary antibody is usually linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. This means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> and enhance the signal.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> can {{be labeled}} {{using a small}} {{molecule}} [...] which interacts with a high affinity binding partner that {{can be linked to}} an enzyme or fluorophore. The biotin-streptavidin is one commonly used high affinity interaction.|$|E
2500|$|After blocking, a dilute {{solution}} of <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> (generally between 0.5 and 5 micrograms/mL) is incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation. [...] The <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> is then diluted with PBS or TBST wash buffers. Washing the membranes with the antibody-buffer solution helps minimize background and removes unbound antibodies. Typically, {{the solution is}} composed of buffered saline solution with {{a small percentage of}} detergent, and sometimes with powdered milk or BSA. The antibody solution and the membrane can be sealed and incubated together for anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight. It can also be incubated at different temperatures, with lesser temperatures being associated with more binding, both specific (to the target protein, the [...] "signal") and non-specific ("noise").|$|E
30|$|The {{protocol}} of Western blot {{analysis was}} as previously reported (Feng et al., 2009) with some modifications of indicated <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies.</b>|$|R

30|$|Specificity of {{the used}} {{antibodies}} {{has previously been}} tested [21]. Moreover, control experiments by substitution of the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> with non-immunized animals IgG were performed.|$|R
50|$|Secondary (indirect) {{immunofluorescence}} uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first (<b>primary)</b> <b>antibody</b> specifically binds {{the target}} molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> and binds to it. Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> This provides signal amplification {{by increasing the}} number of fluorophore molecules per antigen. This protocol is more complex and time-consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{indirect}} method involves an unlabeled <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> (first layer) that binds {{to the target}} antigen in the tissue and a labeled secondary antibody (second layer) that reacts with the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> As mentioned above, the secondary antibody must be raised against the IgG of the animal species in which the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> has been raised. This method is more sensitive than direct detection strategies because of signal amplification due to the binding of several secondary antibodies to each <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> if the secondary antibody is conjugated to the fluorescent or enzyme reporter.|$|E

30|$|First-passage {{cells were}} {{harvested}} using trypsin and thoroughly pipetted to prepare single-cell suspensions in PBS with 2 % FBS. Samples of the suspensions (1 [*]×[*] 106 cells) were then incubated with <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Table  1) for 60  min {{at room temperature}} {{in the dark and}} washed in three portions of PBS, 10  min each. If <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were fluorochrome-conjugated, the cells were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde for 5  min in the dark, washed in three portions of PBS, resuspended in 1  ml of PBS, and analyzed using the Cell Lab Quanta™ SC MPL system (Beckman Coulter). If the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were not labeled, the samples after washing were incubated with secondary antibodies for 40  min at room temperature in the dark, and the cells were then fixed and analyzed as described above. Corresponding isotype controls were used, and 10 000 cells per probe were analyzed.|$|R
5000|$|There are two complex {{steps in}} the {{manufacture}} of antibody for immunolabeling. The first is producing the antibody that binds specifically to the antigen of interest and the second is fusing the tag to the antibody. Since it is impractical to fuse a tag to every conceivable antigen-specific antibody, most immunolabeling processes use an indirect method of detection. This indirect method employs a <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> that is antigen-specific and a secondary antibody fused to a tag that specifically binds the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> This indirect approach permits mass production of secondary antibody that can be bought off the shelf. [...] Pursuant to this indirect method, the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> is added to the test system. The <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> seeks out and binds to the target antigen. The tagged secondary antibody, designed to attach exclusively to the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody,</b> is subsequently added.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{immunoperoxidase}} staining is the binding of the specific (<b>primary)</b> <b>antibody</b> to the cell or tissue sample. The detection of the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> can be then accomplished directly (example 1) or indirectly (examples 2 & 3).|$|E
5000|$|After rinsing the {{membrane}} to remove unbound <b>primary</b> <b>antibody,</b> {{the membrane}} {{is exposed to}} another antibody, directed at a species-specific portion of the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures); an anti-mouse secondary will bind to almost any mouse-sourced <b>primary</b> <b>antibody,</b> which allows some cost savings by allowing an entire lab to share a single source of mass-produced antibody, and provides far more consistent results.

30|$|Briefly, ATSCs were trypsinized and {{incubated}} with <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> [CD 29 (cat#BD- 556049), CD 45 (cat#SC- 70686), CD 90 (cat#SC- 53456, SantaCruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA] in PBS at 4  °C for 45  min.

40|$|To achieve {{specificity}} {{and sensitivity}} using immunohistochemistry {{it is necessary}} to combine the application of validated <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> with optimised pre-treatment, detection and visualisation steps. The influence of these surrounding procedures is reviewed. A practical evaluation of tyramide signal amplification and rolling circle amplification detection methods is provided in which formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections of adenocarcinomas of breast, colon and lung together with squamous metaplasia of lung were immunostained with CD 20 and CK 19 <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The results indicate that the detection systems are of comparable sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a novel recombinant secondary antibody mimic, GST-ABD, which {{can bind to}} the Fc regions of target-bound <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> and acquire multiple HRPs simultaneously.

GST-ABD is effectively conjugated with 3 HRPs per molecule on an average and selectively bind to the Fc region of <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> derived from three different species (mouse, rabbit, and rat). HRP-conjugated GST-ABD (HRP-GST-ABD) is successfully used as an alternative to secondary antibodies to amplify target-specific signals in both ELISA and immunohistochemistry regardless of the target molecules and origin of <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> used. GST-ABD also successfully serves as an anchoring adaptor on the surface of GSH-coated plates for immobilizing antigen-capturing antibodies in an orientation-controlled manner for sandwich-type indirect ELISA through simple molecular recognition without any complicated chemical modification. clos...|$|R
50|$|Example 2. The <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> can be tagged {{with a small}} {{molecule}} {{that can}} be recognised by a peroxidase-conjugated binding molecule with high affinity.

50|$|Dynabeads are {{frequently}} used for cell isolation. Cell-types often {{of interest to}} purify may be specific leukocytes, such as CD4+ T cells, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Dynabeads may be covalently linked to an antibody that recognizes a specific protein {{on the surface of}} the target cell-type. Alternatively, Dynabeads may attach to the cell indirectly, either via streptavidin on the Dynabead linking to a biotinylated <b>primary</b> <b>antibody,</b> or a secondary antibody on the Dynabead linking to the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> Streptavidin linkage to the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> allows Dynabeads to capture cells with lower expression of the surface protein.|$|E
50|$|Immunofluorescence is a {{technique}} which uses the highly specific binding of an antibody to its antigen in order to label specific proteins or other molecules within the cell. A sample is treated with a <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> specific for the molecule of interest. A fluorophore can be directly conjugated to the <b>primary</b> <b>antibody.</b> Alternatively a secondary antibody, conjugated to a fluorophore, which binds specifically to the first antibody can be used. For example, a <b>primary</b> <b>antibody</b> raised in a mouse which recognises tubulin combined with a secondary anti-mouse antibody derivatised with a fluorophore {{could be used to}} label microtubules in a cell.|$|E

30|$|Paraformaldehyde-fixed (4 %), paraffin-embedded, 3 -μm-thick tumour and {{granuloma}} tissue {{sections were}} stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Immunofluorescent staining of the adjacent tissue sections was also performed {{according to a}} standard protocol. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT- 1) was detected by using an anti-GLUT- 1 polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG, synthetic peptide, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). LAT- 1 was stained by using an anti-LAT- 1 mAb (rabbit IgG, synthetic peptide, Abcam). The <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected with the corresponding isotype-specific goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 488, Abcam). Adjacent tissue sections incubated with rabbit IgG instead of the <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> were used as negative controls.|$|R
40|$|Double or {{multiple}} antigen labeling in IHC classically {{relies on the}} existence of <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> raised in different species or of different IgG isotypes to ensure the specific labeling with the secondary detection systems. However, suitable pairs of <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> are not always available or the best choice (e. g., as diagnostic tools). During the last few years, several methods have been proposed to overcome this, but none of them offers the flexibility needed for reliable double {{or multiple}} enzymatic or fluorescent IHC. We present here a procedure that elutes the antibodies after a first round of immunolabeling, which, in combination with precipitation-based detection systems, allows multiple IHC rounds even for <b>primary</b> <b>antibodies</b> raised in the same species and IgG isotype. Compared with other proposed methods, this procedure ensures a reliable enzymatic or fluorescent staining without cross-reactivity and without loss of tissue antigenicity, thus offering a flexible tool for colocalization studies and pathological diagnosis.
