40|$|We {{develop a}} parsimonious {{model of the}} interbank payment system to study {{congestion}} {{and the role of}} liquidity markets in alleviating congestion. The model incorporates an endogenous instruction arrival process, scale-free topology of payments between banks, fixed total liquidity that limits banks 2 ̆ 019 capacity to process arriving instructions, and a global market that distributes liquidity. We find that at low liquidity, the system becomes congested and payment settlement loses correlation with <b>payment</b> <b>instruction</b> arrival, becoming coupled across the network. The onset of congestion is evidently related to the relative values of three characteristic times: the time for banks 2 ̆ 019 net position to return to zero, the time for banks to exhaust their liquidity endowments, and the liquidity market relaxation time. In the congested regime, settlement takes place in cascades having a characteristic size. A global liquidity market substantially diminishes congestion, requiring {{only a small fraction of}} the payment-induced liquidity flow to achieve strong beneficial effects...|$|R
50|$|From its {{inception}} in 1996, e-gold pioneered the decoupling of the numeraire for specifying a <b>payment</b> (Spend) <b>instruction</b> from the native unit of account of the settlement currency. For example, while AUG® (the trademarked designation for e-gold) was denominated in grams and decimal fractions (or in troy ounces since, as weight units, both are related by fixed arithmetic ratio), a Spend Instruction might be specified as “Pay account 10 USD’ worth of e-gold”. Calculation of the actual quantity to convey was made using a table of reference exchange rates maintained by the company, reflecting current actual exchange rates published by exchange providers.|$|R

This enables simultaneous settlement of the payments {{on both sides of}} a FX transaction.|$|E
40|$|Payment systems come in many forms, {{but their}} purpose {{is always the}} same - namely, to enable people to {{transfer}} funds from an account at one bank to an account at another bank. The alternative for the payer and the payee would be to settle their transaction either using cash or by barter. Banks themselves also use payment systems to transfer funds {{as a result of their}} own transactions (as distinct from their customers’). Whatever its particular form, a payment system can be seen as comprising three main elements or processes: A means of authorising and initiating the payment ie the means by which the payer gives authority to his bank for funds to be transferred. A means of transmitting and exchanging the <b>payment</b> <b>instruction</b> between the banks involved - usually referred to as clearing. A means of settlement between the banks involved - ie the payer’s bank has to compensate the payee’s bank, either bilaterally or through accounts that the banks hold at a third-party settlement agent, usually (but not always) the central bank. This Handbook considers these processes in more detail, and in particular the risks and policy issues that they present. A recurring theme is that, while there are a number of common risks and problems to be addressed, there is no single ideal way of addressing them. Solutions adopted in one country may not necessarily be appropriate in another. Another important message is that, in developing a new payment system or modifying an existing one, the emphasis must be on agreement and co-operation - both between central bank and commercial banks as the operators of the system, and between the system operators and its customers. This handbook is also available in Arabic and Spanish. Payment Systems...|$|R

25|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with the United States, online banking {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom. The UK's first home online banking services known as Homelink {{was set up by}} Bank of Scotland for customers of the Nottingham Building Society (NBS) in 1983. The system used was based on the UK's Prestel viewlink system and used a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed on-line viewing of statements, bank transfers and bill payments. In order to make bank transfers and bill <b>payments,</b> a written <b>instruction</b> giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly.|$|R

50|$|Another {{key element}} of the CLS Settlement Service is the {{liquidity}} efficiencies delivered through multilateral payment netting. On each day participants will very likely {{have more than one}} trade to settle—in practice, major banks will have hundreds or thousands of trades each day. Each day prior to settlement, CLS calculates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral netted basis. The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all <b>payment</b> <b>instructions</b> is reduced, allowing each Settlement Member to transfer only the net amount of its payment obligations in each currency, rather than the total amount of each trade to be settled.

40|$|Construction {{industry}} has been increasingly recognizing {{the need for more}} efficient and timely projects completion. However, there remain a number of unexpected problems and changes from the original design. This will arise during the construction phase which often leads to many negative effects such as increased costs, lost productivity and revenue, contract termination, arbitration or litigation and even total abandonment of the project. Therefore, this research is set out to develop a profile of the delay in construction projects which lead to disputes. The profiling of the cases has been done based on the year, types of parties involved, time of delay disputes occur, nature of delay disputes and court judgment for the construction delay disputes that have been occurring in Malaysian construction industry. The approach adopted in this research is case law based; only cases in Malaysia between years 1961 - 2010 reported by Malayan Law Journal specifically centered on issue of delay disputes will be centered in this study. A total number of 18 cases were studied and the results show that the number of construction delay disputes cases is the highest between years 1991 - 2000. Most of the causes of delay dispute incurred in construction industry being debated in the court suit are mainly committed by the employer which includes late site possession, late <b>payment,</b> late <b>instructions,</b> late drawings and specifications as well as suspensions of work. It also highlighted that most delay disputes cases in construction industry generally occurred when financial conflict such as loss of profit, damages claim, non-payment reimbursement, noncertified work done and so forth between the contractual parties take place as a result of construction delay. In summary, findings of this research will be able to increase the awareness of the construction players of the current scenario in relation to construction delay issues as well as to assist them in addressing and overcoming the problems associated to delay disputes in Malaysian construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Selection of the {{university}} {{is one of the}} most important life decisions among young people. With a continually rising assortment of educational options, future students look for institutions that will provide them a distinctive educational knowledge that they will keep in their minds for a lifetime. Also, students usually seek an educational program that will prepare them for a successful profession and that will provide them profitable employment. A lot of different factors heavily impact the decision whether to choose state university or a private one. This paper is focused on examining those factors, such as curriculum, quality and number of the staff, facilities, equipment, language of <b>instruction,</b> <b>payments</b> and fees and many others. Data for this study were collected though surveys of 303 examinees attending both private and state universities. The topic is important since the reasons why students choose one or the other option reveals a lot on their motives as well, which is, most often, extremely important for their development, quality and success, which is both a good indicator of the present quality and can influence the future representation of {{the university}} itself and, more important, heavily affects the quality of the society in general. The results of the survey can also help these institutions understand their strengths and weaknesses develop better marketing strategies, provide better conditions to their students and develop a constructive competition between these two types of institutions...|$|R

This article argues that concepts of value are conceptually and practically misleading. Identifying and determining the content of transactions are normative processes that depend, not upon identifying the precise mechanisms by which a particular change in legal relations is sought and executed, but rather upon the manifested intentions of the transacting parties. This allows us to deal straightforwardly with complex payment structures, clearing and credit, and to focus instead upon the role of transactions in the justification for a resulting claim...|$|E

In particular, {{we are interested in}} payments behaviour towards a bank that is, for operational reasons, unable to make but able to receive payments. If other banks did not sufficiently monitor their outgoing payments, these operational shocks could impact the entire payment system because the affected bank could absorb liquidity from the system. Our game-theoretic model predicts that only early in the day, when they are uncertain about the <b>payment</b> <b>instructions</b> they might have to execute, banks stop sending payments to a counterparty which is unable to make payments. Using a non-parametric method, we find that this prediction is supported by the data, implying that banks effectively contain the disruption caused by the operational outage: payment flows between healthy banks remain unaffected.
