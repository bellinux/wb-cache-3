500|$|Howard himself {{never took}} to the show. [...] "It's like a beauty pageant," [...] he told one reporter. [...] "I have 20 minutes {{to give you a}} {{presentation}} on our games that by their nature are hard to demo in that time period, and then the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to check their watch and walk out and go see someoneomfortable seating, and dim lighting—where attendees could comfortably watch. Howard agreed with the choice: [...] "We've always taken sort of the meeting room approach. We don't have loud crazy booths." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2013, it was {{confirmed}} that Rowland would be co-headlining a US concert tour alongside The-Dream, who produced two songs on Talk a Good Game. Speaking about the tour, Rowland said: [...] "To {{be able to}} work with [...] in this capacity and have the opportunity to showcase our new music to our fans live and in <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be extremely rewarding! I can't wait.". The Lights Out Tour was originally scheduled to have twenty-two shows, but this was later changed to five, after Rowland was forced to cancel many of the shows because she signed on to become a judge on The X Factor US. The tour kicked off on May 26, 2013 in Washington, D.C. and ended on June 2, 2013 in Mashantucket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spirituality of}} death is very {{important}} in African-American culture. A member of the clergy or members of the religious community, or both, are typically present with the family through the entire process. Death is often viewed as transitory rather than final. Many services are called homegoings or homecomings, instead of funerals, {{based on the belief that}} the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> home to the afterlife; [...] "Returning to god" [...] or the Earth (also see Euphemism as well as Connotation). The entire end of life process is generally treated as a celebration of the person's life, deeds and accomplishments – the [...] "good things" [...] rather than a mourning of loss. This is most notably demonstrated in the New Orleans jazz funeral tradition where upbeat music, dancing, and food encourage those gathered to be happy and celebrate the homegoing of a beloved friend.|$|E
5000|$|The “Panic Stop” [...] {{requires}} two merging traffic lanes. As one driver {{tries to}} merge {{into the next}} lane, he is waved forward by a car who proceeds to crash into the unsuspecting driver, later claiming they never realized the <b>person</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to merge lanes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{show you}} the way, my dear. I always get my things settled at once, as one never knows when one may have to turn in. The Professor will go with you, Ethel; it is not proper for you to roam about alone;" [...] and with that hint Mrs. Homer led the way below, privately {{wondering}} how these young <b>persons</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get on together.|$|R

2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was his own, fault, Larry. If a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to {{do wrong}} he {{must take the}} consequences. Mr. Baxter might today be a fairly well-to-do mine owner of the West and Dan might be a leading cadet here. But instead they both threw {{themselves}} away -- and now they must take what comes." ...|$|E

"It's false,--it must be false," [...] he said, violently; [...] "nothing is more {{deceptive}} {{than these}} ideas that {{doctors and nurses}} pile on when a sensitive <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> down a little. I know Mara; everything depends on the mind with her. I shall wake her up out of this dream. She is not to die. She shall not die,--I come to save her." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{case of a}} [...] "complete control" [...] by the Jinn, the possessed {{surrender}} to the Jinn and the <b>persons</b> consciousness <b>is</b> subverted by it. Such a jinn is indeed absolutely evil and thereupon the acts of the <b>person</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> evil as well. The person will obey the commands of the jinn at anytime. In a [...] "constant possession" [...] the person will not act without a command by the jinn.|$|R

60|$|Yes, it {{was pretty}} hot weather. Now here, when a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to die, he is always in a sweat about where he is going to; but in Keokuk of course they don't care, because they are fixed for everything. It has set me reflecting, it has taught me a lesson. By and by, when my health fails, I am going to put all my affairs in order, and bid good-bye to my friends here, and kill all the people I don't like, and go out to Keokuk and prepare for death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Esther dear," [...] he said, [...] "I shall do {{just as you}} ask me. At {{the same}} time, please listen. I think that you are all absurdly frightened of Mr. Fentolin. Living here alone with him, you have all grown under his {{dominance}} to an unreasonable extent. Because of his horrible infirmity, you have let yourselves become his slaves. There are limits {{to this sort of}} thing, Esther. I come here as a stranger, and I see nothing more in Mr. Fentolin than a very selfish, irritable, domineering, and capricious old man. Humour him, by all means. I am willing to do the same myself. But {{when it comes to the}} great things in life, neither he nor any living <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to keep from me the woman I love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{why should}} they start a {{perfectly}} rotten action like that," [...] continued Maxwell Hartington, now addressing himself very earnestly to his client, [...] "when they've only got to keep quiet and do their job and be comfortable. In these matters, Brumley, as in most matters affecting the relations of men and women, people can do absolutely what they like nowadays, absolutely, unless there's someone about {{ready to make a}} row. Then they can't do anything. It hardly matters if they don't do anything. A row's a row and damned disgraceful. If there isn't a row, nothing's disgraceful. Of course all these laws and regulations and institutions and arrangements are just ways of putting people at the mercy of blackmailers and jealous and violent persons. One's only got to be a lawyer for a bit to realize that. Still that's not our business. That's psychology. If there aren't any jealous and violent persons about, well, then no ordinary decent <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to worry what you do. No decent person ever does. So far as I can gather the only barbarian in this case is the testator--now in Kensal Green. With additional precautions I suppose in the way of an artistic but thoroughly massive monument presently to be added----" ...|$|E
30|$|The {{primary means}} of {{preventing}} outrage is cover-up: the doctor tells no one about intentionally hastening death. Other doctors or perhaps relatives might suspect what the doctor has done, but not have sufficient evidence or incentive to expose it. If there is a suspicion of foul play, then the doctor may use reinterpretation, saying the <b>person</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down quickly or claiming {{not to have been}} involved. In such situations, devaluation {{may or may not be}} used. The doctor seldom has access to official channels to reduce outrage, nor has any means of intimidating critics.|$|R

50|$|Another type of {{technology}} that is commonly used in Physical Education {{is the use of}} pedometers.

5000|$|John Kennedy, {{a native}} of Windsor and a sports {{executive}} based in Los Angeles, was named the first commissioner of the NBL. He previously had experience working with the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). League president Andre Levingston spoke on his expectations of the commissioner, saying, [...] "We {{wanted to make sure}} we had a <b>person</b> who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> committed and was willing to roll up his sleeves and work very hard, someone who understood business, had business relationship and a <b>person</b> who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to govern the league the right way."

5000|$|Speaking to NPR in 2012, Grier {{explained}} {{the inspiration for}} his characterization: [...] "I had already done Dreamgirls on Broadway, and being in a musical and working with other performers who were gay, I was privy to that vocabulary backstage. They were being themselves. So {{a lot of it}} was hijacked from what I heard in the theater and what was permeating around. Now at that time, if a gay <b>person</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to read you — to tell you off — it was always accompanied by snaps. Now I don't know if it was a gay thing, but it was also a very black thing." ...|$|R

50|$|There are daily {{treatments}} {{to reduce the}} severity of the allergic response. Often these treatments include an antihistamine oral pill, nasal spray, or eye drops. Other treatments include an allergy shot, which keep the allergic response to a minimum. For more severe reactions an epinephrine injection is carried around. This injection will be taken if the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> into anaphylactic shock. The best treatment is avoidance of each allergen.|$|E
50|$|Psychological noise {{results from}} preconceived notions we bring to {{conversation}}s, such as racial stereotypes, reputations, biases, and assumptions. When we {{come into a}} conversation with ideas about what the other <b>person</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to say and why, we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time psychological noise is impossible to free ourselves from, and we must simply strive to recognize that it exists and take those distractions into account when we converse with others.|$|E
5000|$|Interview Time - Guests interviewed {{included}} Death, an atom, and G-spot & Orgasm.
