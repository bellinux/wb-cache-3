50|$|Among other differences, in {{literary}} works {{a very specific}} concept of attribution is {{a critical part of}} the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for inventions or brand names. Also, most countries recognize moral rights that are not alienable from the work, that is, a <b>purchaser</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in the work does {{not have the right to}} relabel it as if someone else had written it. While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the WGA screenwriting credit system which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{legislation}} {{exists in}} various parts of the world enforcing this right, to varying degrees. For example, in the European Union, the Consumer <b>Rights</b> Directive <b>of</b> 2011 obliges member states to give purchasers the right to return goods or cancel services purchased from a business away from a normal commercial premises, such as online, mail order, or door-to-door, with limited exceptions, within two weeks or one year if the seller did not clearly inform the <b>purchaser</b> <b>of</b> their <b>rights</b> from the receipt of the goods, for a full refund. The Consumer Rights Directive is implemented in the United Kingdom by the Consumer Contracts (information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.|$|R
2500|$|Handler's {{noteworthy}} {{achievement is}} a case {{considered to be a}} landmark case that was won on an ironic, yet relatively simple, but critical oversight. [...] At issue were the sale <b>of</b> intellectual property <b>rights</b> to certain Marvel Enterprises characters that Marvel's new owners thought it bought with the company. [...] The claim was successful because, although the <b>purchaser</b> <b>of</b> those <b>rights</b> had a valid signed contract with the former owners of Marvel, the actual new rights were never registered with the United States Copyright Office. [...] Handler's discovery of that fact, and her interpretation of IP law during the court proceedings, caused the rights to revert to Marvel, which was bought by Avi Arad and Ike Perlmutter.|$|R
60|$|In {{the chapter}} on the Preoccupations of Bacon the reader may find help in making up his mind as to whether Bacon, with his many and onerous duties and occupations, his {{scientific}} studies, and his absorbing scientific preoccupation, is a probable author of the Shakespearean plays. Mr. Greenwood finds the young Shakspere impossible--because of his ignorance--which made him such a really good pseudo-author, and such a successful mask for Bacon, or Bacon's unknown equivalent. The Shakspere of later life, the well-to-do Shakspere, the <b>purchaser</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to bear arms; so bad at paying one debt at least; so eager a creditor; a would-be encloser of a common; a man totally bookless, is, to Mr. Greenwood's mind, an impossible author of the later plays.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to clarify the grounds upon which an {{arbitration}} clause may be binding in the new relationship between the parties after a transfer <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and/or obligations.  The issue is not regulated by law but instead it has been left to the Supreme Court to regulate.  In the Emja-case the Swedish Supreme Court left guidance on the issue.  The Supreme Court stated that a third party <b>purchaser</b> <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> where the contract includes an arbitration clause shall be bound by the clause.  The arbitration clause is only binding to the remaining part of the initial agreement if no special circumstances exist.  The binding effect was justified by the reason that {{a situation where the}} purchaser but not the remaining part should be bound to the clause was not sought after and the principle through the 27 § of the Swedish debt instruments act...|$|R
50|$|A <b>right</b> <b>of</b> {{pre-emption}} {{is a type}} <b>of</b> preferential <b>right</b> ‘to purchase at a {{fixed price}} or at a price at which the grantor is prepared to sell’. It is granted by a prospective seller to a prospective purchaser to give the <b>purchaser</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first refusal if the prospective seller should decide to sell. A pre-emption right must comply with all the requirements for contracts in general. The capacity of the pre-emption grantor to alienate the thing in question is restricted. If the grantor breaches his undertaking to offer the thing to the holder, the holder’s remedy is an interdict preventing alienation to a third party. It is uncertain, though, whether a claim by the holder for specific performance would be successful.|$|R
50|$|No, {{said the}} Court of Appeals. The {{provision}} {{does not include}} a third party {{who does not have}} privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied. If there is no privity of contract between third persons and the seller of food, there can be no implied warranty. The benefit of warranty (either express or implied) does not run with the chattel on its resale (and thus is unlike a covenant running with land, which does give a subsequent <b>purchaser</b> a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> action on a warranty).|$|R
50|$|A 2007 Antitrust Modernization Commission Report {{proposed}} that Congress should abandon the Illinois Brick doctrine. The proposal, if adopted, would weaken the federal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> action for direct purchasers by reviving {{as a defense}} {{the fact that the}} direct purchaser had passed on the overcharge instead of absorbing it, while creating a federal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> action for indirect <b>purchasers.</b> Federal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> action under the proposal would not be exclusive, but state law claims would be subject to expanded federal jurisdiction to allow consolidation of all claims from a price fix in a single court for both discovery and trial. All recoveries in the consolidated actions would be limited to the initial overcharge, trebled.|$|R

40|$|Irrigation {{farmers in}} the Lower Orange River were {{surveyed}} during October 2003 in order to study whether water marketing has promoted efficiency and to identify factors that affect future investment in irrigation farming. Econometric procedures (principal component and logit model) indicate that <b>purchasers</b> <b>of</b> water <b>rights</b> produce lucrative export grapes and horticultural crops with relatively less raisin, wine or juice grapes and less field crops; are more specialised in production; have more livestock (probably liquidity factor) and have a less negative view of the five-year review period. The water market has facilitated a transfer of water use from relatively lower value crops to relatively higher value crops, and also promoted the use of more advanced irrigation. An investment model using Ridge Regression indicates that the following variables are associated with future investment in irrigation farming; expected profitability, risk perception and risk aversion (Arrow/Pratt). Results confirm that farmers who are more risk averse invest less {{in the future as}} can be expected from theory. Policies that increase risk in agriculture will have a significant negative effect on future investment in irrigation. What is significant from the results is that irrigation farmers are highly risk averse (down side). Results also show that farmers who feel that water licenses are not secure expect to invest less in the future. The latter effect is thus amplified as farmers appear to be highly risk averse. This has important policy implications, and measures should be taken to improve the perceived security of water licenses. This could be achieved by keeping farmers more informed about the practical implications of the National Water Act (NWA) and specifically water licenses. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
