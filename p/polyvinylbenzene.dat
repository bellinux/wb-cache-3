40|$|A {{new method}} {{enabling}} {{the determination of}} 15 priority carcinogenic polyaromatic compounds (PAC) proposed by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has been developed and applied to diesel exhaust particulates (DEP). The clean-up procedure consists of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and HPLC fractionation on silica phases followed by liquid-liquid extraction and chromatography on a <b>polyvinylbenzene</b> copolymer column. The method gives good recoveries for all PAC studied except dibenzo[a,j]acridine and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, for which recovery values are below 80 %. The use of GC-MS ion trap and its capacity to achieve single-ion storage enhanced {{the sensitivity of the}} method, enabling the detection of high-molecular-weight PAH in the low ng g(- 1) concentration range. Intermediate polarity GC columns, e. g. BPX- 50 or equivalent, enabled better separation, when applied to DEP analysis, than the generally used DB- 5 apolar phase. This is observed mainly for separation of isomeric compounds belonging to the benzofluoranthene and dibenzopyrene families. The application of this method to DEP sampled from the exhaust of a diesel engine and in confined locations such as a tunnel has shown that all PAH of the NTP list could be detected, except dibenzo[a,h]pyrene. No dibenzacridine or dibenzocarbazole could be detected in such matrices. The method is sufficiently sensitive to be applicable to environmental exposure measurements in occupational health surveys...|$|E
