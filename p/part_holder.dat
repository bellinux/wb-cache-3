5000|$|Note that {{mechanical}} systems are inherently multi-dimensional - a typical robot arm can place {{an object in}} three dimensions (x, y, z coordinates) and in three orientations (e.g. roll, pitch, yaw). In theory, an impedance controller can cause the mechanism to exhibit a multi-dimensional mechanical impedance. For example, the mechanism might act very stiff along one axis and very compliant along another. By compensating for the kinematics and inertias of the mechanism, we can orient those axes arbitrarily and in various coordinate systems. For example, we might cause a robotic <b>part</b> <b>holder</b> to be very stiff tangentially to a grinding wheel, while being very compliant (controlling force with little concern for position) in the radial axis of the wheel.|$|E

40|$|Let f be a {{distribution}} (generalised function) {{on the real}} line. If there is a continuous function F with real limits at infinity such that F'=f (distributional derivative) then the distributional integral of f is defined as ∫_-∞^∞ f = F(∞) - F(-∞). It is shown that this simple definition gives an integral that includes the Lebesgue and Henstock [...] Kurzweil integrals. The Alexiewicz norm leads to a Banach space of integrable distributions that is isometrically isomorphic to the space of continuous functions on the extended real line with uniform norm. The dual space is identified with the functions of bounded variation. Basic properties of integrals are established using elementary properties of distributions: integration by <b>parts,</b> <b>Hölder</b> inequality, change of variables, convergence theorems, Banach lattice structure, Hake theorem, Taylor theorem, second mean value theorem. Applications are made to the half plane Poisson integral and Laplace transform. The paper includes a short history of Denjoy's descriptive integral definitions.

40|$|A {{limiting}} factor in {{electron beam lithography}} is the proximity effect. In the special case of X-ray mask making, Monte Carlo calculations and resist profile simulations show that the proximity effect can be almost entirely eliminated by using 100 keV electrons for the resist exposure.

The poor efficiency of 100 keV electrons results in decreasing resist sensitivity. Electrons passing through the membrane hit <b>holder</b> <b>parts</b> behind it.

50|$|Modern {{boring tools}} have three primary {{components}} although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower <b>part</b> (bar <b>holder)</b> is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the dial screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if {{the cutting tool}} is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession. Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the boring tool. Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.|$|R
