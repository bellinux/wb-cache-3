50|$|These {{additional}} {{copies of}} the mating type information do {{not interfere with the}} function of whatever allele is <b>present</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> MAT locus because they are not expressed, so a haploid cell with <b>the</b> MATa allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> active MAT locus is still an a cell, despite also having a (silenced) copy of <b>the</b> MATα allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> HML. Only <b>the</b> allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> active MAT locus is transcribed, and thus only <b>the</b> allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> MAT will influence cell behaviour. Hidden mating type loci are epigenetically silenced by SIR proteins, which form a heterochromatin scaffold that prevents transcription from the silent mating cassettes.|$|R

5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end to explain material <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous {{was not necessary}} for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E
