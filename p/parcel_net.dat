50|$|The Twenty 70 {{announced}} in mid-September 1933 remains all-steel and now more streamlined. It {{has been given}} an outswept long-skirted tail {{in place of the}} former D-shape. There are separate chairs in front except on the Family saloon which has a three-seater single-piece bench seat at the front. Triplex safety glass is now throughout the car. There are dual screenwipers, a roof lamp, a rear blind which may be controlled from the driver's seat, locks on all doors and a driving mirror. A special design of bumpers is standard throughout the range. De luxe saloons have a sunshine roof, ash trays, cigar lighter, a <b>parcel</b> <b>net</b> on the ceiling and pillar pulls. A luggage grid was also fitted at the back of de luxe saloons.The radiator grille or shell stylishly slopes back to match the new streamlined coachwork and its chromium-plated shutters are thermostatically controlled.|$|E

Whereas density changes with changing pressure, potential density of a fluid parcel is conserved as the pressure experienced by the parcel changes (provided no mixing with other <b>parcels</b> or <b>net</b> heat flux occurs). The concept is used in oceanography and (to a lesser extent) atmospheric science.|$|R

In this <b>parcel</b> <b>net</b> a vector statistics with dimensions 100 × 200 meters has been accomplished through a Random-systematic method, and 20 circle-shape pieces with 10 R (1000 m 2) measurements were made. In each sample piece, the diameter and height of all trees thicker than 7. 5 cm were measured. In order to fit these characteristics Beta, Weibull, Gamma, Normal, Log normal and Exponential statistical distributions were used. The results obtained from Kolmogrof-smirnov (K.

40|$|Grassland carbon {{budgets are}} known to be greatly {{dependent}} on management. In particular, grazing is known to directly affect CO 2 exchange through consumption by plants, cattle respiration, natural fertilisation through excreta, and soil compaction. This study investigates the impact of two grazing methods on the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) dynamics and carbon balance, by measuring CO 2 fluxes using eddy covariance in two adjacent pastures located in southern Belgium during a complete grazing season. Rotational (RG) grazing consists of an alternation of rest periods and short high stock density grazing periods. Continuous grazing (CG) consists of uninterrupted grazing with variable stocking rates. To our knowledge, this is the first study {{to assess the impact of}} these grazing methods on total net ecosystem exchange and CO 2 exchange dynamics using eddy covariance. The results showed that NEE dynamics were greatly impacted by the grazing method. Following grazing events on the RG <b>parcel,</b> <b>net</b> CO 2 uptake on the RG parcel was reduced compared to the CG parcel. During the following rest periods, this phenomenon progressively shifted towards a higher assimilation for the RG treatment. This behaviour was attributed to sharp biomass changes in the RG treatment and therefore sharp changes in plant photosynthetic capacity. We found that differences in gross primary productivity at high radiation were strongly correlated to differences in standing biomass. In terms of carbon budgets, no significant difference was observed between the two treatments, neither in cumulative NEE, or in terms of estimated biomass production. The results of our study suggest that we should not expect major benefits in terms of CO 2 uptake from rotational grazing management when compared to continuous grazing management in intensively managed temperate pastures.

40|$|We {{constructed}} a simple non–steady-state model of trophic cycling {{relationships in the}} California Current Ecosystem and tested its predictions of mesozooplankton fecal-pellet export against vertical carbon-flux measurements by the 234 Th method taken during Lagrangian experiments. To assess trophic relationships, we simultaneously measured 14 C-primary production and chlorophyll-based rate estimates of phytoplankton growth, microzooplankton grazing, mesozooplankton grazing, and net phytoplankton growth. Study locations ranged from coastal upwelling to offshore oligotrophic conditions. E-ratios (carbon export: 14 C-primary production) predicted by the model ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 14, in good agreement with both the magnitude and the variability found in contemporaneous measurements of 234 Th export and C: 234 Th-ratios of sinking particles. E-ratios were strongly decoupled from new production estimates. The lowest measured and predicted e-ratios were associated with higher nutrient chlorophyll <b>parcels</b> with <b>net</b> accumulating phytoplankton in the inshore region. For our study sites, variability in export efficiency {{was determined by the}} local net balance of growth and grazing and the relative strengths of grazing pathways to microzooplankton and mesozooplankton.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} upper-ocean {{survey of}} a cyclonic jet meander and an adjacent cyclonic eddy in the California Current region near 38 °N, 126 °W was conducted {{as part of}} the summer of 1993 Eastern Boundary Currents program. Temperature and salinity were measured from a SeaSoar vehicle, and velocity was measured by shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). SeaSoar data show a density front at a depth of 70 – 100 m with strong cyclonic curvature. The geostrophic velocity fields, referenced to the ADCP data at 200 m, show a strong surface-intensified jet (maximum speed of 0. 9 m s⁻¹) that follows the density front along a cyclonic meander. Relative vorticities within the jet are large, ranging from − 0. 8 ƒ to + 1. 2 ƒ, where ƒ is the local Coriolis parameter. The SeaSoar density and ADCP velocity data are used to diagnose the vertical velocity via the Q-vector form of the quasigeostrophic omega equation. The diagnosed vertical velocity field shows a maximum speed of 40 – 45 m d⁻¹. The lateral distribution of vertical velocity is characterized by two length scales: a large (~ 75 km) pattern where there is downwelling upstream and upwelling downstream of the cyclonic bend, and smaller patches arrayed along the jet core with diameters of 20 – 30 km. Geostrophic streamline analysis of vertical velocity indicates that water <b>parcels</b> make <b>net</b> vertical excursions of 20 – 30 m over 2 – 3 days, resulting in net vertical velocities of 7 – 15 m d⁻¹.

40|$|Abstract. The {{design and}} {{operation}} of a quantum-mechanical device as a laboratory instrument puts models written in equations of quantum mechanics in contact with instruments. In designing a quantum-mechanical device of high precision, such as a quantum computer, a scientist faces choices of models and of instruments, and the scientist must choose which model to link to which arrangement of instruments. This contact is recordable in files of a Classical Digital Process-control Computer (CPC) used both to calculate with the equations and to manage the instruments. By noticing that equations and instruments make contact in a CPC, we rewrite equations of quantum mechanics to explicitly include functions of CPC-commands to the instruments. This sets up a proof that a scientist’s choice in linking mathematical models to instruments is unresolvable without guesswork to narrow the set of models from which one is to be chosen. The proof presents the challenge of pursuing its implications. Scientists in any investigative endeavor inherit choices {{from the past and}} frame choices for the future, choices open to guesswork and visible in CPC files. To picture the framing of choices and relations among them, we adapt colored Petri nets. Constraining the events of the nets to produce output colors defined by definite functions of input colors excludes guesswork from the firing of net events, and by contrast highlights guesses entering a net fragment as colored tokens placed by a scientist or by instruments on input conditions. The availability of these net fragments makes choice and guesswork part and <b>parcel</b> of physics. <b>Net</b> fragments as a means of expressing guess-demanding choices are applied to portray guesswork needed in testing and calibrating a quantum computer. The sample size required to test a quantum gate in a quantum computer is shown to grow as the inverse square of the error allowed in implementing the gate...|$|R
40|$|Duke, JoshuaPublic goods {{exist in}} space and recent {{research}} has shown that accounting for the location of their provision can have many implications for policy. Non-market valuation techniques are often utilized to value benefits from the provision of public goods in monetary terms. However, if willingness to pay (WTP) for public goods varies with the spatial location of provision, then valuation studies without spatial specificity may lead to suboptimal provision. WTP for land preservation provides a public-goods context where space matters. This study examines the benefits of preserving farm and forest parcels, which are derived from existing survey data from community-level and state-level choice experiments (CE) conducted in 2005 in Delaware and Connecticut (Johnston and Duke 2007; Duke and Johnston 2010). Data on applicant parcels, both accepted and rejected, to the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation (DALPF) from 1995 - 2003 (Allen, et al., 2006) are utilized to develop a hedonic model to estimate conservation easement costs across all eligible parcels in Sussex County, Delaware. Using a geographic information system, nonuse benefits and easement costs are predicted for every eligible parcel in the County to cost-effectively prioritize parcel selection. Parcels are selected under a fixed budget with four different prioritization strategies: benefit-targeting (BT), cost-targeting (CT), benefit-cost targeting (BCRT), and an binary linear programming optimization method (OPT). This initial prioritization effort does not account for variability in benefits associated with the spatial location of selected parcels. To investigate potential spatial interdependencies in parcel selection, a distinct 'gravity' is calculated for each parcel i to every other parcel j in a feasible set based {{on the size of the}} parcels and the distance amongst them. An exponent (β) on distance captures the friction of these distances (i. e., high β, higher friction). The gravity values are then scaled by α to determine the spatial synergy (SS) benefits for all parcels i and j. Parcels are selected utilizing an algorithm for a quadratic knapsack problem (QKP), which finds a subset of <b>parcels</b> that maximizes <b>net</b> social benefits subject to the constraint of the knapsack—in this case, the budget. Because the true value of α would reflect WTP for spatial proximity and this is unknown, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying α to allow for policy makers to evaluate the level at which spatial preference might affect optimal choice. Results from the County-level model demonstrate that optimal (OPT) and near-optimal (BCRT) parcel prioritizations both generate $ 435 million more net benefits to society compared to BT and nearly $ 236 million more net benefits than CT. Furthermore, accounting for spatial interdependence dramatically alters the optimal set of parcels selected and thus the preserved landscape. Any study ignoring space, when public preferences vary systematically with space, will thus produce a suboptimal provision of preservation. The sensitivity analysis shows the degree to which this spatial preference varies with changes in the hypothesized values of α and β. This outcome indicates that welfare analysis based on a standard valuation study might, in fact, provide information that leads to misguided policy. Since the primary land preservation decision is whether to preserve a specific parcel, consideration of systematic elements, such as spatial interdependence, is needed to avoid potentially arriving at suboptimal policy guidance.
