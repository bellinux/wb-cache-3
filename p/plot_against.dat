5|$|The Rommel myth, {{also known}} as the Rommel legend, as a term used by {{critical}} historians, refers to common depictions of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in popular culture and academic writings as an apolitical, brilliant commander, and a victim of the Third Reich due to his participation in the 20 July <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> Adolf Hitler. According to critical historians, such depictions are not accurate.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius had {{at least}} one illegitimate son, John Athalarichos, who conspired a <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> Heraclius with his cousin, the magister Theodorus, and the Armenian noble David Saharuni. When Heraclius {{discovered}} the plot, he had Athalarichos's nose and hands cut off, and he was exiled to Prinkipo, one of the Princes' Islands. Theodorus had the same treatment but was sent to Gaudomelete (possibly modern day Gozo Island) with additional instructions to cut off one leg.|$|E
5|$|In January 1556, Mary's {{father-in-law}} abdicated. Mary and Philip {{were still}} apart; he was declared King of Spain in Brussels, but {{she stayed in}} England. Philip negotiated an unsteady truce with the French in February 1556. The following month, the French ambassador in England, Antoine de Noailles, was implicated in a <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> Mary when Sir Henry Dudley, a second cousin of the executed Duke of Northumberland, attempted to assemble an invasion force in France. The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up. Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain.|$|E

5|$|Keyes, Olavo de Carvalho, {{author of}} a dozen books on {{philosophical}} and political matters, and Alejandro Peña Esclusa, president of UnoAmerica, met on 3 March 2009 in Washington D.C. for an informal and friendly talk. In July 2010, Olavo de Carvalho denounced a <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> Alejandro Peña Esclusa, who was arrested on terrorism-related charges. According to the website of the Venezuelan Ministry of Communications & Information, Alejandro Peña Esclusa {{was the head of}} a plan to murder Pope John Paul II during a visit to Venezuela on 13 November 1984.|$|E
5|$|King James VI visited Doune on occasion, and in 1581 {{authorised}} £300 to {{be spent}} on repairs and improvements, the works being carried out by the master mason Michael Ewing under the supervision of Robert Drummond of Carnock, Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland. In 1593, a <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> James was discovered, and the King surprised the conspirators, who included the Earls of Montrose and Gowrie, at Doune Castle.|$|E
5|$|Later, in the Central Asian campaign, {{a second}} <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> {{his life was}} revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Cobham family's {{estate was}} {{forfeited}} to the Crown in 1603 when his grandson, Henry Brooke, the 11th Baron Cobham, {{was charged with}} high treason {{for his part in}} the Main <b>Plot</b> <b>against</b> James I. The College was granted for life to the 11th Baron's wife after which it reverted to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, husband of Baron Cobham's sister. The College remained in the ownership of the Cecil family until 1697 when it was sold to Sir Robert Marsham of Mote House. The College estate was subsequently owned by Marsham's heirs, the Earls of Romney.|$|E
5|$|On the October 28, 2014 {{episode of}} Raw, Ziggler and John Cena shook hands {{together}} backstage, which The Authority {{interpreted as a}} deal to <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> them. As a result, Ziggler was put in a match against Kane, which Ziggler won. Ziggler then joined Team Cena at Survivor Series. On the November 10 episode of Raw, Ziggler was brutally attacked by the returning Luke Harper. The following week, Harper was awarded a title match against Ziggler, which Harper won with assistance from The Authority, ending Ziggler's reign at 56 days.|$|E
5|$|Prospero then {{explains}} that he tested Ferdinand, and betroths a willing Miranda to him. He then asks Ariel to bring some other spirits and create a masque to entertain the young couple. These spirits present a blessing by Iris, Ceres, and Juno, followed by dancing. Prospero suddenly remembers the <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> his life, dismisses the spirits and Miranda and Ferdinand, and sets a trap for Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano. They are chased offstage by goblins {{in the shape of}} hounds.|$|E

5|$|Zou began a {{rebellion}} against the Han after learning of Yang's <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> him. A Han military campaign was dispatched and led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, military commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The revolt was repressed and the Han annexed Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, conquering the remaining territory of the former Minyue. Sima Qian records that the entire population of Dongyue was exiled, a claim that is implausible.|$|E
5|$|A <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> {{his life}} was revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At the Council of Hieria in 754, Constantine V had {{declared}} the adoration of icons to be a heresy, and had thereby elevated iconoclasm to official imperial policy. No persecution of iconophiles was launched at first, but iconophile resistance grew, until from 765 on, Constantine began persecuting iconophiles, and especially monks. The {{discovery of a}} wide-ranging iconophile <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> him involving {{some of the highest}} civil and military officials of the state in 766 provoked an extreme reaction. Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed, jailed, publicly humiliated, and finally executed, replaced by new, uncompromisingly iconoclast officials. In addition, the veneration of sacred relics and prayers to the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned.|$|E
50|$|In 560 BC, Battus II died. Her husband Arcesilaus II {{became the}} new king. Arcesilaus’ counsel was Learchus, who had murdered her father. Learchus was {{secretly}} <b>plotting</b> <b>against</b> Arcesilaus to overthrow him. When Arcesilaus discovered that Learchus was <b>plotting</b> <b>against</b> him, he ordered Learchus {{and his supporters}} to be banished from Cyrene.|$|R

5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the pulpit of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in the pulpit which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, rival regime {{officials}} and their followers, generally {{people of a}} younger generation, had begun to <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> the rule of Gomułka and his associates. Poland's security chief Mieczysław Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger. The party leader in Upper Silesia, Edward Gierek, who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France, also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the nomenklatura. From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the Prague Spring.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent <b>plot</b> <b>against</b> the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
