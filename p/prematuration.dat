However, no major differences were evident between the 2 % TCA-insoluble or-soluble frac-tions of prematured milk as seen by urea-PAGE or by RP-HPLC, respectively. <b>Prematuration</b> starters had little effect on the growth of mesophilic or thermophilic cheesemaking starters or on the rate at which pH decreased during incubation. Furthermore, they did not effect the growth of typical indige-nous microflora. Although RCT decreased with decreasing pH, results show that the slight decrease in pH which normally occurs during <b>prematuration</b> would result in only a small decrease in RCT. Lit-tle difference was evident between chemically (i. e., 4 % lactic acid) and biologically (i. e., <b>prematuration)</b> acidified samples with regard to RCT, indicating that any decrease in RCT observed in this study was caused by the effect of pH alone and not by any biological effect of <b>prematuration...</b>|$|E

40|$|In somatic {{embryogenesis}} (SE) of conifers, {{the inability of}} many embryogenic cell lines to form well-developed somatic embryos may results from failure and constraints during the transition of proembryogenic masses (PEMs) to early somatic embryos. In the present work, we propose {{the inclusion of a}} preculture and <b>prematuration</b> steps looking at enhancing PEM III-to-early somatic embryos transition. It was further hypothesized that these results would correlate with the contents of endogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and polyamines (PA). To test these hypotheses, the embryogenic culture was subjected to preculture with fluridone (FLD) and <b>prematuration</b> treatments with different combinations of carbon source and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The frequency of PEM III was increased after FLD preculture and the contents of IAA and ABA decreased, while the contents of PA increased. Putrescine (Put) was the most abundant PA present at this stage, followed by spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm). In early embryogenesis, <b>prematuration</b> treatments supplemented with maltose or lactose plus PEG enhanced the PEM III-to-early somatic embryos transition. IAA and ABA contents increased at this stage, while a decrease of the total free PA levels was observed. Put was the most abundant PA, followed by Spd and Spm, mainly in the treatment supplemented with PEG. This resulted in a decrease of PA ratio (Put/Spd + Spm) and, hence, PEM III-to-early somatic embryos transition. It was concluded that the preculture with FLD and <b>prematuration</b> treatments promote the PEM III-to-early somatic embryos transition throughout the whole early developmental process in Araucaria angustifolia.

40|$|Objectives: Asynchrony between {{nuclear and}} cytoplasmic maturation, and {{possibly}} {{damage to the}} oocyte meiotic spindle, limits the application of in vitro maturation (IVM) in assisted reproduction. Several {{studies have suggested that}} <b>Prematuration</b> with meiosis blockers may improve oocyte quality after IVM, favoring early embryogenesis. Thus, we investigated the effect of <b>Prematuration</b> with the nuclear maturation inhibitor butyrolactone I (BLI) on the meiotic spindle and chromosomal configuration of bovine oocytes. Study design: Immature oocytes obtained from cows slaughtered in a slaughterhouse (n = 840) were divided into the following groups: (1) control (n = 325), submitted only to IVM in TCM 199 for 24 h; (2) BLI 18 h (n = 208) submitted to meiotic blockage with 100 mu M BLI for 24 h (<b>Prematuration)</b> and then induction of IVM in TCM 199 for 18 h; and (3) BLI 24 h (n = 307), pre-matured with 100 mu m BLI for 24 h followed by 24 h of IVM in TCM 199. The oocytes were then fixed, stained by immunofluorescence for morphological visualization of both microtubules and chromatin, and evaluated. Results: Meiotic arrest occurred in 90. 2 % of the oocytes cultured with BLI. Maturation rates were similar for all groups (80. 3 %, 73. 6 % and 82. 7 % for the control, BLI 18 h and BLI 24 h groups, respectively). We observed 81. 3 % normal oocytes in metaphase II in the control group, and 80. 0 % and 81. 2 % in the BLI 18 h and BLI 24 h groups, respectively. The incidence of meiotic anomalies did not differ between groups (18. 7 %, 20. 0 % and 18. 8 % for the control, BLI 18 h and BLI 24 h, respectively).

40|$|Published online before print June 25, 2014 Oocyte {{in vitro}} {{maturation}} (IVM) is an important assisted reproductive technology and research tool. The adoption of IVM into routine clinical practice has been hindered by its significantly lower success rates compared to conventional in vitro fertilization. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) modulation and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), independently, have long been known to improve IVM oocyte developmental competence. This study comprehensively {{examined the effects of}} FSH and cAMP/cGMP modulation, alone and in combination, on IVM oocyte metabolism and developmental outcomes. Mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were subjected to a 1 h <b>prematuration</b> phase ± the cAMP modulator forskolin and cAMP/cGMP modulator 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine followed by IVM ± FSH. <b>Prematuration</b> with these cyclic nucleotide modulators or IVM with FSH significantly improved oocyte developmental competence and reduced spindle abnormalities compared to spontaneous IVM (no treatment); however, these two treatments in combination endowed even greater developmental competence (improved subsequent blastocyst rates and quality; P < 0. 05), albeit blastocyst yield and quality remained significantly lower than that of oocytes matured in vivo. A significant additive effect of combined IVM treatments was evident as increased COC lactate production and oxygen consumption and enhanced oocyte oxidative metabolism, ATP production, ATP:ADP ratio, and glutathione levels (P < 0. 05). Nevertheless, IVM increased reactive oxygen species production, particularly as a consequence of FSH addition, relative to in vivo matured oocytes. In conclusion, improvements in the embryo yield following IVM is associated with increased COC oxygen consumption and oocyte oxidative metabolism, but these remain metabolically and developmentally less competent relative to in vivo derived oocytes.

The wild-type cdc 25 Hs gene product was synthesized as an 80 -kDa fusion protein (p 80 GST-cdc 25) and was judged to be functional by several criteria: recombinant p 80 GST-cdc 25 induced meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes in the presence of cycloheximide; p 80 GST-cdc 25 activated histone H 1 kinase activity upon addition to extracts prepared from Xenopus oocytes; p 80 GST-cdc 25 activated p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B complexes (<b>prematuration</b> promoting factor) in immune complex kinase assays performed in vitro; p 80 GST-cdc 25 stimulated the tyrosine dephosphorylation of p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin complexes isolated from Xenopus oocyte extracts as well as from overproducing insect cells; and p 80 GST-cdc 25 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenylphosphate. In addition, deletion analysis defined a functional domain residing within the carboxy-terminus of the cdc 25 Hs protein.

In humans and nonhuman primates, oocyte quality is diminished with in vitro maturation. To determine the changes in gene expression in rhesus monkey cumulus cells (CC) that occur during the final day prior to oocyte maturation and how these changes differ between in vitro (IVM) and in vivo maturation (VVM), we completed a detailed comparison of transcriptomes using the Affymetrix gene array.

Among the genes affected by IVM are those that contribute to productive cell-cell interactions between cumulus cell and oocyte and between cumulus cells. Numerous genes involved in lipid metabolism are incorrectly regulated during IVM, and the synthesis of sex hormones appears not to be suppressed during IVM.

In the present study, {{the quality of}} mouse and human cumulus-enclosed oocytes (CEOs) was examined after a two-step culture consisting of a three-dimensional <b>prematuration</b> culture (3 D-PMC), followed by in vitro maturation (IVM). Methods: Mouse and human CEOs were embedded in an extra-cellular matrix (Collagen gel Type I). The gels containing the CEOs were cultured in medium with a phosphodiesterase 3 -inhibitor (PDE 3 -I; cilostamide 1 µM) for 24 h. Afterwards, CEOs {{were removed from the}} gel, washed away from inhibitor and underwent IVM. The optimal concentration of collagen (diluted 1 : 2 versus undiluted) was first determined in a mouse model. Cytoplasmic maturation after IVM of human and mouse oocytes was assessed in relation to fertilization and embryonic developmental capacity. Results: The diluted form of collagen supported better the structure of the expanding CEOs and meiotic competence of the oocytes. Electron microscopy in combination with Lucifer Yellow dye coupling assay revealed that oocyte-cumulus cell connections could be preserved during 3 D-PMC. Percentages of mouse 2 -cell embryos upon IVF were higher in the 3 D-PMC group compared to in vitro controls and 2 D-PMC oocytes, but lower compared to in vivo controls. In the human model, percentages of polar body-extruded oocytes were significantly higher in the 3 D-PMC group compared to conventionally matured oocytes.

The present study aimed to evaluate the quality of denuded in vitro matured human oocytes (= 'rescue IVM') following a <b>prematuration</b> culture (PMC) in a three-dimensional (3 D) co-culture system with cumulus cells. Denuded, germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes retrieved from controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycles were embedded in collagen (Type I) gel containing dissociated cumulus cells and a specific phosphodiesterase 3 -inhibitor (PDE 3 -I) for 24 h.

Cytoplasmic maturation was assessed by the oocytes' capability to fertilize after ICSI and sustain further embryonic development. Conventional microdroplet cultures of denuded oocytes, with and without PMC, served as controls. Oocytes embedded in collagen gel and exposed to PDE 3 -I were efficiently arrested at the GV stage. After removal from collagen and inhibitor, oocytes were capable of resuming meiosis: maturation rates (74. 5 %) were similar compared with non-prematured (68. 5 %) and prematured oocytes (73. 4 %) in microdroplets. Fertilization rates after PMC in 3 D co-culture were significantly higher compared with non-prematured oocytes (72. 2 % versus 54. 0 %; P < 0. 05), but similar to oocytes prematured in microdroplets (63. 8 %).

However, the complexity of the procedure and its poor efficiency are factors that limit a wider application of SCNT. In this context, oocyte meiotic arrest is an important option to make SCNT more flexible and increase the number of cloned embryos produced. Herein, we show that the use of butyrolactone I in association with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to arrest the meiotic division for 24 h prior to in vitro maturation provides bovine (Bos indicus) oocytes capable of supporting development of blastocysts and full-term cloned calves at least as efficiently as nonarrested oocytes. Furthermore, the procedure resulted in cloned blastocysts with an 1. 5 - and twofold increase of POU 5 F 1 and IFNT 2 expression, respectively, which are well-known markers of embryonic viability. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was diminished by <b>prematuration</b> in immature oocytes (718, 585 +/- 34, 775 vs. 595, 579 +/- 31, 922, respectively, control and treated groups) but was unchanged in mature oocytes (522, 179 +/- 45, 617 vs. 498, 771 +/- 33, 231) and blastocysts (816, 627 +/- 40, 235 vs. 765, 332 +/- 51, 104).

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of reproductive medicine has expanded rapidly since {{the birth of}} Louise Brown, the first baby to be conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 1978. In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes - a culture technique to support maturation of immature oocytes in vitro - could offer an interesting adjunct to the classical assisted reproductive treatments. From a clinical point of view, it could diminish or avoid the use of superovulation drugs, thus reducing treatment length, costs {{and the risk of}} severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and other adverse side-effects associated with hormonal stimulation. Other potential benefits include the provision of a source of oocytes for research in the fields of stem cells and cloning, obtaining oocytes for donation and preservation of fertility. However, several aspects of the technique are {{still in the process of}} optimization. A crucial point in this context is the development of new culture strategies for IVM, which is the objective of the present thesis. Immature human and mouse oocytes were used as models to reach this goal. One of the major problems in IVM is the fact that isolated meiotic-competent oocytes undergo nuclear maturation spontaneously before the cytoplasm achieves full maturity. A possible way to circumvent this deficiency is to apply a 2 -step culture composed of (1) a <b>prematuration</b> culture (PMC) to block temporarily spontaneous nuclear maturation, followed by (2) conventional IVM. By inducing meiotic arrest during PMC, oocytes may have the time to undergo cytoplasmic changes (mRNA storage, protein accumulation, ultrastructural remodelling), needed to enhance the oocytes’ capacity to sustain further embryonic development. Oocyte-specific phosphodiesterase type 3 -inhibitors (PDE 3 -Is) are potent meiotic inhibitors of the PMC-step. Mouse cumulus-oocytes complexes (COCs) were utilized to optimize the 2 -step culture. In addition, a similar 2 -step culture was applied on human oocytes. Furthermore, we performed the PMC step in a three-dimensional (3 D) co-culture system of human oocytes with dissociated cumulus cells, making use of an extra-cellular matrix (ECM; collagen). The results from the above studies might offer significant applications for improving the clinical outcome of IVM technologies...|$|E

After maturation, oocytes were inseminated and zygotes were cultured for 5 days in VitroCleave (IVF Vet Solutions, Adelaide, Australia) and transferred into VitroBlast (IVF Vet Solutions, Adelaide, Australia) until blastocyst assessment (Days 7 and 8). Zona-intact embryos were retrieved to assess differential staining of trophectoderm and inner cell mass. Data were transformed into a logarithm and analysed by 1 -way ANOVA and post hoc least significant difference using SigmaStat software (SPSS Inc., San Jose, CA, USA; P< 0. 05). There was no difference among groups on cleavage rates or blastocyst rates at Day 7; however, both Pre 2 h treatments increase hatched blastocyst rates at Day 8 of embryo development (Table 1). Supplementation with BMP 15 increased total blastocyst rates at Day 8, regardless of pretreatment with IBMX+FSK (Table 1). Our data demonstrate that embryos from oocytes matured in the presence of BMP 15 or pretreated with IBMX+FSK increase trophectoderm and total cell numbers; however, no differences were observed for inner cell mass.

Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan probably best known for its anti-coagulant activity, and its capacitation effects on spermatozoa, however its effects on the equine oocyte have not been thoroughly studied. Based on preliminary observations it was hypothesized-that heparin enhanced protease-induced post-culture cumulus cell loss for oocytes matured in vitro in equine follicular fluid, and that heparin exposure would have no effect on nuclear maturation. Over an eight-week period on nine separate occasions ovaries were obtained from an abattoir, 565 oocytes from 833 follicles were recovered from 177 ovaries. Oocytes were graded for gross cumulus morphology and randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups. All oocytes were cultured for 36 h in equine follicular fluid supplemented with gonadotropins and steroids, {{and in the case of}} the treatment group, two mg per ml heparin. Following culture, oocytes were treated with trypsin, scored for cumulus loss, and stained with aceto-orecein to assess nuclear maturation. Maturation rates for heparin-exposed and non-exposed oocytes were not significantly different: 26. 83 % and 27. 01 % respectively (P-. 968). Pre-culture cumulus morphology was slightly related to nuclear maturation (pooled data); cumulus grade one, two, and three oocytes had maturation rates of 31. 58 %, 18. 45 %, and 29. 01 % respectively (P-. 068); cumulus grade was related to maturation for control oocytes (P-. 029), but not for oocytes exposed to heparin (P-. 743).
