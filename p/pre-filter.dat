Watermark data, belonging to the user, are embedded on an original work such as text, audio, image, and video and thus, product ownership can be proved. Various robust watermarking algorithms have been developed in order to extract/detect the watermark against such attacks. Although watermarking algorithms in the transform domain differ from others by different combinations of transform techniques, it is difficult to decide on an algorithm for a specific application. Therefore, instead of developing a new watermarking algorithm with different combinations of transform techniques, we propose a novel and effective watermark extraction and detection method by <b>pre-filtering,</b> namely Adaptive Unsharp Masking (AUM). In spite of the fact that Unsharp Masking (UM) based <b>pre-filtering</b> is used for watermark extraction/detection in the literature by causing the details of the watermarked image become more manifest, effectiveness of UM may decrease in some cases of attacks.

The developed techniques substantially mitigate the noise amplification problem affecting previous <b>pre-filtering</b> algorithms extending their applicability to moderate to low C/N 0 values. The proposed algorithms are based on a convolutional representation of GNSS signals that allows one to apply the concepts of ZF and MMSE equalization to the signal sub-carrier. The proposed algorithms retain all the flexibility of standard <b>pre-filtering</b> techniques and can be used for unambiguous BOC tracking and autocorrelation shaping for multipath mitigation.

A motorized fan is used to pull air through the filters for distribution to rooms or enclosed work stations such as hoods.

Desired cleanliness levels determine the filter used: HEPA filters remove particles 0.3 um or larger at 99.99% efficiency, while ULPA filters remove particles 0.12 um or larger at 99.999% efficiency. FFUs are engineered for laminar air flow, as is required in critical environments. Controlled air flowing in a uniform direction and speed (carrying microparticles) is cleaner than turbulent air that flows in multiple directions or at inconsistent speeds.

If the compound has an ionization energy below that of the lamp photons, an electron will be ejected, and the resulting current {{is proportional to the}} concentration of the compound. Common lamp photon energies include 10.0 eV, 10.6 eV and 11.7 eV; the standard 10.6 eV lamp lasts for years, while the 11.7 eV lamp typically last only a few months and is used only when no other option is available. A broad range of compounds can be detected at levels ranging from a few ppb to several thousand ppm. Detectable compound classes in order of decreasing sensitivity include: aromatics and alkyl iodides; olefins, sulfur compounds, amines, ketones, ethers, alkyl bromides and silicate esters; organic esters, alcohols, aldehydes and alkanes; H2S, NH3, PH3 and organic acids. There is no response to standard components of air or to mineral acids.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the bunkers of the Siegfried Line was their ability to operate under gas attack. The bunkers could be hermetically sealed and supplied with purified air from outside. Because of their importance, the B-Werke had the most elaborate filter systems designed and built into the facilities. A constant overpressure prevented the penetration of gases in the event of minor leaks and allowed the removal of stale air and exhaust gases from the battle positions. One or more spaces were combined to form gas-tight cells. Pressure relief valves in the rooms or cells regulated the pressure. The air sucked in from outside was passed through a <b>pre-filter,</b> which cleared the air of dust and water vapour. Then it flowed through four, parallel, room filters, which filtered dangerous gasses out using active carbon inserts. If required, the air for heating the bunker could be warmed using a heat exchanger before being blown into the bunker. The capacity of the central fan was 40 m³ / minute. To ensure the ventilation of the plant even in the event of the central fan failing, individual rooms or cells had hand-operated HES ventilators (army unit protection ventilators) with 1.2 m³ or 2.4 m³ capacity per minute. The central fan and its filters was located above the engine room but is no longer in place.|$|E
