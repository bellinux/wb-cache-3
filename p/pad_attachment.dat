For both defect-free components and components having axial crack-like defects, finite element and limited experimental studies of the local and global deformations were made and results were found to be in close agreement. Both welded and integrally machined pads were studied. It was observed that for defect-free components, the method of <b>pad</b> <b>attachment</b> has little effect on the burst pressure. The presence of a pad was found to increase the burst pressure of cracked components by a small but significant margin. A finite element-based parametric study of pipes with part-penetrating defects and a range of pad geometries has demonstrated that pad size has little influence on the limit load for any of the cracked cases considered.

Multiple local force-volume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy.

Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single <b>attachment</b> <b>pad.</b> Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force.

Scanning electron microscopy of tarsal adhesive structures and leaf surfaces was conducted to investigate how A. subplicata attaches to its host.

5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy <b>attachment</b> <b>pads</b> employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy <b>attachment</b> <b>pads</b> of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|R

40|$|Many {{animals are}} able to scale smooth {{surfaces}} using adhesive structures on their feet. These organs are either soft pads with a relatively smooth surface or dense arrays of microscopic adhesive hairs with both designs having independently evolved in diverse taxa of arthropods and vertebrates. Biological adhesive pads out-perform conventional adhesives in many respects, making them important models for biomimetics. Hairy pads have attracted particular attention, because it has become feasible to fabricate similar synthetic microstructures. Nevertheless, the detailed performance and functional properties have not been characterised for any natural fibrillar adhesive system, and many fundamental aspects are still not understood. The aim of this thesis was therefore to investigate the fibrillar adhesive system of leaf beetles as a model. To investigate the functional implications of hairy <b>pad</b> design, the <b>attachment</b> performance between hairy pads of the leaf beetle Gastrophysa viridula and smooth pads of stick insects (Carausius morosus) was compared. Adhesive and frictional stresses {{were found to be}} similar in smooth and hairy pads, inconsistent with contact splitting theory, which predicts higher adhesive stresses for fibrillar adhesives. Hairy pads showed a greater direction-dependence of friction forces than smooth pads, confirming the importance of the asymmetric design of individual setae for effortless detachment. Experiments with contaminating particles also showed that hairy pads removed contamination more rapidly and efficiently than smooth pads. Self-cleaning ability had not been previously documented for adhesive organs of insects. To investigate to what extent the hairy system is able to compensate for surface roughness, whole-body attachment forces were measured for varying roughness levels. Attachment was reduced for all length scales of surface roughness, but in particular for asperity sizes smaller than the diameter of individual seta tips. Leaf beetles possess adhesive pads on three tarsal segments, which vary in setal morphology. However, the functional implications of this variation are unknown. The mechanical and adhesive properties of individual pads were therefore tested and their use during climbing observed. Proximal pads were shown to be stiffer than distal pads, conferring stability during pushing. In contrast, the softer distal <b>pads</b> allowed better <b>attachment</b> to rough surfaces. Hence the morphological variation is explained by an effective division of labour between the pads. To investigate an extreme example of pushing in a hairy system, pad use was studied during jumping in flea beetles. The pushing forces needed during take-off were exclusively produced by the proximal pads, again confirming the division of labour. To characterise the effects of different hair morphologies and to understand how individual setae contribute to array and whole-animal performance, single hair forces were measured using a glass capillary cantilever. Male-specific discoidal hairs were shown to be both stiffer and more adhesive than pointed and spatula-tipped setae, likely affecting overall <b>pad</b> stability and <b>attachment.</b> This thesis has shown that hairy pads are similar to smooth pads in the magnitude of adhesive stress supported yet outperform them in detachability and self-cleaning. It was also demonstrated that there are considerable differences in design and performance even within setal arrays of the same insect, indicating the limitations of general models of fibrillar adhesion and underlining the importance of specialised adaptations.

There are two alternative designs of such systems (Gorb and Beutel, 2001; Beutel and Gorb, 2001). Pads of flies, beetles and earwigs are covered by relatively long deformable setae which, due to the individual bending, {{increase the number of}} contact points with the surface. The second type of pads, so-called smooth systems, such as arolia and euplantulae, occurring in cockroaches, bees, grasshoppers and bugs, are soft deformable structures with a relatively smooth surface (Jiao et al., 2000). Pads of this type are composed of a very compliant material, which adapts to the surface profile and can increase the area of real contact (Gorb et al., 2000 b). There is also evidence that the non-volatile pad secretion is an essential factor for attachment to smooth substrata with both types of systems (Edwards and Tarkanian, 1970; Dixon et al., 1990; Vötsch et al., 2002). Attachment forces on smooth surfaces have been previously measured on the hairy adhesive pads of reduviid bugs (Edwards and Tarkanian, 1970), flies (Walker et al., 1985; Gorb et al., 2001 a), beetles (Stork, 1980; Ishii, 1987), and on the smooth pads of cockroaches (Roth and Willis, 1952) ...|$|R
