Clarke was {{involved}} in <b>planning</b> <b>Operation</b> Bodyguard, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in the Middle Eastern region. However, {{by the end of}} the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where the department was disbanded.|$|E

500|$|Ecology is an {{employed}} {{science of}} restoration, repairing disturbed sites through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in environmental impact assessments. Edward O.

Ecological science has boomed in the industrial investment of restoring ecosystems and their processes in abandoned sites after disturbance. Natural resource managers, in forestry, for example, employ ecologists to develop, adapt, and implement ecosystem based methods into the <b>planning,</b> <b>operation,</b> and restoration phases of land-use. Ecological science {{is used in the}} methods of sustainable harvesting, disease, and fire outbreak management, in fisheries stock management, for integrating land-use with protected areas and communities, and conservation in complex geo-political landscapes.|$|E

500|$|In July 1940 the German High Command {{commenced}} <b>planning</b> <b>Operation</b> Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union. On 15 March 1941 Manstein was appointed commander of the LVI Panzer Corps; he was one of 250 commanders to be briefed for the upcoming major offensive, first seeing detailed plans of the offensive in May. His corps was part of the Fourth Panzer Group under the command of General Erich Hoepner in Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb's Army Group North. The Army Group was tasked with thrusting through the Baltic States and then advancing on Leningrad. Manstein arrived at the front only six days prior to the launch of the offensive. Operation Barbarossa commenced on 22 June 1941 with a massive German attack along the whole front line. Manstein's corps was to advance with Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XLI Panzer Corps to the Dvina River to secure the bridges near the town of Daugavpils. The Soviet forces mounted a number of counterattacks, but those were aimed against Reinhardt's corps, leading to the Battle of Raseiniai. Manstein's corps advanced rapidly, reaching the Dvina River, [...] distant, in just 100 hours. Overextended and well ahead {{of the rest of the}} army group, he fended off a number of determined Soviet counterattacks. After Reinhardt's corps closed in, the two corps were tasked with encircling the Soviet formations around Luga in a pincer movement. Again having penetrated deep into the Soviet lines with unprotected flanks, his corps was the target of a Soviet counteroffensive from 15 July at Soltsy by the Soviet 11th Army, commanded by Nikolai Vatutin. Manstein's 8th Panzer Division was cut off. Although it was able to fight its way free, it was badly mauled, and the Red Army succeeded in halting Manstein's advance at Luga. The corps regrouped at Dno. The 8th Panzers were sent on anti-partisan duties and Manstein was given the 4th SS Polizei Division. The attack on Luga was repeatedly delayed.|$|E

2500|$|In early July 1940 the German High Command began <b>planning</b> <b>Operation</b> Barbarossa, the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union. Bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or do much damage to the war economy; eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British war production which continued to increase. The greatest effect was to force the British to disperse the production of [...] aircraft and spare parts. British wartime studies concluded that cities generally took 10 to 15 days to recover when hit severely but exceptions like Birmingham took three months.|$|E

2500|$|... "Operation Grand Slam", {{which was}} {{launched}} by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu {{and a key}} region for communications between Kashmir {{and the rest of}} India, was also a failure. Many Pakistani commentators criticised the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam. These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India (having called it India's [...] "jugular vein") {{and did not want to}} capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war. Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen. Yahya Khan. A 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan. [...] "The enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command. Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticised Ayub Khan for <b>planning</b> <b>Operation</b> Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war. Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned.|$|E

During this time, 2/3's Intelligence Officer, Captain Scott Westerfield, focused further on learning about Ahmad Shah. His overall intelligence picture of Shah took a substantial leap when 2nd Lieutenant Regan Turner, a platoon commander with 2/3's [...] "Whiskey Company" [...] – a Weapons Company augmented to function like an infantry line company, gathered a wealth of human intelligence about Shah during a patrol, including his full name: Ahmad Shah Dara-I-nur (Ahmad Shah of the Valley of the Enlightened ones); his birthplace, the Kuz Kunar District of Nangarhar Province; his primary alias: Ismael; his chief allegiance: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was based out of the Shamshato Refugee Camp near Peshawar, Pakistan; his team's size: fifty to one hundred fighters; and his aspirations: to impede the upcoming elections and attempt to aid a resurgent Taliban in the region. Although Shah was a relatively unknown entity in the region, he apparently held regional aspirations and possibly had the assistance of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. 2nd Lieutenant Turner also gathered a number of photographs of Shah.|$|E

40|$|A <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> {{performance}} always affects patient´s {{needs for}} assurance and safety. It {{is important to}} provide necessary information connected with the <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance itself so that the patient can feel assure and safe. The key role for the patient and her/his needs for assurance and safety is in general nurse´s hands because she is the closest person to the patient and can help to inspire her/his needs for assurance and safety with konfidence best through the aid of her knowledge and skills {{that she should have}} as well as through the aid of her attitudes. The target of the thesis was to find out how a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance affects patient´s needs for assurance and safety and how a general nurse inspires patient´s needs for assurance and safety connected with a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance with confidence. The following research questions were stated: How does a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance affect patient´s needs for assurance and safety? How does a general nurse affect patient´s needs for assurance and safety connected with a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance to inspire her/him with confidence? What is insufficient in filling patient´s needs for assurance and safety before a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance? How can a general nurse help a patient control her/his fear and state of anxiety related to a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance? The method qualitative research with the use of depth interview was used to figure out the investigation. The respondents were willing to record the interview which were verbally rewritten and then subjected to the contents analysis by the method paper and pencil. From the research it is clear that a <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performance affects patient´s needs for assurance and safety in a negative way disregarding to her/his previous experience. Patient´s worries and negative feelings can be eliminated by a general nurse who treats her/him as equal, taking up an individual approach, informing her/him about all performances and proceedings, having a calming and welcoming way of communication, using empathy and listening as well as trying to meet patient´s wishes according to her possibilities. The research reveals the advantage of patients´ readiness for <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performances. Patients can learn it in the framework of educational proceeding in the out-patients´ department at the same time when they learn {{that they are going to}} be operated. The research also shows that general nurses do not have enough knowledge in the sphere of therapeutical communication. The results indicate that it would be suitable to start educating patients as soon as it is known how their disease will be solved and treated in order to reduce the negative impact of surgical treatment to patients´ needs for assurance and safety. General nurses should complete their knowledge and skills to be able to help patients to cope with their difficult life-situation. On the basis of the research investigation and after the consultation with the senior nursing officer, the training course will be organized. The topic of the training course will concentrate on communication with patients before <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performances with a view to therapeutical communications and therapeutical interviews. Other discovered facts, for example, the lack of information provided to patients and possibilities regarding better patients´ readiness for <b>planned</b> <b>operation</b> performances will surely be solved by the hospital management...|$|R
