40|$|Recent {{published}} work showed post-exercise (<b>PostEx)</b> esophageal temperature (Tes) recovered rapidly to a persistent plateau that was significantly elevated (0. 5 ∘C or more) above pre-exercise (PreEx) values. Non-acral skin temperatures, except over exercised muscle, returned rapidly to PreEx levels. Rectal temperatures (Tre) fell gradually during recovery reaching a plateau late in recovery (45 min) equal in magnitude of difference from Tes to PreEx values. Surface temperatures over the quadriceps remained high, indicating that heat {{was trapped in}} muscle. A similarity between the exercise Tes at which skin surface dilation occurred (Tdil) and the <b>PostEx</b> Tes was identified. These observations contradict the widely accepted "load-error" prinicple of thermoregulation which predicts that displacement of core temperature (Tco) from a hypothalamic set point (SPhy) will induce defense reflexes until the displacement is reversed. These data lead to the hypothesis {{that there was some}} residual influence related to exercise that retained the modulation of thermal reflex thresholds during recovery. Testing of the hypothesis was conducted with experiments to establish if: (1) the <b>PostEx</b> Tes was related to PreEx temperature; (2) exogenous thermal loading would produce the same post treatment elevation; (3) <b>PostEx</b> Tes elevation followed by exogenous thermal loading would result in an increase in the Tes elevation and (4) a 5 min exercise generating Tes below Tdil would result in a <b>PostEx</b> elevation of Tes. It was demonstrated that repeated running-recovery cycles produced patterns of rise and then fall of Tes to an elevated <b>PostEx</b> plateau that was equal to Tdil. This was similar to previous results except that the second exercise was begun at an elevated Tes and produced further elevation of Tdil with a comparable effect on <b>PostEx</b> Tes. Similarly, the third exercise further increased Tes following which it recovered to an even higher plateau equal in magnitude to Tdil. We observed that exogenous heat loading, by immersion of subjects in a bath of water at 44 ∘C to produce a rate of increase and peak elevation of Tes equal to exercise, did not result in a post-treatment elevation in Tes. Similarly, the <b>PostEx</b> Tes elevated plateau, equal to Tdil, remained unchanged following water immersion at 44 ∘C despite a larger total heat gain during the immersion. These observations eliminate whole body heat content changes as the primary cause of the Tes elevation and support the hypothesis that the homeothermic defense mechanisms become inoperative during recovery at a temperature above resting values as defined by Tdil. The physiological importance of Tdil in defining upper limits of resting temperature cannot be determined at this point. However, the physiological relationship of Tdil with <b>PostEx</b> Tes suggests that neuro-muscular activity significantly influences thermolytic controls which persist in recovery. That Tdil may represent the upper limit of a range of "normal temperatures" is supported by data from a 5 min exercise performed to a Tes elevation below Tdil. Within minutes of exercise termination Tes achieved a stable elevated <b>PostEx</b> Tes (0. 3 ∘C or greater) which was maintained with no change over 65 min of recovery. The data suggest the possibility of: (1) a metabolically induced change in SPhy thermosensitivity, (2) a decreased sensitivity to an increase LE, or (3) a range of temperature regulation defined by an upper threshold control for thermolytic temperature defense reflexes...|$|E
40|$|A ccurate and {{reliable}} measurements of dialysate volumes {{are needed in}} a wide range of clinical and physiological studies of peritoneal dialysis. Assessment of ultrafiltration capacity and solute mass transfer during peritoneal dialysis exchanges requires estimation of infusion and drain dialysate volumes and often warrants determination of pre and <b>postex</b> change residual volumes. Kinetic studies of peritoneal dialysis, in addition, frequently require evaluation of changes in the intraperitoneal volume of dialysis solution during the dwell time. Several approaches for measuring these dialysate parameters have been reported in recent years (1 - 24). From these studies have evolved the preferred methods for estimating peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity, intraperitoneal residual volume, and dialysate volume as a function of dwell time.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were done {{to study the}} effects of L-carnitine supplementation (CNsup) during exercise. EXP 1, examined the effect of CNsup on lipid oxidation and muscle glycogen utilization during submaximal EX. Triglycerides were elevated by a fat feeding (90 g fat), 3 h later subjects cycled for 60 min at 70 % VO 2 max (CON). Muscle biopsies were obtained preEX, after 30 and 60 min of EX. Blood samples were taken preEX and every 15 min of EX. Subjects randomly completed two additional trials following 7 and 14 days of CNsup (6 g/day). During one of the trials, subjects received 2000 units of heparin 15 min prior to EX to elevate FFA (CNhep). There were no differences in V 02, RER, HR, g of CHO and fat oxidized among the three trials. Serum total acid soluble (TASC) and free carnitine (FC) increased with CNsup (CON, 71. 3 ± 2. 9; CN, 92. 8 ± 5. 4; CNhep, 109. 8 ± 3. 5 mol·g'). Muscle carnitine concentration at rest was unaffected by CNsup. During EX, TASC did not change, FC decreased (p< 0. 05) and SCAC increased (p< 0. 05). With CNsup the decrease in FC was less (~ 50 %) (p< 0. 05) and the increase in SCAC was greater (~ 200 - 300 %) (p< 0. 05) compared to CON (free 65 %; SCAC 150 %). Pre and <b>postEX</b> muscle glycogens were not different. EXP 2, examined the effects of CNsup on blood lactate accumulation during maximal EX. Subjects cycled for 4 min at ~ 100 % VO 2 max (CON). Exercise was repeated following 6 and 13 days of CNsup (6 g/day). Serum TASC and FC were elevated due to CNsup. Blood Lactate was measured prior to and 0, 3, 5, and 7 min <b>postEX.</b> CNsup resulted in less (p< 0. 05) lactate accumulation compared to CON. There were no differences between DAY- 6 and DAY- 13.

40|$|The {{positions}} of objects – typically trees and other vegetation – in forest sample plots are often of interest, e. g., as ground truth data in forest surveys in which remote sensing techniques are used, and in environmental monitoring. Laser rangefinders and measurements of bearings using electronic compasses {{are often used}} for this purpose. However, use of laser rangefinders is problematic when sighting conditions are poor. In contrast, since ultrasound passes through vegetation and around stems it also enables measurements in dense forest. Thus, the novel ultrasound-based Haglöf <b>PosTex</b> ® instrument provides quick measurements of {{positions of}} objects in sample plots even in dense forest with poor sighting conditions. The design of the instrument also enables measurement of positions {{at the same time}} as data are recorded for the objects, such as the diameters of trees. The instrument – developed in collaboration between the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and Haglöf Sweden AB – has been used in various applications, e. g. in forest remote-sensing projects and mapping mountain vegetation, trees in burnt forests and seedlings for monitoring forest regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Flow-mediated {{dilation}} (FMD) {{refers to}} the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and the subsequent dilation of the vessel in response to increases in shear stress on the endothelial lining accompanying increases in blood flow. The phenomenon {{has been shown to}} be endothelium dependent and as such is used clinically and experimentally as an index of endothelial health. FMD can be assessed by imaging a conduit artery with ultrasound during a period of reactive hyperaemia, typically following a period of prior blood flow occlusion achieved by the inflation of a pneumatic cuff around the limb distal to the imaging site. Previous studies have shown that the health of the endothelium is predictive of the health of the cardiovascular system as a whole. This thesis set out to scrutinize the FMD test as a marker for endothelial health by testing the following five hypotheses: 	 1. A short burst of high shear is not adequate to elicit the FMD response. 	 2. Brachial artery dilation following 15 minutes of occlusion is a clearer indicator of endothelium dependent FMD than 5 minutes of occlusion with exercise. 	 3. Oscillating the post occlusion shear stress will decrease FMD compared to unidirectional shear). 	 4. Heavy dynamic hand grip exercise 6 minutes before an occlusion-only FMD protocol will result in an enhanced FMD response. 	 5. Long term bed-rest inactivity will attenuate the FMD response and an exercise program will preserve endothelial function. The experiments documented in Chapter 2 found that a 20 -s shear stress stimulus following 15 min of forearm circulatory occlusion was not adequate to induce an FMD response compared to longer durations of shear and there was a progressive reduction in FMD when the magnitude of the initial peak shear was reduced by limiting the duration of prior occlusion. Also, the FMD response was correlated with the total shear to time of peak diameter for all shear durations and peaks that were studied while the same was not true of peak shear. In Chapter 3 it was revealed that an uncoupling of the shear-to-dilation ratio occurred when dynamic exercise was added to the FMD test as both 15 min of occlusion (15 OC) and 5 min of occlusion with 1 min of exercise (1 EXin 5 OC) yielded similar FMD responses, even though the shear stimulus was increased with the addition of exercise. Increased plasma nitrite during hyperaemia was observed only in the 15 OC protocol, suggesting that the exercise in the 1 EXin 5 OC protocol initiates dilatory mechanisms that are not as heavily reliant on the shear sensitive nitric oxide pathway. In Chapter 4 it was shown that 5 min of intense dynamic hand grip exercise (5 EX) produced a greater dilation than either continuous (15 OC) or intermittent (IO) shear following 15 OC. Total shear to the time of peak diameter (AUCshear) and peak shear were both correlated to %dilation following 15 OC; however this relationship was lost during 5 EX and IO. The results of this study echoed the suggestion in Chapter 3 that there was an uncoupling of the intensity of the shear stimulus and the magnitude of vasodilatation when exercise was introduced, and adds that it may be in part due to the oscillatory nature of the shear profile during exercise. The acute effects of local exercise on the FMD response following 15 OC were examined in Chapter 5. FMD in the brachial artery was blunted following dynamic hand grip exercise, even though the shear stimulus was greater during <b>PostEX.</b> Nitrite was significantly elevated in CON at 15 s while <b>PostEX</b> nitrite was significantly elevated at 30 s post cuff release but not different from CON at 15 s. The results of this study suggested that prior exercise had a negative effect on FMD which may be related to exercise blunting post occlusion endothelial N ̇O production. Chapter 6 examined the effect of 56 days of head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR) and an exercise countermeasure on conduit artery FMD following release of distal limb ischemia and NMD following sublingual administration of 0. 3 mg of nitroglycerin. HDBR without EX decreased the resting diameter of the popliteal artery while EX increased the diameter. HDBR had no effect on the resting diameter of the brachial artery. FMD was elevated in all groups for the brachial but only in the non-exercisers for the popliteal. When change in resting diameter was taken into account the preserved FMD in EX was removed. NMD was not altered by HDBR in any group. There was enhanced endothelial function relative to intrinsic dilatory capacity in both the brachial and popliteal arteries post HDBR. The results from Chapter 2 support hypothesis 1, showing that a 20 second burst of high shear stimulus was not adequate to elicit the FMD response during reactive hyperaemia. It is not clear whether hypothesis 2 was supported or not given that the results from Chapter 3 showed on the one hand that the %FMD did not change with the addition of exercise in the occlusion but on the other hand the shear to dilation ratio was altered. The finding, in Chapter 4, that FMD was not reduced when the hyperaemia was intermittent does not support hypothesis 3. In opposition to hypothesis 4, Chapter 5 showed that %FMD was reduced following bouts of heavy hand grip exercise; however the absolute magnitude of vessel diameter was similar in both post exercise and control tests. Finally, hypothesis 5 was also contradicted, with Chapter 6 showing that long term bed-rest enhanced rather than attenuated the FMD response in both arm and leg arteries, while an exercise countermeasure preserved pre-bed-rest FMD in the legs only. In addition to the specific hypotheses tested, there was evidence that acute exercise evoked dilatory mechanisms in the conduit arteries that were not shear/endothelium dependent given that the shear to dilation relationship was uncoupled during, following, and in occlusion protocols that include exercise. The precise mechanisms by which this is achieved are still unknown, but it may be partially due to the oscillatory nature of the elevated blood flow during exercise. I conclude that inference of cardiovascular health from endothelial function by the evaluation of %FMD should be approached with caution, especially in the event that physical activity is involved...|$|E
