With {{two other}} Jedi masters at his side, Windu {{attempts}} to arrest <b>Palpatine,</b> but <b>Palpatine</b> produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. <b>Palpatine</b> engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at him, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's {{face into the}} gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. Just as Windu is about to dispatch <b>Palpatine,</b> Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith lord's behalf, allowing <b>Palpatine</b> to kill Windu with another blast of lightning. Anakin then pledges himself {{to the dark side}} as Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 sequel , <b>Palpatine</b> is {{captured}} by cyborg Separatist general General Grievous, {{as part of}} a plan devised by Sidious. <b>Palpatine</b> is rescued by Anakin and Obi-Wan, but not before the Jedi confront Count Dooku again. A duel ensues in which Anakin defeats Dooku. <b>Palpatine</b> orders Anakin to kill the unarmed Dooku; after some hesitance, Anakin kills Dooku in cold blood. <b>Palpatine</b> then escapes with his Jedi rescuers and returns to Coruscant. By this point, <b>Palpatine</b> has become a virtual dictator, able to take any action in the Senate. He makes Anakin his personal representative on the Jedi Council, who deny Anakin the rank of Jedi master and order him to spy on the Chancellor. <b>Palpatine</b> tells Anakin the story of Darth Plagueis, a powerful Sith Lord who was able to manipulate life and death but was killed by his own apprentice. Eventually, <b>Palpatine</b> reveals his secret identity as a Sith Lord to Anakin; he knows that Anakin has been having prophetic visions of Padmé, his pregnant secret wife, dying in childbirth, and offers to teach him Plagueis' secrets to save her life.|$|E
5|$|Ian McDiarmid as Senator <b>Palpatine</b> / Darth Sidious, a Senator of Naboo who is {{eventually}} elected Chancellor of the Republic. McDiarmid {{was surprised when}} Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of <b>Palpatine</b> because he had assumed that a younger actor would play the part in the prequel films.|$|E

5|$|In the 1999 prequel , {{which is}} set 32 years before Star Wars, <b>Palpatine</b> is {{depicted}} as a middle-aged Galactic Senator from the planet Naboo who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. As Sidious, he influences the corrupt Trade Federation to blockade and invade Naboo. Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo flees to the planet Coruscant to receive counsel from <b>Palpatine,</b> unaware that he actually engineered the invasion. After a plea for help from the senate results in bureaucratic delays, <b>Palpatine</b> persuades the queen to make a motion to have Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum removed from office.|$|E
5|$|Lucas's {{conceptualization}} of <b>Palpatine</b> {{and the role}} the character plays in Star Wars changed over time. From Return of the Jedi onwards, <b>Palpatine</b> became the ultimate personification of evil in Star Wars, replacing Darth Vader as the central villain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palpatine</b> {{orders the}} clone troopers {{to turn on}} their Jedi generals, while {{dispatching}} Vader to kill everyone inside the Jedi Temple and then murder the Separatist leaders on the planet Mustafar. <b>Palpatine</b> then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor. Jedi Master Yoda confronts him in his Senate office and engages the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel that ends in a stalemate. Sensing that his new apprentice is in danger, <b>Palpatine</b> travels to Mustafar and finds Vader near death following a duel with Obi-Wan. After returning to Coruscant, he rebuilds Vader's burned, mutilated body with the black armored suit from the original trilogy. <b>Palpatine</b> then tells Vader that Padmé {{was killed in the}} heat of Vader's anger, breaking what remains of his apprentice's spirit. <b>Palpatine</b> is last seen watching the original Death Star's construction, with Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin at his side.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>Palpatine's</b> takeover, he {{believes}} his power is absolute. He controls everything, including the senate. He {{is the leader of}} the evil Sith.|$|R
5000|$|Stover {{describes}} the Clone Wars as [...] "the perfect Jedi trap". This {{is the first}} account of {{the full extent of}} <b>Palpatine's</b> intricate plotting.|$|R
5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} <b>Palpatine</b> to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If <b>Palpatine</b> was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E
5|$|Since the Separatists are {{secretly}} {{building a}} battle droid army, <b>Palpatine</b> uses {{the situation to}} have himself granted emergency powers. <b>Palpatine</b> feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising to {{return it to the}} Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow the creation of a clone army to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixteenth and}} final {{level of the}} game takes place during Dark Empire, six years after s Battle of Endor. The Rebel Alliance has {{established}} the New Republic, which now controls {{three quarters of the}} galaxy. After the deaths of Emperor <b>Palpatine</b> and Darth Vader, the Galactic Empire collapsed, but was reborn under a mysterious new leader (who is actually a clone of <b>Palpatine).</b> Rogue Squadron, now under the command of Wedge Antilles, continues to fight the Empire to protect the newly formed Republic.|$|E

5|$|Palpatine's {{ultimate}} fate {{is further}} chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor {{is once again}} reborn on Byss into a clone body. <b>Palpatine</b> tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. <b>Palpatine</b> tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. <b>Palpatine</b> is killed by a blaster shot fired by Han, but his spirit is captured by the mortally-wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.|$|E
50|$|As the Clone Wars were winding down, however, <b>Palpatine's</b> once near-unanimous support {{began to}} falter. As {{depicted}} in the Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith novelization and deleted scenes from the film itself, a bloc of senators began to emerge, even before the Clone Wars had ended, who opposed <b>Palpatine's</b> authoritarian rule and resented his treatment of the Jedi and other opponents. This bloc, originally led by influential politicians such as Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and later by Bail's adopted daughter Princess Leia Organa, eventually became the political voice of the emerging Rebel Alliance.|$|R
50|$|When he is {{betrayed by}} Anakin and shot with <b>Palpatine's</b> lightning, Windu realizes too late that {{he forgot to}} look for Anakin's own shatterpoint - his desire to save Padmé Amidala, his secret wife, at any cost.|$|R

5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Padmé about Anakin's {{turn to the}} dark side, Obi-Wan stows aboard her ship. Padmé travels to Mustafar and implores Vader to leave the dark side. He refuses, and upon witnessing Obi-Wan, chokes Padmé into unconsciousness {{in a fit of}} rage. Obi-Wan duels and defeats Vader, severing most of his limbs and leaving him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles <b>Palpatine</b> until their duel reaches a stalemate.

5|$|Director George Lucas has a cameo as Baron Papanoida, a blue-faced alien in {{attendance}} at the Coruscant Opera House. Lucas' son Jett portrays a young Jedi-in-training named Zett Jukassa. Lucas' daughter Amanda appears as a character called Terr Taneel, seen in the security hologram; while his other daughter Katie plays a blue-skinned Pantoran named Chi Eekway, visible when <b>Palpatine</b> arrives at the Senate after being saved by the Jedi, and talking to Baron Papanoida at the Opera House (she also has a brief speaking role {{in one of the}} deleted scenes where Padmé is meeting in secret with other senators). Christian Simpson appeared as a stunt double for Hayden Christensen.

5|$|In April 2014, {{most of the}} {{licensed}} Star Wars {{novels and}} comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise by Lucasfilm. Star Wars Legends literature elaborates on <b>Palpatine's</b> role in Star Wars fiction outside of the films.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Navy, also {{referred}} to as the Imperial Starfleet, was the military arm of the Galactic Empire in charge of maintaining security, peace and order in the galaxy.

Organization of the Imperial Navy is assigned to the Moffs.|$|R
5|$|In the 2002 sequel , <b>Palpatine</b> {{exploits}} constitutional loopholes {{to remain}} in office even after the official expiration of his term.

5|$|On the {{asteroid}} Polis Massa, Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda and Padmé {{gives birth to}} twins named Luke and Leia before dying shortly thereafter. A funeral procession is held for Padmé on Naboo, who is buried with the necklace Anakin made her years earlier. On Mustafar, <b>Palpatine</b> finds a severely burnt Vader still alive. After returning to Coruscant, Vader's mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. <b>Palpatine</b> explains to Vader that he killed Padmé in his anger. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda decide to conceal the twins from the Sith, as they are the galaxy's only hope for freedom. Yoda exiles himself to the planet Dagobah, while Vader and the Emperor oversee {{the construction of a}} superstation, the Death Star.

500|$|<b>Palpatine's</b> {{role in the}} prequel films {{required}} McDiarmid to play {{two dimensions}} of the same character. Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace, McDiarmid stated, [...] "Stepping onto the set of Episode I {{for the first time}} was like going back in time, due to my experience in Jedi. <b>Palpatine's</b> an interesting character; he's conventional on the outside, but demonic on the inside [...] he's on the edge, trying to go beyond what's possible." [...] McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones. He noted, [...] " [...] is a supreme actor. He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a schizophrenic fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional [...] and for those who are looking for clues, that's almost where you can see them." [...] McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padmé Amidala is almost assassinated: ...|$|R
500|$|<b>Palpatine's</b> wardrobe, {{tailored}} by {{costume designer}} Trisha Biggar, {{played an important}} part {{in the development of the}} character throughout the films. In Attack of the Clones, explained McDiarmid, [...] "The costumes ... have got much more edge to them, I think, than the mere senator had [...] So we see the trappings of power." [...] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, [...] "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering." [...] McDiarmid's favorite costume in Revenge of the Sith was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that [...] "it just feels reptilian, which is exactly right for [...]" [...] According to Trisha Biggar, <b>Palpatine's</b> costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, [...] "His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking him toward the dark side." ...|$|R
2500|$|The labels [...] "Star Destroyer" [...] and [...] "Super Star Destroyer" [...] {{are applied}} to several other massive Star Wars warships, such as the Pellaeon-class in the [...] comic series (2006–2010), the reborn Emperor <b>Palpatine's</b> flagships Eclipse and Eclipse II in the Dark Empire series (1991–1995), and the Victory class first {{described}} in the early Star Wars novella Han Solo's Revenge (1979).|$|R
