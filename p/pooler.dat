One of Pooler's personal poems formed the basis for Merry Christmas Darling, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard charts for three years. Bettis, who later would win an Primetime Emmy Award himself, also successfully collaborated on songs with other artists, such as Human Nature performed by Michael Jackson, Crazy for You performed by Madonna, and One Moment in Time performed by Whitney Houston.|$|E
