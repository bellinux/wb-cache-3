60|$|Now {{right on}} top of this the cabinet {{reported}} a national debt amounting to upward of forty-five dollars--half a dollar to every individual in the nation. And they proposed to fund something. They had heard that this was always done in such emergencies. They <b>proposed</b> <b>duties</b> on exports; also on imports. And they wanted to issue bonds; also paper money, redeemable in yams and cabbages in fifty years. They said the pay of the army and of the navy and of the whole governmental machine was far in arrears, and unless something was done, and done immediately, national bankruptcy must ensue, and possibly insurrection and revolution. The emperor at once resolved upon a high-handed measure, and one of a nature never before heard of in Pitcairn's Island. He went in state to the church on Sunday morning, with the army at his back, and commanded the minister of the treasury to take up a collection.|$|E
6000|$|It is never, therefore, wise to {{quarrel with}} the {{interested}} views of men, whilst they are {{combined with the}} public interest and promote it: it is our business to tie the knot, if possible, closer. Resources that are derived from extraordinary virtues, as such virtues are rare, so they must be unproductive. It {{is a good thing}} for a moneyed man to pledge his property on the welfare of his country: he shows that he places his treasure where his heart is; and revolving in this circle, we know, that, [...] "wherever a man's treasure is, there his heart will be also." [...] For these reasons, and on these principles, I have been sorry to see the attempts which have been made, with more good meaning than foresight and consideration, towards raising the annual interest of this loan by private contributions. Wherever a regular revenue is established, there voluntary contribution can answer no purpose but to disorder and disturb it in its course. To recur to such aids is, for so much, to dissolve the community, and to return to a state of unconnected Nature. And even if such a supply should be productive in a degree commensurate to its object, it must also be productive of much vexation and much oppression. Either the citizens by the <b>proposed</b> <b>duties</b> pay their proportion according to some rate made by public authority, or they do not. If the law be well made, and the contributions founded on just proportions, everything superadded by something that is not as regular as law, and as uniform in its operation, will become more or less out of proportion. If, on the contrary, the law be not made upon proper calculation, it is a disgrace to the public; wisdom, which fails in skill to assess the citizen in just measure and according to his means. But the hand of authority is not always the most heavy hand. It is obvious that men may be oppressed by many ways besides those which take their course from the supreme power of the state. Suppose the payment to be wholly discretionary. Whatever has its origin in caprice is sure not to improve in its progress, nor to end in reason. It is impossible for each private individual to have any measure conformable to the particular condition of each of his fellow-citizens, or to the general exigencies of his country. 'Tis a random shot at best.|$|E
5000|$|When the Bill was reintroduced in February 1868, Disraeli {{noted that}} the Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn, had written to the Lord Chancellor expressing the [...] "strong and {{unanimous}} feeling of insuperable repugnance" [...] to their <b>proposed</b> <b>duties</b> under the Bill.

The Liberal opposition did not attack {{the principle of the}} Bill, although two individual Liberal MPs fervently opposed it, with Alexander Mitchell arguing he was [...] "convinced that the retention by the House of its own jurisdiction and the right of determining who were its Members was essential to its dignity and independence". There was a feeling in the press and in Parliament that a makeshift court was not of suitable esteem to take over what had been a matter of Parliamentary privilege. Disraeli therefore came up with a compromise, which William Gladstone accepted, whereby two Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, Exchequer of Pleas or Queen's Bench would be designated to try election petitions with full judicial salaries. The passage of the Bill was prolonged in the House of Commons because of opposition, but passed through the House of Lords in five days and the Bill received Royal Assent on 31 July 1868.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} corporate liability {{in the context of}} occupational health and safety in New Zealand. In particular it looks at the new <b>duty</b> of officers <b>proposed</b> in the Health and Safety Reform Bill 2014. New Zealand’s occupational health and safety framework has experienced a regulatory breakdown, stemming from its incomplete implementation of the Robens Model for health and safety regulation.

40|$|Abstract—Duty cycling {{is often}} used to reduce the energy {{consumption}} caused by idle listening in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Most studies on WSN protocols define a common duty cycle value throughout the network to achieve synchronization among the nodes. On the other hand, a few studies propose adaptation of the duty cycle according to uniform traffic conditions, which is beneficial assuming one-to-one traffic patterns that result in evenly distributed packet traffic. In this work, we consider the convergecast communication pattern commonly observed in WSNs. In convergecast communication, the packet traffic observed around the sink node is much higher than the traffic observed far from the sink, i. e., nodes with different distances to the sink node receive and must relay different amounts of traffic. Additionally, we utilize receiver-based protocols, which enable nodes to communicate with no synchronization or neighbor information, and hence do not require all nodes in the network to have the same duty cycle. In this paper, we model the expected energy consumption of nodes utilizing receiver-based protocols as a function of their duty cycle and their distance to the sink node. Using this analysis, we derive a closed-form formula for the duty cycle that minimizes the expected energy consumption at a given distance. Moreover, we propose an adaptation method for the derived distance-based duty cycle based on local observed traffic. Performance evaluations of the two <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle assignment methods show that they greatly improve the energy efficiency without sacrificing packet delivery ratio or delay significantly.

40|$|The Department of Energy's Advanced Turbine System (ATS) {{program is}} aimed at {{forecasting}} {{the development of a}} new generation of land-based gas turbine systems with overall efficiencies significantly beyond those of current state-of-the-art machines, as well as greatly increased times between inspection and refurbishment, improved environmental impact, and decreased cost. The <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle of ATS turbines will require the use of different criteria in the design of the materials for the critical hot gas path components. In particular, thermal barrier coatings will be an essential feature of the hot gas path components in these machines. While such coatings are routinely used in high-performance aircraft engines and are becoming established in land-based turbines, the requirements of the ATS turbine application are sufficiently different that significant improvements in thermal barrier coating technology will be necessary. In particular, it appears that thermal barrier coatings will have to function on all airfoil sections of the first stage vanes and blades to provide the significant temperature reduction required. In contrast, such coatings applied to the blades and vances of advanced aircraft engines are intended primarily to reduce air cooling requirements and extend component lifetime; failure of those coatings can be tolerated without jeopardizing mechanical or corrosion performance. A major difference is that in ATS turbines these components will be totally reliant on thermal barrier coatings which will, therefore, need to be highly reliable even over the leading edges of first stage blades. Obviously, the ATS program provides a very challenging opportunity for TBC's, and involves some significant opportunities to extend this technology...|$|R

40|$|Broadcasting by {{flooding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental services for both wired and wireless networks. This also includes several sensor network applications that use broadcasting to spread information from one sensor node to the other sensor nodes in the entire sensor network. These wireless sensor networks have certain characteristics such as limited power and battery driven. However the simple flooding mechanism causes lots of duplicated packets and consumes a lot of resources. In view of these constraints, the broadcasting service should reduce redundant transmissions such that energy conservation is obtained since the devices within a wireless sensor network have limited battery power. Since it is not necessary for each sensor node to be active all the time a more sophisticated method might be introduced to flood an entire network and the other side is more efficient. In this work, an asynchronous sleep scheduling is proposed by an adapted duty cycle for each sensor where the duty cycle is based on the RSS based density estimation for each sensor node. By using the <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle the reachability is compared with that of the fixed duty cycle and the adapted duty cycle by using neighborhood discovery density estimation model.
