40|$|This paper {{describes}} a virtual networking approach for Grids called ViNe. It enables symmetric connectivity among Grid resources and allows existing applications to run unmodified. Novel {{features of the}} ViNe architecture include: easy virtual networking administration; support for <b>physical</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> and support for multiple independent virtual networks in the same infrastructure. The requirements of an application-friendly virtual network environment are presented and it is shown how the proposed solution meets them. Qualitative arguments are provided to justify all design decisions. Also presented is an experimental evaluation of the round-trip latencies and bandwidths achieved by a reference implementation. Measurements are reported for WAN-scenarios involving three different institutions. Under favorable conditions, ViNe bandwidths are within 90 to 100 % of the available physical network bandwidth. 1...|$|R

50|$|A virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) extends a <b>private</b> <b>network</b> {{across a}} public network, and enables users to {{send and receive}} data across shared or public {{networks}} as if their computing devices were directly connected to the <b>private</b> <b>network.</b> ("In the simplest terms, it creates a secure, encrypted connection, which {{can be thought of}} as a tunnel, between your computer and a server operated by the VPN service.")

40|$|As {{internet}} usage grows exponentially, {{network security}} issues become increasingly important. Network security measures {{are needed to}} protect data during transmission. Various security controls are used to prevent the access of hackers in networks. They are firewall, virtual <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> and encryption algorithms. Out of these, the virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> plays {{a vital role in}} preventing hackers from accessing the <b>networks.</b> A Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> (VPN) provides end users with a way to privately access information on their network over a public network infrastructure such as the internet. Using a technique called “Tunneling”, data packets are transmitted across a public routed network, such as the internet that simulates a point-to-point connection. Virtual <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> provide customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. The basic structure of the virtual circuit is to create a logical path from the source port to the destination port. This path may incorporate many hops between routers for the formation of the circuit. The final, logical path or virtual circuit acts {{in the same way as}} a direct connection between the two ports. Our proposed Provisioning Restorable Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm (PRA) is used to combine the provisioning and restoration algorithms to achieve better results than the ones obtained by independent restoration and provisioning. In order to ensure service quality and availability in Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks,</b> seamless recovery from failures is essential. The quality of service of the Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> is also improved due to the combination of provisioning and restoration. The bandwidth sharing concept is also applied in link to improve the quality of service in the Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network.</b> The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in terms of cost, the number of nodes, the number of VPN nodes, delay, asymmetric ratio and delay with constraints with Disjoint Path Algorithm and Approximation Restoration Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm.

40|$|This paper explores a {{wide range}} of {{opportunities}} for the interworking of the ATM signaling and routing mechanisms of B-ISUP/BICI-based public and PNNIbased <b>private</b> broadband <b>networks.</b> A spectrum of interworking scenarios is presented that ranges from simple virtual PVC tunneling to evolution of the public network to include PNNI capabilities. 1. Introduction The ATM Forum recently released the PNNI Version 1. 0 [1] specification for a new network signaling and routing protocol for use at the interface between two <b>private</b> <b>network</b> switches.

40|$|For proper {{operation}} of today's large digital <b>private</b> <b>networks,</b> high quality synchronization must be achieved. A general telecommunication performance {{objective is to}} maintain long-term frequency accuracy of ten parts per trillion at all synchronous digital equipment in the network. Many times, however, this is not achieved in <b>private</b> <b>networks.</b> Low quality clocks, errored transmission facilities, and incorrectly designed synchronization plans are often cause for poor performance. It is shown that properly-designed <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> can operate with long term frequency averages between ten parts per trillion to ten parts per million. These performance levels can adversely impact customer applications. The most demanding applications are digital and voice band data, encrypted voice, facsimile, and video. In a typical <b>private</b> <b>network</b> operating at 0. 01 parts per million, the user would experience reduced data throughput, dropped encrypted calls, unreadable facsimile pages, or interrupted video transmission dozens of times per day. The major contribution to poor <b>private</b> <b>network</b> synchronization performance is the interaction of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) clocks and the network facilities used to distribute timing. The performance of typical CPE clocks and facilities, {{and their impact on}} customer applications, are discussed. CPE clock performance issues, along with <b>private</b> <b>network</b> architectural constraints, make synchronization planning extremely difficult. Planning is usually costly and requires specialized expertise...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Wireless {{clients are}} usually placed into private address realm (<b>private</b> <b>network)</b> in the Internet. The {{clients in the}} private address realm are able to {{communicate}} {{to each other in}} the same <b>private</b> <b>network,</b> and using special boxes (NAT boxes) the clients can also communicate to the public internet. This solution “hides ” the wireless clients from the outside public internet world: they are unreachable from the outside world, or from other <b>private</b> <b>networks.</b> In special situations the requirement of the direct connection between two wireless clients (located in different <b>private</b> <b>networks)</b> may occur. One widely used solution for this kind of problem is the special configuration of the NAT boxes (called “port forwarding”), but also there are many cases, where the NAT box configuration is not allowed (e. g...|$|R
40|$|A virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) is a <b>private</b> <b>network</b> {{that has}} been {{constructed}} over a shared, public infrastructure such as Frame Relay, an ATM network, or the Internet. It is considered virtual {{because it does not}} require a separate physical network, but instead it is a logical network, one of possibly many logical networks, that make use of a single physical network. It is considered a <b>private</b> <b>network</b> because a VPN can ha ve its own separate addressing and routing scheme to interconnect devices that need to communicate. A VPN is designed so that only devices supposed {{to communicate with each other}} can do so. For instance, a VPN can be the network infrastructure that provides communication between the corporate headquarters, branch offices, mobile users, suppliers, and customers, while ensuring that unwanted devices cannot gain access to this <b>private</b> <b>network.</b> Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> (VPNs) is not a new concept for the European Research & Education community.
