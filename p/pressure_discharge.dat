Also, this expanded operating regime is more relevant to new generations of industrial plasma reactors being used by the microelectronics industry.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> on the {{performance}} of the trans-critical CO 2 heat pump with a low gas-cooler outlet temperature is experimentally investigated on a test rig of water source heat-pump water heater. The optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> of the trans-critical CO 2 heat pump is investigated under different external operation conditions. When the tap-water temperature is low, the characteristic of the S-shape isotherm at the supercritical region has little effect on the occurrence of the optimal discharge pressure; while the mass flow rate of CO 2, the suction pressure and the gas-cooler outlet temperature {{play a significant role in}} determining the emergence of the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b> At the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> the COP reaches the peak; however, the corresponding heating capacity is still lower than its maximum, which is reached as the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> is slightly above the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b> Reducing the tap-water flowrate or increasing the water-source temperature can increase the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b> The COP is positively dependent on both the tap-water flowrate and the water-source temperature.

40|$|Abstract: Even in {{the absence}} of {{self-acting}} valves, flow through the discharge port of a twin screw compressor is oscillatory in nature. This unsteady but periodic flow variation at the discharge port excites the pressure pulsation, which is the main source of noise and vibration. In this paper, a mathematic model based on the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations is established to describe the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation, which considers the effects of friction and heat transfer between the gas and the pipe. The boundary conditions of the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation model are given in detail. The two-step Lax–Wendroff scheme is applied to solve the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations. In order to verify the theoretical analysis, the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsations under various working conditions are measured and compared. It is shown that the model established in this paper is a useful tool to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the <b>pressure</b> pulsation in <b>discharge</b> pipe. It is found that the most important factor that affects the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation is the pressure difference between the pressure upstream of the discharge port in the compression chamber and the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>discharge</b> line someway downstream. The minimum fluctuation occurs when the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> is equal to the pressure corresponding to the built-in volume ratio.
