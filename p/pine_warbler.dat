60|$|Now as {{the time}} of these migrations is the season of storms, {{especially}} the autumnal one, which nearly coincides with the hurricanes of the West Indies and the northerly gales of the coast of America, the migrating birds are very liable to be carried out to sea. Sometimes they may, as Mr. Jones suggests, be carried up by local whirlwinds to a great height, where meeting with a westerly or north-westerly gale, they are rapidly driven sea-ward. The great majority no doubt perish, but some reach the Bermudas {269} and form one of its most striking autumnal features. In October, Mr. Jones tells us, the sportsman enjoys more shooting than at any other time. The violent revolving gales, which occur almost weekly, bring numbers of birds of many species from the American continent, the different members of the duck tribe forming no inconsiderable portion of the whole; while the Canada goose, and even the ponderous American swan, have been seen amidst the migratory host. With these come also such delicate birds as the American robin (Turdus migratorius), the yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroeca coronata), the <b>pine</b> <b>warbler</b> (Dendroeca pinus), the wood wagtail (Siurus novæboracensis), the summer red bird (Pyranga æstiva), the snow-bunting (Plectrophanes nivalis), the red-poll (Ægiothus linarius), the king bird (Tyrannus carolinensis), and many others. It is no doubt in consequence of this repeated immigration that none of the Bermuda birds have acquired any special peculiarity constituting even a distinct variety; for the few species that are resident and breed in the islands are continually crossed by individual immigrants of the same species from the mainland.|$|E

40|$|Evaluating bird {{population}} trends requires baseline data. In North America the earliest population data available are {{those from the}} late 1960 s. Forest conditions in the northern Great Lake states (U. S.

We propose pre-Euro-American settlement as an alternative baseline for assessing changes in bird populations. We evaluated the amount, quality, and distribution of breeding bird habitat during the mid- 1800 s and early 1990 s for three forest birds: the <b>Pine</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Dendroica pinus), Blackburnian Warbler (D. fusca), and Black-throated Green Warbler (D. virens). We constructed models of bird and habitat relationships based on literature review and regional data sets of bird abundance and applied these models to widely available vegetation data. Original public-land survey records represented historical habitat conditions, and a combination of forest inventory and national land-cover data represented current conditions. We assessed model robustness by comparing current habitat distribution to actual breeding bird locations from the Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas. The model showed little change in the overall amount of <b>Pine</b> <b>Warbler</b> habitat, whereas both the Blackburnian Warber and the Black-throated Green Warbler have experienced substantial habitat losses. For the species we examined, habitat quality has degraded since presettlement and the spatial distribution of habitat shifted among ecoregions, with range expansion accompanying forest incursion into previously open habitats or the replacement of native forests with pine plantations. Sources of habitat loss and degradation include loss of conifers and loss of large trees. Using widely available data sources in a habitat suitability model framework, our method provides a long-term analysis of change in bird habitat and a presettlement baseline for assessing current conservation priority...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{landscape}} pattern caused {{by changes in}} forest management, namely the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), {{and the implications of}} these structural changes on landscape processes were analyzed. Landscape structure was studied based upon the comparison of landscapes with different management histories. Ecological processes were analyzed based upon simulation of stand and landscape attributes of habitats for several vertebrate species and upon simulation of hydrological processes such as water and sediment yield. A methodology to integrate landscape and stand pattern and dynamics with landscape processes was developed for this work. It integrates a forest landscape structure model, several stand level growth and yield models, vertebrate habitat models, and a hydrological model. The comparisons among landscapes revealed that forest management has a strong influence on landscape structure. The SFI program increases fragmentation of the landscape indicated by the presence of more and smaller patches, more edges, more complex shapes, and less and smaller core areas. Traditional intensive and extensive management show comparable patterns characterized by high aggregation and connectivity. Landscapes managed according to the SFI program show higher Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) values for American woodcock, American beaver, wild turkey, fox squirrel, and gray squirrel. HSI is higher for <b>pine</b> <b>warbler</b> in the landscape not managed according to the SFI program. Downy woodpecker and barred owl present very reduced HSI values in either landscape. The SFI program induced fragmentation of the habitat of <b>pine</b> <b>warbler</b> and the establishment of narrow and elongated habitats in a network structure for the remaining species. Both patterns are determined by SMZs. The scenario representing management according to the SFI program presents higher sediment yield at the watershed level than the scenario representing management not according to the SFI program due to higher channel erosion related to the absence of buffer strips in the non-SFI scenario. In general, management according to the SFI program increases landscape diversity and evenness, habitat suitability for most species, potential vertebrate diversity, and provides habitat structure suitable for most species. This management also decreases sediment loss at the watershed level...|$|E
40|$|Cluster subdivisions were {{designed}} to protect open space in response to rapid rates of conventional development. One of the proclaimed benefits of preserving open space within cluster subdivisions is the provision of habitat for native wildlife, but this has rarely been evaluated. This study examined songbird response {{to the amount of}} land protected within cluster subdivisions in Rhode Island (USA). We selected 11 sites along a gradient based on the relative amount of land protected within a site (% land under a conservation easement; %CE). We used nonparametric multivariate statistics to compare songbird communities between protected and developed areas within subdivisions and regression analyses to relate bird abundance and community metrics to %CE. Songbird communities differed significantly between protected and developed areas within cluster subdivisions. Songbird richness and diversity both peaked between 73 - 74 %CE, while densities of forest interior and human intolerant species increased with increasing %CE. Ovenbird, Veery, and <b>Pine</b> <b>Warbler</b> most typified high %CE sites and were found most often in protected areas far from development edges. This study demonstrates that cluster subdivisions need to preserve approximately 70 - 75 % of the original undeveloped parcel of land in order to maximize songbird diversity. A higher percentage should be preserved in large contiguous blocks to further benefit forest interior species. This suggests that proposed regulations that require Rhode Island subdivisions to protect at least 50 % of a parcel’s buildable land may not be adequate to enhance bird diversity or preserve species that depend on large contiguous blocks of forest interior habitat. </p...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{harvesting}} practices frequently {{result in}} simplification {{of the structure}} and composition within managed forest stands in comparison to their natural counterparts. In particular, loss of heterogeneity within stands may pose a problem for maintaining biodiversity in perpetuity. In this study, we survey breeding bird diversity and abundance in response to different spatial harvesting patterns in mature red pine forests located on the Chippewa National Forest of northern Minnesota, USA. Treatments are designed to increase structural complexity over time and include three overstory manipulations (dispersed retention, aggregate retention with small gaps, and aggregate retention with large gaps), one understory manipulation (brush removal), and controls (no harvesting, and/or no brush removal). In 2003, the first breeding season following the harvest, we found little difference in bird community composition between control and treatment stands. In 2005, the third breeding season following harvest, avian abundance, richness, and diversity were all greater within treatments. Species associated with edge, shrub, and early successional habitats generally show positive response to treatments (e. g. Chestnut-sided Warbler [Dendroica pensylvanica], Mourning Warbler [Oporornis philadelphia], Chipping Sparrow [Spizella passerine]), as do some species associated with mature forest (e. g., <b>Pine</b> <b>Warbler</b> [Dendroica pinus], Rose-breasted Grosbeak [Pheucticus ludovicianus]). Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) were more abundant in control stands. There are, as of yet, no discernable differences in avian community composition among the three overstory treatments or between the single understory treatment and the understory control, but differences are expected as the treatments diversify due to understory development. While overstory retention harvests provide habitat for a diverse and abundant bird community, the temporal divergence in avian community composition that we observed between treatment and control stands reveals the importance of uncut, mature red pine forest {{as a component of}} a biodiverse landscape...|$|E
40|$|We {{predicted}} that bird diversity and abundance of some bird species would be higher in old-growth stands than in mature pine stands {{because of the}} greater structural diversity in old growth. We also {{predicted that}} patch size of stands should be influential. To test these predictions, we modeled counts of 79 bird species from 52 stands in 5 regions {{in the province of}} Ontario, Canada in relation to habitat at the local and landscape extents. Neither total species richness nor abundance differed between stand types. No significant difference was found in bird assemblages between stand types using ordination analysis. However, more Neotropical migrants were found in old-growth stands than in mature stands, while the reverse was true for short-distance migrants. Twenty-five species had higher counts in old-growth stands - three significantly so: Brown Creeper Certhia americana, Northern Parula Setophaga americana, and Scarlet Tanager Piranga olivacea. Supercanopy pine (> 60 cm dbh) was a significant (P 40 cm/dbh) was a significant positive predictor for Brown Creeper, <b>Pine</b> <b>Warbler</b> Setophaga pinus, and total species richness. The density of supercanopy and medium/large pine explained a small but significant amount of variation in bird assemblages (1 %), after considering age, other tree variables (9 %), and landscape metrics. Patch size was significant for Evening Grosbeak Coccothraustes vespertinus and total abundance. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) thresholds, Brown Creeper required a minimum of 62 stems/ha of medium/large pine. Pileated Woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus and Black-throated Green Warbler required a minimum of 14 and 23 stems/ha of supercanopy pine, respectively. Blackburnian Warbler Setophaga fusca required a minimum stand age of 66 years. Current targets in shelterwood seed cuts for pine appear to be just within range for Brown Creeper - at least for the first cut, but not for subsequent cuts. We recommend that forest management seek to emulate increased old-growth characteristics in a proportion of managed stands that fall within the range of variation expected under natural variation...|$|E
40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} mild with {{most parts of}} the state at least somewhat dry. The most interesting avian phenomena were a major incursion of White-winged Crossbills and a warm-up in late January which resulted in several waterfowl species putting in very early appearances. Because of the latter, it was difficult to assess the status (wintering or migrant) of birds reported in late January to early February from major reservoirs and waterfowl concentration spots without some information on ice conditions. Thanks to Larry Einemann, I had detailed information about ice conditions at Branched Oak L, but I would appreciate a few notes on other reservoirs during the winter. Jan Johnson pointed out that my reporting of records from the Wakefield School feeders that she maintains did not make it clear that these feeders are in fact in Wayne County, as are the southern 3 blocks of the town. My apologies; I believe (hope) that this may only be a problem in the Winter 2000 - 2001 report, recently published in Nebraska Bird Review.

40|$|Undergraduate Research Exper. As our climate {{continues}} to change, {{the range of}} suitable habitats for many species will be in flux, which along with changes in many biotic and abiotic factors will bring about changes in migratory behavior. This has already been seen for many species of birds, which have begun migrating shorter distances and even halting migration entirely as necessary resources become available year-round. Behavioral differences between migratory and non-migratory populations of birds have been observed for some species, particularly in song repertoire size and sharing. As a way to predict how vocal behavior and patterns will change {{as a result of}} climate change, comparisons can be made between populations of pine warblers, a wood-warbler unique for the presence of migratory behavioral plasticity, with migratory populations in the northern United States and Canada, and non-migratory populations in the southern United States. Due to the absence of previous studies on <b>pine</b> <b>warbler</b> song behavior, the patterns and variation across populations was assessed to provide good baseline data with which to make future comparisons. In the assessment of two migratory populations of pine warblers in northern Michigan, I found birds to possess relatively small repertoires, singing an average of three songs each. These songs could be categorized as “first” and “second” category songs, with characteristics similar to other wood-warblers. However, the use of these songs differed dramatically from what was expected, as birds sang both first and second category songs throughout the day, showing quite unique behavior for a wood-warbler. In an analysis of song variation across a population, I found that neighbors were not significantly more likely to share songs than non-neighbors. In a comparison of note repetition rates with frequency ranges, I found a very tightly clumped distribution, falling quite close to a theoretical vocal performance limit. Though the small repertoire size and low levels of song sharing observed in this population agree with predictions about migratory songbirds, the use of first and second category songs as well as vocal performance show interesting differences from other wood-warblers that would benefit from further study. The observations collected in this study will help greatly in the study of behavioral differences in migratory and non-migratory populations, and could give great insight into the potentially farreaching behavioral consequences of climate change...|$|E

Brown, Kearney WOOD DUCK CARRYING EGG. On 24 April 1987, Gail Roebuck was hiking along the north Stream Trail in Fontenelle Forest and heard Wood Duck calls. She {{looked up to see}} the female carrying something in her bill. The Duck dropped the object {{along the edge of the}} trail, and Gail went over to investigate. The 20 -foot fall hadn’t even broken the egg Gail found. —Ruth C. Green, Bellevue MORE ON THE DESOTO EIDERS. The summer 1987 issue of Iowa Bird. Life (57 : 88) has about a page and a half of comments, four photographs, and four drawings of the eiders seen at DeSoto last winter (NBR 54 : 10 and 81). The Iowa records committee accepted them both as King Eiders. SWAINSON’S HAWKS. On 28 September 1986 we were traveling east on a gravel road 3 miles south and 2 miles west of Coleridge, Cedar County. In a 28 -minute period from 4 : 48 to 5 : 14 PM we observed a total of 166 Swainson’s Hawks flying out of the north-northwest into the south-southeast. —Dave and. Lois Stage, Laurel PRAIRIE GROUSE. Over the weekend of 11 and l 2 April 1987 Bill Huser, Jerry Probst, and I traveled to Center, Nebraska, to observe Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) and Greater Prairie-Chickens (T 2 ̆ 7 ympanuchus cupido) which were reported to be in the area. —Randall D. Williams, Sioux City, Iowa WHOOPING CRANE REPORT. The Fish and Wildlife Service office in Grand Island has released the record of Whooping Crane sightings in Nebraska in the spring of 1987. WINTERING KILLDEER. On 17 January 1987 John Manning and I saw a hardy, healthy Killdeer in a pasture that had a spring-fed pond and open water. —Duane Wolff, Norfolk CRESCENT LAKE NESTING RECORDS. The first known production of White-faced Ibis on Crescent Lake NWR was recorded in 1987 with not one but two successful nests discovered on Smith Lake. Refuge personnel documented and photographed a total of seven young. —Royce R. Huber, Refuge Manager, Ellsworth BLAIR BACKYARD BIRDING. On 22 August 1987 my father spotted a Ruby-throated Hummingbird in our backyard, and soon after that I saw two Wilson’s Warblers. Later on I saw another warbler, bluish-gray above and yellow below, prominent eye-ring, a hint of a band across the breast, and yellow feet, so I decided it was a Canada Warbler. And later the same day I saw about twenty Empidonax flycatchers and four more Wilson’s Warblers. And a week later we had a small warbler in our bird bath. The bird had very prominent wingbars, yellow below, light brown above, and when it flew it had white on the outside and around the tail like a Vesper Sparrow. We figured it to be a <b>Pine</b> <b>Warbler.</b> —Joel Jorgensen, Blair BLUEBIRD NEST BOXES. In 1985, Boy Scout Troop 18 of Gering made 150 bluebird nesting boxes as a conservation project and in honor of scouting’s 75 th anniversary. In the early spring the Boy Scouts, along with members of the Wildcat Audubon Society, placed 115 of these nesting boxes in the Wildcat Hills south of Gering as a Mountain Bluebird trail. —Alice Kenitz, Gering LEWIS’ WOODPECKER DOESN 2 ̆ 7 T QUALIFY. The Bill Lemburgs saw a Lewis’ Woodpecker from US 83, within the Waterfowl Refuge, on their way home from the 1987 Annual Meeting. It was just a little after noon, and so outside the official count period. ONE OF OUR COWBIRDS IS MISSING. All winter long three Cowbirds, one male and two females, were staying in my one feedlot. On cold days they would huddle on the back of a fat heifer. The cow and birds both looked content. Then on 20 January 1987 a Cooper’s Hawk showed up, slowly moving over and around the cattle. Since then only the male and one female are around. —Duane Wolff, Norfol...|$|E
