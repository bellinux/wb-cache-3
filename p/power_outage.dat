The storm brought heavy rainfall and wind gusts {{of up to}} 55mph (90km/h), causing a three-hour <b>power</b> <b>outage</b> in Valdosta and downing several trees. Across the state, King produced $250,000 in damage (1950USD) and caused one death.|$|E
50|$|According to Pacific Gas & Electric, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 100 - 150 <b>power</b> <b>outages</b> each year due to metallic balloons. These <b>power</b> <b>outages</b> affect thousands of customers statewide and are costly to repair.

A total of 680people in the Marianas Islands sought shelter during the storm. One flight was cancelled, and three others were diverted.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a <b>power</b> <b>outage.</b>|$|E

There, 2000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters. The hurricane's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, yet sparing the island from damaging winds. Rain from Hurricane Dean flooded several roads throughout Puerto Rico, {{and there was}} heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, a 3-hour <b>power</b> <b>outage</b> {{caused by}} testing of new {{distribution}} circuits affected seven major factories producing material for World War II. These included the Grumman plant in Bethpage and the Republic Aviation plant in Farmingdale, where workers staged an impromptu baseball game {{while they waited}} for power to return. Local hospitals and Mitchel Field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power. Although sabotage was not suspected, it caused the colonel in charge of civilian protection for Nassau County to request that the Army guard the power station.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread <b>power</b> <b>outage</b> cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{widespread}} in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, where the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In {{some parts of the}} country, electricity was cut off for up to six days straight. Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while Luzon suffered an island-wide <b>power</b> <b>outage.</b> Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and Bicol Region. Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{fears of}} a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, which devastated the island group the {{previous}} year, officials issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches while seven shelters were opened, though few people actually used these shelters. On Oahu, a <b>power</b> <b>outage</b> was reported, affecting 2,400 customers. Jellyfish also stung 50 people. Locally heavy rainfall and rough seas led to minor damage while strong winds lead to extensive damage {{on the north side}} of the island. On Maui and Kauai, minor flooding, as well, though damage was minimal. Offshore, one person is presumed to have died in a shipwreck. In a separate shipping incident, three crewmen were slightly injured. The remnants of Gil later affected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where near-gale force winds were measured. Throughout the state, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} as a {{tropical}} cyclone, Ewiniar affected Yap and Palau, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, Guam. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5feet (1.5m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide <b>power</b> <b>outage</b> in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The total amount of damage caused {{was estimated to be}} just over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E
40|$|With the {{expansion}} of China's power system, {{there are more and}} more factors contributing to Large-area <b>Power</b> <b>Outages.</b> The snow disaster that hit Southern China in 2008 caused serious damages to the power systems, which made Chinese government realize that they cannot solely depend on power enterprises to effectively control the risk involved in power system. The Chinese government needs to collaborate with power enterprises in strengthening Electricity Regulation and taking countermeasures to reduce the risk of Large-area <b>Power</b> <b>Outages.</b> This paper first proposes an objective, practical and adaptive Electrical Security Risk Assessment System based on Electricity Regulation. The system consists of an assessment process with 278 indices, which are used to calculate the risk of Large-area <b>Power</b> <b>Outages</b> by the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Delphi Method. Then, an example of Guangdong power system serves to illustrate the detailed implementation procedures of the proposed assessment system and the results show that Guangdong power system faces a moderate risk of Large-area <b>Power</b> <b>Outages.</b> Finally, some countermeasures are proposed to overcome the defects in the existing power system.
