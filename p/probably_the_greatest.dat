It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|In 1965 Tom Kabu {{became the}} first Papuan Bahá'í. Approximately twenty Papuans became Bahá'ís in Port Moresby {{immediately}} after Kabu who were from the Baimuru area. Kabu traveled among many villages presenting the religion. Yale University professor Charles Forman analyzed religious trends across the Pacific Islands and attributes what he termed the surprising growth of the Bahá'í Faith across Micronesia was partly due to {{a certain amount of}} response from some youths of wider experience and education as well as from some village folk among whom Bahá'ís settled. <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> single increase, in his view, came in 1966 with this effort as Kabu was a leader of an important modernising movement in the Purari River area of Papua. Kabu died in 1969 from tuberculosis after being sick about a year.|$|E

25|$|McMillan did {{enough to}} earn {{selection}} for the Commonwealth Bank ODI series in Australia. On 21 January 2007 he made 89 against Australia. A month later, he scored a blistering hundred off just 67 balls, {{which is the}} fastest by any Kiwi player. His Gladiator-like efforts {{set the stage for}} a whopping 3–0 series win against Australia, and also the 2nd highest successful run chase in ODI history. Chasing a massive 346, at one stage New Zealand were 41 for 4 and with Fleming, Vincent, Taylor and Styris gone, looked well and truly out of the game. Craig McMillan's amazing innings kept their hopes alive and resulted in <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> comeback by a team in ODI history. New Zealand managed to win with 1 wicket and 3 balls left.|$|E
25|$|After the {{retirement}} of Doug Wright, Eric Hollies and Roly Jenkins, together with the disappearance from the county scene of Bruce Dooland and Gamini Goonesena, Greenhough stood as the last county leg spinner of any standing {{in an era when}} overgrassed pitches and bowling tactics changing rapidly from the enterprising attack of the 1940s to rigid containment rapidly removed this style of bowling from prominence. Greenhough had nothing like the spin of Wright or Jenkins, but could disguise his googly exceptionally well, although he bowled from a quite long run-up for a slow bowler. During 1959 and 1960, Greenhough formed an extremely valuable complement to Brian Statham – at the time <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> post-war English bowler – but for the remainder of his career a succession of injuries, and form lapses, prevented him reaching the potential those two seasons suggested.|$|E
25|$|Frik du Preez is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> Northerns hero of all heroes. The Springbok {{lock and}} flank {{was not only}} a {{dazzling}} player on the field, but was equally popular off the field. Together with his close friend, Mof Myburgh, both played a total of 109 matches for the Northern Transvaal. Du Preez and Myburgh were inseparable, and Myburgh also proved to be a hero of note. Despite being rather short for a lock, Du Preez's line-out work was practically unequalled and his powerful sprints struck fear in the hearts of his opposition, while he also kicked for posts for the Springboks and Northern Transvaal and put away some magnificent drop goals. How popular he was, even outside Pretoria, is apparent from {{the fact that he was}} carried, shoulder high, off the field after his last game at Newlands in Cape Town in a match that Northerns won by 25-14. Frik retired at the end of the 1971 season. Du Preez was nominated by the magazine SA Rugby as the South African player of the century, and was the first South African to be honoured, along with Dr Danie Craven, in the International Hall of Fame in Auckland, New Zealand.|$|E

From the ganglia and the commissures where they join, nerves run to the lophophore, the mantle lobes and the muscles that operate the valves. The edge of the mantle has <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> concentration of sensors. Although not directly connected to sensory neurons, the mantle's chaetae probably send tactile signals to receptors in the epidermis of the mantle. Many brachiopods close their valves if shadows appear above them, but the cells responsible for this are unknown. Some brachiopods have statocysts, which detect changes in the animals' position.|$|E
500|$|The {{persecution}} of the Jews in Hungary soon became well known abroad, unlike {{the full extent}} of the Holocaust. At the end of May 1944, George Mantello publicized two important reports. One of the reports was probably Rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl's five-page abridged version of the 33-page Auschwitz Protocols: both the Vrba–Wetzler report and Rosin-Mordowicz report. The reports described in detail the operations of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. The second was a 6-page Hungarian report, that detailed the Ghettoization and deportation of 435,000 already deported Hungarian Jews, updated to 19 June 1944, town by town, to Auschwitz. The report's publication resulted in Winston Churchill's letter: [...] "There is no doubt that this {{persecution of}} Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...." ...|$|E
500|$|Keogh was a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} sport; {{he was accused of}} [...] "playing stiff" [...] in a match against Queensland but the allegations were dismissed, however in 1891 he was banned from rugby due to a separate incident where he was found to have gambled at the game. He was reinstated in 1895, but by this time his rugby career was over. Despite having never played for New Zealand, his reputation was such that in 1917, when discussing the declining standards of New Zealand rugby's back-play, an anonymous former representative player wrote that Keogh [...] "was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods." [...] Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending much of the last 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E

500|$|In 1746, a {{group of}} {{publishers}} approached Johnson with an idea about creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language. A contract with William Strahan and associates, worth 1,500 guineas, was signed {{on the morning of}} 18 June 1746. Johnson claimed that he could finish the project in three years. In comparison, the Académie Française had forty scholars spending forty years to complete their dictionary, which prompted Johnson to claim, [...] "This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman." [...] Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years, he did manage to finish it in eight. Some criticised the dictionary, including Thomas Babington Macaulay, who described Johnson as [...] "a wretched etymologist," [...] but according to Bate, the Dictionary [...] "easily ranks {{as one of the greatest}} single achievements of scholarship, and <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> ever performed by one individual who laboured under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time." ...|$|E

According to the New York Times obituary, [...] "it was estimated after Mr. Rockefeller retired from business that he had accumulated close to $1,500,000,000 out of the earnings of the Standard Oil trust and out of his other investments. This was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> amount of wealth that any private citizen had ever been able to accumulate by his own efforts." [...] By the time of his death in 1937, Rockefeller's remaining fortune, largely tied up in permanent family trusts, was estimated at $1.4 billion, while the total national GDP was $92 billion. According to some methods of wealth calculation, Rockefeller's net worth over the last decades of his life would easily place him as the wealthiest known person in recent history. As a percentage of the United States' GDP, no other American fortune — including those of Bill Gates or Sam Walton — would even come close.|$|E

[...] While rugby writer Terry McLean wrote of Keogh in 1987 that he was [...] "one of those rare birds of rugby, the genuine 'freak'." [...] A correspondent for Christchurch paper The Sun, lamenting a perceived decline in back play, wrote in 1917 that Keogh [...] "was <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods. Neither opponents nor spectators {{knew what he was}} going to do next. He was the first player to bounce the ball on the head of an opponent on a line-out, catch it, and streak down the field. He was an adept in kneeing the ball over the head of an opposing player; he feinted, he hurdled, he kicked; his play was never the same two minutes together." [...] While a teammate of Keoghs from the Natives, George Williams, said in 1925 that he had never seen Keogh's equal. William McKenzie, known as [...] "Off-Side Mac", who played 20 matches for New Zealand in the 1890s, said of Keogh in 1910: [...] "Keogh is {{regarded as the}} trickiest and most brilliantly attacking back ever turned out of the New Zealand school." ...|$|E
