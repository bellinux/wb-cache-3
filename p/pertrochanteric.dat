30|$|<b>Pertrochanteric</b> {{fractures}} {{are common}} problems in elderly patients. Operative stabilization permits early mobilization and minimizes complications of prolonged recumbency [1]. Stable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures are preferably fixed by sliding hip screws [2, 3, 4]. In general, {{for the treatment}} of unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures, two options exist: extramedullary or intramedullary stabilization [5]. Each device has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of extramedullary fixation, such as dynamic hip screw (DHS), is the relatively simple, safe and forgiving surgical technique [5]. The DHS remains the implant of choice because of its favourable results and low rates of non-union or hardware failure [2, 3, 4], but the complication rates of the DHS are higher in unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures; despite the widespread use of the DHS, cut-out rates of 5 – 17  % {{have been reported in the}} literature [3, 6, 7, 8]. The most common mode of failure of a DHS is cut-out of the lag screw from the femoral head [9, 10] followed by lift-off of the plate from the femur [3, 4, 11]. Wolfgang et al. [12] reported a 19  % mechanical and technical complication rate with unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures treated with sliding hip screw device. Moreover, osteoporosis, associated with <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures in elderly patients, also presents a problem for stable osteosynthesis of the fracture [13].|$|E
30|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{many patients}} with <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures are unsuitable for treatment by conservative means or by conventional open reduction and internal fixation [4]. Moreover, {{the treatment of}} basicervical fractures, as with very proximal <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures or low-neck fractures, has been controversial. Biomechanical studies suggest that basicervical fractures may be best treated similarly to <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures rather than to neck fractures [1, 6, 19]. For the elderly patients the treatment of choice for <b>pertrochanteric</b> or basicervical fractures is surgical because non-operative treatment involves high morbidity and mortality compared to surgical treatment [8, 15, 16, 24]. Moreover, the general condition of these patients is often poor due to the accompanying cardio-vascular, pulmonary, and in Egypt, liver diseases. In the majority of geriatric patients, walking ability is limited before the fracture, and co-existing anaemia and malnutrition make significant intra-operative blood loss intolerable [13]. A surgical procedure that achieves minimal surgical blood loss, short operative and hospitalisation time, minimal anaesthetic risk, the least morbidity and mortality rates, and early weight bearing is favoured [20]. This {{study was conducted to}} assess using the AO tubular external fixator in the management of both <b>pertrochanteric</b> and basicervical fractures in high-risk elderly patients.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{osteomyelitis}} following {{treatment of}} <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures is rare, management {{can be difficult}} and often results in several physical and economic difficulties.

30|$|Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation of <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures is a treatment ‘gold standard’, but the {{morbidity and mortality}} rates are high in elderly patients with significant co-morbid factors. Despite the differences in fracture stability, {{it is recommended that}} basicervical fractures are treated similarly to <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures rather than to transcervical fractures [6, 19]. Nonoperative treatment involves prolonged immobilisation and hospitalisation, with many concomitant problems and high mortality [3]. Obtaining a perfect reduction of the <b>pertrochanteric</b> fracture may not be the main objective for this high-risk group but to operate with the least blood loss in the shortest time and an anaesthetic technique of low risk, which ultimately facilitates early mobilisation in the postoperative period [20].|$|E
30|$|The average {{patient with}} <b>pertrochanteric</b> {{fracture}} presents numerous comorbidities which {{may contribute to}} the finding of elevated preoperative IL levels.|$|E
30|$|The best {{treatment}} for unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures remains controversial. The diversity of fixation devices available {{for treatment of}} unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures illustrates the difficulties encountered in the actual treatment. Intramedullary devices have mechanical and biological advantages in such fractures [20]. The dynamic hip screw (DHS) remains the implant of choice because of its favourable results and low rate of non-union or hardware failure [2], but complication rates of the DHS are higher in unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures; despite {{the widespread use of}} the DHS, cut-out rates of 5 – 17  % {{have been reported in the}} literature [3, 6, 7, 8]. The DHS is often linked to a high incidence of therapeutic failure in patients with <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures and a severe degree of osteoporosis [1, 11, 13]. Complications have been associated with cut-out of lag screw from femoral head predominantly, particularly in unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures [3, 21]. Most mechanical failures involve progressive varus deformity at the fracture site. This may increase tension on the side plate screws, leading to failure of screw–bone interface. The side plate pull-out has been reported in patients with severe osteoporosis [4, 11]. The majority of patients (n =  41) in the present study had osteoporosis, and only 4  % patients had fixation failure. No patient had a side plate pull-out in the present study, which may be attributed to the concept of a locking side plate. Strauss et al. [15] reported that the biomechanical advantages seen with helical blade fixation of the femoral head compared to sliding hip screw designs may be useful in managing fractures in patients with poor bone quality. We, as a consequence of this review, are also of the opinion that the dynamic helical hip system (DHHS) is a reliable alternative in stabilization of osteoporotic <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures.|$|E

Between 1978 and 1984, 157 patients 70 years of age and over were treated at our clinic for fresh unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> hip fractures. Fifty-five patients had internal fixation. Because of the high incidence of mechanical complications, the long spherostem endoprosthesis became the treatment of choice between 1980 and 1984. Thus, 102 patients were treated with this type of arthroplasty. They were compared with the 55 patients treated with osteosynthesis, and we concluded that: (1) in comparison with osteosynthesis, the procedure of endoprosthetic replacement is no more extensive and the mortality is no higher; (2) the incidence of mechanical complications is significantly lower in the endoprosthesis group; (3) even if the dynamic hip screw is now the treatment of choice for <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures, the long spherostem endoprosthesis is still indicated in arthrotic hip fractures {{or in the case of}} reintervention after implant failure. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Intramedullary nailing of <b>pertrochanteric</b> femoral {{fractures}} {{has grown}} in popularity over the past 2 decades likely because this procedure {{is associated with a}} low risk for postoperative morbidity and a fast recovery of function. The evaluation of outcomes associated with <b>pertrochanteric</b> nailing has mainly been based on objective measures. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to correlate patients’ health-related quality of life results after intramedullary nailing of <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures with objective outcome measures. Methods We conducted a single-center study including 62 patients (mean age 80 [*]±[*] 10 years) with <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures treated with a Gamma 3 Nail. Health related quality of life was measured using the Short Form- 36. These results were compared to both US and Austrian age and sex-adjusted population norms. The objective outcome measures studied at one year postoperatively included Harris Hip Score, range of motion, leg length, body mass index, neck-shaft angle and grade of osteoarthritis. Results According to the Harris Hip Score 43 patients (67 %) had excellent or good results. There was no significant difference in the average neck-shaft angle comparing affected hip to non-affected hip at 12 months postoperatively. The average osteoarthritis score, for both the injured and uninjured hip, did not differ significantly. We found significant differences between the bodily pain, social functioning and mental health subscales and two summary scores of the Short-Form 36 in comparison to Austrian population norms. Complication rate was 8 %. Conclusions The results of this study confirm that intramedullary nailing with the use of a Gamma Nail is a safe treatment option for stable and unstable <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures. Despite good functional and radiographic results we noticed a substantial fall off in patients’ quality of life up to 12 months after operation. </p...|$|E

METHODS: 165 elderly patients who sustained a <b>pertrochanteric</b> 31. A 1 or 31.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The PerCutaneous Compression Plate (PCCP) was {{developed}} by Gotfried (Israel, Haifa) for minimal-approach osteosynthesis of <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures. METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients, aged 60 or more, with intertrochanteric fractures (AO type 31 A 1 or 31 A 2) were selected randomly for fixation with either the PCCP (53 patients) or the Dynamic Hip Screw (62 patients). All surviving patients were scheduled for a 1 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Less invasive surgical stabilization of <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures with the PCCP resulted in shorter theater and surgical time and reduced postoperative pain. The PCCP treatment showed a tendency toward a lower transfusion need and a reduction of fracture impaction; however, results were not statistically significant.

40|$|Background: Intramedullary hip nails, which {{combine the}} {{advantages}} of intramedullary fixation with those of a sliding screw, should diminish the incidence of complications after osteosynthesis of the <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures. Despite less mechanical failures, this has not happened. However, some new specific complications have occured. In this retrospective study of the <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures treated with IMHS nail, the author is analysing the importance of experience {{and the impact of}} »learning curve« on incidence of complications. Methods and results: Between March 1996 and July 1999 65 patients with 65 non-pathologic <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures were operated with IMHS nail. Thirty-one were operated in 1996 / 97 (Group I), thirty-four later on (Group II). Between the groups there were no differences in demographic characteristics, types of fractures, used material or outcome. Twelve out of 65 patients (eight from Group I, four from Group II) had at least one complication. In five patients there was a crack of femoral diaphisis. In two reduction of the fracture was insufficient. In another two the hip screw protruded into the joint. One fracture dislocated secondarely. Three patients had infection. One non-union of the femoral neck showed after removal of the nail 2. 5 years postinjury. Stratified statistical analysis showed that Group I had signifficantly more mechanical complications (insufficient reduction, hip screw protrusion, secondary dislocation), whereas differences between the groups in femur cracks, infection and non-union were insignificant.

40|$|Background: Animal {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{the efficacy of the}} use of bisphosphonates to enhance screw fixa-tion in bone. In this prospective, randomized study of <b>pertrochanteric</b> fractures treated with external fixation, we tested whether systemic administration of bisphosphonates would improve the fixation of hydroxyapatite-coated screws implanted in osteoporotic bone. Methods: Sixteen consecutive patients with a <b>pertrochanteric</b> fracture were selected.

Exclusion criteria included bisphosphonate treatment during the two-year period prior to the fracture. Fractures were fixed with a <b>pertrochanteric</b> fixator and four hydroxyapatite-coated pins. Two pins were implanted in the femoral head (pin positions 1 and 2), and two were placed in the femoral diaphysis (pin positions 3 and 4). The patients were ran-domized either to therapy with alendronate for a three-month postoperative period (Group A) or to no therapy (Group B). The Group-A patients received an oral dose of 70 mg of alendronate per week. The fixators were removed after three months. Results: All of the fractures healed, and no loss of reduction, nonunion, or delayed union was observed. The com-bined mean extraction torque (and standard deviation) of the pins implanted at positions 1 and 2 (cancellous bone...|$|E
