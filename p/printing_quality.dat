40|$|Abstract � Printability {{of paper}} is a multidimensional concept {{consisting}} of runnability and <b>print</b> <b>quality.</b> The lack of definition for <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> makes printability rather ambiguous. In this {{paper we discuss}} the measurability of the high-level printability and <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> and present {{an interpretation of the}} measurements of low-level <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> related characteristics as information channels about highlevel concepts. This enables the construction of a layered model in which the information provided by measurements is propagated to infer about higher level concepts of quality, eventually supporting decision making. As an example, we present a case study of low-level <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> defects caused by the small-scale measurable properties of the paper, and consider the meaning of this process from the viewpoint of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} an {{understanding}} of the factors affecting <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> in inkjet <b>printed</b> textiles and discusses tools for quantifying <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> in these textiles. Cotton fabrics with different fabric structures, yarn sizes, yarn types, and surface treatments were printed on a commercial desktop inkjet printer. <b>Print</b> <b>quality</b> (PQ) analyses were performed using an automated <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> analysis system to quantify quality attributes including line width, image noise, optical density, tone reproduction and CIELab color. Wicking tests were also conducted to elucidate the correlation between the observed <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> and the wicking behavior of the fabric structure. An image processing technique was developed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> measurements and minimize the “noise ” introduced by the structure of the fabric. The results of this study provide some insight into the relationship between structure and printability in inkjet printing of textile fabrics. The efficacy of the automated PQ analysis instrument used is also demonstrated...|$|R

500|$|Ejler Jakobsson's tenure {{began with}} a large backlog of stories that Pohl had acquired, but {{within a year or}} two {{substantial}} changes were apparent. [...] In the early 1970s, Jakobsson attempted to update Galaxys image, adding a comic strip, [...] "Sunpot", by Vaughn Bodé, for example. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the regular book reviewer in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not manage to give Galaxy a new and distinctive character: [...] "Sunpot" [...] lasted only four issues, Sturgeon's reviews were undistinguished, and many of the new authors he published have been, in the words of Mike Ashley, [...] "mercifully unknown ever since". [...] The paper quality and <b>printing</b> <b>quality</b> also dropped, and early cover designs were very weak. [...] Jakobsson initially printed guest editorials rather than writing his own; when he took over the editorial page his work was unremarkable. [...] However, he did manage to attract some of the new writers who were just becoming well known in the sf scene, including George R.R. Martin, Joe Haldeman, and Joanna Russ. [...] Three novels published in Jakobsson's Galaxy won awards: Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves and Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama each won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, in 1972 and 1973 respectively, and Robert Silverberg's A Time of Changes won the Nebula in 1971.

If not properly controlled, ink/media interactions, in particular ink sorption, can result in unacceptable degradation in <b>print</b> <b>quality,</b> directly affecting machine readability. Several commercially available aqueous inkjet inks and several recycled and regular envelopes were tested by conventional methods and by ultrasonic attenuation. In this case study, we printed a selected set of envelope papers at low speed (office {{inkjet printing}}) with carefully designed test patterns and performed a statistical analysis to correlate <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> attributes and machine readability. <b>Print</b> <b>quality</b> attributes were measured according to ISO- 13660 definitions, which are well suited for automated measurement.

40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{methods are}} increasingly being used to solve real-world problems in the society. Often, {{the complexity of the}} methods are well hidden for users. However, integrating machine learning methods in real-world applications is not a straightforward process and requires knowledge both about the methods and domain knowledge of the problem. Two such domains are colour <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> assessment and anomaly detection in smart homes, which are currently driven by manual monitoring of complex situations. The goal of the presented work is to develop methods, algorithms and tools to facilitate monitoring and understanding of the complex situations which arise in colour <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> assessment and anomaly detection for smart homes. The proposed approach builds on the use and adaption of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Novel algorithms for computing objective measures of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> in production are proposed in this work. Objective measures are also modelled to study how paper and press parameters influence <b>print</b> <b>quality.</b> Moreover, a study on how <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> is perceived by humans is presented and experiments aiming to understand how subjective assessments of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> relate to objective measurements are explained. The obtained results show that the objective measures reflect important aspects of <b>print</b> <b>quality,</b> these measures are also modelled with reasonable accuracy using paper and press parameters. The models of objective  measures are shown to reveal relationships consistent to known <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> phenomena. In the second part of this thesis the application area of anomaly detection in smart homes is explored. A method for modelling human behaviour patterns is proposed. The model is used in order to detect deviating behaviour patterns using contextual information from both time and space. The proposed behaviour pattern model is tested using simulated data and is shown to be suitable given four types of scenarios. The thesis shows that parts of offset lithographic printing, which traditionally is a human-centered process, can be automated by the introduction of image processing and machine learning methods. Moreover, it is concluded that in order to facilitate robust and accurate anomaly detection in smart homes, a holistic approach which makes use of several contextual aspects is required.

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a common}} printing method in the packaging field. The printing method is characterized primarily by the flexible printing plate and the low viscosity inks which make it suitable for use on almost any substrate. The object {{of this study was}} to obtain further knowledge of the some important mechanisms of flexographic printing and how they influence the <b>print</b> <b>quality.</b> The thesis deals with printing primarily on board and liner but also on newsprint with water-borne ink using a full-scale flexographic central impression (CI) printing press. Several printing trials have been performed with a focus on the chemical interaction between the ink and substrate and the physical contact between the ink-covered printing plate and the substrate. Multicolour printing exposes the substrate to water from the water-containing ink. The emphasis was to investigate the relation between <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> and water-uptake of the paper surface with heat and water. Printing trials was carried out on substrates possessing a hydrophobic, and also a rather hydrophilic surface using a regular commercial water-borne ink. The favorable effect which water or surfactant solution had on the hydrophobic substrate with regard to print mottle could depend on its surface compressibility in combination with the hydrophobic nature of its surface that could affect the wetting properties. Conventional printing involves physical contact between plate and ink and between ink and substrate. A method for measuring the dynamic nip pressure using thin load cells is presented. <b>Print</b> <b>quality</b> was influenced by the plate material. A correction procedure taking into account the size of the sensor was developed in order to estimate the maximum dynamic pressure in the printing nip. An attempt was made to identify essential mechanical and chemical parameters, and also geometrical properties of the plate that affected <b>print</b> <b>quality.</b> Laboratory <b>printing</b> trials were carried out and a multivariate analysis was applied for evaluation of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> data.
