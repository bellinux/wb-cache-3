40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} the statics and dynamics of face packing seals, {{in which one}} of the sealing rings is made of elastic sealant. The study involved analyzing the axial vibration of the flexible ring for two configurations of its housing in the seal and determining the frequency characteristics and the condition of maintaining face-to-face contact between the sealing rings with considerably different elastic properties subjected to two types of external excitations. The derived analytical relationships were verified using a calculation example for real operating conditions of face <b>packing</b> <b>seal</b> in the pump...|$|E
40|$|Large rotary {{processors}} such like rotary dryers, rotary calciners and kilns {{are difficult}} to seal properly because of their large diameter, their low precision methods of fabrication and their severe operating conditions. Those factors result in several types of imperfection at the sealing surface. This work explores the possibility to seal large rotary processors to positive pressure up to 1 atmosphere (14. 7 psig). First, an extensive theoretical analysis combined with on-site measurements evaluation was conducted to quantify the magnitude of each type of surface imperfection at the seal location. Against these results, the current typical seals used in the industry were evaluated and compared. The seals that featured compressed packing seals seem to show great possibility as they are already used in successful positive pressure large seal arrangement. A typical <b>packing</b> <b>seal</b> arrangement with a stuffing-box was studied thoroughly {{in order to understand}} its particularities. The data collected and calculated in the previous steps was gathered and settled the new seal requirements. A new seal arrangement is proposed and it features as principal characteristics: radial compression and adaptive flexible housing. Based on the stuffing-box available mathematical relations, the equations are re-evaluated to account for the new radially oriented arrangement. Meanwhile, a test rig is designed and built to measure the seal performance and observe its behaviour. The effect of several parameters can be studied such as temperature, gas pressure, magnitude of sealing surface imperfection, magnitude of radial compression and drum rotation speed. Finally, tests are conducted and the results are discussed {{in order to make a}} recommendation for the possible industrial application. In the light of this study the new proposed seal meets or surpasses the industrial application requirements. The performance of the full scale 1. 952 m (76. 875 in) seal are projected as follow; a leak rate of 114 ml/sec (0. 24 scfm) at 0. 69 MPag (10 psig), 4 kW (5 HP) of power loss in friction, half a year of longevity before maintenance and a deformations absorption greater than 3. 15 mm (0. 125 in) in the radial direction...|$|E

40|$|Biological {{evidence}} with forensic interest may {{be found}} in several cases of assault, being particularly relevant if sexually related. Sexual assault cases are characterized by low rates of disclosure, reporting, prosecution, and conviction. Biological evidence is sometimes the only way to prove the occurrence of sexual contact and to identify the perpetrator. The major focus of this review is to propose practical approaches and guidelines to help health, forensic, and law enforcement professionals to deal with biological evidence for DNA analysis. Attention should be devoted to avoiding contamination, degradation, and loss of biological evidence, as well as respecting specific measures to properly handle evidence (i. e., selection, collection, <b>packing,</b> <b>sealing,</b> labeling, storage, preservation, transport, and guarantee of the chain custody). Biological evidence must be carefully managed since the relevance of any finding in Forensic Genetics is determined, in the first instance, by the integrity and quantity of the samples submitted for analysis.
