40|$|In this paper, we {{contrast}} the value-belief-norm (VBN) {{model and the}} theory of planned behavior (TPB) {{for the first time}} regarding their ability to explain conservation behavior. The participants represent a convenience sample of 468 university students. Using survey data and adopting <b>previously</b> <b>established</b> <b>compound</b> measures, structural equation analyses revealed a remarkable explanatory power for both theories: TPB’s intention accounted for 95 % of people’s conservation behavior and VBN’s personal norms accounted for 64 %. Compared to the VBN model, the TPB covered its concepts more hlly in terms of proportions of explained variance. More importantly, the fit statistics revealed that only the TPB depicts the relations among its concepts appropriately, whereas the VBN model does not...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{structure}} of three <b>previously</b> <b>established</b> lead <b>compounds,</b> fifteen selected chalcones were synthesized and evaluated for their multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal activity on mouse lymphoma cells. The most active chalcones were stronger revertants than the positive control, verapamil. In the model of combination chemotherapy, the interactions between the anticancer drug doxorubicin and two of the most effective compounds were measured in vitro, on human MDR 1 gene transfected mouse lymphoma cells, showing that the type of interaction for one of these compounds was indifferent while that for the other one was additive. Furthermore, two chalcones inhibited 50 % of cell proliferation in concentration of around 0. 4 [*]μg/mL and were from 2 - to 100 -fold more active than the most chalcones. The structure-activity relationships were obtained and discussed in view of their usefulness for the design of chalcone-like P-gp modulators and drugs able to treat resistant cancers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} protocols for the preparation of both pyrrolo[1, 2 -c]pyrimidine and pyrrolo[1, 2 -c]pyrimidin- 5 (4 aH) -one libraries. These sequences were used to synthesise analogs, which will be examined for their kinase inhibitory levels. In Chapter One, {{a brief overview of}} how these scaffolds emerged as potent kinase inhibitors and an overview of previous strategies used for their synthesis is described. Chapter Two covers investigations into the synthesis of the pyrrolo[1, 2 -c]pyrimidin- 5 (4 aH) -one core using <b>previously</b> <b>established</b> methodology, where the key step is a metal-catalysed cycloisomerisation reaction. However, it was <b>established</b> that <b>compounds</b> containing thiomethyl groups at the C 1 position could not be used for the substitution with amino groups. Efforts to prepare the chloro-substituted scaffold are described. In Chapter Three, <b>previously</b> <b>established</b> methodology using ionic hydrogenation was applied to prepare the pyrrolo[1, 2 -c]pyrimidine core. This process proved to be low-yielding. A reliable and more efficient procedure was developed, which involves cyclisation of vinyl-substituted derivatives. With access to the scaffold, substitution of the thiomethyl group at C 1 with amines was investigated. A brief summary of the work described in this thesis and potential future studies is given in Chapter 4. Full experimental procedures are included in Chapter 5...|$|R
