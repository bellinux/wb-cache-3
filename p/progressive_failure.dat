5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which <b>progressive</b> <b>failure</b> {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that delayed intensive care unit (ICU) transfer is associated with increased mortality for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, ICU admission policies and patient epidemiology vary widely across the world depending on local hospital practices and organizational constraints. We hypothesized that the time from the onset of CAP symptoms to invasive mechanical ventilation could be a relevant prognostic factor. METHODS: One hundred patients with a CAP and necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation were included. Prospectively collected data were retrospectively analysed. Two study groups were identified based on the time of the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (rapid respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation within 72 h of the onset of CAP and <b>progressive</b> respiratory <b>failure</b> requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 4 or more days after the onset of CAP). RESULTS: Excepting more COPD patients in the rapid respiratory failure group and more patients with diabetes in the <b>progressive</b> respiratory <b>failure</b> group, these patients had similar characteristics. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 28 % in the rapid respiratory failure group and 51 % in the <b>progressive</b> respiratory <b>failure</b> group (P = 0. 03). The ICU and the day 30 mortality rates were higher in the <b>progressive</b> respiratory <b>failure</b> group (47 % vs. 23 %, P = 0. 02; and 37. 7 % vs. 21. 3 %, P = 0. 03; respectively). After adjusting for the propensity score and other potential confounding factors, <b>progressive</b> respiratory <b>failure</b> remained associated with hospital mortality only after 12 days of invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the duration or delay in the time to intubation from the onset of CAP symptoms was associated with the outcomes in those patients who ultimately required invasive mechanical ventilation...|$|R

Abusing the switch mechanism to hold the contacts in a transition state, or severely overloading the switch, will heat and thus anneal the spring, reducing or eliminating the [...] "snap action" [...] of the switch, leading to slower transitions, more energy dissipated in the switch, and <b>progressive</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, {{aging is}} seen as a <b>progressive</b> <b>failure</b> of homeodynamics-systemic {{preservation}} of homeostasis, involving genes for maintenance and repair, stochastic events leading to molecular damage and molecular heterogeneity, and chance events determining the probability of death. Since complex and interacting systems of maintenance and repair comprise the homeodynamic space of a biological system, aging {{is considered to be a}} progressive shrinkage of homeodynamic space mainly due to increased molecular heterogeneity. [...] In 2013, a group of scientists defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication.|$|E
