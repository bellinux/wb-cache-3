25|$|Poppyseed oil {{has been}} used for {{painting}} for at least 1500 years—one of the oldest known oil paintings, found in caves of Afghanistan and dated to AD 650, was likely drawn using poppyseed oil. It is most often found in white paints, and as a varnish. Painters prepared poppyseed oil by hand until the late 19th century, when oil paints became available prepared in tubes. While poppyseed oil does not cause as much yellowish tinting of paints as linseed oil, it dries slower and is less durable than linseed oil because the fat responsible for the yellowing also provides durability. <b>Perilla</b> <b>oil,</b> which causes yellow tinting even more than linseed, is even more durable than linseed.|$|E

Titration analysis shows that the free fatty acids in an oil oxidation process were more affected by relative humidity than temperature, whereas peroxides in an oil oxidation process were more significantly affected by temperature than relative humidity for the two different environments in this study. Also, the prediction results of ANN models for both acid and peroxide values were the highest among the developed models.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether the fatty acid composition could make a significant contribution to the oxidation stability of vegetable oils marketed in Korea. Ten kinds, 97 items of vegetable oils that were produced in either an industrialized or a traditional way were collected and analyzed for their fatty acid composi-tions and lipid oxidation products, in the absence or presence of oxidative stress. Peroxidability index (PI) calcu-lations based on the fatty acid composition ranged from 7. 10 to 111. 87 with the lowest value found in olive oils and the highest in <b>perilla</b> <b>oils.</b> In the absence of induced oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA), the secondary lipid oxidation product, was generated more in the oils with higher PI (r= 0. 890), while the tendency was not observed when the oils were subjected to an oxidation-accelerating system. In the presence of the oxidative stress, the <b>perilla</b> <b>oils</b> produced in an industrialized manner generated appreciably higher amounts of MDA than those produced in a traditional way, although both types of oils presented similar PIs.

A significant difference in the generation of LTC 4 was observed between the two groups after different dietary supplementations for 4 weeks (P < 0. 05).

50|$|In Japan, <b>perilla</b> <b>oil</b> was {{important}} for fueling oil lamps until early 16th century, before it was overtaken by rapeseed oil. The oilseed contains drying oil elements and was imported in bulk {{as a substitute for}} linseed oil into the United States from Japan, until the supply was interrupted by war.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to elucidate the effect of <b>Perilla</b> frutescens fixed <b>oil</b> on experimental esophagitis in albino rats. A group of rats (n= 6), treated with control vehicle (0. 9 % NaCl in double distilled water, 3 [*]mL/kg, i. p.) and <b>Perilla</b> frutescens fixed <b>oil</b> (100 %) (1, 2, and 3 [*]mL/kg, i. p.), or pantoprazole (30 [*]mg/kg, i. p.), were subjected to pylorus and forestomach ligation. Animals were sacrificed after 6 [*]h and evaluated for the gastric pH, volume of gastric juices, total acidity, esophagitis index and free acidity. Esophageal tissues were further subjected to estimations of TBARS, GSH, catalase, and SOD. Treatment with fixed oil significantly inhibited the gastric secretion, total acidity, and esophagitis index. The oil also helped to restore the altered levels of oxidative stress parameters to normal. The present study also makes evident the in vitro antihistaminic and anticholinergic activity of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) (18 [*]:[*] 3, n− 3) on isolated rat ileum preparation. The lipoxygenase inhibitory, histamine antagonistic, antisecretory (anticholinergic), and antioxidant activity of the oil was attributed for its efficacy in reflux esophagitis...|$|R
50|$|GLA is {{categorized}} as an n−6 (also called ω−6 or omega-6) fatty acid, {{meaning that the}} first double bond on the methyl end (designated with n or ω) is the sixth bond. In physiological literature, GLA is designated as 18:3 (n−6). GLA is a carboxylic acid with an 18-carbon chain and three cis double bonds. It is an isomer of α-linolenic acid, which is a polyunsaturated n−3 (omega-3) fatty acid, found in rapeseed canola oil, soy beans, walnuts, flax seed (linseed <b>oil),</b> <b>perilla,</b> chia, and hemp seed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Response surface {{methodology}} (RSM) {{was used}} to optimize ultrasound-assisted aqueous enzymatic extraction (UAAEE) conditions for <b>perilla</b> seed <b>oil.</b> Under the optimum conditions—which were a liquid-to-solid ratio of 4. 4 : 1, a hydrolysis time of 2. 66 h, a hydrolysis temperature of 50. 87 °C and an ultrasound treatment time of 24. 74 min—an oil yield of 31. 34 % was obtained. Comparisons of the physicochemical characteristics of oil obtained using UAAEE with those of oil obtained by solvent extraction (SE oil) and cold pressing extraction (CPE oil) revealed similar refractive indices and saponification values, but UAAEE oil had a higher iodine value and better stability against oxidation, with a low peroxide value. UAAEE oil contained higher levels of beneficial α-linolenic acid and phenolics than SE oil or CPE oil, and it also had superior efficiency in scavenging 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals...|$|R
