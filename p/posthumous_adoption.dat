500|$|It {{may have}} been {{possible}} for the husband of an epikleros to allow the <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> of {{the son of an}} epikleros as the son of the epikleros' [...] father. This would prevent the inheritance of the newly adopted son of any property from his natural father, but it had the advantage of preserving the adoptee's oikos, commonly translated as [...] "household" [...] but incorporating ideas of kinship and property also. Although the preservation of the paternal oikos is usually felt to be the reason behind the whole practice of the epiklerate, the historian David Schaps argues that in fact, this was not really the point of the practice. Instead, he argues, that it was the practice of adoption that allowed the preservation of an oikos. Schaps feels that the reason the epiklerate evolved was to ensure that orphaned daughters were married. Other historians, including Sarah Pomeroy, feel that the children of an epikleros were considered to transmit the paternal grandfather's oikos. The historian Cynthia Patterson agrees, arguing that adoption may have seemed unnecessary, especially if the epikleros and her husband gave their son the name of the maternal grandfather. She argues that too much {{attention has been paid to}} the patrilineal aspects of the oikos, and that there was probably less emphasis on this in actual Athenian practice and more on keeping a household together as a productive unit.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Augustus, first Roman Emperor. His <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> by Julius Caesar {{elevated}} his plebeian gens Octavia to patrician status.

5000|$|Custom {{dictated}} that an emperor {{who was not}} an immediate descendant of the previous one should be adopted by the previous one, to maintain an unbroken line. Such a <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> of Zhu Houcong by the Hongzhi Emperor was proposed, but he resisted, preferring instead to have his father declared emperor posthumously. This conflict {{is known as the}} [...] "Great Rites Controversy." [...] The Jiajing Emperor prevailed and hundreds of his opponents were banished, flogged in the imperial court (...) , or executed. Among the banished was the poet Yang Shen.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, al-'As had Safahat min al-ayyam al-hamraa, a {{collection}} of his memoirs on the Great Syrian Revolt, published. The book was later republished by his grandson. From {{the perspective of the}} Ba'athist governments of Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad, al-'As's nationalist credentials are relatively strong, but he was not honored like some of the other prominent leaders of the revolt, such as Sultan Pasha al-Atrash or Hasan al-Kharrat. The reason behind this was the <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> of al-'As as a [...] "nationalist saint" [...] by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) of Antun Saadeh. The SSNP and the Ba'ath Party had an acrimonious relationship, and the former was banned in Ba'athist-run Syria.|$|E
5000|$|Roman {{nomenclature}} {{is somewhat}} {{different from the}} modern English form. Gaius, Iulius, and Caesar are Caesar's praenomen, nomen, and cognomen, respectively. In modern usage, his full name might be something like [...] "Gaius Iulius, the Caesar", where 'Caesar' denoted him {{as a member of}} the 'Caesarian' family branch of the 'Iulian' clan, and 'Gaius' was his personal name. Though contemporary writers sometimes referred to him as [...] "Gaius Caesar," [...] the name's historical usage was not the same as it is in the 21st century. His grand-nephew, Gaius Octavius, duly took the full name [...] "Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus" [...] upon his <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> in 44 BC, and the name became fused with the imperial dignity; in this sense it is preserved in the German and Bulgarian words Kaiser and Tsar (sometimes spelled Czar), both of which refer to an emperor.Compare the Hungarian, Slavic and Turkish words for [...] "king", forms of kral, all adapted from Karl, the personal name of Charlemagne.|$|E

5000|$|Redbird Smith's son Stokes {{objected to}} his father's known reverence for (but not worship of) Jesus and the <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> of Jesus into the Keetoowah Society in 1936. Stokes Smith {{rejected}} this position in 1955: [...] "A very weird thing happened, politically speaking, in 1955. It {{had to do}} with Jesus Christ's membership in the Keetoowah Society (and no, we are not making this up). The Nighthawks at the Redbird Smith Stomp Grounds were in civil strife. Stokes Smith, Redbird's youngest, was Chief. Before Redbird died, he told his people to incorporate the worship of Christ into Nighthawk religion. In 1936, the Keetoowah Society amended its constitution to recognized Christ. While Stokes had acquiesced and signed the measure, he and other elders were unhappy. William Lee Smith, current Nighthawk Chief at Stokes Smith's Grounds, says his father, Stokes, took the fire, wampum and pipe, and left the original grounds, but left part of the fire. The Redbird Grounds people then joined the UKB, realizing they could worship Christ and be Keetoowahs, and have the advantages of political recognition all at the same time, and God would not mind. Thereafter, Stokes' followers refused to recognize either the UKB or his other relatives at Redbirds, although Redbird is still an object of veneration. Some Keetoowah elders's say it was actually an adoption of Jesus into the Society and not an edict for the worship of Jesus.|$|E

40|$|AšuƗ/aşık/aşıq (from the Arabic `āshiq, or lover) is {{a skilled}} bard's {{composite}} performing art [...] a unity of prose narrations, songs, instrumental accompaniment, and appropriate gesture. Of sixteenth-century Turkic origin, the art {{spread over a}} vast area covering modern Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and further. In the mid-eighteenth century Sayat`-Nova, the best-known Armenian ašuƗ, was active in Tiflis (modern Tbilisi), the capital of Eastern Georgia. His songs were written {{in at least three}} languages [...] Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijani [...] and won praise for their ardent emotion and artistic perfection. But despite his importance in Near Eastern culture, two issues in Sayat`-Nova studies have rarely been studied. First, fully appreciating Sayat`-Nova requires contextualizing his work within the developing Armenian ašuƗ tradition and the international ašuƗ/aşık/aşıq tradition in the Near East. Second, the history of Sayat`-Nova studies as a field and its growing popularity in relation to twentieth-century Armenian nationalism and Soviet cultural policies demands attention as well. Focusing on these neglected issues will enable a richer understanding of Sayat`-Nova's place {{in the history of the}} ašuƗ/aşık/aşıq tradition as well as his relation to the elevated poetic traditions in South Caucasia, the Armenian ašuƗs’ contribution within the broader matrix of the early modern Turkic aşık/aşıq tradition, and the evolution of a distinct ašuƗ tradition in the Armenian language. At the same time, exploring his <b>posthumous</b> <b>adoption</b> as a cultural icon will provide insight into the history of scholarship and of mass culture both in South Caucasia and for Armenians worldwide...|$|E
