40|$|Emin {{provides}} {{experimental and}} theoretical {{graduate students and}} researchers with a distinctive introduction to the <b>principles</b> <b>governing</b> polaron science. The fundamental physics is emphasized and mathematical formalism is avoided. The book gives a clear guide to how different types of polaron form and the measurements used to identify them. Analyses of four diverse physical problems illustrate polaron effects producing dramatic physical phenomena. The {{first part of the}} book describes the <b>principles</b> <b>governing</b> polaron and bipolaron formation in different classes of materials. The second part emphasizes distinguishing electronic-transport and optical phenomena through which polarons manifest themselves. The book concludes by extending polaron concepts to address critical aspects of four multifaceted electronic and atomic problems: large bipolarons' superconductivity, electronic switching of small-polaron semiconductors, electronically stimulated atomic desorption and diffusion of light interstitial atoms. A distinctive introduction to the <b>principles</b> <b>governing</b> polaron science for experimental and theoretical graduate students and researchers...|$|R
