5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{working with}} Dr. Theodore Wadsworth, Todd gained {{permission}} {{to start a}} hospital near the present-day Farmington/Plainville border for smallpox inoculation. The facility, commonly called Hospital Rock, is found deep in the second-growth hardwood forest of Rattlesnake Mountain in Connecticut and was used from 1792-1794. Though the building is no longer present, the nearby rock ledge upon which <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> socialize remains. It was this rock that lent the facility its name. At this location, they could also receive mail and various packages.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that a physician only {{needs to do}} what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care). However, {{in the case of}} informed consent, the legal standard is more commonly defined as what a reasonable <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> elect to do if she is informed. So if a reasonable <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> want to be screened if only she is informed or if a reasonable <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> want to receive an amniocentesis if only she is informed of that option, then a physician is legally obligated to inform the patient of these options.|$|R

5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E

50|$|For early Unverricht-Lundborg disease <b>patients,</b> {{the disease}} <b>would</b> begin to {{progress}} early {{and lack of}} effective treatment meant a quick progression. In many cases the <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> require a wheelchair for mobility, and would die at a young age.|$|R
30|$|The average {{patient in}} this study had a BMI of 27, a uterus weight of 128  g, and no {{previous}} abdominal surgery. The OR time in this <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> have been 165  min {{in the case of}} a robot-assisted TLH or 174  min in a conventional TLH. If that same <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> have a prior abdominal operation, an extra 12.5  min would have to be added to the OR times in both robot-assisted and conventional TLH.|$|R
25|$|Several {{studies in}} the 1980s seemed to show a benefit of the {{increase}} in physiological information. Many reports showing benefit of the PA catheter are from anaesthetic, and Intensive Care settings. In these settings cardiovascular performance was optimized thinking <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> have supra-normal metabolic requirements.|$|E
25|$|A {{deficiency}} in folate may produce anemia {{similar to the}} anemia resulting from B12 deficiency. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B12 deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> still {{be at risk for}} neurological deficits associated with B12 deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.|$|E
25|$|After the insulin {{injection}} <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> experience various {{symptoms of}} decreased blood glucose: flushing, pallor, perspiration, salivation, drowsiness or restlessness. Sopor and coma—if the dose was high enough—would follow. Each coma would last {{for up to}} an hour and be terminated by intravenous glucose or via naso-gastric tube. Seizures sometimes occurred before or during the coma. Many would be tossing, rolling, moaning, twitching, spasming or thrashing around.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Northern California Kaiser Permanente {{initiated}} {{an in-house}} program for kidney transplantation. Prior to opening the transplant center, Northern California Kaiser <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> generally receive transplants at medical centers {{associated with the}} University of California (UC San Francisco and UC Davis). Upon opening the transplant center, Kaiser required that members who are transplant candidates in Northern California obtain services exclusively through its internal KP-owned transplant center.|$|E
25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} {{one can see}} why understanding of referred pain can lead to better diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{point out}} that the {{severity}} of psychiatric symptoms could easily result in an inappropriate referral to a psychiatrist prior to the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Consequently, undiagnosed hyperthyroidism sometimes results in inappropriate use of psychotropic medications; prompt recognition of hyperthyroidism (or hypothyroidism) through thyroid function screening is therefore recommended in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric symptoms. Naturally, the management of <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> be improved by collaboration between an endocrinologist and a psychiatrist.|$|E
30|$|To avoid {{contact with}} {{numerous}} unspecified individuals, the <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> {{be returned to}} the patient’s room upon awakening instead of being transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).|$|R

25|$|The cost of polio {{rehabilitation}} {{was often}} {{more than the}} average family could afford, and more than 80% of the nation's polio <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> receive funding through the March of Dimes. Some families also received support through philanthropic organizations such as the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine fraternity, which established a network of pediatric hospitals in 1919, the Shriners Hospitals for Children, to provide care free of charge for children with polio.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{research}} into the use of miR-122 as a biomarker for hepatitis C. While some studies dispute its efficacy for diagnosing Hep C, other research indicates that it may be useful in diagnosing specific forms of hepatitis. For instance, decreased levels of miR-122 have been linked to a strain of hepatitis C that is resistant to interferon therapy. In this case, measuring miR-122 levels in the bloodstream of hepatitis C positive <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> enable more accurate and personalized therapy for their disease.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing this}} news, Chard, Bromhead, {{and another of}} the station's officers, Acting Assistant Commissary James Dalton (of the Commissariat and Transport Department), held a quick meeting to decide {{the best course of}} action – whether to attempt a retreat to Helpmekaar or to defend their current position. Dalton pointed out that a small column, {{travelling}} in open country and burdened with carts full of hospital <b>patients,</b> <b>would</b> be easily overtaken and defeated by a numerically superior Zulu force, and so it was soon agreed that the only acceptable course was to remain and fight.|$|E
50|$|At {{the present}} time, {{preparing}} a <b>patient</b> for hypnosurgery <b>would</b> include having several 50-60 minutes’ sessions of hypnotherapy {{done by a}} hypnotherapist. Each individual session focuses on controlling the pain and relaxing the mind. The number of hypnotherapy sessions varies according to the patient and their susceptibility to hypnosis. Generally, the <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> be ready for hypnosurgery after 6 weeks of training.|$|R
50|$|Autonomic system {{dysfunction}} can occur; {{in such a}} case, the <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> {{complain of}} orthostatic dizziness, problems breathing, eye, bowel, bladder and cardiac problems. The patient may also present with a single cranial nerve or peripheral nerve dysfunction.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the single's release, misono {{took part}} in the weight loss reality program Girls meet Beauty. The program was a three-month {{duration}} in which the <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> closely monitor their calorie intake and increase their overall exercise regimen.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, Solimena et al. {{discovered}} that autoantibodies against GAD {{played a key}} role in SPS. Two years later, Solimena found the antibodies in 20 out of 33 patients examined. In the late 1980s, it was also demonstrated that the serum of SPS <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> bind to GABAergic neurons. In 2006, the role of GABARAP in SPS was discovered. The first case of paraneoplastic SPS was found in 1975. In 1993, antiamphiphysin was shown to play a role in paraneoplastic SPS, and seven years later antigephyrin was also found to be involved in the condition.|$|E
25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. These patients are described with having severe syntactical deficits, {{which means that they}} have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of these <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there are of course many possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Izzie's cancer storyline {{received}} a mixed {{response from the}} medical community. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, commented that Izzie's treatment options were unrealistic. Whereas in the show she was offered the drug interleukin-2, in reality the drug is never recommended to patients when melanoma has spread to the brain, as it can cause bleeding and strokes. Brawley explained that such <b>patients</b> <b>would</b> instead be offered radiosurgery. Conversely however, Tim Turnham, {{executive director of the}} Melanoma Research Foundation, praised Grey's Anatomy for bringing about greater public awareness of melanoma, stating: [...] "We welcome the national spotlight Grey's Anatomy has created for melanoma and its efforts to encourage viewers {{to learn more about the}} importance of prevention, early detection and research." ...|$|E
50|$|The duty to {{disclose}} {{is the first}} element. Then proof that <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> have chosen no treatment or a different course of treatment had the alternatives and risks been made known, thus establishing a causation. If the <b>patient</b> <b>would</b> have elected to proceed the element of causation is missing, and so too negligence. A causal connection between the patient’s injury and the doctor’s breach of a duty {{to disclose}} exists only when the disclosure of material risks {{would have resulted in}} a decision against it. The final element is that of an injury. The risk must have actually materialized, AND pl must have been injured as a result of submitting to the treatment.|$|R
40|$|A case of {{priapism}} following prolonged intravenous nutrition is reported.
