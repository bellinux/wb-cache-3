5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula,</b> NGC 4361. The nebula itself resembles a small elliptical galaxy and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.|$|E
5|$|The barred {{spiral galaxy}} NGC 7408 is located 3 degrees {{northwest}} of Delta Tucanae, and was initially mistaken for a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula.</b>|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> NGC 5189, {{estimated}} to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High quality {{spectrophotometric}} {{observations of}} 30 <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae</b> in the Galactic Bulge have been made. Accurate reddenings, plasma parameters, and abundances of He, O, N, S, Ar, Cl are derived. We find the abundances of O, S, Ar in the <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae</b> in the Galactic Bulge to be comparable with the abundances of the <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae</b> in the Disk, high abundances being maybe slightly more frequent in the Bulge. The {{distribution of the}} N/O ratio does not present in the Galactic Bulge <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae</b> the extension to high values that it presents in the Disk <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae.</b> We interpret this as a signature of the greater age of Bulge <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae.</b> We thus find the Bulge <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae</b> {{to be an old}} population, slightly more metal-rich than the Disk <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae.</b> The population of the Bulge <b>Planetary</b> <b>Nebulae</b> shows hence the same characteristics than the Bulge stellar population...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} radio {{continuum}} observations of unidentified IRAS point sources with far IR {{colors that are}} typical of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> These <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> candidates are located outside the Galactic bulge and observable from the southern hemisphere. The IR and radio properties of the observed and detected <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> candidates are discussed. We have detected 18 new <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> out of 89 observed candidates. These seem {{to belong to the}} class of small, radio-bright <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> with IR excess, primarily found within a few degrees of the Galactic plane. They appear to be quite young planetaries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present {{spectroscopy}} of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in M 32 and in {{the bulge}} of M 31 that we obtained with the MOS spectrograph at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our sample includes 30 <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in M 31 and 9 <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in M 32. We also ob-served one H ii region in the disk of M 31. We detected [O iii] 4363 in 18 of the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae,</b> 4 in M 32 and 14 in the bulge of M 31. We use our line intensities to derive electron temperatures and oxygen abundances for the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae...</b>|$|R
5|$|The post-asymptotic-giant-branch {{evolution}} is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant {{as the temperature}} increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionised into a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K, and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present day mass. The <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf.|$|E
5|$|Nicknamed the spare-tyre nebula, IC 5148 is a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis. Around 3000 light-years distant, it is {{expanding}} at 50 kilometres a second, {{one of the}} fastest rates of expansion of all planetary nebulae.|$|E
5|$|Pyxis lies in {{the plane}} of the Milky Way, {{although}} part of the eastern edge is dark, with material obscuring our galaxy arm there. NGC 2818 is a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> that lies within a dim open cluster of magnitude 8.2. NGC 2818A is an open cluster that lies on line of sight with it. K 1-2 is a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> whose central star is a spectroscopic binary composed of two stars in close orbit with jets emanating from the system. The surface temperature of one component has been estimated at as high as 85,000K. NGC 2627 is an open cluster of magnitude 8.4 that is visible in binoculars.|$|E
25|$|The central {{stars of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> are very hot. Only when a star has {{exhausted}} {{most of its}} nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size. <b>Planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> came {{to be understood as}} a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> are expanding. This led to the idea that <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|R
50|$|Only a {{minority}} of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> have WR type central stars, but {{a considerable number of}} well-known <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> do have them.|$|R
40|$|We present {{spectroscopy}} of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in M 32 and in {{the bulge}} of M 31 that we obtained with the MOS spectrograph at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

5|$|Sakurai's Object is {{surrounded}} by a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> created following the star's red giant phase around 8300 years ago. It has been determined that the nebula has a diameter of 44 arcseconds and expansion velocity of roughly 32km/s.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{runs through}} the constellation, {{featuring}} prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.|$|E
5|$|The {{globular}} cluster NGC 6584 lies near Theta Arae and is 45,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is an Oosterhoff type I cluster, and contains at least 69 variable stars, {{most of which}} are RR Lyrae variables. The <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> IC 4699 is of 13th magnitude and lies midway between Alpha and Epsilon Telescopii.|$|E
40|$|We examine {{recent studies}} on the {{formation}} rate of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> and find this rate to be {{about one-third of the}} formation rate of white dwarfs. This implies than only about one-third of all <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> that evolve to form white dwarfs are actually bright enough to be observed. This finding corresponds with the claim that it is necessary for a binary companion to interact with the asymptotic giant branch stellar progenitor for the descendant <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> to be bright enough to be detected. The finding about the formation rate also strengthens De Marco’s conjecture that the majority of observed <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> harbor binary systems. In other words, single stars almost never form observed <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} study of line widths in the [O 3]λ 5007 and Hα lines for {{a sample of}} 86 <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in the Milky Way bulge based upon spectroscopy obtained at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in the Sierra San Pedro Mártir (OAN-SPM) using the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph. The <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> were selected {{with the intention of}} simulating samples of bright extragalactic <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> We separate the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> into two samples containing cooler and hotter central stars, defined by the absence or presence, respectively, of the He 2 λ 6560 line in the Hα spectra. This division separates samples of younger and more evolved <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> The sample of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> with hotter central stars has systematically larger line widths, larger radii, lower electron densities, and lower Hβ luminosities. The distributions of these parameters in the two samples all differ at significance levels exceeding 99...|$|R
25|$|The central {{stars of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> are very hot. Their luminosity, though, is very low, {{implying}} {{that they must}} be very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size, and so <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> are expanding, and so the idea arose that <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|R
5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr) {{is a star}} in the {{constellation}} of Sagittarius. It is thought to have previously been a white dwarf that, {{as a result of a}} very late thermal pulse, swelled and became a red giant. It is located at the center of a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> and is believed to currently be in thermal instability and within its final shell helium flash phase.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> to be {{observed}} with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E
40|$|The high angular {{resolution}} and {{the capability of}} the space telescope to observe ultraviolet radiation are discussed in relation to investigating <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> The physical characteristics of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> particulary the abundances of the common light elements, the H 2 regions, the angular size, and the surface brightness are reviewed. Differences between supernova remants and <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> and H 2 regions are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> glow green, {{especially}} if they contain oxygen. These nebulae, or stars within them, {{may appear to be}} green stars. Some examples are the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> NGC 6572, NGC 6826 and NGC 7009.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} Galactic bulge <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> without emission-line central {{stars for}} which peculiar infrared spectra {{have been obtained}} with the Spitzer Space Telescope, including the simultaneous signs of oxygen and carbon based dust. Three separate sub-groups can be defined characterized by the different chemical composition of the dust {{and the presence of}} crystalline and amorphous silicates. We find that the classification based on the dust properties is reflected in the more general properties of these <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> However, some observed properties are difficult to relate to the common view of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> In particular, it is challenging to interpret the peculiar gas chemical composition of many analyzed objects in the standard picture of the evolution of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> progenitors. We confirm that the dual-dust chemistry phenomenon is not limited to <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> with emission-line central stars. Comment: 17 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
5|$|The <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> NGC 5315 has a {{magnitude}} of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. Bernes 145 {{is a dark}} and reflection nebula first listed in the 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12by5arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula.</b> In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens of billions of years, {{it is likely that the}} Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E

5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Gruis, is {{also known}} as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula</b> IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.|$|E
5|$|As a star's core shrinks, the {{intensity}} of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula.</b> If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object {{about the size of}} Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} <b>planetary</b> <b>nebula,</b> the measured velocity of expansion was much too large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
40|$|We present {{chemical}} abundances for <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> and H II {{regions in}} the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 based upon spectroscopy obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope using the Multi-Object Spectrograph. From these and similar data compiled from the literature for <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in the Magellanic Clouds, Sextans A, Sextans B, and Leo A, we consider the origin and evolution of the stellar progenitors of bright <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in dwarf irregular galaxies. On average, the oxygen abundance observed in the bright <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in these galaxies coincides with that measured in the interstellar medium, indicating that, in general, the bright <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> in dwarf irregulars descend primarily, though not exclusively, from stars formed in the relatively recent past. We also find that the ratio of neon to oxygen abundances in these bright <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> is identical to that measured in the interstellar medium, indicating that neither abundance is significantly altered {{as a result of}} the evolution of their stellar progenitors. We do find two <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae,</b> that in Sextans A and S 33 in NGC 6822, where oxygen appears to have been dredged up, but these are the exception rather than the rule. In fact, we find that even nitrogen is not always dredged up, so it appears that the dredge-up of oxygen is uncommon for the abundance range of the sample.

40|$|We are {{exploring}} {{the theory that}} binary central stars of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> are a contributing factor {{in the formation of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae.</b> We search for this photometric variability in central stars of <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> because consistent periodic variability is indicative of a close binary system. The variability of our targets is assessed with the image subtraction software, ISIS. We find that the central stars of the <b>planetary</b> <b>nebulae</b> (CSPNe) Hen 2 - 84 and NGC 6326 show variability. A preliminary light curve for Hen 2 - 84 shows periodic behavior, suggesting a binary system. Of the remaining targets observed, with sufficient data, seven do not appear to have substantial variability detected through ISIS and two targets have undeterminable variability...|$|R
