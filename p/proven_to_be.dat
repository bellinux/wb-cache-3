The landscape and {{a great number of}} notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{constructive}} {{proof of}} the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem [9] has been completed using the Coq proof assistant. Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primitive recursive. The weak axiom system <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essentially incomplete. In particular, Peano arithmetic <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R

5|$|Book Three: Change {{aired on}} short notice in June 2014 after Spanish-language {{versions}} of some episodes were leaked on the Internet. The season premiered with 1.5 million viewers.

5|$|Significant {{advances}} in astronomy came {{about with the}} introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> similar to the Earth's own Sun, but {{with a wide range of}} temperatures, masses, and sizes.|$|E
5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family has}} no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are {{understood to be}} due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry.

However, unlike Kubah, parts of Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk {{remained}} censored until 2003. Numerous novels dealing with G30S and the PKI, written by other authors, have also been published since Kubah.|$|E
30|$|Data {{collected}} for annual valuations {{of the estate}} provided much of the data. Previous estimates <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too low, and higher values have been substituted here.

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{found in}} Chinese literature, and archaeological evidence, show that {{cartography}} existed in China before the Han. Some {{of the earliest}} Han maps discovered were ink-penned silk maps found amongst the Mawangdui Silk Texts in a 2nd-century-BC tomb. The general Ma Yuan created the world's first known raised-relief map from rice in the 1st century AD. This date could be revised if the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang is excavated and the account in the Records of the Grand Historian concerning a model map of the empire is <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true.|$|E
5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} has <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the more}} complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis {{with at least}} two generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E

25|$|Compounding matters, Roosevelt's congenial Solicitor General, James Crawford Biggs (a {{patronage}} appointment {{chosen by}} Cummings), <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an ineffective {{advocate for the}} legislative initiatives of the New Deal.

5000|$|Rongorongo ( [...] ; Rapa Nui: [...] ) is {{a system}} of glyphs {{discovered}} in the 19th century on Easter Island that appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing or proto-writing. Numerous attempts at decipherment have been made, none successfully. Although some calendrical and what might <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> genealogical information has been identified, none of these glyphs can actually be read. If rongorongo does <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing and <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an independent invention, {{it would be one}} of very few independent inventions of writing in human history.|$|R
5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and Irish Sea, and more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") have <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controversial.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing {{did not reveal}} genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic {{studies have shown that}} the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.|$|E
5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> problematic and {{have yet to}} be definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 season <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{good start}} {{throughout}} the league. Louth qualified for the Division 3 Final where they faced Westmeath.
