25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a <b>pilot</b> <b>flame</b> safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{based on}} {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) was developed for the identifica-tion of the low-dimensional manifold of a chemical reacting system, the determination of its dimensionality and the selection of optimal manifold variables. Results are presented for a simple CO/H 2 /N 2 jet flame and for a CH 4 <b>piloted</b> <b>flame</b> (TNF Flame F). Results of the global PCA analysis (GPCA) on the whole data sets show that, in all cases, the number of modes required to reproduce the different state variables is a strong function of the physical processes by which the variables themselves are affected. As a result, a greater dimensionality is observed for the <b>piloted</b> <b>flame,</b> characterized by significant extinction. A local PCA (LPCA) algorithm, VQPCA, was also employed to reduce the effect of non-linear dependencies among state variables on the manifold dimension determination. By applying VQPCA, the data were divided into separated clusters, by using an unsupervised partitioning algorithm based on reconstruction error minimi-zation. Also, results from VQPCA were compared with those obtained with an approach based on mixture fraction conditioning (FPCA). Both approaches are comparable for the CO/H 2 /N 2 flame, while VQPCA performances are superior to FPCA for the CH 4 flame, due to its higher complexity...|$|R
40|$|Being able {{to ignite}} or reignite a {{gas turbine engine}} in a cold and rarified {{atmosphere}} is a critical issue for many manu-facturers. In the Vesta combustor of Turbomeca, 18 main burners are ignited by two <b>pilot</b> <b>flames.</b> The success of an ignition attempt depends on the completion of three steps. In a first step, a spark plug must ignite the fuel spray produced by each starting burner to generate the <b>pilot</b> <b>flames.</b> In a second step, these two flames must provide a sufficient amount of energy to initiate a stable combustion in the main burners located in their vicinity. Finally, the reactive zone must propagate from one main burner to its nearest neighbour until the whole chamber is ignited. These three steps are strongly influenced by the topology of the flow {{as well as the}} two-phase turbulent combustion phe-nomena. To represent properly the physics involved in such a complex and unsteady process, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) seems to be a powerful tool. This technique has been successfully applied to turbulent reactive flows (Selle et al. 1) and recently extended to two-phase combustion in gas turbines (Pascaud et al. 2). The numerical tool {{used in the present study}} couples an eulerian solver for the liquid spray with a LES solver for the gas flow. Thanks to the use of unstructured grids, it can be applied to complex geometries. This work focuses on the propagation of the flame from the starting burners to the whole chamber but not on the ignition of the starting burners themselves: the spray flame produced by the starting injector is simply replaced by a hot gases jet. First, two-phase flow calculations will be presented in which this jet ignites one isolated burner. Then, some results will be shown from a single-phase flow calculation done on the IBM supercomputer BlueGene/L- cited by TOP 500 as the world’s fastest machine- where the use of 2048 parallel processors have enabled to start computing on the full combustor domain (i. e. 18 main injectors + 2 <b>pilot</b> <b>flames).</b> Report number: TR/CFD/ 05 / 7...|$|R

40|$|Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is now {{recognized}} as an efficient numerical tool to predict gaseous combustion in industrial burners, {{and a number of}} examples of applications {{can be found in the}} literature. In these examples, the accuracy and the predictive capacity of LES are clearly demonstrated, even for unsteady phenomena. However most industrial burners are fed with liquid fuel and require the description of droplets dispersion, evaporation and burning. The presence of liquid fuel strongly modifies the fuel vapor distribution in the chamber, leading to different flame ignition and stabilisation processes, as well as different flame structures. Extending the LES technique to two-phase reacting flow is therefore crucial to capture and predict the behavior of such burners. This has been done in the code AVBP, coupling an eulerian solver for the liquid spray with a LES solver for the gas flow. This approach allows to work on unstructured grids and therefore to calculate the flow in complex geometries. In the present paper, the main steps of the extension of LES to two-phase flow are described and an example of validation is given.

The current methodology is applicable to both premixed combustion and diffusion- dominated regions without assumption regarding the inclusion of the chemistry. Results show that the current method can accurately capture the stratified premixed flame mode near the burner exit as well as the diffusion-dominated flame far downstream.

The unsteady non-adiabatic NO submodel provided excellent agreement with measured NO distribution in comparison to the appreciably overpredicted distribution by its steadyc ounterpart. T he strategyo f non-adiabaticf lamelet model in conjunctionw ith unsteady non-adiabatic NO submodel seems to provide an accurate and robust alternative to the conventional strategy of steady flamelet model with steady NO submodel. While addressing the limitations of steady flamelet model in regard to radiation and slow chemistry of NO is one objective of this research, extending the applicability of the model to partially premixed combustion has been pursued as the second objective. Flamelet/progress variable (FPV) approach based combustion models, which have the potential to describe both non-premixed and partially premixed combustion, have been incorporated in the in-house RANS and LES codes. Based on the form of the PDF for reaction progress variable, two different formulations, FPV- 8 function model and FPV-P function model, have been derived. (Continues [...] .).
