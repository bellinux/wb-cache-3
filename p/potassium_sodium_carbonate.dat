30|$|In recent years, {{because of}} the rising price of {{petroleum}} and natural gas, {{and the threat of}} increasing greenhouse gases, wood pellets have attracted considerable attention [11]. Wood pellets are used in large-scale applications, such as industrial heating systems, coal- powered boilers, and heat gasification [12], or in small-scale operations involving district area and household heating systems [13 – 15]. The wood pellet market is increasing substantially, and more than 442 pellet plants exist in the world, with a total production capacity of 14  million tons a year [14, 16]. Generally, wood pellets are used for energy production, but the large amount of wood pellet ash generated during combustion goes to landfills [17 – 19] or is used in farmland or forest fertilization and soil improvement because of its nutrient and trace element content, and acid neutralization capacity [18, 20 – 29]. However, wood ash does not improve tree growth or biomass production because of its low nitrogen content, and causes biomass to decrease slightly [21, 23 – 25]; furthermore, it is strongly alkaline (pH 13.3) and contains several metal salts, oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates [28, 30]. According to Marsh and Rodríguez-Reinoso [31], the mechanism for preparing AC involves alkali salt activation, in which the oxygen atoms of hydroxide and <b>potassium</b> or <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> gasify carbon atoms to produce CO gas, thereby creating porosity. This gasification is catalyzed by the alkali metal salt.

This study was carried out along a major irrigation water source-Uyyakondan channel in Tiruchirappalli, south India.
