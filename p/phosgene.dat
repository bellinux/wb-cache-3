5|$|Begun on 9 April, Operation Georgette {{shifted the}} {{focus to the}} devastated town of Ypres, in Flanders. The {{bombardment}} preceding the attack was of considerable scale and included <b>phosgene</b> gas shells, causing severe casualties among the Liverpool Scottish.|$|E
5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange {{when exposed}} to light, while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. Both have similar colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained <b>phosgene</b> oxime or hydrogen cyanide. These two chemicals can be fatal, {{but none of the}} protestors in this incident died.|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to <b>phosgene</b> also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, {{the twin}} villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, {{killing at least}} seventy-five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, it issued a {{statement}} in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was {{likely to have been}} halogenous derivatives – <b>phosgene,</b> mustard gas, lewisite, chlorine or cyanogen bromide. The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen. Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that the mustard and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to <b>phosgene,</b> nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly <b>phosgene</b> and mustard gas.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything went the Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by <b>phosgene</b> gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line of departure, nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men. On 2 July 1917, Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman.|$|E
25|$|Suspected samples can {{be tested}} for <b>phosgene</b> using filter paper (treated with 5% diphenylamine, 5% dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in ethanol, and then dried), which turns yellow in <b>phosgene</b> vapor. There are several {{colorimetric}} and fluorometric reagents for <b>phosgene,</b> and {{it can also be}} quantified with mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Diphenyl {{carbonate}} {{may be used}} {{in place}} of <b>phosgene.</b> Phenol is eliminated instead of hydrochloric acid. This transesterification process avoids the toxicity and handling of <b>phosgene.</b>|$|E
25|$|The odor {{detection}} threshold for <b>phosgene</b> is 0.4 ppm, {{four times the}} threshold limit value. Its high toxicity arises from {{the action of the}} <b>phosgene</b> on the proteins in the pulmonary alveoli, the site of gas exchange: their damage disrupts the blood–air barrier, causing suffocation. It reacts with the amines of the proteins, causing crosslinking by formation of urea-like linkages, in accord with the reactions discussed above. <b>Phosgene</b> detection badges are worn by those at risk of exposure.|$|E
25|$|To prevent accidents, {{commercial}} chloroform is stabilized with ethanol or amylene, but {{samples that}} have been recovered or dried no longer contain any stabilizer. Amylene has been found ineffective, and the <b>phosgene</b> can affect analytes in samples, lipids, and nucleic acids dissolved in or extracted with chloroform. <b>Phosgene</b> and HCl can be removed from chloroform by washing with saturated aqueous carbonate solutions, such as sodium bicarbonate. This procedure is simple and results in harmless products. <b>Phosgene</b> reacts with water to form carbon dioxide and HCl, and the carbonate salt neutralizes the resulting acid.|$|E
25|$|Under high {{temperatures}} in air, it forms poisonous <b>phosgene.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Phosgene</b> attack 19 December 1915 was {{the first}} use of <b>phosgene</b> gas by the Germans against British troops, during World War I, at Wieltje {{north-east}} of Ypres in Belgian Flanders. German gas attacks on allied troops had begun on 22 April 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres using chlorine gas, against French and Canadian units. The surprise led to the capture {{of much of the}} Ypres Salient, after which the effectiveness of gas as a weapon diminished, as the French and British produced anti-gas helmets. The German Nernst-Duisberg-Commission investigated the feasibility of adding the much more lethal <b>phosgene</b> to chlorine gas. Mixed chlorine and <b>phosgene</b> gas was used at the end of May 1915, in attacks against French troops on the Western Front and on the Eastern Front against the Russian army.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{may be used}} to {{mitigate}} gaseous spills of <b>phosgene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in {{the presence}} of oxygen, chloroform slowly converts into <b>phosgene</b> by a radical reaction. To suppress this photodegradation, chloroform is often stored in brown-tinted glass containers. Chlorinated compounds used to remove oil from metals, such as automotive brake cleaners, are converted to <b>phosgene</b> by the UV rays of arc welding processes.|$|E
25|$|Each of the CAIS held {{between one}} and five {{different}} chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were <b>phosgene,</b> adamsite, lewisite, cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, sarin, nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin. In addition, triphosgene, a <b>phosgene</b> simulant, and ethyl malonate, a tabun simulant were also used. Sarin was the only nerve agent used in CAIS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosgene</b> {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style refrigerant gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small gas torch (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a sniffer tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any refrigerant gas was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the sniffer tube and would cause a colour change of the gas flame to a bright greenish blue. In the process, <b>phosgene</b> gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of <b>phosgene</b> poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of <b>phosgene,</b> produced during such leak testing. Electronic sensing of refrigerant gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, <b>phosgene</b> poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of refrigerant leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon refrigerant leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E
25|$|The {{diphenyl}} carbonate was derived {{in part from}} carbon monoxide, this route being greener than the <b>phosgene</b> method.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{may be used}} {{to neutralise}} liquid spills of <b>phosgene.</b> Gaseous spills may be mitigated with ammonia.|$|E
25|$|During {{prolonged}} {{storage in}} the presence of oxygen, chloroform converts slowly to <b>phosgene</b> (COCl2), releasing HCl in the process.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosgene</b> is an {{insidious}} poison as the odor {{may not be}} noticed and symptoms may be slow to appear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosgene</b> {{was then}} only {{frequently}} {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army against the Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Gas weapons, such as <b>phosgene,</b> were produced by Unit 731 and authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito (Emperor Showa) himself, transmitted by {{the chief of staff}} of the army. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosgene</b> can be {{released}} during building fires. In one instance, a deputy fire chief was killed {{ten days after}} inhaling fumes that wafted down outside a burning restaurant. After a two-day hospitalization he had appeared to recover, but ultimately suffered cardiac arrest at home following tracheobronchial inflammation, alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. The <b>phosgene</b> was produced by decomposing Freon-22 after flames ducted up from a grease fire heated an air-conditioning unit {{on the roof and}} ruptured a hose.|$|E
25|$|In May 1924, eleven tons of <b>phosgene</b> {{escaped from}} a war surplus store in central Hamburg. Three hundred people were poisoned, of whom 10 died.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{combined}} chlorine–phosgene attack by Germany, against British troops at Wieltje near Ypres, Belgium on 19 December 1915, 88 tons {{of the gas}} were released from cylinders causing 1069 casualties and 69 deaths. The British P gas helmet, issued at the time, was impregnated with sodium phenolate and partially effective against <b>phosgene.</b> The modified PH Gas Helmet, which was impregnated with phenate hexamine and hexamethylene tetramine (urotropine) to improve the protection against <b>phosgene,</b> was issued in January 1916.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{extensive}} use of <b>phosgene</b> gas in combat during World War I, it was stockpiled by various countries {{as part of their}} secret chemical weapons programs.|$|E
25|$|Chloroform has induced liver {{tumors in}} mice and kidney tumors in mice and rats. The {{hepatotoxicity}} and nephrotoxicity of chloroform {{is thought to}} be due largely to <b>phosgene.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{modified}} version of the P Helmet, called the PH Helmet, was issued in January 1916, and was additionally impregnated with hexamethylenetetramine to improve the protection against <b>phosgene.</b>|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of <b>phosgene</b> {{is used in the}} production of isocyanates, the most important being toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). These two isocyanates are precursors to polyurethanes.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>phosgene</b> {{was never}} as notorious in public {{consciousness}} as mustard gas, it killed far more people, about 85% of the 100,000 deaths caused by chemical weapons during World War I.|$|E
25|$|The main hazard of the reagent is its inhalational toxicity. Its median lethal {{concentration}} of 100mg/m3 over 4 hours in rats is {{comparable to that of}} <b>phosgene</b> (49mg/m3 over 50 min in rats).|$|E
25|$|Because {{of safety}} issues, <b>phosgene</b> is often {{produced}} and consumed {{within the same}} plant, and extraordinary measures are made to contain it. It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, <b>phosgene</b> is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent {{because it is so}} easy to manufacture when compared to the production requirements of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent tabun.|$|E
25|$|Meprobamate, 2-methyl-2-propyl-1,3-propandiol dicarbamate is {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction}} of 2-methylvaleraldehyde with two molecules of formaldehyde and the subsequent transformation of the resulting 2-methyl-2-propylpropan-1,3-diol into the dicarbamate via successive reactions with <b>phosgene</b> and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|In World War I, the U.S. {{had its own}} {{chemical}} weapons program, which produced its own chemical munitions, including <b>phosgene</b> and mustard gas. The U.S. only created about 4% of the total {{chemical weapons}} produced for that war and just over 1% of the era's most effective weapon, mustard gas. (U.S. troops suffered less than 6% of gas casualties.) Although the U.S. had begun a large-scale production of Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919, Lewisite was not deployed during World War I. The United States also created a special unit, the 1st Gas Regiment, which used <b>phosgene</b> in attacks after being deployed to France.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{application}} of aniline {{is for the}} preparation of methylene dianiline and related compounds by condensation with formaldehyde (as discussed above). The diamines are condensed with <b>phosgene</b> to give methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, a precursor to urethane polymers.|$|E
25|$|Ureas in {{the more}} general sense can be {{accessed}} in the laboratory by reaction of <b>phosgene</b> with primary or secondary amines, proceeding through an isocyanate intermediate. Non-symmetric ureas can be accessed by reaction of primary or secondary amines with an isocyanate.|$|E
