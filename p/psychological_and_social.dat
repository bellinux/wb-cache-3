5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due}} to psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

30|$|The {{study has}} a number of {{limitations}} that should be taken into consideration. First, although our findings show that <b>psychological</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competence are positively related to entrepreneurial outcomes including performance, satisfaction, wellbeing, and commitment to remain in entrepreneurship, we did not investigate the mechanisms through which these positive effects are transmitted. Previous research has noted the contribution of <b>psychological</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competence to opportunity recognition, creating alliances, and resistance to stress (Miller, 2012). These are potential mediators of the linking between <b>psychological</b> resources <b>and</b> entrepreneurial success. The possible mediating and moderating processes that facilitate the positive impact of <b>psychological</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competence on entrepreneurial outcomes need to be examined.|$|R

5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper <b>psychological</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E

To assess the relationship between the level of <b>psychological</b> well-being <b>and</b> <b>social</b> support Ryff’s <b>Psychological</b> Well-Being Scales <b>and</b> The MOS <b>Social</b> Support Questionnaire were used.

30|$|Two {{independent}} {{studies are}} reported in this paper. Study 1 examines the direct and interactive effects of <b>psychological</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competence on entrepreneurial performance. In this study, social competence is measured {{with the concept of}} relational capital. However, the measurement focused on the relations between the firm owner or manager with the employees. Study 2 assesses the direct and interactional effects of <b>psychological</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competence on subjective entrepreneurial outcomes among young self-employed individuals in two East African countries (Uganda and Kenya). In this study, social competence is measured with the concept of social intelligence. Measuring social competence with different concepts in the two studies serves to broaden the explaining variables (social intelligence vs. relational capital). Moreover, testing our assumptions with two samples aimed at replicating findings in a different sample as well as broadening the set of entrepreneurial outcomes that can be explained by <b>psychological</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competences <b>and</b> their interaction.|$|R
