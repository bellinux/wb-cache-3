50|$|The A-9 was a cantilever, {{shoulder}} wing monoplane. In plan, the wing had a short, constant chord centre section and long, straight tapered outer panels, with a sweep on both edges, terminating in rounded and downward-curled wingtips. The panels were demountable from the centre section for transport; unusually, the centre section {{was an integral}} part of the fuselage structure, its single box spar spanning the 3.2 m (10 ft 6 in) section unbroken. The spar continued beyond the central section-outer panel joint, the whole wing having plywood covering ahead of the spar and aircraft fabric covering aft. Long span, tapered, fabric covered and mass balanced ailerons occupied about ⅔ of the trailing edges of the outer panels; these panels also carried Schempp-Hirth-type airbrakes, placed just behind the spar and ending at the <b>panel</b> <b>mounting</b> joint. The wing section was slightly reflexed towards the rear and thick, with maximum depth far forward at only about 20% chord, making the profile steep-nosed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Different {{actuators}} {{have been}} developed for active noise control. A broadband linear actuator, typically a loudspeaker, is often used. However, this is not an absolute necessity, the important issue is that the performance is “good” in the frequency band where the actuator should work, and that the actuator can produce the volume displacement needed. A speaking panel is a lightweight actuator, intended to be applied in propeller aircraft where the weight consideration is of great importance. The dimension of the used speaking panel is 200 x 600 mm. The panel is based on piezo ceramic materials embedded in a thin carbon fiber plate, resulting in a lightweight and more flexible actuator for trim <b>panel</b> <b>mounting</b> in an aircraft, as compared to a normal loudspeaker. A disadvantage, though, is that the actuator shows a nonlinear behavior, that cannot be overlooked when designing the controller. The cabin noise inside a propeller driven aircraft consists essentially of tonal components originating from the propellers as well as broadband boundary layer noise. However, it is only the tonal components that will be targeted by the controller therefore a narrowband controller has been used in this application. With this in mind the nonlinear characteristics are evaluated in terms of frequency response functions and harmonic distortion. An evaluation of the speaking panels together with a MIMO complex filtered-X LMS algorithm, is presented. The setup consists of four speaking panels, mounted in a test mock-up, four control microphones and two monitor microphones. The controller is implemented on a Texas Instruments C 31 signal processor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for {{the display of}} single sheet material within a library context and uses two recent exhibitions at the Bodleian Library, Oxford as case studies. Most previous library exhibitions have concentrated on bound books, reflecting the predominant format within their collections. These two recent exhibitions, however, have concentrated almost entirely on single sheet items and they have both presented display problems arising from {{the large numbers of}} items to be exhibited; restrictions imposed by space which was designed to display bound books; and the permanent mounting system used within the two displayed collections. A <b>panel</b> <b>mounting</b> system using polyester (Mylar) slings to support the items and their backing sheets was developed and this allowed the backing sheets to be safely overlapped and a larger number of items to be displayed. Both of these exhibitions raised issues about the display of single sheet items within a library context. The published display methods for single sheet items has largely been driven by the familiar museum and gallery print room storage system in the past but libraries have not tended to use these storage systems. These two case studies present a method of resolving the conflict that arises from the long term storage methods used at the Bodleian Library for single sheet material and their safe display and have implications for other museum, library and archive collections. Despite the focused subject, this methodology is important to other conservators preparing similar exhibits. It augments the exhibition of single-sheet library objects which so far has been difficult to display...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of adaptive facades presents a challenge {{because there is}} no established evaluation strategy to systematically reach this goal and many of the available façade performance evaluation tools have limited applicability for such advanced building facades. This paper presents a case study for an adaptive glass façade and evaluates its performance. The evaluation focuses mainly on pre and post construction phase of adaptive facades: The design assist phase (including the durability test, visual mockup, onsite <b>panel</b> <b>mounting</b> and weather stripping), the commissioning phase (field verification and performance testing) and the monitoring phase. The selected project is a nearly zero energy building with unique façade comprising thermal isolated glass sunshades printed with white silk screen. These louvers respond dynamically and automatically to the angle of the sun which improves the control over energy consumption, solar radiation and glare with the ability to admit natural light into the building. The paper is part of the research activities of working group 3 of the European COST Action 1403 on “Adaptive Facades “. Different methods were used for evaluation, this include: interviews with the architect, façade engineer and technical control specialist, reviews of standard and codes and a systematic process mapping. A documentation of the case study describing the post construction occupant comfort and façade operation was prepared. This paper’s audience is mainly architects, building façade engineers together with facility managers concerned with the process of design, construction and operation of adaptive glass facades.

40|$|A tese buscou identificar, a partir da análise da cadeia produtiva de produtos de base florestal, as oportunidades para aproveitamento da madeira roliça dos gêneros Eucalyptus e Pinus, com pequeno diâmetro, para produção de painéis estruturais de vedação destinados a habitação social. A madeira como {{material}} construtivo renovável, e segundo as dimensões da sustentabilidade, econômica e ambiental, apresenta as seguintes potencialidades: plantio e manejo florestal sustentável; adequação a diversos sistemas estruturais e construtivos; baixos consumos de energia e baixa geração de resíduos no processo de produção; desmontagem e aproveitamento dos resíduos no processo de transformação. O método adotado para o desenvolvimento do produto painel foi baseado, na análise e aperfeiçoamentos sucessivos a partir da avaliação dos dados coletados na fase experimental (processo de produção). As variáveis consideradas foram: facilidade de produção (homem/minuto, hora/equipamento e ferramentas), volume de resíduos gerados no processamento, custos e facilidade de montagem do painel. Os critérios adotados na avaliação de desempenho técnico foram: estrutural, estanqueidade visual e durabilidade. Na avaliação da sustentabilidade ambiental foram: uso de materiais de fontes renováveis; baixo consumo energético; redução de resíduos gerados. A sustentabilidade econômica foi avaliada considerando os critérios de: facilidade de produção; facilidade de montagem; produção em escala; baixos custos dos materiais empregados. Foram desenvolvidos e avaliados 10 projetos segundo os critérios considerados, concluindo-se com a proposição do produto painel estrutural composto por 1 / 2 peças roliças de eucalipto com pequeno diâmetro, curtas, justapostas e pregadas à chapa OSB (oriented strand board). O painel tem dimensões fracionadas na altura e na largura da chapa (1, 22 x 2, 44 m), nas seguintes medidas: 0, 61 x 2, 44; 0, 61 x 1, 22; 1, 22 x 1, 22 m; 1, 22 x 2, 44 m. Esta composição do painel viabiliza o melhor aproveitamento das peças chamadas de metrinho, as quais 100 % são destinadas atualmente para queima na geração de energia (desde fornos de padarias até fornos industriais). A proposta mostrou ser viável e pode-se constatar a sua facilidade de execução, mesmo em situações precárias de maquinários. A adoção dessas simplificações construtivas para a produção de componentes construtivos para habitações pode representar uma oportunidade de redução do tempo de execução e dos custos de produtos que atendam ao setor da habitação de baixa renda. A proposta apresenta ainda uma contribuição para a melhoria nas condições de moradia e redução dos impactos negativos ao meio ambiente, gerados pela construção civil, na utilização de materiais não renováveis. The {{purpose of}} this work is to identify, from {{the analysis of the}} production chain of forest based products, the chances of making use of small diameter round-wood of the Eucalyptus and Pinus types, for the production of sealing structural panels destined for social housing. Wood as a renewable building material  and, in accordance with the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability  presents the following potentialities: sustainable forest planting and handling; adequacy to several building and structural systems; low energy consumption and low residual outcome during the production process; dismantling and reuse of the remnants in the transformation process. The method adopted {{for the development of the}} panel product was grounded on the analysis and consecutive improvement, which was based on the evaluation of the data collected in the experimental phase (production process). The following variables were considered: production easiness (man/minute, time/equipment and tooling), amount of remnant generated by the processing, cost and <b>panel</b> <b>mounting</b> easiness. The criteria adopted in the evaluation of technical execution were the following: structural, visual tightness and durability. The following criteria were used in the environmental sustainability evaluation: use of materials from renewable sources; low energy consumption; reduction of residual outcome. The economic sustainability was evaluated taken the following criteria into consideration: production easiness; mounting easiness; mass production, low cost of the materials used. Ten projects have been developed and evaluated according to the considered criteria, and the structural panel product comprising juxtaposed, short, small diameter, eucalyptus, half round-wood pieces, nailed to OSB (oriented strand board) plate, was proposed. The panel has dimensions fractionized in the height and the width of the plate (1. 22 x 2, 44 m), in the following measures: 0. 61 x 2. 44; 0. 61 x 1. 22; 1. 22 x 1. 22 m; 1. 22 x 2. 44 m. This panel composition enables for best utilization of the so called metrinho (small pieces) pieces, which, nowadays, are 100 % used in burning for the generation of energy (from bakery to industrial ovens). The proposal has shown to be doable and of easy execution, even in precarious machinery situations. The adoption of these building simplifications for the production of building components for housing may represent an opportunity to reduce the execution time, as well as the products cost, in order to serve the low income housing sector. The proposal also presents a contribution to the improvement of housing conditions and to the reduction of negative environmental impacts, caused by the civil construction through the use of non-renewable materials...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. The SolarTurtle is a Spazashop style micro-utility unit designed for rural electrification in less-privileged communities of Sub-Saharan Africa. A standard 6 m shipping container is converted into a theft resistant solar battery charging station business from which community members can buy a rechargeable battery pack. These battery packs are charged via solar power then carried home to where it can provide a versatile source of electricity. At night the solar panels fold away for security purposes, this is made possible by employing a unique ‘book-style’ mounting structure. During the design process several design challenges had to be overcome {{in order for the}} SolarTurtle to survive South Africa’s harsh realities. Firstly, solar panels are often the target of theft and vandalism, therefore security measures must be in place. Secondly, maintenance in rural settings is difficult at best. The design must be robust enough to last as long as the solar PV panels. Thirdly if something should go wrong the broken components must be easy to replace, with minimal skills required. Hence a simple design is required without compromising the efficiency of the design. Lastly, the economic factor is of vital consideration. If the SolarTurtle is not economically viable the project will be unsuccessful. The previously mentioned challenges are only a portion of the design challenges that had to be met during the design process. With a host of conflicting requirements a prototype SolarTurtle came to light. The prototype 3. 6 kW PV system powers a fleet of 300 battery packs and can serve households or businesses with basic electricity all year around. This paper will explore the journey taken to overcome some of the difficult design challenges faced in order to ultimately deliver a fully functional SolarTurtle prototype destined for the rural Eastern Cape of South Africa. The SolarTurtle is a micro-utility that sells electricity to rural communities. It is a solar battery charging station (SBCS) fitted into a 6 m shipping container and a solar panel security system. This women empowerment franchise business uses solar PV to recharge any battery off-grid communities might have - phones, tablets, car batteries, penlight batteries and bottled battery packs 1. This enables woman entrepreneurs to sell electricity in any quantity require by turning all rechargeable batteries into solar power distribution devices. This enables the micro-utility to wirelessly reach numerous customers without relying on a grid connection. The challenge is to design the SolarTurtle {{in such a way that}} it is practical and affordable from an African perspective. The design of the SolarTurtle has to consider many aspects. Some are considered more important than others, though none can be disregarded. To find an optimal balance between simplicity, security, robustness, scalability and numerous other considerations while keeping the final product affordable is the ultimate challenge. To do this a scoring matrix was devised against which several designs were rated. This rating process lead to the final design discussed in this paper. However, true to the iterative design methodology the new SolarTurtle design had to improve on the previous design as presented at SASEC 2014 [1]. For this we have to understand its shortcomings. In the original SolarTurtle concept it was the responsibility of the turtlepreneur 2 to carry the solar panels from the container each morning and deploy them in the sun. In the evenings she had to reverse this process in order to lock the panels away in the container. This provided a cost effective solution for providing optimal security while still allowing the container to be transportable. However, there is a serious social risk. Deploying the panels in this way could lead to complacency, as it would require great dedication to deploy all the panels before the sun comes up and secure them after the sun goes down. First there is a risk of damaging the panels. Manhandling panels in and out of the container would surely lead to a breakage before the typical 20 year guarantee of the panel expires. Secondly the security advantage is only valid if the panels are packed away. However, the prototype is set to use around 4 kW worth of PV capacity. This means either multiple panels, or larger and heavier panels are required. This risk of the panels eventually just staying outside for convenience sake is too great. For these reasons an alternative solution was required. This led to the ‘book-style’ solar panel security system, which allows the panels to be packed away quickly and with minimal risk of manhandling. The ‘book-style’ solar <b>panel</b> <b>mounting</b> concept is easy to use and fast to deploy. In the morning the turtlepreneur opens the gates attached to the north facing side of the container. Once the gates are open the panels hanging from the gate and the container is propped up with struts so that an optimal sun inclination angle is achieved. At night the panels fold down again by removing the struts and the gates close onto the container, sandwiching all the panels for safety. The gate locks securely on the inside of the container. Research shows this design is unique and offers the extra security needed without overburdening the turtlepreneurs. This paper will explore the book-style design as well as various other possible designs considered for mounting the solar panels and how they were judged. Furthermore the interior design of the SolarTurtle will also be explored with special attention on security and safety. Finally the future of the SolarTurtle will be discussed. What other challenges are there still to overcome and how will these problems be tackled to deliver a fully functional micro-utility in a container. dc 201...|$|E

The voltage readings are sent through an Ethernet connection to a host computer where the current and power are calculated.
