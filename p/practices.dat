40|$|Aim: This {{paper is}} a report of a study to {{identify}} factors influencing advanced <b>practice</b> nurses’ contribution to promoting evidence-based <b>practice</b> among front-line nurses. Background: Despite widespread recognition that care should be evidence-based, nurses experience challenges implementing evidence-based <b>practice.</b> As opinion leaders, advanced <b>practice</b> nurses can influence the <b>practice</b> of front-line nurses by promoting research use. Little is known about how advanced <b>practice</b> nurses use evidence and their influence on care provided by front-line nurses. Method: A cross-sectional survey of 855 advanced <b>practice</b> nurses working in 87 hospital/primary care settings in England. The questionnaire examined understandings of evidence-based <b>practice,</b> sources of evidence used, ways of working with front-line nurses, perceived impact on front-line nurses, skills in evidence-based <b>practice</b> and barriers to promoting evidence-based <b>practice.</b> Data were collected in 2005 and analysed using descriptive statistics.

We take the stance that all participants in <b>practice</b> communities have a right and a responsibility to contribute to the discourse and that <b>practice</b> is co-constituted and embodied. <b>Practice</b> does not exist outside of practising. <b>Practice</b> knowledge is constituted in <b>practice,</b> for <b>practice.</b> In relation to <b>practice</b> leadership, we highlight the increasing regulation and surveillance of professional <b>practice</b> and propose distributed leadership as an alternate leadership model that privileges the embodied nature of <b>practice</b> as well as the largely marginalised voices of everyday practitioners and those with whom they work...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: “The Influence of <b>Practice</b> Infrastructure on <b>Practice</b> Progress” was an {{evaluation}} review project {{designed to determine}} if investment in the infrastructure of an allied health profession would result in improved <b>practice</b> progress within that profession. <b>Practice</b> infrastructure included robust, profession-specific <b>practice</b> councils; local and regional <b>practice</b> leadership; and support for education infrastructure. Method: This review consisted of selecting three professions (psychology, therapeutic recreation, and respiratory therapy) that were at different stages in their <b>practice</b> evolution. Health care providers in these three professions participated in an online survey. Their <b>practice</b> progress was measured against 32 established professional <b>practice</b> benchmarks. Separate focus groups were then conducted in each profession for frontline staff, <b>practice</b> leaders, and operational leaders. Results: The {{results indicated that the}} professions with a greater degree of <b>practice</b> infrastructure development scored higher on the <b>practice</b> benchmarks. The project also indicated that a profession’s <b>practice</b> priorities followed a hierarchy of needs that were related to the degree of <b>practice</b> infrastructure in that profession. Conclusions: It was concluded that all three <b>practice</b> infrastructure components are required for optimal <b>practice</b> performance and that the three components are interdependent. There is a need to invest in <b>practice</b> infrastructure, and this is particularly important in a program management model. The risks of not investing in this infrastructure include the loss of professional identify, weak profession advocacy, lack of a common voice, reduced shared decision making, and limited professional growth and development. Ultimately, enhancing <b>practice</b> infrastructure leads to improved <b>practice</b> standardization, clinical integration, and ongoing professional development, which in turn results in improved clinical competencies and outcomes. Future research could focus on the hierarchical placement and status of the regional <b>practice</b> leader positions. It would be interesting to follow one profession longitudinally as components of a professional <b>practice</b> infrastructure are added. The education infrastructure components could be interwoven into the <b>practice</b> goals for the <b>practice</b> leaders and the profession-specific <b>practice</b> councils...|$|R
