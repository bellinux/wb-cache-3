50|$|<b>Pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is {{a common}} name for 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol, also known as pine alcohol. Pinacolyl alcohol's {{molecular}} formula is C6H14O and is a secondary alcohol.|$|E
50|$|GD can be {{thickened}} {{for use as}} {{a chemical}} spray using an acryloid copolymer. It can also be deployed as a binary chemical weapon; its precursor chemicals are methylphosphonyl difluoride and a mixture of <b>pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and an amine.|$|E
50|$|Pinacolone (3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone) is an {{important}} ketone in organic chemistry. It is a colorless liquid and has a slight peppermint- or camphor- odor. It is a precursor to triazolylpinacolone in the synthesis of the fungicide triadimefon and in synthesis of the herbicide metribuzin. The molecule is an unsymmetrical ketone. The α-methyl group can participate in condensation reactions. The carbonyl group can undergo the usual reactions (hydrogenation, reductive amination, etc.). It is a Schedule 3 compound under the Chemical Weapons Convention 1993, due to being related to <b>Pinacolyl</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> which {{is used in the}} production of Soman. It is also a controlled export in Australia Group member states.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacture}} of soman {{is very similar}} to the {{manufacture of}} sarin. The difference is that the isopropanol from the sarin processes is replaced with pinacolyl alcohol:Soman is synthesized by reacting <b>pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> with methylphosphonyl difluoride. The result of this reaction is the forming of soman (3,3-dimethylbutan-2-yl methylphosphonofluoridate) which is described as “colorless liquid with a somewhat fruity odor.” The low vapor pressure of soman will also produce the volatile gas form of soman. Also, the acid hydrogen fluoride will form due to the elimination of fluoride and a proton. This acid is indirectly dangerous to humans. Skin contact with hydrogen fluoride will cause an immediate reaction with water which produces hydrofluoric acid.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of dehydration of the protonated (R) - 3, 3 -dimethylbutan- 2 -ol (<b>pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol),</b> [(CH 3) 3 C-CH(OH 2) CH 3]+, and of ethene + 1, 3 -butadiene cycloaddition were studied with the Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) technique for direct dynamics using the AM 1 method. More than 10, 000 trajectories were generated, {{most of them}} related to the unexplored simulated annealing/fragmentation approach. The AM 1 potential energy surface (PES) for the protonated <b>pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> presents two transition states related to the [(CH 3) 3 C-CHCH 3]+hhhOH 2 intermediate complex and to CH 3 migration leading to the [(CH 3) 2 C-CH(CH) 3] 2 +hhhOH 2 product complex. Direct dynamics yielded negligible trajectories involving these complexes, since the momentum acquired by the H 2 O fragment led to a complete dissociation. Thus, rearrangement of the secondary carbocation [(CH 3) 3 C-CHCH 3]+ was practically inexistent during the dynamics. Despite the concerted path (H 2 O dissociation and CH 3 migration) not being an IRC (intrinsic reaction coordinate) path in AM 1 -PES, a statistically significant number of trajectories involved this path. As for the Diels-Alder reaction, even when started from a symmetric transition state using the spin restricted AM 1 wavefunction, the dynamics yielded {{a significant number of}} trajectories that followed asymmetric, i. e. non-IRC, paths toward cyclohexene, independent of the initialization approach. It is noteworthy that all these asymmetric path trajectories led to a concerted reaction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of large molecular alcohols (LMAs) (<b>pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (PCA) and tert-amyl alcohol (tAA)) on N 2 hydrate were examined with a primary {{focus on the}} hydrate phase equilibria and structural transition. The four-phase (H-Lw-LLMA-V) equilibria of the N 2 +PCA+water and N 2 +tAA+water systems were experimentally measured {{in order to determine}} the thermodynamic stability conditions of the N 2 hydrates with LMAs. The H-Lw-LLMA-V curves of both N 2 +PCA and N 2 +tAA hydrates were significantly shifted to more thermodynamically stable regions. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Raman analyses verified that the structure of N 2 hydrates with LMAs was transformed from the original structure of sII to sH (P 6 /mmm) as a result of the inclusion of LMAs. In addition, the formation of sH hydrate from the N 2 +PCA+water system was further verified using an endothermic dissociation thermogram from a high pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP μ-DSC) by confirming the appearance of three distinct peaks that correspond to ice, sII hydrate, and sH hydrate. Therefore, the experimental results that were obtained in this study are expected to be informative for understanding the roles of LMAs in affecting the macroscopic hydrate phase behavior and microscopic hydrate structure. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|In this study, the {{influences}} of large molecular alcohols (LMAs) including <b>pinacolyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (PCA) and tert-amyl alcohol (tAA) on thermodynamic phase behaviors and structural characteristics of CH 4 and CO 2 hydrates were investigated for their potential use in gas storage and CO 2 sequestration. The experimentally measured hydrate phase equilibria demonstrated that CH 4 hydrates were stabilized {{in the presence of}} PCA and tAA. 13 C NMR and Raman spectroscopy confirmed sH hydrate formation from both CH 4 + PCA + water and CH 4 + tAA + water systems, resulting from the enclathration of LMAs in the large 51268 cages. The sH hydrate formation of the CH 4 + PCA + water system was also confirmed by an endothermic dissociation thermogram from a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). In contrast with CH 4 hydrates, the addition of both PCA and tAA to CO 2 hydrates resulted in thermodynamic inhibition. Through Raman and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses, both CO 2 + PCA and CO 2 + tAA hydrates were characterized as sI hydrates, indicating that LMAs simply inhibit the formation of CO 2 hydrates without being captured in the hydrate lattices. Therefore, PCA and tAA are expected to function as thermodynamic promoters which reduce the hydrate forming pressure in natural gas storage applications, while they can serve as thermodynamic inhibitors which prevent CO 2 hydrate formation in pipelines for CO 2 transportation to sequestration sites. close 0...|$|E
