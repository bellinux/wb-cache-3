50|$|As {{depicted}} in Figure 1, the Elk1 protein {{is composed of}} several domains. Localized in the N-terminal region, the A domain {{is required for the}} binding of Elk1 to DNA. This region also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES), which are responsible for nuclear import and export, respectively. The B domain allows Elk1 to bind to a dimer of its cofactor, serum response factor (SRF). Located adjacent to the B domain, the R domain is involved in suppressing Elk1 transcriptional activity. This domain harbors the lysine residues that are likely to undergo SUMOylation, a <b>post-translational</b> <b>event</b> that strengthens the inhibition function of the R domain. The D domain plays the key role of binding to active Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Located in the C-terminal region of Elk1, the C domain includes the amino acids that actually become phosphorylated by MAPKs. In this region, Serine 383 and 389 are key sites that need to be phosphorylated for Elk1-mediated transcription to occur. Finally, the DEF domain is specific for the interaction of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), a type of MAPK, with Elk1.|$|E

The dolichol structure was confirmed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and RP-HPLC analysis of the proteolytic digestion products from parasite proteins labeled with [35 S]cysteine and [3 H]FPP showed that the attachment of dolichol to protein is a <b>post-translational</b> <b>event</b> and probably occurs via a covalent bond to cysteine residues...|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional {{feedback}} loops {{are central}} to the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms. In animal systems as well as Neurospora, transcriptional repression is believed to occur by catalytic <b>post-translational</b> <b>events.</b> We report here in the Drosophila model two different mechanisms by which the circadian repressor PERIOD (PER) inhibits CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC) -mediated transcription. First, PER is recruited to circadian promoters, which leads to the nighttime decrease of CLK/CYC activity. This decrease is proportional to PER levels on DNA, and PER recruitment probably occurs via CLK. Then CLK is released from DNA and sequestered in a strong, ∼ 1 : 1 PER–CLK off-DNA complex. The data indicate that the PER levels bound to CLK change dynamically and are important for repression, first on-DNA and then off-DNA. They also suggest that these mechanisms occur upstream of <b>post-translational</b> <b>events,</b> and that elements of this two-step mechanism likely apply to mammals...|$|R

40|$|Many {{proteins}} with {{a variety}} of functions have proven to have glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -linkages; two members of this family are the scrapie prion protein and the receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The scrapie prion protein has two isoforms: PrPC is found in brain cells from normal animals, while PrPSc is an abnormal isoform that is only found in scrapie-infected animals. PrPSc is the only identified component of the prion, an infectious agent that apparently does not contain nucleic acid. Models for how prions replicate require that PrPSc must somehow recruit PrPC and catalyze or stabilize a <b>post-translational</b> <b>event</b> that converts PrPC into PrPSc. Extensive characterization has suggested that this critical <b>post-translational</b> <b>event</b> is probably conformational and not a chemical change. The presence of a GPI anchor on CNTFR alpha is an unusual feature for a molecule that must transmit a signal {{to the inside of the}} cell. Recent data have indicated that CNTFR alpha must bind CNTF, then interact with two other "beta" receptor components to initiate signal transduction. Furthermore, we have shown that, unlike the vast majority of receptors, CNTFR alpha can function as a soluble molecule to promote CNTF action on cells that contain the two beta components, but do not themselves express CNTFR alpha. Intriguingly, we have also demonstrated that CNTFR alpha is present in cerebrospinal fluid and blood in vivo, and the release of CNTFR alpha from skeletal muscle is increased by denervation of the muscle. Whether the soluble form is released through GPI-anchor cleavage remains to be determined...|$|E

A series of different experiments on the structure and activity of this enzyme have provided strong evidence that SAM-synthetase is regulated by reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio. Restoration of glutathione levels by the addition of S-adenosyl-methionine or glutathione esters in various experimental conditions (buthionine sulfoximine and carbon tetrachloride intoxication) resulted in a normalization of the SAM-synthetase diminution caused by the toxics and an attenuation of the morfological alteration produced in the liver, including fiber production.

In contrast, methods to measure protein abundance on a proteome-wide scale using arrays[11] or mass spectrometry[10] technologies {{are far less}} developed, covering {{only a fraction of}} proteins, requiring large amounts of tissue, and failing to directly capture protein activity.

Even reliable measurements of protein abundance, for instance by low-throughput antibody based methods or by higher-throughput methods such as mass spectrometry, do not necessarily provide quantitative assessment of functional activity.

40|$|Saliva is {{a crucial}} biofluid for oral health and is also of {{increasing}} importance as a non-invasive source of disease biomarkers. Salivary alpha-amylase is an abundant protein in saliva, and changes in amylase expression have been previously associated {{with a variety of}} diseases and conditions. Salivary alpha-amylase is subject to a high diversity of post-translational modifications, including physiological proteolysis in the oral cavity. Here we developed methodology for rapid sample preparation and non-targeted LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of saliva from healthy subjects and observed an extreme diversity of alpha-amylase proteolytic isoforms. Our results emphasize the importance of consideration of <b>post-translational</b> <b>events</b> such as proteolysis in proteomic studies, biomarker discovery and validation, particularly in saliva.

40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} work, {{we showed that}} the differentiation-dependent expression of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) in Caco- 2 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, was controlled at the mRNA level (D. Darmoul et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1992, 267, 4824 - 4833). Whether <b>post-translational</b> <b>events</b> {{may contribute to the}} final control of DPP IV cell surface expression was explored here by studying the potential effect of forskolin (FK), a drug known to permanently stimulates adenylyl cyclase and to strongly perturbs glucose metabolism in fully differentiated Caco- 2 cells. FK treatment reduces by about 50 % the amount of active DPP IV present at the brush border membrane, whereas the total amount of active DPP IV remains unchanged. Biosynthesis and maturation of DPP IV were measured using [35 S]methionine labeling and were shown to be essentially unaffected by FK treatment. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that up to 50 % of the neosynthesized DPP IV do not appear at the apical membrane after FK treatment. To get further insight into this phenomenon, we have used confocal laser scanning microscopy. We demonstrate that the blockade of DPP IV transport is associated with the accumulation of this protein in intracellular vesicles. Double-staining experiments demonstrate that these vesicles are not labeled with a monoclonal antibody directed against the Golgi apparatus but display a strong staining with a polyclonal antibody raised against lamp- 1, a lysosomal membrane protein. Using a newly developed image analysis procedure, {{we have been able to}} quantitate the relative distribution of lamp- 1 and DPP IV labels in both control and forskolin-treated cells. We show that the overlap of the two labels dramatically increases in FK-treated Caco- 2 cells. These results suggest that, beside the transcriptional level, <b>post-translational</b> <b>events</b> may be involved in the final control of the apical expression of a differentiation-dependent hydrolase...|$|R
