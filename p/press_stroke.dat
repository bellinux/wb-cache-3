50|$|As each tool in a turret {{press is}} {{relatively}} small, the press requires little power {{compared to a}} press manufacturing similar parts with a single <b>press</b> <b>stroke.</b> This allows the tool to be lighter and sometimes cheaper, although this is offset by the increased complexity of the turret and sheet positioning. Turret punches can operate faster per stroke than a heavier tool press, although of course many strokes are required. A turret punch can achieve 600 strokes per minute.|$|E

5000|$|Named for the {{movement}} of the transfer mechanism, tri-axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the three (3) axes of movement made by the part manipulators each <b>press</b> <b>stroke.</b> On the press downstroke the automation which will likely be holding the work piece will lower the work piece to the tool and retract to leave the part on the tool. At the bottom of the stroke the automation mechanism in the retracted state will cycle backward one pitch to position itself adjacent to the next workpiece. As the press cycles upward the part manipulators will index inward to pick up the next work piece, continuing upward following the press ram, then indexing forward to next station. As the press reaches the top of its stroke, the process repeats. The three axes of motion are up-down, in-out, and forward-back.|$|E

40|$|Haptic {{interfaces}} {{are designed}} to allow humans to touch virtual objects {{as though they were}} real. Unfortunately, virtual surface models currently require extensive hand tuning and do not feel authentic, which limits the usefulness and applicability of such systems. The proposed approach of haptography seeks to address this deficiency by basing models on haptic data recorded from real interactions between a human and a target object. The studio haptographer uses a fully instrumented stylus to tap, <b>press,</b> and <b>stroke</b> an item in a controlled environment while a computer system records positions, orientations, velocities, accelerations, and forces. The point-and-touch haptographer carries a simply instrumented stylus around during daily life, using it to capture interesting haptic properties of items in the real world. Recorded data is distilled into a haptograph, the haptic impression of the object or surface patch, including properties such as local shape, stiffness, friction, and texture. Finally, the feel of the probed object is recreated via a haptic interface by accounting for the device 2 ̆ 7 s natural dynamics and focusing on the feedback of high-frequency accelerations...|$|R

Passive adaptive MR damper is {{a new type of}} damper based on GMM inverse effect and MR effect, and it doesn’t need energy devices and can realize external force self-adaptation. A model of passive adaptive MR damper is established based on Jiles-Atherton model, the law of approach for the magneto mechanical effect, the magnetic circuit law and Bingham model. Experimental results show that the value of damping force is related to displacement and velocity: the larger the displacement, the greater the damping force; the faster the speed, the greater the damping force. This is consistent with the model. The damper has characteristic of load adaptive. Feasibility of the design was verified...|$|E
40|$|Metal/plastic hybrid {{structures}} are an efficient solution {{for making the}} best use of materials at every point in a product. This article shows {{the state of the art}} and current developments for the manufacture of metal/plastic composites in the fields of production and research. There are three production technologies: insert technology, outsert technology and metal/plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal parts are produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining. The process chains involved are very long. Based on the state of the art in the research a concept for a new process combination, which will be developed at the Fraunhofer IWU in cooperation with the Technische Universität Chemnitz, will be presented. The aim is to combine deep drawing, injection moulding and media-based forming in one die. This process will produce one part for each <b>press</b> <b>stroke,</b> thus increasing production efficiency and achieving very small tolerances for parts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a mathematical formulation for the efficient localization of 3 D surfaces including free-form surfaces and flat surfaces. An important {{application of this}} paper is to register flat surface calculated from unfolding process with a curved surface extracted from ship CAD prior to the multipoint press forming works. The mathematical formulation handles the registration and comparison of two free surfaces represented by sparse points based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm and localization that can be applicable to ship-hull plate forming. The ICP algorithm gives an adequate set of initial translation and rotation for surface objects with little correspondence through the minimization of mean square distance metric. Comparison of surfaces is explained in order to determine a corresponding set which gives the optimized <b>press</b> <b>stroke</b> between unfold surface and referential object surface. It thereby allows the optimized press works in ship-hull forming. The combination of registration and comparison is applied to decide the shape equivalence of correspondent surfaces as well as to estimate the transform matrix between point sets where similarity is low. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration on unfolding surface and curved surface...|$|E

There are different types of press tools are available, in this progressive tools are more influence the automobile industry for mass production. The operation of a progressive die involves the series of sheet metal operations at two or more stations during each <b>press</b> <b>stroke</b> for developing the complete work piece. The strip must move from the first station through each succeeding station and perform one or more distinct die operations at each working station. One or more idle stations may be incorporated in the die. In this paper we use software CATIA V 5 for modeling a progressive tool to manufacture a washer for M 12 bolt. In earlier design there is no primary stopper for first station and there are no accurate location like pilots for further station. In this design we provide primary stopper for first station, pilots for further stations and also we replace the die block with die buttons. For this any damage occurs on die button simply we can replace that particular die button instead of replacement of entire die block this will reduce the material cost, machining time and die maintenance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the investigation for a ring rolling company aimed at designing, {{by means of}} FE analysis, the manufacturing steps involved {{in the production of}} a flanged ring, made of 42 CrMo 4 steel, used for power generation plants. Company engineers proposed the following hot forming cycle consisting in (i) upsetting, (ii) indenting, (iii) piercing and, (iv) ring rolling. The FE analysis conducted adopting the proposed design evidenced different problems (confirmed by a pre-production test operated at the company job shop) both in the forming of the initial ring and in the ring rolling process. The hot forming of the pierced perform exceeds the capacity of the presses available at the job shop. Therefore this part of the forming cycle was redesigned modifying the tooling, reducing the <b>press</b> <b>stroke</b> and adding a new upsetting stage with a flat die {{at the end of the}} hot piercing. Moreover the lack of material in the flanged part of the final ring and the excessive axial expansion of the ring suggested to reduce the height of the preform and to increase the diameter of the flanged zone. The new configuration of the perform sequence and main roller shape were successful in correcting both the axial expansion and the filling of the flanged zone, also keeping the required forming forces below the industrial limits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{regard to}} the climate change {{as well as the}} {{shortage}} and increase in price of natural resources, efficient resource management becomes more and more important, also for production processes. More than half of the sheet metal used in the automotive industry is wasted. Considering the amount of energy and the added value associated to the discards, enormous savings are possible. The approach of this research work is to avoid waste during a forming process by means of a continuous process monitoring and a self-learning intelligent tool interacting with the servo press. The flexibility of the servo press, which is so far used to optimize the single <b>press</b> <b>stroke,</b> only, shall be exerted to respond on altering material properties of blank sheets and the thereby changing forming behaviour. The sample process includes a two-tiered bending process, in which a conventional punch performs the pre-bending in the first step and an independent servo axis the compensation-bending in the second step. If an inadmissible bending angle is measured after the second step, the servo press stops automatically and the additional servo axis performs a teaching-stroke to adjust the compensation angle. After that, the continuous process starts again. This paper presents the springback compensation strategy which uses flexible correction algorithms based on data of the on-line process monitoring as well as data of the previous bending steps. Finite Element Analyses are carried out to validate the strategy...|$|E
