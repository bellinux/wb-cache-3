As I understand the society, its objects are five-fold--first, to guarantee annuities which, it is always to be observed, is paid out of the interest of invested capital, so that those annuities may be secure and safe--annual pensions, varying from 10 to 25 pounds, to distressed railway officers and servants incapacitated by age, sickness, or accident; secondly, to guarantee small pensions to distressed widows; thirdly, to educate and maintain orphan children; fourthly, to provide temporary relief for all those classes till lasting relief can be guaranteed out of funds sufficiently large for the purpose; lastly, to induce railway officers and servants to assure their lives in some well- established office by sub-dividing the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> into small periodical sums, and also by granting a reversionary bonus of 10 pounds per cent. on the amount assured from the funds of the institution.|$|E
40|$|Un examen des différents plans d'assurance lancés ces dernières années par les {{institutions}} Canadiennes-françaises {{permet de}} constater qu'il existe pour répondre à un besoin une tendance à penser les problèmes d'assurance en fonction de la famille. Les besoins essentiels de la famille, en effet, sont la subsistance et la sécurité en cas de décès prématuré du père. Le plan d'assurance familiale de l'Assurance-Vie Desjardins a été proposé pour tenter de trouver une solution à cette situation et entre dans la voie d'évolution qui doit se poursuivre. Cet article a pour but d'exposer les principes, avantages et fonctionnement d'un tel plan récent d'assurance familiale. Two new Insurance Plans are now offered by l'AssuranceVie Desjardins. The "Plan d'Assurance Familiale" {{is a family}} insurance contract which constitutes a self-sufficient insurance plan in a single policy. The reason for such an initiative is that the average French Canadian worker who usually has a large family cannot be adequately insured for a premium he can afford if he insures all his children through individual contracts. Here is {{the description of the}} plan. On the life of the family father:A) An amount of $ 1, 500. 00 up to age 65, reduced to $ 750. 00 after 65. B) A series of family income monthly benefits; the first such benefit being at start an immediate monthly income of $ 25. 00 for 28 years, followed two years later by an additional income of $ 20. 00 for 24 years, followed from 2 years to 2 years by additional incomes of $ 15. 00, $ 10. 00 and $ 5. 00 for durations 20, 16 and 12 years. C) All children, present or future, whatever their number, are insured for amounts increasing up to $ 500. 00. This is a term to age 21 insurance. D) The family mother is insured for $ 500. 00. This insurance is permanent. The premium of such a policy reaches 4 % of the income of a $ 50. 00 per week worker at age 34. Since the plan has been designed for newweds or young married couples, the premium will not exceed 3 % in most cases. After 25 years, it is sharply reduced because benefits B and C are paidup. Benefits A and D are paidup at 65. In case of death of the father, premiums on the insurance of the mother and children will be waived. In case of total disability of the father before age 60, all premiums will be waived during the disability period. A "Prévoyance Familiale" Plan is also offered. It is designed for the young bachelor. The basis is Part A of the Family Insurance Plan to which a special feature has been added: In case of marriage, a conversion credit is granted. Such credit is substantially higher than the corresponding cash surrender value, and is applied towards the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> of the new family Insurance policy, {{at a time when the}} insured might be in dire need of funds.

40|$|Dubai {{energy sector}} is facing two main challenges: energy {{insecurity}} that is mainly driven by limitations to accessibility {{of natural gas}} and <b>the</b> high levels <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions due to a growing economy and power demand. As a result Dubai launched its Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 to diversify its energy resources and include solar energy within its power generation mix. A key issue facing Dubai would be addressing the discrepancy between <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> solar and <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> conventional power. This thesis aims to examine <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> involving <b>the</b> private sector, {{in this case the}} tourism industry in Dubai, given it was identified as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fastest growing sectors and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest contributors to Dubai’s economy, in participating in <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> for solar. To address the thesis aim, the study draws upon literature and semi structured interviews with the Dubai utility (DEWA), tourism department (DTCM), and large hotel chains who were identified as potential off-takers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar energy. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empirical investigation and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Business Model Canvas framework, first <b>the</b> core characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dubai energy business model are presented, showing the transition from the traditional model to the current one after introducing solar energy and Independent Power Producers to the energy production. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel interviews resulted in a set of potential value propositions that could be offered by the Dubai government (through DTCM) to incentivize hotels to pay for solar energy and by that providing initial support to enhance renewable energy promotion in Dubai.

30|$|Another factor likely {{contributing}} to {{growth in the}} IVB rolls occurred in 1988 when the Income Support program replaced Supplementary Benefits as the primary means-tested social assistance payment for those out of work with insufficient work history to qualify for IVB proper or other insurance-based payments. Although there were various elements to this reform, the key change for our purposes was that those claiming Income Support on grounds of disability, and thus counted in the disability roll, could now receive a higher level <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> (<b>the</b> Disability <b>Premium)</b> than those claiming Income Support on other grounds.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{illustration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> this equitable principle was {{in connection}} with motor vehicle insurance. A policyholder was provided with coverage {{on the basis that}} she was entitled to a [...] "no claims" [...] discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full <b>premium</b> until proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> no claims discount was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by <b>the</b> brokers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at {{what would have happened if}} the insurer's normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.|$|R

5000|$|A {{constant}} maturity {{credit default swap}} (CMCDS) {{is a type of}} credit derivative product, similar to a standard credit default swap (CDS). Addressing CMCDS typically requires prior understanding of credit default swaps. In a CMCDS the protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller (these payments constitute <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> leg), and in return receives a payoff (protection or default leg) if an underlying financial instrument defaults. Differently from a standard CDS, <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> leg <b>of</b> a CMCDS does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a floating spread, using a traded CDS as a reference index. More precisely, given a pre-assigned time-to-maturity, at any <b>payment</b> instant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> leg <b>the</b> rate that is offered is indexed at a traded CDS spread on the same reference credit existing in that moment for the pre-assigned time-to-maturity (hence the name [...] "{{constant maturity}}" [...] CDS). The default or protection leg is mostly the same as <b>the</b> leg <b>of</b> a standard CDS. Often CMCDS are expressed in terms <b>of</b> participation rate. <b>The</b> participation rate may be defined as the ratio between <b>the</b> present value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> leg <b>of</b> a standard CDS with the same final maturity and <b>the</b> present value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constant maturity CDS. CMCDS may be combined with CDS on the same entity to take only spread risk and not default risk on an entity. Indeed, as the default leg is the same, buying a CDS and selling a CMCDS or vice versa will offset the default legs and leave only the difference in <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> legs, that are driven by spread risk. Valuation of CMCDS has been explored by Damiano Brigo (2004) and Anlong Li (2006) ...|$|R

The results suggest that stricter enforcement of noncompetition agreements significantly reduces <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> using stock in takeovers and <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> paid for targets. In addition, the study documents that stronger enforcement of noncompetition agreements is related with more favorable market reactions for large acquirers.

40|$|The {{need for}} public {{infrastructure}} {{is essential in}} modern society, efficient transport and communications networks are the grease in <b>the</b> machinery <b>of</b> any economy while provisions of hospitals, schools, modern sewerage and water systems provide the lifestyle {{that all of us}} want – consider what life may be like without these. The ability to compulsorily acquire land is an essential element for those authorities that provide public works. Such projects often require <b>the</b> assemblage <b>of</b> many individual land parcels which would be near impossible, or impossibly costly to achieve without such legislation. Where land is acquired by compulsion in New Zealand under the Public Works Act 1981, the compensation provided for is based on <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> equivalence – that the landowner should be in a position no better or worse than before the land was acquired. In practice this means compensation based on the assessed market value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land or interest acquired. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature on the subject along with analysis of public submissions to a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act which was undertaken in 2001 indicate that <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> equivalence, while accepted as a reasonable basis for <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> compensation, may well not be adequately compensating all landowners when their properties are taken compulsorily. Further <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> compensation for injurious affection (depreciation) incurred when no land is taken is contentious, with landowners suffering from this extremely unhappy current legislation despite evidence that the actual losses incurred as a result of injurious affection are usually quite small. The literature and the submissions to the Public Works Act review suggest that <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> a small <b>premium</b> over and above the market value mandated by <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> equivalence would be appropriate. There are sound social and economic reasons why compensation should be paid to those who suffer a loss as a result of some public work. Balanced against these considerations is the need to have a regime for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> compensation that does not get bogged down in dispute, encourage spurious claims or allow landowners to be excessively overcompensated. To do so would put at risk any necessary and worthwhile public infrastructure projects. It is very common for overseas jurisdiction to make an allowance in legislation for <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> small <b>premiums</b> in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 5 % to 10 % over the market value when land is acquired using an element of compulsion. This premium is often (but not always) reserved for <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> residential property. Often <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> is discretionary up to the maximum, particularly in cases where <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> is allowed for all classes <b>of</b> land. <b>The</b> New Zealand Act contains a similar provision, referred to as a solatium and payable on <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> a residence from an owner, however this has been fixed at $ 2, 000 for many years and is therefore too low a figure to be relevant in the overall compensation consideration. The submissions to the Public Works Act review indicated that public works providers may be willing to consider an expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compensation provisions to take account of some of these concerns, but this was tempered by a concern about opening themselves up to significant future costs and the problems that will be created for them in delivery of facilities and services into the future. It is considered that a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current solatium provisions could provide ability to both, offer a premium in acquisition and to offer some compensation to those suffering from injurious affection when no land has been taken {{and at the same time}} keep a reign on costs. A look at <b>the</b> “solatium” provisions <b>of</b> overseas legislation shows that within reason these can be constructed to manipulate the payment in almost any manner desired so it is clearly possible to engineer a clause which would enable useful premiums to be paid but still place a reasonable limit on owners expectations. The provisions could also be extended to cover those suffering injurious affection as in most cases the losses suffered would be within <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> a solatium <b>payment</b> or premium being offered to those from whom land is acquired. It is accepted that such proposals would add to <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> public works projects but in most cases this would probably be not much more than 10 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total property cost which is many projects is not a significant component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. On this basis it is recommended that further investigation into <b>the</b> possible extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solatium provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act be undertaken with some cost benefit modelling against actual projects to determine <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposal...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role that}} both managerial and investor optimism can have on mergers. A simple model is constructed to show the effects that belief differences can have on merger activities. The model combines the acquirer and target manager 2 ̆ 7 s possible optimism in their abilities with the potential misvaluations that may exist in the stock market. Several testable hypotheses are implied from the model including <b>the</b> desired method <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> paid to <b>the</b> target, and the market 2 ̆ 7 s reaction a merger. Empirical tests are then implemented to assess <b>the</b> predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model. ^ The model demonstrates <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> optimism on <b>the</b> method and amount <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> in mergers along with the market 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to the merger announcement. We find that optimistic acquiring managers will prefer cash mergers because of they believe that their stock is undervalued. Their optimism will also bias them to pay a larger premium in cash mergers than an unbiased manager resulting in a negative stock market reaction to the merger announcement. Optimistic target managers will instead prefer stock mergers and demand a larger premium in cash mergers, compared to an unbiased manager. This increased <b>premium</b> leads to <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s share price experiencing a positive stock market reaction to the acquisition announcement. ^ To test the model, investor misvaluations are proxied by both price-to-book and price to residual-income ratios. Managerial optimism is measured as positive bias {{in their ability to}} manage their company. Managers are classified as optimistic if they fail to exercise significantly in-the-money vested options or purchase their own companies stock. ^ Empirical tests show that market overvaluation leads to stock mergers and undervaluation leads to cash mergers, which agrees with <b>the</b> predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acquiring manager and not the target manager. Optimistic managers, both acquiring and target, are associated with larger <b>premiums.</b> <b>The</b> market reacts negatively to <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> a merger announcement when either the acquirer or target shares are overvalued. No market response is documented for an optimistic acquiring manager purchasing another firm. A positive market reaction is found, however, if an optimistic target manager is being acquired. ...|$|R
40|$|In Thailand, a {{universal}} {{health insurance coverage}} policy was implemented in 2001 alongside <b>the</b> reform <b>of</b> public health insurance. Since the reform, Thailand has had three major public health insurance schemes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Social Security Scheme (SSS), Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) and the Gold Card scheme. These three schemes covered more than 90 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thai population in 2003, moving the country closer to universal coverage. The Gold Card scheme was a new public health insurance scheme, introduced in 2001 and covering <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> Thai population. <b>The</b> scheme {{is designed to provide}} coverage for those on low and middle incomes and, thus, plays a vital role in the drive towards universal coverage. There are problems that need to be rectified in this scheme, including financing feasibility, the need for additional sources <b>of</b> finance and <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> contracted hospitals in the Gold Card scheme. This thesis seeks to elicit the willingness to pay (WTP) for public health insurance (the Gold Card scheme) in Thailand by using a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) approach. DCE provides an interesting application to decision- making in health care financing and this study is the first to use the DCE approach to elicit the WTP for public health insurance in Thailand. WTP may help policy makers understand the communities’ preferences because it is elicited through community consultation. Although insured people in the Gold Card scheme currently pay nothing for accessing health care, the DCE approach finds that insured people may be willing to contribute to <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> running <b>the</b> scheme through <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>premium.</b> <b>The</b> DCE was conducted in <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> Thailand from 1 st August to 31 October 2009. The sample size comprising 1, 200 heads of households from five districts who are covered by the Gold Card scheme were surveyed and interviewed. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Qualitative methods were used to collect socio- economic status, health expenditures, hospitalisation and financing experience. Quantitative methods were used to analyse DCE data. The study finds that the Gold Card scheme is very important for respondents and if the Gold Card scheme is able to extend <b>the</b> choices <b>of</b> health care providers and the waiting time in Out-Patient-Department (OPD) can be reduced, insured people {{would be willing to pay}} a <b>premium</b> for <b>the</b> Gold Card scheme. Thus, it is possible that premium payment can be used to raise additional funds for the Gold Card scheme. This study recommends that as long as other additional public funds such as tax reform cannot be sourced, the Gold Card scheme may require the insured to pay <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> in order to ensure its long-term viability...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{logistics}} is {{the science}} and art <b>of</b> bringing <b>the</b> right drugs at the right places in the right time in appropriate quantities. The drug supply systems are fields of pharmacy practice that add extra knowledge to the pharmacist different from that acquired at the college. This necessitates <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> pharmacy practice to the pharmaceutical curriculum. In <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> military services, drugs are more valuable than weapons as diseases are more dangerous than the enemy fires. The present work had been fulfilled at the Sudanese Medical Corps facilities in the period from 8 / 2000 to 2 / 2004, where continuous crises are common, complaints from <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply unit, financial obstacles and organizational instability are common. Lack <b>of</b> drugs at <b>the</b> regional hospitals had persisted even after introducing the health insurance program; the Takaful, which is a risk-sharing mechanism. Soldiers at the war areas suffer from <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> drugs as their drug supplies were sorted {{to be on the}} military financial affairs budget in spite <b>of</b> their <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monthly <b>premiums</b> in risk-sharing program. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work are to study the drug supply process,to tackle the problems and to contribute to innovation of a supply model based on a scientific background. To achieve these objectives the study had focused on <b>the</b> systems <b>of</b> supply dimensions; policies, planning, organization, selection, procurement, distribution, prescribing and dispensing, financing and security. The study had been organized as follows: Chapter one, the introduction which contains a brief description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug supply dimensions, a historical background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sudanese Medical Corps and <b>the</b> pharmaceutical activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NFDMS. Chapter two is the literature review which contains a comprehensive study of fourteen elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug supply. They are the policies, the drug logistics planning, organizing drug supply, selection ofdrugs, drug quantification, procurement of drugs, small scale local production, quality assurance, drug donation, distribution, prescribing, dispensing, drug financing and managing security for the supply systems. Chapter three is <b>the</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. Chapter four is the methodology. Chapter five is the results and discussion which tackled the problems on <b>the</b> fourteen elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply systems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SMC, discussed and compared with the literature and other similar organizations. Chapter six includes the conclusion and recommendations on each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mentioned elements independently. Chapter seven is the references and annexes. The subject is concerned with the pharmaceutical practice, management, planning, organizations, financial and military aspects. This explains <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. <b>The</b> absence <b>of</b> a sound documented policy statement diverse the plans. The policy statement, the clear objectives and proper planning together with workers will make the NFDMS succeed in achieving the objectives. The performance improvement was in <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> Takaful and <b>the</b> military administrative area. This raises an image of duality which appears and disappears according to persons occupying the key positions. <b>The</b> selection <b>of</b> drugs is based on informal and non-scientific practices. In <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pharmacy and Therapeutics Higher Committee which is widely recommended and the existing direct purchases which are due to lack of finance, all sorts of breaches may emerge. Distribution of drugs is a CMS old style, a pull method of requisition, in monthly and weekly intervals. This pool method burdened the Central Warehouses. The storage conditions were inappropriate where the temperature exceeds 40 C in some buildings. The stores are manual type and thermometers were notthere. <b>The</b> problems <b>of</b> transportation in Lorries for 6 - 8 days to some areas make <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> drugs questionable. Those physicians on the housemanship and those under the National Service are 3 - 4 folds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military physicians. This results in difficulties in managing the prescribing. Over prescribing of vitamins reaches 85 % of drugs being prescribed. The total vitamins and haematinics expenditure is greater than <b>the</b> total expenditure <b>of</b> antimalarials and cardiovasculardrugs together. Their expenditure is also greater than <b>the</b> summation <b>of</b> GIT drugs, ophthalmologic preparations and cardiovascular drugs expenditure. The dispensing time for the prescription is one minute reflecting <b>the</b> heavy load <b>of</b> work in <b>the</b> day time at the casualties, referred clinics, pediatrics pharmacies; explain <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> inventory records. <b>The</b> flow <b>of</b> prescriptions to <b>the</b> contracted unaffiliated pharmacies provides an outlet for security breaches. The average item price at the unaffiliated pharmacies is two to three folds of its price at the pharmacies within the system. The total drug expenditure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drugs from the contracted pharmacies for the year 2003 is four hundred millions Dinars. This amount is twice the drug expenditure for the whole army for the year 1999. The pharmaceutical services in the PAF need to be reorganized. The systems should be rebuilt on scientific basis; more pharmacists should be enlisted to encourage the changes. Autonomous or semiautonomous organization is recommended including the production sector, import division, sales, supply and pharmacies activities. It could be financed by the NFDMS; <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> Takaful is appreciated. The war areas could be supplied on cost coverage, Takaful on contract and market sales on investment basis. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Higher Committee is the corner stone in improving performance.

D. <b>The</b> {{contract}} <b>of</b> {{insurance is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more frequently concluded commercial contracts. <b>The</b> <b>premium</b> which is undertaken {{in terms of}} an insurance contract is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essential features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurance contract. Notwithstanding <b>the</b> obvious importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> and <b>the</b> legal aspects surrounding it, it has in the past often received but scant treatment in insurance-law materials. In this thesis it is shown that there exist a number <b>of</b> aspects regarding <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> which are unclear and in need of careful scrutiny. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> certain other aspects (regarding <b>the</b> <b>premium),</b> although there is certainty as to their contents it is necessary to identify and (re-) define their place in <b>the</b> broader scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurance law. The study commences with an investigation into <b>the</b> historical development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> "insurance" and "premium". This is followed by a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant principles <b>of</b> Roman-Dutch law.

These aspects concern <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premium; the question whether "premiumless" or "free" insurance is legally possible; the question whether the parties may agree to insure at a "reasonable premium"; <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insured in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non­ <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premium; <b>the</b> receipt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> by <b>the</b> broker; <b>the</b> return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> where <b>the</b> insured has acted fraudulently; <b>the</b> legal tenability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> insuring <b>the</b> premium; the possibility that the contribution in terms of some concepts of our indigenous law may resemble the premium; and finally, the analogous method as a source of law to extend and broaden <b>the</b> pool <b>of</b> legal principles applicable to the insurance contract...|$|R
