50|$|<b>Pomato</b> {{plants have}} been seen as a new {{technology}} to make food production more efficient, as they maximize the amount of crops that can be produced on a piece of land or in a small urban environment like a balcony. This has significant impacts on developing countries like Kenya, where farmers can save on space, time and labour without affecting the quality of their produce by growing <b>pomato</b> plants. In addition, grafting can improve resistance to bacteria, viruses and fungi, attract a more diverse group of pollinators and provide a sturdy trunk for delicate ornamental plants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pomato</b> (or tomtato, ketchup and chips) is a botanical chimera that is {{produced}} by grafting together a tomato plant and a potato plant, {{both of which are}} members of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. Cherry tomatoes grow on the vine, while white potatoes grow in the soil from the same plant.|$|E
5000|$|Grafted <b>pomato</b> {{plants were}} {{launched}} in the United Kingdom in September 2013 by horticultural mail order company Thompson & Morgan, who sold pre-grafted plants branded as the [...] "TomTato". The Incredible Edible nursery in New Zealand announced a [...] "DoubleUP Potato Tom" [...] in the same month. Thompson & Morgan claim {{that this is the}} first time the plant has been produced commercially, and director Paul Hansord describes originating the tomtato idea himself 15 years ago in the US, when visiting a garden where someone had planted a potato under a tomato as a joke.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "jaeger" [...] {{is derived}} from the German word JÃ¤ger, meaning [...] "hunter". The genus name Stercorarius is Latin and means [...] "of dung"; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement. The {{specific}} Pomatorhinus is from Ancient Greek poma, <b>pomatos,</b> [...] "lid" [...] and rhis, rhinos, [...] "nostrils". This refers to the cere, which the pomarine jaeger shares with the other skuas. The name of this species is unrelated to the Baltic Sea region of Pomerania, ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to propagating trees on rootstocks designed to control size/vigour and confer disease resistance, grafting above the rootstock {{can be used}} to provide multiple cultivars of a single species, known as a family tree, or, within certain limits, cultivars of different fruit species on one tree, often known as a fruit salad tree. Family trees typically combine several cultivars (two or three being most common) of apple, pear or a given species of stonefruit on a single rootstock, while fruit salad trees typically carry two or more different species from within a given genus, such as plum, apricot, and peach or mandarin orange, lemon, and lime. Certain combinations, including sour cherry (prunus cerasus)/sweet cherry (prunus avium), although from the same genus, are known to be difficult, although successes have sometimes been reported. Other grafts of this kind can produce the <b>Pomato.</b>|$|E
