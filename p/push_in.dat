5|$|The SummerSlam {{match was}} DiBiase's final {{appearance}} as a WWF wrestler. He injured {{his neck and}} back in January 1994 {{and was forced to}} retire from wrestling.

As the Republic of Korea's First Division hurled {{itself on the}} enemy, shore fire control observers saw New Jerseys salvos hit directly on enemy mortar emplacements, supply and ammunition dumps, and personnel concentrations. New Jersey returned to Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{failing to}} capture the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at King of the Ring, Diesel {{continued}} to enjoy an unprecedented <b>push.</b> <b>In</b> 1994, {{he became the first}} wrestler in WWF history to win the WWF's Triple Crown in one calendar year. The Headshrinkers dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Michaels one day before SummerSlam 1994. Diesel followed this up by winning the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on November 26, 1994.|$|E

5|$|The Marines {{began their}} attack, codenamed Operation Vigilant Resolve, on 5 April. The overall ground {{commander}} in Anbar, 1st Marine Division commander General James Mattis, initially {{planned to use}} his only available units, 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion 1st Marines. They would <b>push</b> <b>in</b> from {{the east and west}} and methodically contain the insurgents. This plan was underway when on 9 April, General Sanchez ordered an immediate halt.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2007, the New Breed was {{phased out}} as a group. Cor Von and Burke {{remained}} loosely aligned and teamed together on a few occasions until mid-June. After this, Cor Von took an extended leave of absence before being released from the company in September. Burke remained part of ECW and received a <b>push</b> <b>in</b> late June and July, challenging for the ECW World Championship on several occasions. Throughout the remainder of 2007 and most of 2008, he was rarely used in a prominent role and was released in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a <b>push</b> <b>in</b> that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E

5|$|Keen to {{strengthen}} Bolton for a European <b>push</b> <b>in</b> the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, {{and in an}} unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who {{changed his mind about}} joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|The sale of star midfielder Joey Beauchamp to West Ham for a club record £1million allowed Smith {{money to}} spend in the {{transfer}} market, and he spent £100,000 each on Norwich City midfielder David Smith and Sunderland striker David Rush. Oxford formed a strong promotion <b>push</b> <b>in</b> 1994–95, but were knocked out of the FA Cup {{in the first round}} by non-League Marlow. In February 1995, he spent £60,000 on Hartlepool United's Phil Gilchrist, who would form a highly effective centre-back partnership with Elliott. Oxford finished the season in seventh place, six points outside the play-offs. In November 1995, Smith re-signed Beauchamp for £300,000, who continued his excellent form after returning to his native Oxfordshire. The next month he brought in striker Martin Aldridge on a free transfer. The club were 14th in January 1996, but lost only once in their last 17 matches of 1995–96 in a tremendous {{second half of the season}} that saw them climb 12 places to win promotion as runners-up. At the end of the season, Smith became a director of the club.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1986, Bremner spent £125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and {{a further}} £80,000 {{to bring in}} 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (£15,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free {{transfer}} from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (£35,000 from Doncaster Rovers). Aiming for a promotion <b>push</b> <b>in</b> the 1986–87 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for £840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for £110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for £72,000 and £200,000 respectively. A 2–1 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs {{by the end of}} the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3–2 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1–0 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's. John Sheridan put Leeds ahead in extra-time of the replay, but two late goals from Peter Shirtliff changed the game and denied Leeds promotion.|$|E

5|$|The final race in Europe {{took place}} at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole {{position}} by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster when Alonso's rear anti-roll bar failed in the final period of qualifying, leaving the championship leader marooned in tenth while Lewis Hamilton took pole. Hamilton asserted early control over the race, and while Ferrari made significant ground early on to be running second and third – despite losing the data uplink between their cars and the pit wall that provided them with telemetry – it was Sergio Pérez who proved to be Hamilton's biggest challenge. Starting outside the top ten, Pérez elected to start on the harder compound tyres and complete one stop, producing fastest lap after fastest lap as McLaren's confidence was broken when Jenson Button's car was paralysed by a fuel pressure problem. Hamilton would ultimately prevail, but {{he was forced to}} <b>push</b> <b>in</b> the final few laps to maintain his lead, and won the race by four seconds as Pérez claimed his third podium of the season with second place. Alonso went on to finish third, benefiting from Button's retirement and a drive-through penalty for Sebastian Vettel when the reigning World Champion forced him so wide through the Curva Grande that Alonso was forced off the circuit. Bruno Senna later criticised the race stewards for not penalising Paul di Resta for a similar altercation on the approach to the Variante della Roggia early in the race. Meanwhile, with Romain Grosjean serving his suspension, Lotus enlisted former Marussia F1 driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio as their second driver for the weekend. He qualified sixteenth, and went on to finish thirteenth overall.|$|E
