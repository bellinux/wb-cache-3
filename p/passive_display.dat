Test patterns of gratings with various contrast and spatial frequencies {{are used to}} determine the contrast thresholds, from which the contrast sensitivity of human visual systems is obtained. Perceptual resolution tests show that viewers can perceive the highest vertical frequency on active displays, but not on <b>passive</b> <b>displays.</b> However, the contrast sensitivity is higher for <b>passive</b> <b>displays</b> than active displays for all other frequencies. Viewers can perceive frequency components with lower contrast, except for the highest frequency, more easily on <b>passive</b> <b>displays</b> than on active displays. Perceptual crosstalk tests show that interocular crosstalk is a function of spatial frequency. Crosstalk is lower on <b>passive</b> <b>displays</b> than on active displays. close...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{real and}} virtual objects in 3 D virtual worlds. Our {{focus is on}} the case study Dark Luminance, an exhibition of virtual artworks inside the 3 D graphic, multi-user, virtual environment of Second life. Real models of the virtual artworks were also installed in multiple art galleries in New York City and Melbourne in 2008 - 2009. We begin by defining Second life in general terms. Using the taxonomy of Milgram and Kishino this paper makes a specific case study of the Dark Luminance art exhibition as a mixed-reality environment. We observe how gallery visitors and the viewer-as-avatar may experience artwork that includes both real and virtual elements. The use of a mixed-reality environment takes the exhibition beyond its traditional function of <b>passive</b> <b>display</b> into a zone where the observer is an active participant, even a co-creator of the work. We observe how the virtual art may augment reality while the real art objects may demonstrate Milgram and Kishino&# 039;s theory of augmented virtuality...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : We {{automatically}} {{design and}} manufacture magic lenses to warp source images into specified target images. Here we photograph a source image (far left) viewed through a manufactured lens with 32 × 32 facets (left), resulting in four images {{depending on the}} lens’ orientation atop the source. We present an automatic approach to design and manufacture <b>passive</b> <b>display</b> devices based on optical hidden image decoding. Motivated by classical steganography techniques we construct Magic Lenses, composed of refractive lenslet arrays, to reveal hidden images when placed over potentially unstructured printed or displayed source images. We determine the refractive geometry of these surfaces by formulating and efficiently solving an inverse light transport problem, taking into account additional constraints imposed by the physical manufacturing processes. We fabricate several variants on the basic magic lens idea including using a single source image to encode several hidden images which are only revealed when the lens is placed at prescribed orientations on the source image or viewed from different angles. We also present an important special case, the universal lens, that forms an injection mapping from the lens surface to the source image grid, allowing it {{to be used with}} arbitrary source images. We use this type of lens to generate hidden animation sequences. We validate our simulation results with many real-world manufactured magic lenses, and experiment with two separate manufacturing processes...|$|E
40|$|An e-{{newspaper}} is {{the result}} of newspaper content adapted to electronic paper. Electronic paper is a display technology which has many favourable attributes. It is a <b>passive</b> <b>display</b> technology which means that it can have the appearence of paper due to its high contrast, it is readable like paper due to only changing its pixels when the image changes and also uses very little power making it suitable for mobile uses. Making an e-newspaper service has many challenges, the areas focused on in this thesis are namely layout and distribution. There is great differences between an online newspaper and a paper newspaper, and the question is which direction is suitable for an e-newspaper. Some of the factors that plays a role includes rates of updates, feel of quality, ``charm'' and of course personal preferences. Distribution is split in two different approaches, pull or push. The latter most preferable because it gives the quickest updates in an automatic fashion. The reason for considering pull distribution is because it is more suited for devices that wishes to limit the time with an active air interface. There was made a demonstration of such an e-newspaper service, with a standard template, online newspaper inspired, layout and pull distribution to accomodate the chosen e-paper device's poor battery life. The pull distribution was further user initiated to conserve even more power. The software made for this demonstration {{can be found in the}} accompanying archive file. There was a test group, which evaluated the demonstration for a period of time. They did not completely agree with the layout choices, as they favoured a layout closer to the original paper source. That the download was user initiated was not a great problem though. </p...|$|E

50|$|To present {{stereoscopic}} pictures, {{two images}} are projected superimposed onto the same screen through polarizing filters or presented on a display with polarized filters. For projection, a silver screen is used so that polarization is preserved. On most <b>passive</b> <b>displays</b> every other row of pixels are polarized for one eye or the other. This method {{is also known}} as being interlaced. The viewer wears low-cost eyeglasses which also contain a pair of opposite polarizing filters. As each filter only passes light which is similarly polarized and blocks the opposite polarized light, each eye only sees one of the images, and the effect is achieved.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Wirelessly powered sensors {{are proven}} as an {{effective}} solution for sensing and monitoring in undeveloped, inaccessible environments or where the difficulty of maintaining devices dramatically increases as the network increases in scale. In addition, small low power consumer electronics, such as wearable sensors, are constrained by the properties of their batteries. The use of a battery limits the device’s lifetime, size, hardware cost and maintenance effort (charging or replacing the battery). Among the latest battery-free solutions, radio frequency (RF) wireless power {{is one of the}} most promising technologies for supplying power, because it not only wirelessly charges passive or semi-passive devices, but also has intrinsic compatibility with existing radio communication systems. This dissertation will discuss a type of RF wirelessly powered system with extremely constrained available power, that leverages existing infrastructure, such as an RFID reader or a cellphone, for its power source. In general, the power available on these wireless devices is around a few uW to a few mW. However, some applications using these devices require power-hungry computing, sensing or communications, which require much more power than is available from RF harvesting. Therefore, the performance attainable for computation, sensing, and communication is significantly affected by energy harvesting efficiency as well as the duty cycle strategy. This dissertation will use a few application examples to demonstrate how RF energy harvesting efficiency affects the performance of wirelessly powered platforms using existing infrastructure with regard to localization, sensing and communication. This dissertation categorizes wireless power systems into two types based on the target operation range and available wireless power level. The first type comprises far-field systems whose operating ranges are beyond a few meters and which support harvested power on the order of a few to hundreds of uW. The second type comprises near field systems whose operating ranges are closer than 10 cm, where the available power is greater than a few mW. The first portion of this thesis addresses the challenges and trade-offs in a far field wirelessly powered sensing system. This dissertation presents a working prototype of an RFID-based system that localizes a custom, battery-free, EPC Gen 2 -compatible UHF tag, and uses it as an example to discuss the typical features of a far-field system. The presented system detects the 3 D position and motion of a battery-free RFID tag incorporating an ultrasound detector and an accelerometer. Combining the tag’s acceleration with absolute 3 D location permits adaptive power management and supports activity recognition. It uses the RFID communication channel for synchronization and inventory, and uses acoustic propagation delays for distance measurement. We characterize the system's localization performance in open space as well as implement it in a smart wet lab application. In the wet lab setting, the system is used to track the real-time location and motion of objects with wireless powered sensing tags, as well as recognize pouring actions performed on the objects to which the tag is attached. This thesis discusses the trade-offs between sensing accuracy, latency, tag power consumption and position. The second portion of this dissertation presents the NFC-WISP as an example of a typical near-field wireless power system. The NFC-WISP is a programmable, computationally enhanced platform designed to explore new near field battery-free sensing and user interface applications. Not only is the NFC-WISP be wirelessly powered and read by commercially available RFID readers (including NFC-enabled smart phones), but the harvested wireless power is sufficient to power external power hungry sensors and peripherals such as an active bistable matrix E-ink display. Firstly, we illustrate possible applications which use the NFC-WISP as a <b>passive</b> <b>display</b> tag, such as a battery-assisted perishable goods temperature display, and a motion monitor with wireless charging features. Secondly, this dissertation discusses how to improve the communication and power harvesting efficiencies by varying the number and the quality factor (Q) of receiver coils. A revision of NFC-WISP is demonstrated with improved communication and energy harvesting performance. Finally, this dissertation discusses how to choose antenna designs to meet the requirements of different systems...|$|E
