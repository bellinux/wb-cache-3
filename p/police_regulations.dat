6000|$|I {{hold that}} the {{proposition}} that slavery cannot enter a new country without <b>police</b> <b>regulations</b> is historically false. It is not true at all. I hold {{that the history of}} this country shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these [...] "police regulations" [...] which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another fact,--how came this Dred Scott decision to be made? It was made upon the case of a negro being taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory, claiming his freedom because the act of Congress prohibited his being so held there. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there without <b>police</b> <b>regulations?</b> There is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without <b>police</b> <b>regulations,</b> but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time.
