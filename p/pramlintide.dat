2500|$|A 2008 study {{reported}} a synergistic effect {{for weight loss}} with leptin and amylin coadministration in diet-induced obese rats by restoring hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin. However, in clinical trials, the study was halted at Phase 2 in 2011 when a problem involving antibody activity that might have neutralized the weight-loss effect of metreleptin in two patients who took the drug in a previously completed clinical study. The study combined metreleptin, {{a version of the}} human hormone leptin, and <b>pramlintide,</b> which is Amylin’s diabetes drug Symlin, into a single obesity therapy. [...] Finally, a recent proteomics study showed that human amylin shares common toxicity targets with beta-amyloid (Abeta), providing evidence that type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease share common toxicity mechanisms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pramlintide</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} by the FDA, for use by type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients who use insulin. [...] <b>Pramlintide</b> allows patients to use less insulin, lowers average blood sugar levels, and substantially reduces what otherwise would be a large unhealthy rise in blood sugar that occurs in diabetics right after eating.|$|E
5000|$|Amylin in {{its natural}} form is sticky—it clumps on needles and forms little rocks in the pancreas. Researchers first had to create a {{synthetic}} version that they could work with more easily and reliably. The inventors at Amylin Pharmaceuticals—Laura Gaeta, Howard Jones and Elisabeth Albrecht—altered amino acids in the molecule and created a new drug named <b>Pramlintide.</b> [...] In 1995, Amylin Pharmactietucals {{signed an agreement with}} Johnson & Johnson's LifeScan division to further develop <b>Pramlintide.</b> [...] A Phase II study made public in January 1997 showed <b>pramlintide</b> was safe to mix with leading short-acting and intermediate-acting commercial insulin products, with preliminary results suggesting it might improve glucose control. [...] Initial Phase III trial results released in August 1997 showed <b>Pramlintide</b> did show statistically significant results for type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes, helping modestly to improve glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) while also improving weight and cholesterol levels. But adult-onset type 2 diabetes affects far more people than type 1, and <b>pramlintide</b> showed significant benefits only at 6 months but not after 12 months.  In March 1998, seven months before the next trial data were due, J&J discontinued its partnership with Amylin.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pramlintide</b> (Symlin): is an Amylin agonist. It acts {{centrally}} (via the brain) {{to reduce}} food intake and blood sugar. It is {{most commonly used}} at mealtimes by people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pramlintide</b> is an {{analogue}} of amylin, a small {{peptide hormone}} that is {{released into the}} bloodstream by the β cells of the pancreas along with insulin after a meal. [...] Like insulin, amylin is completely absent in individuals with Type I diabetes.|$|E
50|$|Amylin Pharmaceuticals was a {{biopharmaceutical}} {{company based}} in San Diego, CA, that was founded in 1987. The company was engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drug candidates {{for the treatment of}} diabetes, obesity and other diseases. Amylin produced three drugs: Symlin (<b>pramlintide</b> acetate), Byetta (exenatide) and Bydureon (exenatide extended-release).|$|E
50|$|In recent years, several peptides, such as T-20 (also called DP178), Eptifibatide, Ziconotide, <b>Pramlintide,</b> Exenatide, and Bivalirudin, {{have been}} {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are on the market for use in the treatment of various diseases. More importantly, at the end of 2004, more than 600 peptides were either in development or advanced preclinical phases.|$|E

50|$|The area postrema is also {{indicated}} in an insulin treatment against type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A particular mechanism, {{employed by the}} drug <b>pramlintide,</b> acts mainly on the area postrema and results in decreased glucagon secretion, which in turn slows down gastric emptying and the satiety effect. This targeting of the area postrema allows an improvement of glycaemic control without causing weight gain. Since the drug acts on the area postrema, the doses must be titrated slowly to avoid inducing nausea in the patient.|$|E
50|$|Results are in µg/mL. Lower values {{indicate}} worsening glucose control, {{with more}} frequent and prolonged glucose values over 180 mg/dL. 10 µg/mL of 1,5-AG correlates to an average post meal glucose of 185 mg/dL, and is the target value in people with diabetes. Values over 10 µg/mL indicate glucose on average is below 180 mg/dL. Those with values below 10 µg/mL could benefit from nutritional counseling, and medications which target post meal glucose spikes, such as <b>pramlintide,</b> exenatide, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, repaglinide or rapid acting insulins.|$|E
