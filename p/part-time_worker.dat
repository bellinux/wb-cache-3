5|$|Davidson's family {{assumed that}} he would follow his father in {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition {{on the stage and}} in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a <b>part-time</b> <b>worker</b> at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E

40|$|Increases in {{the number}} of jobs for <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> has had little impact on the rate of {{unionisation}} for <b>part-time</b> <b>workers,</b> the majority of whom are women. The argument run by union officials in Japan is that women, and thus <b>part-time</b> <b>workers,</b> are not interested in industrial issues. This study explores an alternative explanation which is that union officials and "core" male workers are excluding women and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> in order to protect their own privileged position. Whilst it is acknowledged that the organisational structure of enterprise unions makes it difficult to incorporate the needs of <b>part-time</b> <b>workers,</b> it is the attitudes of "core" male workers and union officials to women as paid workers that is the major hurdle to the non-unionisation of <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> For women and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> there is no power in the union.

40|$|Using nationally {{representative}} household survey data from 1995 to 2006, this paper explores heterogeneity among female <b>part-time</b> wage (salaried) <b>workers</b> in post-apartheid South Africa, specifically distinguishing between individuals {{who choose to}} work <b>part-time</b> and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> who report wanting to work longer hours. As in studies of voluntary and involuntary part-time employment in other countries, the findings show that involuntary <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> in South Africa are outnumbered by voluntary <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> In contrast to other countries, however, involuntary underemployment in South Africa has not risen substantially over time, nor is there consistent evidence to suggest {{a positive correlation between}} involuntary underemployment and broad unemployment. Significant differences are found among <b>part-time</b> <b>workers,</b> with occupational characteristics specifically being identified as key correlates of involuntary part-time employment. The wage premium to female part-time employment in South Africa, identified in an earlier study, is shown to be robust also to a distinction among <b>part-time</b> <b>workers,</b> and involuntary <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> are found to have a stronger labour force attachment than women who choose to work part-time. ...|$|R
30|$|The monthly {{minimum wage}} {{does not apply}} to <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> Instead, in 2004 the {{government}} mandated a separate hourly minimum wage for <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> Because employers are not required to pay some non-wage benefits for <b>part-time</b> <b>workers,</b> the <b>part-time</b> hourly minimum wage is set above the monthly minimum wage for full-time workers (or, more specifically, the monthly minimum wage divided by the number of hours worked per month by a full-time worker). For this reason, it is not appropriate to compare the hourly wage of full-time workers to the hourly legal minimum wage for <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> when examining compliance.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the year}} 2000, 40.7% {{of the total}} Japanese work force were female workers, with 56.9% of those women being married, {{indicating}} the path of career woman was not just open to the single women of Japan. [...] {{by the end of}} the 1990s, women were concentrated in light manufacturing work, such as food production, as well as tertiary industries, like retail business, restaurants, and financing companies. In Japan, the idea of a <b>part-time</b> <b>worker</b> is someone who works for a set period, with no bonuses or fringe benefits. Many employers used part-time women workers as supplementary labor with no chance of advancement and unstable job security.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a <b>part-time</b> <b>worker</b> cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{more evidence that}} the wage differential is far smaller than is suggested by simple comparison of gross wages of full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> It is noted that to obtain a more reasonable measure of the full-time and part-time wage differential, {{it is necessary to}} adjust for differences in workers' characteristics, labour market conditions and sample selection. It is found that, in general, full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> exhibit different personal characteristics. In particular, full-time workers possess more human capital and experience than part-timers. Also, labour market conditions such as unions and pension plans favour full-timers. These differences may partly account for the wage disparity between full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> It was noted that the nonrandomness of the workers into full-time and part-time jobs influences the wage determination of both full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> The results indicate that the adjustment of the wage equations to reflect the above mentioned differences reduces the national wage differential between full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> by 10 %. The reduction is even larger across regions and industries. Another finding was that the wage determination processes between full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> do differ. ...|$|R

30|$|As far as {{the impact}} of {{increasing}} part-time work on poverty is concerned, <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> face a higher poverty risk than full-timers on average, but that hides substantial variation among <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> and across countries (Horemans and Marx 2013). <b>Part-time</b> <b>workers</b> obviously earn less annually because they work less, but in addition, they often face a pay penalty that is largely driven by occupational segregation (Bardasi and Gornick 2008; O’Dorchai et al. 2007). Involuntary <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> in particular can be placed in between the unemployed and ‘voluntary’ part-timers {{for a number of}} characteristics that determine their lower level of earnings, including human capital indicators like skills and labour market history (Wilkins and Wooden 2011; Wilkins 2006), and job characteristics like occupation and local labour market conditions (Barrett and Doiron 2001). Hence, limited earnings are a first reason why the poverty risk of <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> in general and involuntary part-timers in particular is higher.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which incidence of unemployment and duration of unemployment spells affect the wage differentials between full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> The estimation results of a sample selectivity bias-adjusted wage equation reveal that high incidences of unemployment are associated with low wages for both full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> However, the reduction in wages due to incidence of unemployment is larger for full-time workers in high-paid jobs than for their part-time counterparts. Duration of unemployment spells affects full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers</b> differently. In general, longer unemployment spells tend to increase the wages of full-time workers but tend to depress the wages of <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> Although the probability of unemployment is not a factor in explaining the wage differential, the duration of unemployment accounts for a substantial portion (about 66. 6 % in full sample) of the wage differential that exists between full-time and <b>part-time</b> <b>workers.</b> Copyright 2003 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
