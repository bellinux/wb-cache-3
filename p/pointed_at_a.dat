One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> light source such as a dot on the television screen. Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is then <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> photovoltaic cell. This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.|$|E

25|$|Since {{only one}} window in McEwen's car was open, {{and none of}} them had been shattered, Seedman knew the shot had to have been fired from Sheepshead Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the {{distance}} and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, he <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter—a local gas station owner who had been on his boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle.|$|E
500|$|A {{test of the}} Archimedes heat ray {{was carried}} out in 1973 by the Greek {{scientist}} Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the Skaramagas naval base outside Athens. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1m). The mirrors were <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> plywood [...] of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160feet (50m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of tar paint, which may have aided combustion. A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.|$|E
2500|$|It is incomprehensible that Ruddigore {{should ever}} have been {{considered}} less attractive than the other comic operas in the Savoy series. The libretto gives us Gilbert at his wittiest, and in the music we hear Sullivan not only in his most tuneful vein {{but also as a}} master of more subtle rhythms than he commands elsewhere. [...] Moreover, the parody is one that all can enjoy to the full, for here the satire is not <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> coterie, nor at this or that æsthetic movement, but at the absurdities of a melodramatic tradition which is nearly as old as the stage itself.|$|E

2500|$|Up to {{the last}} minute, Harkins and Felt {{remained}} unaware of the imminent coup, despite Đôn's fidgety behaviour. The pair had {{paid a visit to}} Đôn to discuss military issues at 09:15, but instead of the Vietnamese general hosting his American visitors as Joint General Staff headquarters, as was the norm, Đôn went to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam office. Although Felt was surprised, the Americans did not realise the reason for the unusual venue and then <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> map and wondered why two airborne battalions appeared to be idling. Đôn replied that they were going into battle, and Harkins nodded, unaware that they were entering Saigon. Harkins had told the generals earlier that he opposed a coup, so Đôn avoided the topic. Felt had been told of the existence of coup plans by Lodge, who falsely informed him that it was not imminent, saying [...] "There isn't a Vietnamese general with hair enough on his chest to make it go." [...] Felt later said that Đôn appeared to be calm and composed.|$|E
2500|$|Entering {{into the}} fifth season, the {{production}} team knew {{the series was}} not being renewed and had saved money from the budget of each season five episode {{for use in a}} climactic battle for the season finale. The money was instead used for the penultimate episode, [...] "Eye of the Storm", while the last episode ended with an unresolved cliffhanger. Insiders have various theories as to why this happened. The producers were concerned the Sci Fi Channel had lost interest in the show (even though it was their highest-rated program at the time) after they ceased supplying corrective notes for the episodes, and it was believed they did not even bother reading the scripts. One strict rule the Sci Fi Channel had was that a gun couldn't be <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> person's head. To test this rule, executive producer Bill Dial presented a script featuring a character getting his head shot completely off—which was ignored. Dial then presented the script for the final episode cliffhanger, which was also ignored. Some claim this was done to encourage fans to push for a sixth season, but members of the production team claim that the decision was personal.|$|E
2500|$|The men {{and their}} teams {{generally}} credited {{with the creation of}} the original Thunderbird are: Lewis D. Crusoe, a retired GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II; George Walker, chief stylist and a Ford vice-president; Frank Hershey, chief stylist for Ford Division; Bill Boyer, designer Body Development Studio who became manager of Thunderbird Studio in spring of 1955, and Bill Burnett, chief engineer. Ford Designer William P. Boyer was lead stylist on the original 1955 two-seater Thunderbird and also had a hand in designing the future series of Thunderbirds including the 30th Anniversary Edition. Hershey's participation {{in the creation of the}} Thunderbird was more administrative than artistic. Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris, Crusoe <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> sports car and asked Walker, 'Why can’t we have something like that?' Some versions of the story claim that Walker replied by telling Crusoe, [...] "oh, we're working on it"...although if anything existed at the time beyond casual dream-car sketches by members of the design staff, records of it have never come to light.|$|E
