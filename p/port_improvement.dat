40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} an {{evaluation}} of the feasibility of a <b>port</b> <b>improvement</b> project at General Santos City in the Philippines. For an analysis of this project, which is an expansion of an existing facility, the financial and economic analyses are conducted with and without the project. To identify the variables that would have an important impact on the project’s net present value and to assess the nature of the variability of the returns from this investment, a sensitivity and risk analysis is carried out. From this analysis we find that the proposed expansion plan of the port is neither financially nor economically justified. The mean and median of both financial and economic incremental net present values (NPVs) are significantly negative, showing that the financial and economic NPVs with the project are much lower than those without the project. This project turns out to be one that is sensitive to the time at which the project is started. The country will benefit if the project is postponed, but it should be postponed for a decade. Even with the expected poor financial and economic performance, the project does have major beneficiaries. The shippers of goods and livestock, and the shipowners will receive substantial benefits from the project. They will be strong and vocal proponents of this project because, while they receive most of the benefits of the project, they pay only a small share of the cost.

40|$|Ports and harbors (hereinafter "ports") {{have been}} {{developed}} at many locations in Japan as important public infrastructure through a government redistribution policy designed to achieve the balanced development of the national territory. Given low growth and fiscal reconstruction, however, the uniform development of the past {{will no longer be}} possible. A more selective approach will be required, and efficient and effective operation will also be needed. The question now is how effectively will Japan-given the heavy debt burden carried by both the central and local governments-be able to use its limited financial resources and how will it develop and operate ports to facilitate economic growth and affluent lifestyles. The government understands that an "appropriate sharing of roles" between what it calls "Super Central" ports and regional ports is important in terms of both development and operation as "specific tasks for the future to enhance the international competitiveness of industries. " The government also believes {{that it is important to}} strengthen regional cooperation among ports in Japan and to clarify cooperation between the central and local governments. Given these trends, there is a need to (1) examine the development of ports by the government in light of the appropriate sharing of roles between super central ports and regional ports, and (2) consider the operation of ports through regional cooperation of ports and management of ports (by cooperation among central and local governments and the private sector) that are already developed. However, these perspectives were not verified using data in past studies. In this paper, therefore, the following four studies are conducted as new research: 1. (Chapter 2) : The allocation of fiscal funds for <b>port</b> <b>improvement</b> in the past is demonstrated for the first time. 2. (Chapter 3) : The current status of regulations is organized, and barriers to efficient operation are clearly specified. 3. (Chapter 4) : The effect of policy toward efficient operation of ports is revealed using the lead time data as an efficiency indicator for the first time. 4. (Chapter 5) : The cost structure of ports is clarified using financial data of ports for the first time. As a result of these studies, the following points have been identified: 1. (Chapter 2) : Ports {{have been developed}} based on the principle of the balanced development of national territory. Also, funds have been allocated to cities in recent years. Meanwhile, debt of approximately 8 trillion yen has been incurred for the development of ports, and the allotment of the debt between the central and local governments will become a problem when the decentralized system is introduced in the future. Further transparency is needed for future development. 2. (Chapter 3) : Although various undertakings were made in the special deregulation zone, the effect is limited. Customs peculiar to Japan will need to be reformed to follow international trends. 3. (Chapter 4) : It is revealed that efforts to improve the efficiency of port operation contributed to improvements in the efficiency of port operation in terms of lead time and other aspects. 4. (Chapter 5) : It is clear that cooperation among ports is effective in improving cost efficiency, given the cost structure of ports. As just described, the studies of this paper show that the Japanese government should seek more transparent and effective development of ports and further improvements in port operation, while reforming customs peculiar to Japan. The cost analysis of ports has also revealed that links among ports with externalities are effective. This paper provides some important perspectives for considering future port policy: discovering new data that were not used in the past from the standpoint of evaluating public and fiscal policies, assessing polices for the development and operation of ports, and clarifying the cost structure of ports that is related to the future direction of policies. Although the strictness of verification remains an issue, the findings of this paper should contribute to the development of future studies. ...|$|E

They serve as a trade between the area and ocean transport and are utilized for asemnling and separating commoditis moved in mass or in holders. The ports are areas that are attached to a sea, ocean or river by connecting waterway and are essentially considered as entities. They are equipped with infrastructure and technical facilities of any kind {{that allow them to}} manage the load type for which they are specialized. Its basic function is to provide shelter to a different extent to ships, allowing the transfer of goods from one means of transport to another. They also function as node link between sea and land and are a clear example of intermodality (Tarantola, 2005). Truly, port advancements and their development have started, inspired by both monetary and mechanical weights coming about because of the worldwide modern upheaval. In {{the course of the last}} ten to a quarter century has been significant change and new thinking in the configuration and development of port and harbor structures. Port facilities are the main transportation bases for world trade. Ports are multi- purpose offices, a spot where rail, truck, scow, ship, and other transport techniques focalize. Along these lines, ports assume a key part in moving items both to different nations and to the inside of the nation. The port's terminal makes conceivable the docking and the taking care of, capacity and exchange of load. Ports are intended to handle a wide assortment of sorts of payload: mass or free, breakbulk in bundles. Seaborne exchange has expanded considerably, to a limited extent as a result of the huge redistribution of assembling to minimal effort areas (outsourcing) and to some extent due to continuous financial development. This underlines the developing significance of logistics to sort out the subsequent complex conveyance framework. The effects of port base ventures are expect of a positive impact of port throughput on neighborhood financial improvement. Notwithstanding, prove over the world underlines that this impact is frail, with versatility levels amongst throughput and business that are ordinarily under 0. 05 occupations for each 100 tons. This infers development in movement volumes are not connected with huge direct picks up in occupation. This versatility is among the weakest in the vehicle division, especially concerning air terminals, which are the foundation with the most astounding flexibility. Still, the work effects of ports are certain and are generally higher for the administration area than for the modern segment. Experimental proof underlines that port framework speculation ventures do cultivate financial improvement and are essential when a port is nearing its operational limit. Under such circumstances, the absence of ventures will obviously prompt extra externalities, to be specific blockage, which will undermine the aggressiveness of an entire area, if not a country. The presentation of holder frameworks for transporting products resulted in drastically diminishes ship pivot time, velocity and proficiency and wellbeing of taking care of a wide range of containerized cargoes. This new innovation radically changed the way to deal with port arranging. <b>Port</b> <b>improvement</b> can allude either to the production of another port or to the development of existing one, normally went for expanding its capasity or overhauling port operations. the issue of port improvements is analyzed at three diverse levels: national, nearby and port terminal. Complete investigation of the above can be a confused method since it presupposes a commitment by numerous masters of different controls. The analysis laid out in this study derives from discipline of a civil engineer specialized in port planning and design. As a very under the scope of submitted thesis a docking structure is designed under the regulations of specifications related to coastal and harbor structures. Theorems and formulas used for planning and design are taken from “DLH 2008 “ and “KLY 2007 ” Information and necessary descriptions for design of a harbor & related structures are submitted. The structure to be studied is chosen as pier and detailed information & design parameters are provided for piles and related upper structures. The system consisting of steel pipe piles and two types of parts’ loading conditions and combinations are analyzed systematically and the most unfavorable loading conditions are chosen for design calculations. The Designed pier is located in the 1 st degree earthquake zone. 20 000 DWT Cargo ship is chosen as design ship for calculations. Concrete class for structures is defined as C 30 &C 40 and rebar is defined as S 420. Modeling is completed with SAP 2000 V. 15. 2. 1 program. Detailed analyzes for planning and design of structure are in Chapter 5 and for both construction stage and final stage statical and dynamical analyzes are completed. Under the circumstances of changes in design ship dimensions, loading conditions and damages occurred due to seismic activities it is observed that repair and strengthening is appropriate for the structure. Most important thing in a design of docking structure is the design ship. Due to construction of the ports is very expensive and high scale constructions, it is very important to obtain maximum efficiency and life time for country’s economy. To define design ship it is chosen that biggest ship possible to dock. However with developing ship and logistic technology docking structure may face with a bigger ship than the design ship and thus docking structure can be damaged seriously and irreversibly by oversize ships which cause a very specific drop for capacity of docking structure. To avoid this additional construction or strengthening might be appropriate for docking structure under local data and statistics. Damages occurred on docking structures affects the service life critically. Damages vary as small and repairable or major and may affect stability, resistance and endurance. To operate structure properly, regular checks should be done to detect these damages and necessary repairs should be complete. In this section, several damage occurrences has been shown for increment of design ship dimensions and various preventions & repairs have been defined for these circumstances. All loading conditions should be separately and exhaustively inspected and every loading type should be included for design of coastal and harbor structures. Due to this kind of structures are large scale and costly constructions that complex and contain several disciplines; structures should be designed and constructed with more attention and importance. It is suggested that necessary preliminary examinations and surveys should be completed to maximize the efficiency of DGT method which is more applicable on site construction. It is also suggested that to define and repair damages properly under the regulations and to ensure necessary inspections, renovation of legislation is needed. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
