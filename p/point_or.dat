5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the <b>point</b> <b>or</b> clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single <b>point)</b> <b>or</b> a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E

During the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, the Ottomans built an artillery battery on the peninsula in order to bombard Fort St. Elmo.|$|E

30|$|The ACEs of the {{participants}} were assessed using two validated measures. First, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1997) was used, which includes five subscales: physical neglect, emotional neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse before they were 18, and has good convergent and discriminant validity (Bernstein et al., 1997). The following scores represent the condition under which the traumatic experience of a participant was given a score of 1 (each component had to be within the range specified below): emotional neglect ≥[*] 15 <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> physical neglect ≥[*] 10 <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> sexual abuse ≥[*] 8 <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> physical abuse ≥[*] 10 <b>points,</b> <b>or</b> emotional abuse ≥[*] 13 points.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the premium}} tax credits are {{mandatory}} spending, meaning all those eligible under the ACA receive them without Congressional appropriation. These adjust with premium increases to limit after-subsidy premium payments by ACA enrollees to a fixed percentage of income. Based on President Trump's threats {{to end the}} CSR payments during early 2017, several insurers and actuarial groups estimated {{this resulted in a}} 20 percentage <b>point</b> <b>or</b> more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year. In other words, premium increases expected to be 10% or less in 2018 became 28-40% instead.|$|E

5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km <b>point,</b> <b>or</b> half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E

5|$|In {{football}}, Ward {{was only}} the second African-American to win a varsity letter for the Michigan Wolverines football team, lettering in 1932, 1933, and 1934. In 1934, a controversy developed when Georgia Tech refused to play if Ward took the field, and university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Teammate Gerald R. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team {{in response to the}} university’s decision. After being excluded from the Georgia Tech game, Ward went on to score all 12 of Michigan's points that year outside of the Georgia Tech game, without another Wolverine even having an extra <b>point</b> <b>or</b> a field goal.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a <b>point)</b> <b>or</b> expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged.

5|$|On the Rochester end, NY33 {{primarily}} {{serves as}} a paralleling local route to Interstate490 (I-490), of less importance to the area's traffic patterns. Between the two cities, it is mostly a rural two-lane highway. The largest location on this stretch is the Genesee County city of Batavia, where NY33 reconnects to NY5 and crosses NY63 and NY98, two regionally important north–south highways. NY33 overlaps with all three routes at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> another as it traverses Batavia. A southerly alternate route, designated NY33A, leaves NY33 northeast of Batavia in Bergen and rejoins its parent in Rochester.|$|E

Boston College now had 28seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra <b>point</b> <b>or</b> win it with a two-point conversion.|$|E
5|$|The general {{statement}} of Apollonius' {{problem is to}} construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane, where an object may be a line, a <b>point</b> <b>or</b> a circle of any size. These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another; however, they are usually taken to be distinct, meaning {{that they do not}} coincide. Solutions to Apollonius' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles, although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius.|$|E
