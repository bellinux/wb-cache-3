40|$|This report {{discusses}} the methodology, formulas, and inputs {{needed to make}} characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> for Bacillus anthracis-contaminated and uncontaminated (or decontaminated) areas using a statistical sampling approach. Specifically, the report includes the methods and formulas for calculating the • number of samples required to achieve a specified confidence in characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> • confidence in making characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> for a specified number of samples for two common statistically based environmental sampling approaches. In particular, the report addresses an issue raised by the Government Accountability Office by providing methods and formulas to calculate the confidence that a decision area is uncontaminated (or successfully decontaminated) if all samples collected according to a statistical sampling approach have negative results. Key to addressing this topic is the probability that an individual sample result is a false negative, which is {{commonly referred to as}} the false negative rate (FNR). The two statistical sampling approaches currently discussed in this report are 1) hotspot sampling to detect small isolated contaminated locations during the characterization phase, and 2) combined judgment and random (CJR) sampling during the clearance phase. Typically if contamination is widely distributed in a decision area, it will be detectable via judgment sampling during the characterization phrase. Hotspot sampling is appropriate for characterization situations where contamination is not widely distributed and may not be detected by judgment sampling. CJR sampling is appropriate during the clearance phase when it is desired to augment judgment samples with statistical (random) samples. The hotspot and CJR statistical sampling approaches are discussed in the report for four situations: 1. qualitative data (detect and non-detect) when the FNR = 0 or when using statistical sampling methods that account for FNR > 0 2. qualitative data when the FNR > 0 but statistical sampling methods are used that assume the FNR = 0 3. quantitative data (e. g., contaminant concentrations expressed as CFU/cm 2) when the FNR = 0 or when using statistical sampling methods that account for FNR > 0 4. quantitative data when the FNR > 0 but statistical sampling methods are used that assume the FNR = 0. For Situation 2, the hotspot sampling approach provides for stating with Z% confidence that a hotspot of specified shape and size with detectable contamination will be found. Also for Situation 2, the CJR approach provides for stating with X% confidence that at least Y% of the decision area does not contain detectable contamination. Forms of these statements for the other three situations are discussed in Section 2. 2. Statistical methods that account for FNR > 0 currently only exist for the hotspot sampling approach with qualitative data (or quantitative data converted to qualitative data). This report documents the current status of methods and formulas for the hotspot and CJR sampling approaches. Limitations of these methods are identified. Extensions of the methods that are applicable when FNR = 0 to account for FNR > 0, or to address other limitations, will be documented in future revisions of this report if future funding supports the development of such extensions. For quantitative data, this report also presents statistical methods and formulas for 1. quantifying the uncertainty in measured sample results 2. estimating the true surface concentration corresponding to a surface sample 3. quantifying the uncertainty of the estimate of the true surface concentration. All of the methods and formulas discussed in the report were applied to example situations to illustrate application of the methods and interpretation of the results...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a need}} to {{evaluate}} the influence of risk factors such as patency of foramen ovale (PFO) or "daredevil" psychological profile on contra-indication policy after a decompression sickness (DCS). Methods: By crossing information obtained from Belgian Hyperbaric Centers, DAN Emergency Hotline, the press, and Internet diving forums, it was possible to be accountable for the majority if not all DCS, which have occurred in Belgium from January 1993 to June 2013. From the available 594 records we excluded all cases with tentative diagnosis, medullary DCS or unreliability of reported dive profile, leaving 209 divers records with cerebral DCS for analysis. Demographics, dive parameters, and PFO grading were recorded. Twenty-three injured divers were tested using the Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale V and compared to a matched group not involved in risky activities. Results: 41. 2 % of all injured came for iterative DCS. The average depth significantly increases with previous occurrences of DCS (1 st DCS: 31. 8 ± 7. 9 mfw; 2 nd DCS: 35. 5 ± 9. 8 mfw; 3 rd DCS: 43. 4 ± 6. 1 mfw). There is also an increase of PFO prevalence among multiple injured divers (1 st DCS: 66. 4 % 2 nd & 3 rd DCS: 100 %) with a significant increase in PFO grade. Multiple-times injured significantly scored higher than control group on thrill and adventure seeking (TAS), experience seeking, boredom susceptibility and total score. Conclusion: There is an inability of injured diver to adopt conservative dive profile after a DCS. Further work is needed to ascertain whether selected personality characteristics or PFO should be taken into account in the <b>clearance</b> <b>decision</b> to resume diving.

40|$|Recovery of spores from {{environmental}} surfaces {{is known to}} vary due to sampling methodology, techniques, spore size and characteristics, surface materials, and environmental conditions. A series of tests were performed to evaluate a new, validated sponge-wipe method. Specific factors evaluated were the effects of contaminant concentrations and surface materials on recovery efficiency (RE), false negative rate (FNR), limit of detection (LOD) - and the uncertainties of these quantities. Ceramic tile and stainless steel had the highest mean RE values (48. 9 and 48. 1 %, respectively). Faux leather, vinyl tile, and painted wood had mean RE values of 30. 3, 25. 6, and 25. 5, respectively, while plastic had the lowest mean RE (9. 8 %). Results show a roughly linear dependence of surface roughness on RE, where the smoothest surfaces have the highest mean RE values. REs were not influenced by the low spore concentrations tested (3 x 10 {sup - 3 } to 1. 86 CFU/cm{sup 2 }). The FNR data were consistent with RE data, showing a trend of smoother surfaces resulting in higher REs and lower FNRs. Stainless steel generally had the lowest mean FNR (0. 123) and plastic had the highest mean FNR (0. 479). The LOD{sub 90 } varied with surface material, from 0. 015 CFU/cm{sup 2 } on stainless steel up to 0. 039 on plastic. Selecting sampling locations {{on the basis of}} surface roughness and using roughness to interpret spore recovery data can improve sampling.

However, the European Commission has repeatedly stated that it cannot relax its application of EU merger control rules and that social concerns such as employment should be tackled by instruments designed specifically for them. This thesis assesses the development of the failing firm doctrine of the European Commission. The aim is to clarify how the Commission has reviewed failing firm arguments invoked by the merging parties and whether the decisions adopted during the recent economic crisis have affected this assessment. The thesis has a doctrinal standpoint as it attempts to explain how the European Commission has been and now is applying the failing firm defence. The failing firm defence is invoked when a concentration has anti-competitive effects but one of the parties to the transaction is in financial ruins and would be forced to exit the market without the merger. Competition authorities accept such arguments only when they assess that the merger is more favourable than the exit of the failing company and its assets from the market. It is argued here, that the European Commission has been fairly consistent with its application of the failing firm defence. Ever since clearing a concentration for the first time {{on the basis of the}} defence in Kali and Salz the Commission has insisted that the defence can be accepted only if the concentration in question is not causing the deterioration of the competitive structure. The purpose of the failing firm criteria it has established is to assist in the assessment of this causality. However, the 2013 <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> seem to have changed the way in which the failing division defence, where only a business branch or a subsidiary of a financially healthy parent company is failing, is assessed in EU merger control. According to the Commission’s initial approach such a transaction could not take place only due to unfulfilled expectations of the parent company. However, both in Nynas/Shell/Harburg Refinery and Aegean/Olympic II the Commission assessed the strategic interests of the parent companies to continue funding their subsidiaries, which it had not done in its previous decisions. The thesis also has a theoretical aspect to it. Competition law has an inherent law and economics approach which is followed here as a series of economic theories concerning merger control is introduced. These theories serve a purpose in educating the reader about the basic concepts relating to the appraisal of failing firm arguments. However, they are also used here for assessing how the European Commission’s failing firm doctrine has developed. It is argued here that the acceptance of the defence in Kali and Salz and in BASF/Eurodiol/Pantochim is compatible with the theory of contestable markets as the clearances were followed by de facto monopoly market structures. Similarly in the 2013 <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> the Commission seems to have taken due notice of the theory as the parent companies were allowed to exit unprofitable markets. However, the Commission has not relied on such reasoning every time it has faced failing firm arguments as its initial approach towards failing division arguments illustrates. Instead it can be argued that both the Commission’s failing firm doctrine as well as EU merger control on a more general level have been and still are influenced by a variety of partly contradicting economic theories...|$|R
