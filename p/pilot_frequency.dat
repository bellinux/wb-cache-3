The demodulation module involves division and arctan {{for which there}} is no dedicated hardware on a fixed-point DSP. Division is normally achieved either by using the Newton-Raphson method or by using conditional subtraction instruction. It is normally more efficient to use a table lookup approach. However, in a table lookup, if the denominator value is very small, the size of the table lookup will be very large for high accuracy. In this paper, we present a new method, which utilizes the in-phase representation of the denominator overcoming the table lookup problem.

The capability of resistance of intersymbol interference and bandwidth efficiency are improved, and multipath fading is effectively combated.

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this project {{is to build a}} stereophonic radio and investigate how noise is generated when building a stereophonic radio and minimizing its effects to obtain a quality sound. We investigated ways in which to get rid of noises, spikes, and harmonic distortion in the signal due to modulation and demodulation of the signal. After countless attempts we were able to minimize the noise generated for better sound quality. For this project, a stereophonic radio was built using MATLAB. The signals that were used as the input to radio was taken from an mp 3 file which was split into two channels using a software called Audacity. Each channel was saved as a file independent of one another and was later used as inputs to the Stereo Radio. The reason we chose to build a stereo radio compared to a mono radio was due to the reason that stereo is used vastly to produce the impression sound heard from various direction, as in natural hearing. Audio signal are routed through 2 channels (or more) to simulate depth/direction perception, like in the real world. The stereo radio mostly used in the movies, television, and FM radio stations. Planned Procedure There are two parts to building a stereophonic radio; the transmitter and the receiver. a. The Transmitter We assume that we have a pilot carrier of frequency of 7 kHz and fixed sampling frequency of 1000 k samples per unit second. The transmitter generally takes in two signals, named left (L) and right (R), and performs an addition and subtraction which gives us (L + R) and (L – R) signals.

30|$|Channel {{estimation}} is {{a necessary}} process before demodulation as the radio channel is frequency selective. For multicarrier modulation systems, the estimation is usually performed by sending a training data sequence, called pilot tones, {{on a set of}} carriers known to the receiver. The channel is then estimated at the <b>pilot</b> <b>frequencies</b> using the classical least squares (LS) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators [10]. When pilot tones are not available on every carrier, a process of interpolation is required to recover the complete channel response [11]. The interpolation may be done in the time domain [12]. A time-domain channel impulse response is obtained using an inverse Fourier transform of the channel estimated at the <b>pilot</b> <b>frequencies.</b> A filter may then be applied to reduce noise effects and border effects. An interpolated frequency domain channel is then processed by Fourier transform. Another solution may be to interpolate the channel in the frequency domain. Many algorithms, such as linear interpolation, low-pass filtering and spline cubic interpolation have been proposed [13, 14]. For most interpolation schemes, the channel is poorly interpolated on the carrier located on the edges of the frequency band. This effect may be neglected when the number of carriers per contiguous frequency band is large but may lead to significant performance degradation of the overall system when the multicarrier modulation is applied to a fragmented spectrum. A robust interpolation scheme for the complete spectrum, including the edges is therefore critical. A solution has already been proposed in [12] using interpolation in the time domain. Performance is increased at the price of higher complexity. Furthermore, instability issues are not addressed and may lead to noise enhancement. A stable and robust scheme based on interpolation filters in the frequency domain is proposed in this paper.|$|R
