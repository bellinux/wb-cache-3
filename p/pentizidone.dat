40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of fludalanine (MK 641) combined with <b>pentizidone</b> (MK 642) {{so as to}} give a fludalanine /D-cycloserine ratio of 1 : 1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - <b>pentizidone</b> on four different media, including a defined medium (DFN - 2), was studied. The MIC of fludalanine - <b>pentizidone</b> against 90 % of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN - 2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90 % MIC, {{less than or equal}} to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90 % MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, fludalanine - <b>pentizidone</b> was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone. In the absence of human serum, the MBC of fludalanine - <b>pentizidone</b> was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC...|$|E
