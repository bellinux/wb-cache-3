Aimed at the radial tire's {{randomness}} in {{the structural}} parameters and material properties, etc., took the strain energy {{density of the}} tire carcass <b>ply</b> <b>turn-up</b> end as the objective function {{on the basis of}} analysis of the tireâ€™s main failure modes, chose the tire carcass <b>ply</b> <b>turn-up</b> height and the rubber material parameters as random variable by using the Finite Element sensitivity analysis method(DSA), On this basis, adopted Monte-Carlo stochastic finite element method to calculate the reliability of the fatigue life of tire...|$|E
