The working group consisted of 208 students who study at Uludağ University Faculty of Education, Physical Education and Sport Department in the 2005 - 2006 academic year. The research has been designed as descriptive research. The material used in this research is Social Skills Inventory (SSI). As a result, students who participated in the research took an average 292. 60 points in SSI, 46. 61 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the emotional expressivity inferior scale (EE), 53. 41 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the emotional sensitivity inferior scale (ES), 41. 34 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the emotional control inferior scale (EC), 48. 05 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the social expressivity inferior scale (SE), 47. 93 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the social sensitivity inferior scale (SS) and 55. 26 <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the social control inferior scale (SC).
