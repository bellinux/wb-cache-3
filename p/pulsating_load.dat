The main tasks in this master thesis was to design a circuit, build a prototype, program a Digital Signal Processor, do a verification and make an evaluation. The Active Power Filter is average inductance current controlled, with a voltage controller as an outer loop. A state space representation was used for creating {{a model for the}} Active Power Filter and a controller. The Active Power Filter with the controller was simulated in SIMULINK in order to evaluating the controller performance. Thereafter, the controller parameter was implemented in a microprocessor and verified with the Active Power Filter, a <b>pulsating</b> <b>load</b> and DC/DC-converter. The Active Power Filter has not been integrated with the existing DC/DC-converter except for the switching frequency being the same. Therefore, there are some conflicts between the controllers in the two devices. The result of this master thesis show that by combining a passive-filter, active-filter and a DC/DC-converter, it is possible to get an undisturbed power supply on the input of the DC/DC-converter. It has also been shown {{that it is possible to}} decrease 300 Hz distortion. Also by using a digital control it is possible to create an adaptive system.

In addition to the behaviour of various supplementary materials (concrete with and without polymer dispersion and shotcrete) the influence of bonding layers, dowels and fabric reinforcement in the supplementary material could be studied {{as well as the}} influence of secondary treatment measures on the success of the repair work. To test the durability of the repair measures undertaken, the five beams supplemented on both sides and the two beams supplemented from below were first subjected to static and dynamic loads and then exposed to a one-year permanent load under natural weathering until they were loaded to the defined breaking load. By direct comparison of the load-bearing, cracking and deformation behaviour with beams supplemented in an unstressed state, the influence of the <b>pulsating</b> <b>load</b> during the application of the building component supplement on the success of the repair work could be established. The best results concerning the durability were displayed by the beams supplemented with normal concrete in formwork. This concerned above all the test specimens which were provided with dowels and fabric reinforcement in the supplementary layer and were given a corresponding secondary treatment. Shotcreting work is able to achieve similarly good results by using pre-fabricated materials. With the materials supplemented with PCC, the largest differences between the girders supplemented in an unstressed state and the girders supplemented under <b>pulsating</b> <b>load</b> were observed. However, the comparisons of the repair methods themselves also show that for large-surface building component supplements PCCs are not to be recommended. Adding bonding layers contains risks for all types of supplements; clear increases in the adhesive strength in the bond joint are not be be expected with thick-layered supplements by means of bonding layers.

The work reported in this paper deals with the analysis of a D. C. motor drive with elastic coupling and periodically varying load torque.

Wood-concrete composite structural members are usually applied in building structures. There are {{a relatively small number}} (in the low 100 s) of known bridge applications involving wood-concrete composites. A problem with using these novel composite members in bridges with high traffic is that the fatigue behavior of the composite member under long-term repeated loading is not known.

40|$|The project 'Strength and {{fracture}} behaviour of branch {{connections and}} elbows under internal pressure load and superimposed external bending moment' (BV IV) {{was carried out}} at MPA Stuttgart from 1989 to 1993. The objective of the project BV IV was to extend the foundations for a safety-relevant assessment of the main coolant pipes (MCP) of primary systems of pressurized water reactors (PWR). This was made by enhancing the state of knowledge of the load bearing behaviour (stress state) {{as well as the}} failure and fracture behaviour (crack initiation, crack propagation, leak-before-break) of degraded branch connections (T-branches) and elbows. The manufacture and design of the T-branches and elbows was performed according to the conditions in the plants KWO, KKS, KWB A, GKN- 1, KKU and KWB B. The dimensions corresponded to those of the main coolant pipe, resp. to the T-branch of the surge line. The T-branches and Elbows were on the one hand made of the material 20 MnMoNi 5 5 (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e > 150 J) {{and on the other hand}} of a MnMoNiV-special melt (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e #approx# 50 J). Both materials dispose of comparable strength properties. The loads applied during the tests covered the loading types and levels occurring in the plants as well as those postulated for accidents. In the case of the T-branches the flaws were applied on the inside of the nozzle corner shaped as a quarter-elliptical nozzle corner flaw longitudinal to the run pipe axis, in the case of the elbows the flaws (spark eroded notches, prefatigue cracks) were applied longitudinally on the inside in the area of the bend flanks. The flaw size was chosen in a way to be definitely found by nondestructive examination methods. Five tests with T-branches consisting of a run pipe with set-on nozzle and six tests with 90 elbows were carried out. An external bending moment (in the case of elbows in-plane bending moment with opening mode, in the case of T-branches in-plane at the branch pipe) was applied reaching maximum load resp. until occurrence of leakage (quasistatic load, in the case of elbows also <b>pulsating</b> <b>load).</b> This took place in the tests after attaining the test temperature (temperature of the upper shelf impact energy, for one T-branch made of the special melt the test temperature corresponded to the transitional range of the C_v-T-curve with T 30 C) as well as the static internal pressure (operational pressure, exception one test with T-branch with p_i = 11 MPa).

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{construction}} in the long-term performance is the main goal of structural designers. An example is seen in reinforced concrete (RC) bridge deck slabs that {{have been subjected to}} a large number of load repetitions. Therefore, many numerical and experimental studies have been conducted to predict the fatigue life of these slabs. Most of these studies focused on the modeling of fatigue behaviors of RC slabs reinforced with deformed bars. Until 1965, plain bars were used for reinforcing RC bridge slabs in a part of Japan. The fatigue damage of those slabs is more significantly observed than that of slabs reinforced with deformed bars. Moreover, old slabs were economically designed by small thickness without considering the fatigue resistance. Until 1965, plain bars were used for reinforcing RC bridge slabs in a part of Japan. The fatigue damage of those slabs is more significantly observed than that of slabs reinforced with deformed bars. Therefore, it is important to predict the fatigue behaviors of these slabs to decide a suitable repairing method. For the main goal of this research, a numerical method based on the bridging stress degradation concept is presented in this study to simulate the fatigue behaviors of RC slabs reinforced with plain bars under a moving load. Moreover, this study provides a numerical investigation to understand the fatigue failure and the improvement mechanism of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening. Finite element method (FEM) is used to solve a slab model of smeared crack elements. The cracked elements are modified according to the bridging stress degradation concept. This concept can be defined as the reduction of transferred stress across a crack plane under repetitive loading due to crack opening and closing process. Reinforcing bars are modeled as a smeared reinforcement according to its ratio in all directions. For plain reinforcing bars, the bond-slip effect between a reinforcing bar and its surrounding concrete is taken into consideration by adding equivalent bond strain to plain bar strain. To verify the numerical method, this study will be divided to three parts as follows. In the first part, plain concrete beam is analyzed under static and fixed <b>pulsating</b> <b>load.</b> Moreover, RC beams are analyzed using this numerical method under fixed pulsating and moving load. The numerical method succeeded in describing the propagation of cracked elements for fixed pulsating and moving load. The numerical results are compared with the experimental results to examine the applicability of this method for plain and reinforced concrete beams. In the second part, three RC slabs reinforced with plain bars are conducted using the proposed numerical method. Moreover, one RC slab reinforced with deformed bars is analyzed to compare with that reinforced with plain bars. The numerical model is verified using previous experimental data. This model is also able to capture the cracking pattern, change in displacement and rebar strain. The numerical results provide a good agreement with the experimental ones. In this part, a successful explanation of fatigue failure mechanism is existed. The effect of plain reinforcing bars on the fatigue behaviors is described. In the last, three full scale RC slabs reinforced with plain bars under moving load are analyzed using a proposed numerical method to simulate their fatigue behaviors. two of them were strengthened with externally bonded FRP sheets in longitudinal and transverse directions on slab bottom surface. The interfacial bond behavior between FRP sheet and concrete surface with its degradation due to fatigue loading are integrated to obtain appropriate numerical results. The propagation of cracked elements, center displacement evolution, cracking pattern and FRP strain are presented in this study. According to the results, FRP sheets play an important role to restrict the major crack opening. This leads to a slow degradation, longer fatigue life and smaller deformations for the strengthened RC slab. These numerical results are compared with the experimental results, and this comparison provides a good agreement...|$|E

Simulation has been done in MATLAB/Simulink and results are presented demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed power conditioning system...|$|R
40|$|Functionally graded (FG) {{materials}} are {{a class of}} composites that have a continuous variation of material properties from one surface to another and thus eliminate interface problems found in laminated composites. FG {{materials are}} typically manufactured from isotropic components such as metals and ceramics since they are used as thermal barrier structures in environments with severe thermal gradients. FG materials {{have the advantage of}} heat and corrosion resistance typical of ceramics and mechanical strength and toughness typical of metals. Buckling and parametric instability behavior of functionally graded shells subjected to in-plane static and <b>pulsating</b> <b>loads</b> are carried out in the present paper. The shell forms considered here are cylindrical (CYL), spherical (SPH) and hypar (HYP). Temperature change through the thickness is not uniform, and is governed by one-dimensional Fourier equation of heat conduction. Finite element formulation based on a higher order shear deformation theory is used to carry out the analyses. The parametric instability problem is solved using the Bolotin’s approach. The displacement fields are assumed in the form as [1], 2 * 3...|$|R
