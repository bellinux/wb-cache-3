5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} on 18 June 1948, {{prompted by a}} rise in Malayan Communist guerrillas in Malaya (later Malaysia). Australia, {{as a member of}} the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, first deployed two RAAF squadrons to the region in 1950. In 1955, the Far East Strategic Reserve was created as a concentration of Commonwealth military forces (primarily British, New Zealand, and Australian) in Malaya for the protection of that nation from communist threats. Australia's commitment included two destroyers or frigates on station at any time, plus an annual visit by an aircraft carrier, and additional ships as needed. Training for the <b>potentiality</b> of war was the main occurrence for ships deployed to the Strategic Reserve, with RAN personnel gaining experience in working as part of a larger naval organisation.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the <b>potentiality</b> of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E

Among the <b>potentialities</b> which every human being possesses is his intellectual capacity. High intellectual capacity, however, does not guarantee achievement. [ [...] . ...|$|R

25|$|In summary, {{the matter}} {{used to make}} a house has <b>potentiality</b> to be a house and both the {{activity}} of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to <b>potentiality</b> in formula, in time and in substantiality.|$|E
25|$|Actuality is the {{fulfillment}} {{of the end of}} the <b>potentiality.</b> Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists <b>potentiality,</b> therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.|$|E

25|$|Referring to <b>potentiality,</b> {{this is what}} a {{thing is}} capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the {{conditions}} are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the <b>potentiality</b> of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E

25|$|According to Heng-Ching Shih, the {{teaching}} of the universal Buddha-nature does not intend to assert the existence of substantial, entity-like self endowed with excellent features of a Buddha. Rather, Buddha-nature simply represents the <b>potentiality</b> to be realized in the future.|$|E
25|$|The Unconscious is both Will and Reason (the latter concept also {{interpreted}} as Idea) and the absolute all-embracing ground of all existence. Von Hartmann thus combines pantheism with panlogism {{in a manner}} adumbrated by Schelling in his positive philosophy. Nevertheless, Will and not Reason is the primary aspect of the Unconscious, whose melancholy career {{is determined by the}} primacy of the Will and the latency of the Reason. Will is void of reason when it passes from <b>potentiality</b> to actual willing. The original state of the Unconscious is one of <b>potentiality,</b> in which, by pure chance, the Will begins to strive. In the transition state, called that of the empty Will, there is no definite end. Acting on its own, the Will creates absolute misery.|$|E

25|$|A central {{feature of}} honing theory {{is the notion}} of a <b>potentiality</b> state. Honing theory posits that {{creative}} thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a <b>potentiality</b> state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.|$|E
25|$|According to Heng-Ching Shih, the tathāgatagarbha/Buddha-nature {{does not}} {{represent}} a substantial self (ātman).

25|$|According to some scholars, the Buddha nature {{which these}} sutras discuss, does not {{represent}} a substantial self (ātman). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness, and represents the <b>potentiality</b> to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, {{the intention of the}} teaching of Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical. According to others, the potential of salvation depends on the ontological reality of a salvific, abiding core reality — the Buddha-nature, empty of all mutability and error, fully present within all beings.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he {{sees the}} {{universe}} as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that <b>potentiality</b> exists {{for the sake of}} actuality. Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing. Now, each thing has certain potentialities {{as a result of its}} form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, we can say that the snake ought to slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.|$|E

Purpose of the work: {{determination of the}} criterion of estimate of the contractual value of the maximum power which {{makes it possible to}} compare the decisions by the load value and limits of the maximum adjustment for metallurgical enterprises. The distribution of the electric power consumption parameters of ferrous metallurgy enterprises obeys the rank law. To estimate the adjustment <b>potentialities</b> of enterprises, use can be made of the number of hours of the declared maximum load. Developed are methods for estimating the adjustment <b>potentialities</b> and power limitation with regard to the irregularity of power consumption and adjustment <b>potentialities</b> of the consumers and a method of a multi-version prediction of the power consumption parameters. The developed methods are introduced at some production associations. The methods of power limitation promote reduction of the expenditure of fuel-energy resources.
