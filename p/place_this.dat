5|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the three Black September members had arrived at Zagreb Airport, the hijacked Lufthansa jet also landed there and some time later, at 18:05, the handing-over took <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> {{happened}} without any reciprocal measures: The 18 hostages were not released yet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, on 28 January 1868, the naval Battle of Awa between the Shogunate and {{elements}} of the Satsuma Navy took <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> was Japan's second engagement between two modern navies. The battle, although small in scale, ended in favour of the Shogunate.|$|E
5|$|District I (2015 population: 415,906) {{covers the}} western part of Tondo and is the most densely {{populated}} Congressional District.

After the closure of the landfill in 1995, mid-rise housing buildings were built in <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> district also contains the Manila North Harbour Centre, the Manila North Harbor, and the Manila International Container Terminal of the Port of Manila.|$|E

In the Western Cape, the only province not won by the ANC, the DA increased its majority from 51.5% to 59.4%.|$|E
5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been discussed above, some modern historians <b>place</b> <b>this</b> attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2004, Patti Smith {{released}} Trampin' {{which included}} several songs about motherhood, partly {{in tribute to}} Smith's mother, who had died two years before.

Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of Horses in its entirety.

5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki's {{tombstone}} at Montmartre {{was designed}} by his friend and executor of his last will, painter Charles Pétiniaud-Dubos; it did not weather {{the passage of time}} well however, and in 1851 a new, similar tombstone was put in <b>place,</b> <b>this</b> one designed by Polish sculptor Władysław Oleszczyński. In 1927 Słowacki's remains were moved to Wawel Cathedral in Poland, but an empty grave still remains at Montmartre.|$|E
5|$|The {{communist}} Polish United Workers' Party dissolved {{itself in}} 1990 and {{transformed into the}} Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland. The Warsaw Pact was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991 and the last post-Soviet troops left Poland in September 1993. On 27 October 1991, the first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections since the 1920s took <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system.|$|E

5|$|The {{mortality}} rate {{for people who}} reach a hospital alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates <b>place</b> <b>this</b> number at 9%. The number of people reaching a hospital alive has increased, perhaps due to improved prehospital care or specialized treatment centers. Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first two hours of arrival. The sooner a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the {{mortality rate}}; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries that prove fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{name came}} from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All {{that can be seen}} of the Burne, or Bourne, is the small pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies on the site of a Saxon ‘moot’, or meeting <b>place.</b> <b>This</b> gives Motcombe its name.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after this}} loss Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias <b>place</b> <b>this</b> attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the list}} of largest {{shopping}} malls in Canada, the Scarborough Town Centre is the tenth largest in the country and the fourth largest in the GTA. It is located next to the Scarborough Civic Centre, Albert Campbell Square, and Consilium <b>Place.</b> <b>This</b> area was developed as a city centre under the old City of Scarborough government. The Scarborough Walk of Fame is also located in the Town Centre, consisting of plaques embedded in the floor to honour notable residents, past and current. The inaugural inductees included National Basketball Association player Jamaal Magloire, Olympic gold medalist Vicky Sunohara, and eight prominent residents who contributed to advances in medicine, arts, and the community.|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, {{was built}} around a core of four infantry battalions. Three of these were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting {{since the start of}} the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, <b>place</b> <b>this</b> figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this <b>place,</b> <b>this</b> name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E
