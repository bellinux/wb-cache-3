5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the <b>possessor</b> of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the <b>possessor,</b> and are inflected {{to agree with the}} noun they are attached in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between masculine and feminine singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E

40|$|Most child {{pornography}} is distributed online. It {{is estimated that}} 3 % to 15 % of {{child pornography}} consumers are juveniles. The present study analyzed a consecutive sample of 54 male juveniles convicted of the possession of child pornography. Demographic characteristics, criminal history, and subsequent offending were assessed from criminal files and official reports. Juvenile <b>possessors</b> of child pornography were compared to three different groups of juveniles: Juvenile <b>possessors</b> of other illegal pornography (n = 42), juveniles who committed a sexual contact offense against a child (n = 64), and juveniles who committed a sexual contact offense against a peer or adult (n = 104). Juvenile <b>possessors</b> of child pornography {{were found to have}} downloaded the illegal material more frequently and over a longer time period than juvenile <b>possessors</b> of other illegal pornography. Furthermore, juvenile <b>possessors</b> of child pornography differed from juveniles who had committed a sexual contact offense in terms of demographics and showed fewer previous and subsequent offending than juveniles who sexually offended against a peer or adult. We conclude that juvenile <b>possessors</b> of child pornography need a specific target intervention focusing on dysfunctional Internet use and sexually deviant arousal...|$|R

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} oft-made claim that <b>possessors</b> are (animate) locations. I argue this possessor-as-location {{hypothesis}} is valid {{only as a}} claim about conceptual structure rather than grammatical representation. I show that the apparent similarity between <b>possessors</b> and lo-cations {{is largely due to}} morphological marking: <b>possessors</b> may be indicated with locative morphology. Argument realization patterns of possessive and locative predicates, however, indicate <b>possessors</b> and locations to have different semantic prominence relative to their re-spective co-arguments: <b>possessors</b> rank higher than possessees, while locations rank lower than themes. I account for alternative argument realization patterns of possessive predicates, i. e. own/have vs belong, through the interacting factors of semantic prominence and semantic class. The effects of semantic prominence are captured by the default argument realization principle Isomorphy, which preserves semantic prominence in syntactic prominence. The se-mantic class of <b>possessors</b> shows a preference for oblique morphological marking. Concep-tual similarity with locations allows locative marking to satisfy this preference. In languages where oblique marking is disallowed on grammatical subjects, this preference conflicts with the higher semantic prominence of <b>possessors,</b> leading to different possibilities for possessive predication structures. The current approach better accommodates the various patterns found in possessive predication structures, many of which are non-locative. ∗This paper is based on several chapters of my 2005 Stanford University dissertation. Beth Levin deserves the most thanks for comments leading to the current version. At various stages, I have received valuable comments an...|$|R

40|$|Absolute Pitch (AP) is {{the ability}} to {{identify}} a musical note without the use of an external reference. The literature focusses on the accuracy of AP <b>possessors</b> and not on reaction times (RTs) in identifying musical notes. Investigating RT differences between observers with and without AP will further our understanding of the processes involved in AP. This thesis aimed to investigate the RTs of AP <b>possessors</b> and provide a new account of the cognitive mechanisms involved in AP. Three studies were conducted. The first was a tone identification study which was designed to identify RT profiles for AP <b>possessors</b> in comparison to non-AP <b>possessors</b> (NAP <b>possessors).</b> This study was designed to show that AP <b>possessors</b> were quicker and more accurate than NAP <b>possessors</b> in tone identification and that they identified each note of a chromatic scale with varying degrees of difficulty. The RT profile indicates that some notes are identified quicker than others and a relative process was used to identify some notes. The second was an interval identification study which was designed to identify the strategy used by AP <b>possessors</b> in interval identification to identify if an AP or RP strategy was used. The results showed intervals were identified with a similar RT profile to tones indicating a relative process used for both notes and interval identification. The data from these two studies was used to construct the first formal model of absolute pitch (the Multiple Reference Pitch Model) which provides an explanation of AP using three reference points and a relative strategy. The third study aimed to test this model by inducing anchors into participants and developing a sense of relative judgment. Further directions and limitations are discussed in the final chapter. These include the use of a case study design with only three participants and further applications of the model in other domains in Psychology...|$|R

Possessed nouns are marked for person of <b>possessor.</b> In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E

5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd who took care of pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the <b>possessor</b> of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E

(Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its <b>possessor.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} <b>possessor</b> of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Schmitt was a {{significant}} blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, {{he was the most}} experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the sieges at Kehl and Hünigen, the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winterthur and Zürich. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement, Franz von Weyrother. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at Hohenlinden in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and <b>possessor</b> of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory, but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was considered one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.|$|E
40|$|The pitch {{identification}} {{performance of}} absolute pitch <b>possessors</b> {{has previously been}} shown to depend on pitch range, key color, and timbre of presented tones. In the present study, the dependence of pitch identification performance on key color and timbre of musical tones was examined by analyzing hit rates, reaction times, and pupillary responses of absolute pitch <b>possessors</b> (n 59) and nonpossessors (n 512) during a pitch identification task. Results revealed a significant dependence of pitch identification hit rate but not reaction time on timbre and key color in both groups. Among absolute pitch <b>possessors,</b> peak dilation of the pupil was significantly dependent on key color whereas the effect of timbre was marginally significant. Peak dilation of the pupil differed significantly between absolute pitch <b>possessors</b> and nonpossessors.
