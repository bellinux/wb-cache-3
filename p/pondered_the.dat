5|$|Wright's sermon left a great {{impression}} on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon {{in detail in}} his memoir Dreams from My Father. Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fifth}} season {{introduced}} former Miss USA Moore and football player Kordell Stewart's wife Williams, Leakes reconciled with Gregg and <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> possibility of remarrying him. Zolciak {{was forced to}} move out of her mansion, which she and Biermann had attempted to purchase less than a year earlier, Leakes began to question Moore's seemingly unfaithful behavior towards her boyfriend Walter during a group trip to Anguilla, which began a feud between Leakes and Williams against Moore. Moore wished to marry Walter although their relationship had begun to deteriorate, while Parks and Moore created competing workout DVDs after plans to make the project a joint venture proved unsuccessful. Toward the end of the season, Williams attempted to revive her failing marriage to Stewart with therapist sessions.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E

25|$|Gluck {{had long}} <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> {{fundamental}} problem {{of form and}} content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera should really be and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E

500|$|The {{arrival of}} the James Caird at King Haakon Bay was {{followed}} by a period of rest and recuperation, while Shackleton <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> next move. [...] The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast. [...] To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island, or a land crossing through its unexplored interior. The condition of the James Caird, and the physical state of the party, particularly Vincent and McNish, meant that the crossing was the only realistic option.|$|E
500|$|The satirical single [...] "Sunny Afternoon" [...] was {{the biggest}} UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and {{displacing}} the Beatles' [...] "Paperback Writer". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> band's direction.

[...] Not only does Nancy have the freedom to go where she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as The Dana Girls do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and fix a flawed distributor, prompting Paretsky to argue that in [...] "a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model." ...|$|E

500|$|Understanding that renewed {{hostilities}} with Britain {{were now}} a real possibility, Kruger began to pursue armament. Relations with Germany had been warming for some time; when Leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895, he took with him {{an order from}} the Transvaal government for rifles and munitions. [...] Conferring with the Colonial Office, Rhodes <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> co-ordination of an uitlander revolt in Johannesburg with British military intervention, and had a force of about 500 marshalled on the Bechuanaland–Transvaal frontier under Leander Starr Jameson, the Chartered Company's administrator in Matabeleland. On 29 December 1895, ostensibly following an urgent plea from the Johannesburg Reform Committee (as the National Union now called itself), these troops crossed the border and rode for the Witwatersrand—the Jameson Raid had begun.|$|E
500|$|Biographical readings, {{in which}} critics {{would try to}} connect {{passages}} in the plays and sonnets to specific events in Shakespeare's life, {{are at least as}} old as the Romantic Period. Many famous writers, scholars, and critics from the 18th to the early 20th century <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> connection between Hamnet's death and Shakespeare's plays. These scholars and critics included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edward Dowden, and Dover Wilson, among others. In 1931, C. J. Sisson stated that such interpretations had [...] "gone too far". In 1934, Shakespeare scholar R. W. Chambers agreed, saying that Shakespeare's most cheerful work was written after his son's death, making a connection doubtful. In the mid-to-late 20th century, it became increasingly unpopular for critics to connect events in authors' lives with their work, not just for Shakespeare, but for all writing. More recently, however, as the ideas of the New Criticism have lost prominence, biographical interpretations of Hamnet's relationship to his father's work have begun to re-emerge.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} The World Without Us was {{suggested}} to Weisman in 2004 by Josie Glausiusz, {{an editor at}} Discover.

His Discover article, [...] "Earth Without People", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in The Best American Science Writing 2006 anthology, describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned Korean Demilitarized Zone and how nature would overwhelm the built environment of New York City. Using interviews with paleoecologists, the article speculates that megafauna would return and that forest cover, like the Białowieża Forest, would spread over Europe and the eastern United States. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks.|$|E

500|$|The name Spiderland {{originates}} from McMahan's younger brother, {{who thought}} that the record sounded [...] "spidery". The album's black-and-white cover photograph, which depicts {{the members of the}} band (Brashear, McMahan, Walford and Pajo, from left to right) treading water in the lake of an abandoned quarry, was taken by Will Oldham. An article in The Stranger credited the cover for creating a mystique surrounding Slint, noting [...] "ost people only had seen Slint as four heads floating in a Kentucky quarry on Spiderland's cover. Listeners <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> band's sparsely adorned black-and-white covers as if they were runes bearing secrets." [...] Chris Gaerig of the Michigan Daily wrote, [...] "the cover of Slint's masterful Spiderland captures the joyous fear and violence of the album so precisely it shakes souls. The group—submerged in a lake to their chins with deranged smiles—seems to be stalking you, hovering out of the black-and-white façade." [...] Several other promotional images have been taken from the same photo session with Oldham.|$|E
500|$|In May 1842 {{when the}} Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island {{came to a}} head, Tyler <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> request of the {{governor}} and legislature to send in federal troops to help suppress it. The insurgents under Thomas Dorr had armed themselves and proposed to install a new state constitution. Before such acts, Rhode Island had been following the same constitutional structure that was established in 1663. Tyler called for calm on both sides, and recommended that the governor enlarge the franchise to let most men vote. Tyler promised that in case an actual insurrection should break out in Rhode Island he would employ force to aid the regular, or Charter, government. He {{made it clear that}} federal assistance would be given only to put down an insurrection once underway, and would not be available until violence had taken place. After listening to reports from his confidential agents, Tyler decided that the 'lawless assemblages' had dispersed and expressed his confidence in a [...] "temper of conciliation as well as of energy and decision" [...] without need of federal forces. The rebels fled the state when the state militia marched against them, but the incident led to broader suffrage in the state.|$|E
500|$|While traveling, Applewhite and Nettles <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> life of St.Francis of Assisi {{and read}} works by authors {{including}} Helena Blavatsky, R.D. Laing, and Richard Bach. They kept a King James Version of the Bible {{with them and}} studied several passages from the New Testament, focusing on teachings about Christology, asceticism, and eschatology. Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by Robert A.Heinlein and Arthur C.Clarke. By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles' beliefs had solidified into a basic outline. They concluded {{that they had been}} chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people. They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus' reincarnation as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite. Furthermore, they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the Book of Revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities, often referring to themselves as [...] "The Two", or [...] "The UFO Two". They believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as [...] "the Demonstration", was to prove their claims. To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received.|$|E

500|$|As {{his daughters}} {{approached}} womanhood, Liszt {{felt that a}} change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged (over their mother's bitter protests) for them to move to Berlin. Here they {{were placed in the}} care of Franziska von Bülow, whose son Hans was Liszt's most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls' musical education while Frau von Bülow supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von Bülow, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner's Lohengrin at Weimar in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, Bülow studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. Bülow was quickly impressed by Cosima's own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: [...] "he fell at my feet, covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> mystery, without being able to solve it".|$|E
500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but now {{it was time to get}} back to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1867, Stowe {{followed}} {{her son to}} Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her {{to spend more time}} on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once, writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become [...] "young & frisky". She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about [...] across the St. Johns River. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe {{fell in love with a}} cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking [...] "How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?" [...] She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and <b>pondered</b> <b>the</b> effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: [...] "I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos—where the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing.
