5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The <b>polymers</b> are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable <b>polymers</b> themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin <b>polymers</b> cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin <b>polymers</b> are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E
