40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} silver {{nanowires}} {{were used as}} the transparent conductive electrode on a crystalline silicon solar cell {{in place of the}} commonly used screen <b>printed</b> <b>grid.</b> Light transmission and surface characterisation of the cells displays an average of 22 % more light transmission than the physical non-AgNW shaded area of the cell surface. Further to this it is observed that plasmonic effects result in an increased scattering of incoming light into the cell, which also reduced the amount of light reflected from the cell’s front plane. The cells with silver nanowire electrodes did not, however, show improved current–voltage characteristics compared to cells without a front electrode. This is attributed to the overall low light transmission as a result of silver nanoparticles present in the electrodes and poor electrical connection between silicon cell and electrode. Finally, a large reduction in the mass of silver used for the nanowire electrodes was observed when compared to standard screen <b>printed</b> <b>grid</b> fingers...|$|R

40|$|MEBES ® 50 kV {{mask pattern}} {{generators}} use Raster Graybeam ™ writing, providing an effective grid that is 32 × finer than the <b>print</b> <b>grid.</b> The electron beam size and print pixel size are variable between 60 nm and 120 nm, allowing a tradeoff between resolution and write time. Raster scan printing optimizes throughput by transferring precisely {{the amount of}} data to the mask {{that is consistent with}} the chosen resolution. As with other raster output devices, mask write times are not affected by pattern complexity. This paper examines the theoretical performance of Raster Graybeam for model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) patterns and provides examples of mask patterning performance. A simulation tool is used to model the MEBES eXara ™ system writing strategy, which uses four writing passes, interstitial <b>print</b> <b>grids,</b> offset scans, and eight dose levels per pass. It is found that Raster Graybeam produces aerial image quality equivalent to the convolution of the input pattern data with a Gaussian point spread function. Resolution of 90 nm is achieved for equal lines and spaces, supporting subresolution assist features.

One {{limitation of}} endomicroscopy {{is the small}} field of view which can however be extended using mosaicing techniques. In this paper, we describe a methodological framework aiming to reconstruct a mosaic of endomicroscopic images acquired following a noisy robotized spiral trajectory. First, we infer the topology of the frames, that is the map of neighbors for every frame in the spiral. For this, we use a Viterbi algorithm considering every new acquired frame in the current branch of the spiral as an observation and the index of the best neighboring frame from the previous branch as the underlying state. Second, the estimated transformation between each spatial pair previously found is assessed. Mosaicing is performed based only on the pairs of frames for which the registration is considered successful.

The emitter of these cells is usually covered by Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCO) that ensures lateral conductivity and Anti Reflection Coating (ARC).

40|$|We {{report the}} self-aligned {{passivation}} of a current distribution grid for an organic {{light emitting diode}} (OLED) anode using a pulsed Joule heating method to align the passivation layer accurately on the metal grid. This method involves passing an electric current through the grid to cure a polymer dielectric. Uncured polymer is then rinsed away, leaving a patterned dielectric layer that conforms to the shape of the grid lines. To enhance the accuracy of the alignment, heat conduction into the substrate and the transparent electrode is limited by using short current pulses instead of a constant current. Excellent alignment accuracy of the dielectric layer on <b>printed</b> metal <b>grid</b> lines has been achieved, with a typical 4 -μm dielectric overhang. In addition to good accuracy, pulsed Joule heating significantly cuts down process time and energy consumption compared to heating with a constant current.

In particular, the increasing number of pixel made available for each picture allows developing software that is able to perform precise surface characterizations. In the present paper the interest is oriented into two directions. The firs one concerns the detecting the geometric features of surfaces through digital image comparison. The method does not require stereo image processing but it is based on a single camera vision. The base of this first part of the work regards the displacements of a grid virtually applied on the surface. To this goal the real <b>printed</b> <b>grid</b> case is firstly discussed. The grid virtually attached to the pictures identifies a finite element mesh associated to the comparing images. The second part aims to evaluate surface strains experienced on the specimen surface. The algorithm performs the analysis of the two comparing images, before and after the application of loads. The method is based on differential calculation of the Jacobian matrix and the solution of an over-determined system of equations. The differential calculation is truncated at the first order and iteratively applied. Two different strategies are proposed: a partial grouping of pixels by equation averaging; the use of Hu’s invariants applied to sub-images. These two approaches are discussed and compared...|$|R

40|$|Aerosol jet {{printing}} is investigated {{as a new}} deposition {{method for}} a current collecting grid in indium tin oxide (ITO) free organic solar cells with an inverted layer sequence. In this device configuration, the ITO layer which usually serves as the hole contact {{is replaced by a}} transparent highly conductive poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer in combination with a silver grid deposited by aerosol jet printing. Since the cells are illuminated from the grid side, the optimisation of the grid design is a trade-off between area coverage and conductivity of the grid lines. These factors have been controlled by the printing parameters such as chuck temperature, printing speed and the number of printing passes. In this paper, we demonstrate that continuous, conductive grid lines with a minimum line width of 58 mu m can be processed {{on the top of the}} PEDOT:PSS layer. For single pass printing the area coverage varied from 5. 8 % to 11. 9 % with corresponding effective sheet resistances ranging from 8. 9 Omega to 1. 5 Omega.

The AgNWs form a random network on a substrate of choice when being drop casted. ALD encapsulation of AgNWs guarantees a conformal and thickness controlled coating of the wires e. g. by the selected aluminum doped zinc oxide AZO. Annealing of the AgNWs prior to ALD coating, yield a local sintering of AgNWs at their points of intersection, which improves the conductivity of the composite electrodes by reducing their sheet resistance. To demonstrate the performance of these AgNW AZO composite transparent electrodes, they were used as a top electrode on wafer based silicon Si solar cells. A novel combination of scanning electron microscopy and image processing is used to determine thedegree of percolation of the AgNWs on large areas of the nano composite AgNW AZO electrodes. Our results show that the solar cell with percolated AgNW AZO electrode show the highest short circuit current density 28 mA cm 2 and a series resistance in the same order of magnitude compared to reference solar cells with a thermally evaporated silver grid electrode.

Sheet to sheet (S 2 S) inkjet printing as contactless and highly flexible technology and gravure printing suitable for large-area roll to roll (R 2 R) production combined with production processes like back injection molding or resin transfer molding offer great potential to fulfill the mentioned requirements in the field of smart lightweight applications. The main focus is the S 2 S and R 2 R manufacturing of conductive grid patterns as well as sensor arrays on flexible substrates using inkjet and gravure printing combined with infrared (IR) radiation for functionality formation. The conductive patterns are integrated into composite materials by back injection molding or resin transfer molding enabling data communication, sensor applications or power supply in the field of automotive or clean energy. The conductive grids can increase the directivity of an antenna signal and hence support utilization of 24 GHz radio together with plastic encapsulation in lightweight components e. g. in the automotive sector [1].
