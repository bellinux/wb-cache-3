The conclusion of this previous work was that more quality assurance was needed to guarantee concordance between actual and declared concentrations of these nutrients i. e., lutein (L) zeaxanthin (Z) and meso-zeaxanthin (MZ) in commercially available supplements. Since this publication, we performed further analyses using different commercially available macular carotenoid supplements. Three capsules from one batch of eight products were analysed at two different time points. The results have been alarming. All of the <b>powder</b> <b>filled</b> products (n = 3) analysed failed to comply with their label claim (L: 19 – 74 %; Z: 57 – 73 %; MZ: 83 – 97 %); however, the oil filled soft gel products (n = 5) met or were above their label claim (L: 98 – 122 %; Z: 117 – 162 %; MZ: 97 – 319 %). We also identified that the carotenoid content of the oil filled capsules were stable over time (e. g., L average percentage change: − 1. 7 %), but the <b>powder</b> <b>filled</b> supplements degraded over time (e. g., L average percentage change: − 17. 2 %).

40|$|During {{the filling}} of a {{container}} by a dry granular material (ex. storage in a silo, mixer container, packaging), the powder flow {{interacts with the}} side walls and {{the bottom of the}} bowl, and leads {{to the creation of a}} semi-confined free surface in the “feeding zone” and of particle jamming under the free surface. The “feeding zone” corresponds to a zone of strong energy dissipation induced by shocks and frictions between the grain bed formed, the particles in movement and walls of the bowl. The resultant free surface takes the shape of a heap and the surface rises upward the bowl with the <b>powder</b> <b>filling.</b> Once "buried" within the heap, particles are immobilized under the free surface. Particle jamming can be postponed according to the possible local mobility. The stabilization of the intergranular force network inside the heap leads to the establishment of a local stress field. The intensity and the distribution of these stresses can be very different according to the elastic and frictional properties of the particles and also according to the <b>powder</b> <b>filling</b> conditions (size of the bowl, mechanical properties of the walls, flowing properties of the particles, initial velocity of the particles, etc.). The knowledge of the local stress field is important for a mechanical stability of storages or a grain re-mobilization grains under the influence of a shear stress (mixing, flowing) or a compression stress (packing, tapping, compaction). This work concerns the experimental identification of the static mechanical state within an ensiled granular material by measuring the force applied on a sensor immersed inside the heap. The experimental analysis of the <b>powder</b> <b>filling</b> and of the stabilized bed formation is realized with granular materials of contrasted properties (durum wheat semolinas, agglomerates), which are poured according to a calibrated protocol in a cell in order to follow the evolution of the free surface by recording successive pictures. The results allow to characterize the formation of a heap with repose rest angle more or less important. This structure, which results from local granular arrangements, suggests the expression of two main modes of layout: the one by "layering" with a lateral homogeneity of the local stresses (at least until a certain distance of the side walls), the other one in "dune", (sloping heap) with a lateral heterogeneity of the local stresses. The joint analysis of the local vertical stresses in the granular bed, reveals a direct relation between the structure of the free surface and the distribution of the local stresses. Several modes of stress distribution could be distinguished and could be classified according to a parameter of uniformity and their gap from an ideal hydrostaticity...|$|E

40|$|Il s'agit d'une {{publication}} soumiseThe free surface, {{which results}} from the filling of a container by a dry granu- lar material, takes {{the shape of a}} heap. This shape is induced by the particle properties like their size, their friction, their restitution coefficient but also by their kinetic energy induced by the filling conditions. The stabilization of the intergranular contact network inside the heap leads to the formation of a spe- cific local stress field. For five wheat-based powders of same origin but with contrasted properties, beds are formed in a 2 D semi-confined cell using a point source. Captures of the bed free surface are realized from pictures taken at different filling states. The local vertical force is measured {{in the center of the}} cell at different depths. This work highlights a correlation between the local vertical force profile and the shape of the heap during the filling. Two modes of force distribution can be distinguished and classified according to a parameter of uniformity. These distinctions are linked to the different shapes of the heap, quasi-layering or dune.

Placebo devices are commonly used to instruct patients. It is not obvious that patients, who inhale with an adequate flow through an empty placebo Diskus, would {{also be able to}} do so with active inhalers containing a strip with powder. The presence of powder may result in a change in resistivity. We compared the resistivities of a placebo Diskus being empty; a <b>powder</b> <b>filled</b> Diskus inhaler and a Diskus inhaler with an empty blister. METHODS: A Diskus inhaler was placed in a box, which enabled measurement of pressure drop and flow rates. Ten placebo and ten Ventolin Diskus inhalers were measured. Twelve pressure- and flow-profiles were recorded through each device. After each simulated inhalation through a <b>powder</b> <b>filled</b> blister, a second inhalation was performed through the empty blister. The resistivity was calculated by pressure-flow equation.

40|$|We perform {{experiments}} and discrete element simulations on the dosing of cohesive granular materials in a simplified geometry. The setup is a canister box where the powder is dosed {{out through the}} action of a constant-pitch coil feeder connected to a motor. A dosing step consists of a rotation followed by a period of rest before the next step. From the experiments, {{we report on the}} operational performance of the dosing process through a variation of dosage time, coil pitch and initial <b>powder</b> <b>filling</b> mass. We find that the mass per dose shows an increasing linear dependence on the dosage time and rotation speed. In contrast, the mass output from the canister is inversely proportional (as expected) to {{an increase in the number}} of coils. After calibrating the interparticle friction and cohesion, we show that DEM simulations with upscaled particles can quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings for smaller masses but also overestimate arching and blockage. For some parameters, with appropriate homogenization tools, further insights into macroscopic fields can be obtained. This work shows that the calibration of (upscaled) meso-particle properties is a viable approach to overcome the untreatable number of particles inherent in experiments with fine, cohesive powders and thus opens the gateway to simulating their flow in more complex geometries...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Although highly {{effective}} in plaque and stain removal, {{the use of}} air polishing devices (APDs) on denuded root surfaces may lead to clinically relevant loss of tooth substance. As the amount of powder emitted by an APD may {{have a significant impact}} on the safety and efficacy of the instruments, the purpose of the study was to quantify the amount of powder emitted by APDs depending on their <b>powder</b> <b>filling</b> status and powder setting. Methods: Four different APDs were filled to maximum level and the cumulative amount of powder emitted, depending on instrument settings and filling status, was quantified during 15 subsequent 120 -s periods of use. Differences in powder emission were analyzed using ANOVA repeated measures. Results: Exact powder dosage was possible in one APD only (Dentsply Prophyjet®) where emission rates also remained constant over the first five periods assessed. In the three other APDs assessed (EMS Air-Flow®, Satellec Air-Max®, KaVo Prophyflex II®) powder emission depended on the amount of powder present in the powder chamber and declined with ongoing use. Changes in powder setting had a significant impact on powder emission in all APDs assessed, apart from the KaVo Prophyflex II® unit. Conclusions: Powder emission of APDs may vary greatly depending on the amount of powder present in the powder bowl. Therefore, instrument powder setting may not be a reliable parameter for safety and efficacy adjustments. This should be considered in clinical applications as well as in future research. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2002. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
