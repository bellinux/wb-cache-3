50|$|To {{deal with}} this situation, various precleaning {{policies}} are implemented.

Precleaning assumes {{that it is possible to}} identify <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> will be replaced next. Precleaning that is too eager can waste I/O bandwidth by writing <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> manage to get re-dirtied before being selected for replacement.|$|R

5|$|The {{agreement}} {{to withdraw the}} special police and the JNA largely restored status quo ante bellum. 17 of the 32 arrested policemen returned to service by 5 March; charges were eventually filed against five, including Vezmar. The incident had a lasting significance {{because it was the}} first serious skirmish in what would become the Croatian War of Independencea full-scale war between Croatia and its rebel Serb population supported by Serbia and the JNA. The Serbian government used the Pakrac clash to strengthen nationalist propaganda claims that Croatia was committing genocide against its Serb population. Up to 40 deaths from the clash were reported by Serbian and Montenegrin media outlets. In an indication of the confused and highly inaccurate nature of the reporting, the Belgrade daily newspaper Večernje novosti reported on its front <b>page</b> <b>that</b> the town's Orthodox priest had been killed, on its second <b>page</b> <b>that</b> he had been wounded, and on its third page it printed a statement from him. The Yugoslav presidency finally issued a statement that nobody had been killed in Pakrac.|$|E

In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period.

This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their <b>page</b> <b>that</b> Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator.
