5000|$|In basketweave, groups <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> and weft <b>threads</b> are {{interlaced}} so {{that they}} form a simple criss-cross pattern. Each group of weft threads crosses an equal number <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> by going over one group, then under the next, and so on. The next group of weft threads goes under the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} more {{advanced}} techniques in which, instead <b>of</b> merely allowing <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to alternate in their {{up or down}} positions, individual threads are brought to the surface to form {{what is called a}} [...] "pick up" [...] pattern. One side of the band will show the exposed surfaces <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> while, {{on the other side of}} the pattern, the weft thread will be visible. Using a supplemental weft thread that will come up over the top <b>of</b> certain <b>warp</b> <b>threads,</b> brocaded designs can also be worked into the inkle band.|$|R
50|$|This vitally {{important}} process sees thousands <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> gathered in long hanks in very specific order and wound onto large beams {{ready to be}} delivered, together with yarn for the weft, to the weavers.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, extra <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> can be {{wound around}} the weights. When a weaver {{has reached the}} bottom <b>of</b> the {{available}} <b>warp,</b> the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional lengths <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> can be unwound from the weights to continue. This frees the weaver from vertical size constraints.|$|R
50|$|Kam means {{little or}} scarcely. Khwab means {{a dream and}} it’s said that even with such a name ‘Its beauty, splendor and elegance can be hardly dreamt of’. Kinkhwabs are heavy fabrics or several layers <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> with an {{elaborate}} all-over pattern of extra weft, which may be of silk, gold and / or silver threads or combinations. There may be three to seven layers <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b> (Tipara means three layers and Chaupara means four layers to Satpara meaning seven layers). Kin means golden in Chinese.

50|$|Both {{the wires}} and the slots in the reed {{are known as}} dents (namely, teeth). The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> pass through the dents after going through the heddles and before {{becoming}} woven cloth. The number of dents per inch (or per cm or per 10 cm) indicates the number of gaps per linear width, the number <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> ends by weaving width determines the fineness of the cloth. One or more <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> may go through each dent. The number <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> that go through each dent depends on the warp, {{and it is possible}} that the number of threads in each dent is not constant for a whole <b>warp.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> per dent might not be constant if the weaver alternates 2 and three threads per dent, in order to get a number of ends per inch that is 2.5 times the number of dents per inch, or if the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> were to change at that point, and the fabric to have a thicker or thinner section.|$|R
50|$|The warp-weighted loom is a {{vertical}} loom {{that may have}} originated in the Neolithic period. The earliest evidence of warp-weighted looms comes from sites belonging to the Starčevo culture in modern Serbia and Hungary and from late Neolithic sites in Switzerland. This loom was used in Ancient Greece, and spread north and west throughout Europe thereafter. Its defining characteristic is hanging weights (loom weights) which keep bundles <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> taut. Frequently, extra <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> is wound around the weights. When a weaver has reached the bottom <b>of</b> the available <b>warp,</b> the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional lengths <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> can be unwound from the weights to continue. This frees the weaver from vertical size constraints.|$|R
5000|$|Jacquard was not {{the first}} to try to {{automate}} the process of weaving. In 1725 Basile Bouchon invented an attachment for draw looms which used a broad strip of punched paper to select the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> that would be raised during weaving. [...] Specifically, Bouchon’s innovation involved a row of hooks. The curved portion of each hook snagged a string that could raise one <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> <b>threads,</b> whereas the straight portion of each hook pressed against the punched paper, which was draped around a perforated cylinder. Whenever the hook pressed against the solid paper, pushing the cylinder forward would raise the corresponding warp thread; whereas whenever the hook met a hole in the paper, pushing the cylinder forward would allow the hook to slip inside the cylinder and the corresponding <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> would not be raised. Bouchon’s loom was unsuccessful because it could handle only a modest number <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ends {{per inch}} (EPI or e.p.i.) {{is the number}} <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> per inch <b>of</b> woven fabric. In general, the higher the ends per inch, the finer the fabric is. The current fashion is to wear T-shirts with a higher thread count, such as soft and {{comfortable}} [...] "30 single" [...] tee shirt that has 30 threads per inch as contrasted to the standard T-shirt with an 18 thread count per inch.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{structural}} weft threads alternate with supplementary weft {{that rises}} {{from the surface of}} the weave at a perpendicular angle.

50|$|The weavers beam is now {{placed on}} the Drawing-in frame. Here each end is passed through the healds, and then through a reed. This job was done by a reacher-in and a loomer. The reacher-in, who would be young and usually a boy, passed each end in order to the loomer. The mill still has two Drawing in frames. Alternatively, if the loom had already run that cloth, a short length <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> could be left on the healds and reed, and a Barber-Colman knotter could tie in <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to the new beam. This process took 20 minutes, {{considerably}} faster than starting afresh. Spare healds and reeds are stored above head height for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|By 1737, {{a master}} silk weaver of Lyon, Jean Falcon, had {{increased}} the number <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> that the loom could handle automatically. He developed an attachment for looms in which Bouchon’s paper strip {{was replaced by a}} chain of punched cards, which could deflect multiple rows of hooks simultaneously. Like Bouchon, Falcon used a “cylinder” (actually, a four-sided perforated tube) to hold each card in place while it was pressed against the rows of hooks. [...] His loom was modestly successful; about 40 such looms had been sold by 1762.|$|R

50|$|The warp-weighted loom is {{a simple}} and ancient form of loom in which the warp yarns hang freely from a bar {{supported}} by upright poles which can be placed at a convenient slant against a wall.

Evidence of the warp-weighted loom appears in the Neolithic period in central Europe. It is depicted in artifacts of Bronze Age Greece and was common throughout Europe, remaining in use in Scandinavia into modern times.

50|$|The {{most common}} denim is indigo denim, {{in which the}} <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> is dyed, while the weft thread is left white. As {{a result of the}} warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the textile is {{dominated}} by the blue <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> and the other side is dominated by the white weft threads. This causes blue jeans to be white on the inside. The indigo dyeing process, in which the core <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> remains white, creates denim's signature fading characteristics.|$|R

5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> namely longitudinal <b>warps,</b> crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only <b>warp</b> and weft <b>threads.</b> Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>threads,</b> leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|R
5000|$|The Ikat {{technique}} (also called [...] "chong kiet" [...] in Khmer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient weaving techniques in the world and is used to create designs in fabrics.

50|$|The {{incident}} {{is described as}} having taken place {{at the house of}} weaver Gilbert Campbell in Glenluce during October, 1654. A beggar Alexander Agnew was refused a handout by Campbell.

This included the mysterious cutting <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> demonic voices, strange whistling noises and stones being thrown. The poltergeist claims have been dismissed by researchers as a hoax. Magic historian Thomas Frost suggested that the phenomena was the result of conjuring trickery. The story was given to Sinclair by Campbell's son Thomas, a philosophy student from a college in Glasgow who was living at the household. Folklorist Andrew Lang suggested that Thomas had produced the phenomena fraudulently.|$|R
50|$|In weaving, {{the shed}} is the {{temporary}} separation between {{upper and lower}} warp yarns through which the weft is woven. The shed is created {{to make it easy}} to interlace the weft into the warp and thus create woven fabric. Most types of looms have some sort of device which separates some <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> from the others. This separation is called the shed, and allows for a shuttle carrying the weft thread to move through the shed perpendicular to the <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b> Which threads are raised and which are lowered are changed after each pass of the shuttle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>warp</b> is <b>threaded</b> through heddles on {{different}} shafts {{in order to}} obtain different weave structures.

The third <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> would be threaded through the second heddle on the first shaft, and so on.

If the size hardened it broke the thread. Loomshops were built in the basement or on the ground floor. The weavers kept the floor beneath the loom moist, sometimes by digging channels into the clay floor and pouring in water. The loomshop was entered through the family accommodation so humidity was not lost to the outside. In such a cottage, one ground floor room became the manufactory, and the family lived in the other, a kitchen living room. Sometimes a basement was excavated beneath the family home lit by elongated windows. The term 'cellar loomshop' was used for both ground floor and basement establishments.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} in France of the Jacquard loom {{in about}} 1803, enabled complicated patterned cloths to be woven, by using punched cards {{to determine which}} threads of coloured yarn should appear on the upper side of the cloth. The jacquard allowed individual control <b>of</b> each <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> row by row without repeating, so very complex patterns were suddenly feasible. Samples exist showing calligraphy, and woven copies of engravings. Jacquards could be attached to handlooms or powerlooms.|$|R
50|$|Pitumarca {{is known}} internationally for its {{revival of the}} ticlla (discontinuous warp and weft) {{technique}}.

50|$|Weavers in the Santa Cruz de Sallac {{association}} {{are unique}} in the Cusco region for their use of embroidery to create their designs. While they also weave patterns in the ley (supplementary warp) technique, they predominately embroider geometric shapes over plain weave backgrounds. Santa Cruz de Sallac is also well known for its revival of the watay (ikat) technique. In this dyeing technique, the weaver will prepare a special warp, {{where he or she}} tightly wraps up certain sections. The weaver then dyes this warp. The unwrapped sections <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> are dyed, but dye cannot enter the tightly wrapped sections which remain undyed. After dyeing, the weaver unwraps the sections <b>of</b> wrapped <b>warp.</b> When the weaver mounts this warp on her or his loom and weaves it as plain weave, the dyed and undyed sections form a design. Besides the Ccatcca district, Santa Cruz de Sallac is one of the only communities in Peru that still maintains the watay technique which can be traced to dyeing techniques practiced by the Nazca and Huari cultures.|$|R

5000|$|Weaving is {{a method}} of textile {{production}} in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced {{at right angles to}} form a fabric or cloth.
