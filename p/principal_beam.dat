The necessary blocks and tackle were likewise laid to hand and properly arranged. The men were severally allotted in squads to different stations; some were to bring the principal beams to hand, others were to work the tackles, while a third set had the charge of the iron stanchions, bolts, and wedges, so that the whole operation of raising the beams and fixing them to the rock might go forward in such a mariner that some provision might be made, in any stage of the work, for securing what had been accomplished, in case of an adverse change of weather.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{verify the}} {{conditions}} and the possible use of the historical buildings, it is fundamental to individuate structural patterns really near to each particular configuration. The calculation of a double warp ceiling usually supposes that the secondary warp structure simply leans upon the <b>principal</b> <b>beams.</b> <b>Principal</b> <b>beams,</b> on their turn, can lean or seldom be lodged into the walls. These conditions are usual in the most simple ceilings, but they cannot merely {{be transferred to the}} most riches and complex constructions. In the case of Palazzo Pallavicino in Cremona were inserted on some beams between the joists wooden blocks, forming a veritable reinforced beam. Verification to calculation of these reinforced beams gave load values eligible for the new public destination. The old system has served as a model for consolidation, and allowed minimal intervention and avoided the introduction of incongruous material...|$|R

In regard to the subsidiary works, the erection of the beacon house was in itself a work of considerable difficulty, requiring no common effort of engineering skill. The <b>principal</b> <b>beams</b> of this having been towed to the rock by the Smeaton, all the stanchions and other material for setting them up were landed, and the workmen set about erecting them as quickly as possible, for if a single day of bad weather should occur before the necessary fixtures could be made, the whole apparatus would be infallibly swept away.|$|R

Fluctuations in the <b>principal</b> <b>beam</b> parameters, namely, electron energy, energy-spread, charge, and pointing, are demonstrated to be minimized at low densities. This improvement in stability is attributed to the reduced time for pulse evolution required before self-injection occurs; i. e., that the pulse is closest to the matched conditions for these densities. It is also observed that electrons are only consistently produced above a density-dependent energy threshold. These observations are consistent with there being a threshold intensity (a 0 ≳ 3) (a 0 ≳ 3) required for the occurrence of self-injection after accounting for pulse compression...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} the first {{laboratory}} experiments {{that show the}} generation of internal solitary waves by the impingement of a quasi-two-dimensional internal wave beam on a pycnocline. These experiments were inspired by observations of internal solitary waves in the deep ocean from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, where this so-called mechanism of 'local generation' was argued to be at work, here {{in the form of}} internal tidal beams hitting the thermocline. Nonlinear processes involved here are found to be of two kinds. First, we observe the generation of a mean flow and higher harmonics at the location where the <b>principal</b> <b>beam</b> reflects from the surface and pycnocline; their characteristics are examined using particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Second, we observe internal solitary waves that appear in the pycnocline, detected with ultrasonic probes; they are further characterized by a bulge in the frequency spectrum, distinct from the higher harmonics. Finally, the relevance of our results for understanding ocean observations is discussed...|$|E

At least four rows of permanent magnet segments (2, 12, 22, 32) are provided, whereby two adjacent rows of magnetic segments (2, 12; 12, 22; 22, 32; 32, 2) are displaced by a quarter of a periodicity of individual permanent magnets (1) of every row (2, 12, 22, 32) along their longitudinal axis. Furthermore, for each of the adjacent permanent magnet arrangements (2, 22 and 12, 32), a separate high-frequency coil (3 or 13) is provided, said high-frequency coils being applied with an ultrasonic signal shifted by 90 degrees between the two high-frequency coils (3, 13). This achieves the situation that the ultrasonic wave transducer has a unilateral directional characteristic both as a transmit transducer as well as a receive transducer with a <b>principal</b> <b>beam</b> direction, so that the result is an improved signal-to-noise ratio during the non-destructive material test...|$|E
60|$|An {{important}} occurrence {{connected with}} the operations of this season was {{the arrival of the}} Smeaton at four p.m., having in tow the six <b>principal</b> <b>beams</b> of the beacon-house, together with all the stanchions and other work on board for fixing it on the rock. The mooring of the floating light was a great point gained, but in the erection of the beacon at this late period of the season new difficulties presented themselves. The success of such an undertaking at any season was precarious, because a single day of bad weather occurring before the necessary fixtures could be made might sweep the whole apparatus from the rock. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the writer had determined to make the trial, although he could almost have wished, upon looking at the state of the clouds and the direction of the wind, that the apparatus for the beacon had been still in the workyard.|$|R

50|$|Between 1897 and 1898 {{there was}} some concern by {{technicians}} about {{the integrity of the}} bridge; its 3.1 m width, the interruption of <b>principal</b> <b>beams,</b> its lightweight structure resulted in an elastic nature. In 1890, in Ovar, the Oficina de Obras Metálicas (Metal Works Office) existed to support the work to reinforce and repair those structures. As a consequence, restrictions were placed on transit over the structure between 1900 and 1906: weight limited to 14 tons per lane and velocity to 10 km per hour. Alterations to the platform of the bridge were performed under the initiatives of Xavier Cordeiro in 1900. These were followed between 1901 and 1906 by improvements to the triangular beams were performed by the Ofina of Ovar. Consulting with a specialist in metallic structures (the French engineer Manet Rabut) in 1907, the Oficina concluded that the arch and the works performed on the bridge were sufficient to allow circulation. But, this did not impede further work on the fore- and aft-structural members to make the bridge more accessible and to reinforce the main pillars.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{welded steel}} moment frames are {{designed}} to tolerate substantial yielding and plastic rotation under earthquake loads. This sacrificial design approach can lead to permanent, and often irreparable damage when interstory drifts exceed 2 %. The experimental seismic performance of a 50 % full-scale damage avoidance designed structural steel beam-column connection is presented. The beam-column joint region consists of a top flange-hung beam connected to the column by an angle bracket. High-force-to-volume (HF 2 V) devices are attached from the column to the beam to provide joint rigidity and energy dissipation as the joint opens and closes. The HF 2 V devices are connected either below the beam flange or concealed above the beam's lower flange. Reversed cyclic lateral load tests are conducted with drift amplitudes up to 4 %. No damage is observed in the <b>principal</b> <b>beam</b> and column structural elements. The need for stiff device connections to achieve optimal device performance is demonstrated, and potential design solutions presented.

The design objective of Elise is to maximize the output beam energy within the fixed project budget while allowing for adequate beam diagnostics, flexibility in the acceleration schedule, and beam parameters suitable for ILSE and the experimental program. The authors review the design equations and ``rules of thumb`` used for choosing beam and lattice parameters for heavy-ion induction accelerators, and they discuss incorporating these relations in a spreadsheet program that generates internally consistent lattice layouts and acceleration schedules. These designs have been tested using a one-dimensional (1 -D) particle simulation code, SLIDE, a 3 -D fluid/envelope code, CIRCE, and a 3 -D particle-in-cell code WARP 3 D.

60|$|The wind {{this morning}} was variable, but the weather {{continued}} extremely favourable for the operations throughout the whole day. At six a.m. the boats were in motion, and the raft, consisting of {{four of the six}} <b>principal</b> <b>beams</b> of the beacon-house, each measuring about sixteen inches square, and fifty feet in length, was towed to the rock, where it was anchored, that it might ground upon it as the water ebbed. The sailors and artificers, including all hands, to-day counted no fewer than fifty-two, being perhaps the greatest number of persons ever collected upon the Bell Rock. It was early in the tide when the boats reached the rock, and the men worked a considerable time up to their middle in water, every one being more eager than his neighbour to be useful. Even the four artificers who had hitherto declined working on Sunday were to-day most zealous in their exertions. They had indeed become so convinced of the precarious nature and necessity of the work that they never afterwards absented themselves from the rock on Sunday when a landing was practicable.|$|R
60|$|The Bell Rock {{this morning}} {{presented}} {{by far the}} most busy and active appearance it had exhibited since the erection of the <b>principal</b> <b>beams</b> of the beacon. The surface of the rock was crowded with men, the two forges flaming, the one above the other, upon the beacon, while the anvils thundered with the rebounding noise of their wooden supports, and formed a curious contrast with the occasional clamour of the surges. The wind was westerly, and the weather being extremely agreeable, as soon after breakfast as the tide had sufficiently overflowed the rock to float the boats over it, the smiths, with a number of the artificers, returned to the beacon, carrying their fishing-tackle along with them. In the course of the forenoon, the beacon exhibited a still more extraordinary appearance than the rock had done in the morning. The sea being smooth, it seemed to be afloat upon the water, with a number of men supporting themselves in all the variety of attitude and position: while, from the upper part of this wooden house, the volumes of smoke which ascended from the forges gave the whole a very curious and fanciful appearance.|$|R
60|$|The {{external}} {{part of the}} beacon was now finished, with its supports and bracing-chains, and whatever else was considered necessary for its stability {{in so far as}} the season would permit; and although much was still wanting to complete this fabric, yet it was in such a state that it could be left without much fear of the consequences of a storm. The painting of the upper part was nearly finished this afternoon; and the Smeaton had brought off a quantity of brushwood and other articles, for the purpose of heating or charring {{the lower part of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>beams,</b> before being laid over with successive coats of boiling pitch, to the height of from eight to twelve feet, or as high as the rise of spring-tides. A small flagstaff having also been erected to-day, a flag was displayed for the first time from the beacon, by which its perspective effect was greatly improved. On this, as on all like occasions at the Bell Rock, three hearty cheers were given; and the steward served out a dram of rum to all hands, while the Lighthouse yacht, Smeaton, and floating light, hoisted their colours in compliment to the erection.|$|R
40|$|PurposeCompared {{with many}} small {{circular}} beams used in CyberKnife treatments, beam’s eye view-shaped fields {{are generally more}} time-efficient for dose delivery. However, beam’s eye view-shaping devices, such as a mini-multileaf collimator (mMLC), are not presently available for CyberKnife, although a variable-aperture collimator (Iris, 12 field diameters; 5 – 60 mm) is available. We investigated whether the Iris can mimic noncoplanar mMLC treatments using a limited set of <b>principal</b> <b>beam</b> orientations (nodes) to produce time-efficient treatment plans. Methods and MaterialsThe data from 10 lung cancer patients and the beam-orientation optimization algorithm “Cycle” were used to generate stereotactic treatment plans (3 × 20 Gy) for a CyberKnife virtually equipped with a mMLC. Typically, 10 – 16 favorable beam orientations were selected from 117 available robot node positions using beam’s eye view-shaped fields with uniform fluence. Second, intensity-modulated Iris plans were generated by inverse optimization of nonisocentric circular candidate beams targeted from the same nodes selected in the mMLC plans. The plans were evaluated using the mean lung dose, lung volume receiving ≥ 20 Gy, conformality index, number of nodes, beams, and monitor units, and estimated treatment time. ResultsThe mMLC plans contained an average of 12 nodes and 11, 690 monitor units. For a comparable mean lung dose, the Iris plans contained 12 nodes, 64 beams, and 21, 990 monitor units. The estimated fraction duration was 12. 2 min (range, 10. 8 – 13. 5) for the mMLC plans and 18. 4 min (range, 12. 9 – 28. 5) for the Iris plans. In contrast to the mMLC plans, the treatment time for the Iris plans increased with an increasing target volume. The Iris plans were, on average, 40 % longer than the corresponding mMLC plans for small targets (< 80 cm 3) and ≤ 121 % longer for larger targets. For a comparable conformality index, similar results were obtained. ConclusionFor stereotactic lung irradiation, time-efficient and high-quality plans were obtained for robotic-controlled noncoplanar treatments using a mMLC. Iris is a time-efficient alternative for small targets, with similar or better plan quality...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac Ultrasound (i. e., Echocardiography) {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} imaging modality in daily clinical routine. This is because it is safe (i. e., non-ionizing), relatively cheap, easy to move, and most importantly, it has a good temporal resolution. Currently, frame rates of about 30  70 Hz are typically available {{in most of the}} echocardiographic systems. Although such frame rates are sufficient to visualize the global motion of the heart or assess the cardiac kinematics in a rough way, they are too low to resolve some short-lived cardiac phases (in particular the isovolumetric contraction/relaxation), which may contain potential diagnostic or prognostic information. However, achieving high frame rate is technically challenging as there is always a trade-off between frame rate and image quality. Hereto, {{in the context of this}} thesis, novel imaging methods to meet this challenge were developed and investigated extensively. In particular, new developments were focused on two <b>principal</b> <b>beam</b> forming methods  multi-line acquisition (MLA) and multi-line transmit (MLT) beam forming. With respect to the former method, firstly we systematically investigated the performance of different MLA systems both in-silico and in-vitro. The results showed that while operating at similar frame rate, conventional 4 MLA and compounded plane wave imaging are competitive for gray scale imaging. Secondly, through an in-vivo experimental setup, we demonstrated the feasibility of using non-compounded plane wave imaging for cardiac functional imaging at high temporal resolution. Based on this feasibility, a custom imaging sequence using non-compounded plane wave transmission was developed to map the cardiac mechanical activation at ultra-high frame rate (i. e. 836 Hz). This sequence was validated in an experimental animal model. Regarding the latter beam forming technique, we proposed a method to quantify the crosstalk artifacts in associated with MLT. Using this method, a 4 MLT imaging system with minimum crosstalk level was deduced. The simulation and experimental results (both in-vitro and in-vivo) showed that this system is able to provide competitive grayscale images to that of the conventional imaging but giving a 4 -fold faster frame rate. Moreover, we also showed that MLT can be combined with MLA to further increase frame rate. In particular, the potential of a 4 MLT- 4 MLA system providing high quality, full field-of-view images at a frame rate of approximately 450 Hz was demonstrated in-vivo. Given this feasibility, an MLT based tissue Doppler imaging method for fast cardiac functional imaging was developed. Through an in-vivo experimental study, we demonstrated the feasibility of using this method to achieve full field-of-view, high frame rate (i. e., approximately 450 Hz) cardiac motion/deformation estimation. Finally, based on a simulation study, we demonstrated the feasibility of extending our 2 D findings in MLT to 3 D in order to benefit the low spatio-temporal resolution of current 3 D cardiac imaging. status: publishe...|$|E
60|$|At {{the latter}} {{end of last}} season, as was {{formerly}} noticed, the beacon was painted white, and from the bleaching of {{the weather and the}} sprays of the sea the upper parts were kept clean; but within the range of the tide the <b>principal</b> <b>beams</b> were observed to be thickly coated with a green stuff, the conferva of botanists. Notwithstanding the intrusion of these works, which had formerly banished the numerous seals that played about the rock, they were now seen in great numbers, having been in an almost undisturbed state for six months. It had now also, for the first time, got some inhabitants of the feathered tribe: in particular the scarth or cormorant, and the large herring-gull, had made the beacon a resting-place, from its vicinity to their fishing-grounds. About a dozen of these birds had rested upon the cross-beams, which, in some places, were coated with their dung; and their flight, as the boats approached, was a very unlooked-for indication of life and habitation on the Bell Rock, conveying the momentary idea of the conversion of this fatal rock, from being a terror to the mariner, into a residence of man and a safeguard to shipping.|$|R
60|$|The {{steps of}} the stair being landed, and all the weightier {{articles}} of the light-room got up to the balcony, the wooden bridge was now to be removed, as it had a very powerful effect upon the beacon when a heavy sea struck it, and {{could not possibly have}} withstood the storms of a winter. Everything having been cleared from the bridge, and nothing left but the two <b>principal</b> <b>beams</b> with their horizontal braces, James Glen, at high-water, proceeded with a saw to cut through the beams at the end next the beacon, which likewise disengaged their opposite extremity, inserted a few inches into the building. The frame was then gently lowered into the water, and floated off to the Smeaton to be towed to Arbroath, to be applied as part of the materials in the erection of the lightkeepers' houses. After the removal of the bridge, the aspect of things at the rock was much altered. The beacon-house and building had both a naked look to those accustomed to their former appearance; a curious optical deception was also remarked, by which the lighthouse seemed to incline from the perpendicular towards the beacon. The horizontal rope-ladder before noticed was again stretched to preserve the communication, and the artificers were once more obliged to practise the awkward and straddling manner of their passage between them during 1809.|$|R

This technology spread over a large area in northern Italy between XV and XVI centuries. There are a lot of examples in buildings (palaces, castles, loggias) along the Adige's path, in Trento, Verona, Mantova and Ferrara (Badalini and Dandria 2009), but also in the large area among Emilia and Lombardia and other singular cases in Firenze. Others examples of composite beams were studied in Provence (Bouticourt 2008) and some indications suggest an extention of this technology further the entire alpine arch. In addition the european historical treatises confirm that this method was internationally known. In spite of they are quite common, this kind of structures hasn't been investigate in a specific way, except for the F. E. M. analisys applied in Ferrara for reconstructing the distribution of stress end strains (Fabbri 2005), and it hasn't been elaborated an appropriate calculation procedure to verify the structure. The aim {{of this study is to}} connect together the geometrical and dimensional data come from the detailed surveys of most significant floors with the informations derived from treatises in order to comprehend the assembling procedure, the role of geometrical and static characteristics and to evaluate them...|$|R
