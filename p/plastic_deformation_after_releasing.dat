40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{predicting}} the time-dependent deformation of tools used in hot forming applications subjected to the creep-fatigue regime. An excessive accumulated <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> is configured {{as one of the}} three main causes of premature failure of tools in these critical applications and it is accumulated cycle by cycle without evident marks leading to noncompliant products. With the aim of predicting this accumulated deformation, a novel procedure was developed, presented, and applied to the extrusion process as an example. A time-hardening primary creep law was used and novel regression equations for the law’s coefficients were developed to account not only for the induced stress-temperature state but also for the dwell-time value, which is determined by the selected set of process parameters and die design. The procedure was validated against experimental data both on a small-scale extrusion die at different stress, temperature, load states, and for different geometries and on an industrial extrusion die which was discarded due to the excessive <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> <b>after</b> 64 cycles.

Comparing the results of compression tests with prior tensile loading to the compression-only tests a decrease in compressive strength can be observed for both of the tested materials. The conclusion of the performed experiments is that there is a phenomenon similar to Bauschinger effect not only in metallic materials but also in the examined thermoplastic polymers.

As part of the WaferBoard, a reconfigurable circuit platform for rapid system prototyping, ACF is used as an intermediate film providing compliant and vertical electrical connection between chip contacts and a top surface of an active wafer-size large-area IC. The chosen ACF is first tested by an indentation technique. The results show that the elastic–plastic deformation mode as well as the Young’s modulus and the hardness depend on the indentation depth. Second, the efficiency of the electrical contact is tested using a uniaxial compression on a stack comprising a dummy ball grid array (BGA) board, an ACF, and a thin Al film. For three bump diameters, as the compression increases, the resistance values decrease before reaching low and stable values.

The Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE) is a deformation process, which realizes the concept of SPD as such that the above-mentioned structures can be obtained. In this paper, the experimental research on multi-pass ECAE process of a widely used aluminum 6061 alloy is conducted and the mechanical properties after ECAE process are investigated. To study the effect of pre-extrusion heat treatment on the mechanical properties, different heat treatment scenarios are conducted to obtain un-aged and aged samples. Sixteen passes of ECAE process at room temperature are done without any rotation of the workpiece and the relationship of mechanical properties with number of extrusion passes was identified.

30|$|Conventional {{spinning}} is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> <b>after</b> each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different sizes of rollers for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two cylinder rollers with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically clamp the sheet metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with conventional spinning, the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in conventional spinning, and the <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the roller path, not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from conventional spinning processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|R

Methods: Intraarticular distal humerus fracture (AO 13 -C 2) with 5  mm metaphyseal defect was created in sixteen artificial humeral models. Models were fixed with either orthogonal or parallel plating systems with locking screws (Acumed elbow plating systems). Both systems were tested for their stiffness with loads in axial compression, varus, valgus, anterior and posterior bending. Then <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> <b>after</b> cyclic loading in posterior bending and load to failure in posterior bending were tested. The failure mechanisms of all the samples were observed.

The analysis result shows that the simulation blanking force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the blanking force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the blanking force changes quickly.

40|$|The {{deformation}} field associated with chip formation in machining offers {{a framework for}} studying various phenomena associated with very large strain deformation. Plane-strain machining is used to study microstructure changes {{as a function of}} strain, temperature, and solute additions in a model material system - substitutional solid solutions of copper. The solid solutions incorporate three different solute additions specifically selected for their differing influences on stacking fault energy (SFE) : Ni (increases SFE), Mn (negligible influence on SFE) and Al (decreases SFE). It is shown that a variety of ultra-fine grained (UFG) and nanostructured grains can be created by varying the conditions of strain and temperature. The effect of solutes on the microstructure developed by the large strain deformation is elucidated. The mechanical properties (hardness and yield strength) and thermal stability of the microstructures are characterized. ^ The observations indicate that the SFE plays a negligible role in the microstructure refinement during large strain deformation. The solutes stabilize the nanostructured grains to higher strains and temperatures. Furthermore, the solutes enable a greater refinement of the microstructure, with sub- 100 mn grain sizes resulting at the higher strains. It has also been shown that the nanostructured materials continue to undergo further <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation,</b> <b>after</b> their formation; by twinning; a result independent of the SFE of the material. The results have implications for large scale manufacturing of structural nanomaterials for discrete product applications. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that rolling an Fe– 15 Mn– 5 Si– 9 Cr– 5 Ni (wt. %) alloy at 800 °C {{followed}} by annealing at 650 °C gives a structure – a high density of stacking faults and enough austenite hardness – that promotes the stress induced martensitic transformation instead of <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation.</b> <b>After</b> this thermo-mechanical processing, the material recovers around 95 % of a 3 % permanent deformation excursion. This work addresses the formability and weldability of sheets processed in that manner and how welding affects the mechanical and shape memory properties. Here, the designs and verification are presented for a new method for manufacturing couplings by forming and welding, and finally, the degree of shape recovery in couplings manufactured by this new method are evaluated. The results show that these couplings recover 83 % of their diametrical expansion, which make them suitable for many industrial applications. Fil: Druker, Ana Velia. Universidad Nacional de Rosario.

40|$|The {{effects of}} niobium {{addition}} up to 0. 11 wt% on the microstructure and tensile properties of as-cast ductile iron (ACDI) were investigated. Metallographic analyses by both optical microscopy (OM) and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) indicated that niobium (Nb) promoted the formation of pearlite, reduced pearlite lamellar spacing and decreased the extent of graphitization {{taking place in the}} Nb-alloyed ACDI. The nodularity and nodule counts of graphite changed insignificantly when the Nb content was less than 0. 08 wt% in the ACDI. The analysis of precipitates by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that nano and micro sized (Nb, Ti) C carbides acted as nucleation site for graphites, and promoted the formation of large graphite nodules with low roundnesses as Nb content rose above 0. 08 wt%. The results of tensile testing showed that the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the ACDI with 0. 08 wt% Nb increased by 12. 1 %, 11. 2 % and 14. 3 % over those of the Nb-free ACDI, respectively. The optimum values of the yield strength, tensile strength and elongation of the Nb-alloyed ACDI were found to be 418 MPa, 746. 0 MPa and 8. 0 %, respectively, at the Nb content of 0. 08 wt%. The high strain hardening rates of the Nb-containing ACDIs implied that they were capable of spontaneously strengthening itself increasingly to a large extent, in response to a slight <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> <b>after</b> yielding. status: publishe...|$|R
