A type of facilitation that received little attention is the one that arises indirectly via pathways of direct trophic and competitive interactions. Here we show that in <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> the positive effects from such ‘emergent’ facilitation can be sufficiently strong to dominate over direct negative effects, prevent competitive exclusion, promote co-existence and preserve biodiversity. We carried out a press perturbation experiment using a <b>pelagic</b> algae-ciliate <b>food</b> <b>web</b> model whose realism is based on extensive observations on the algae-ciliate community in Lake Constance. The model incorporated trait gradients regarding algal edibility and growth rate and ciliate selectivity and prey attack rate as commonly observed in <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> Results of the press perturbation exercise showed that some ciliate groups did not persist alone, or only at very low biomass values, while they reached realistic biomass values in the presence of competing groups of ciliates. The mechanism behind this facilitation is that grazing by less selective ciliates protected the more edible and preferred prey for the selective ciliates. We argue that such emergent facilitation, and the positive consequences for co-existence and biodiversity, is likely to occur in real <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> In this way, the present study revealed a potentially important mechanism in the preservation of biological diversity in <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs.</b> </p...|$|R

Alternatively, N(D) can enter planktonic <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> post-bloom following the remineralization of bloom detritus. Although the relative contribution of these processes to planktonic nutrient cycles is unknown, we hypothesized that assimilation of bioavailable N(D) (e. g., nitrate, ammonium) by palatable phytoplankton and subsequent grazing by zooplankton (either during or after the cyanobacterial bloom) would be the primary pathway by which N(D) was incorporated into the planktonic <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> Instead, in situ stable isotope measurements and grazing experiments clearly documented that the assimilation of N(D) by zooplankton outpaced assimilation by palatable phytoplankton during a bloom of toxic Nodularia spumigena Mertens. We identified two distinct temporal phases in the trophic transfer of N(D) from N. spumigena to the plankton community. The first phase was a highly dynamic transfer of N(D) to zooplankton with rates that covaried with bloom biomass while bypassing other phytoplankton taxa; a trophic transfer that we infer was routed through bloom-associated bacteria. The second phase was a slowly accelerating assimilation of the dissolved-N(D) pool by phytoplankton that was decoupled from contemporaneous variability in N. spumigena concentrations.

[...] 1 pageMarine {{ecosystems}} in the Mediterranean Sea {{are fundamentally}} driven by their <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>web</b> compartments, and some pelagic {{species such as}} anchovy and sardine species are also primary targets of commercial fisheries. Previous ecological and food web modelling studies developed in the region highlighted the crucial ecological role of small and medium-sized pelagic fish in the marine ecosystem of the NW Mediterranean Sea. The present study aims at complementing this knowledge and specifically quantifying in detail their ecological role and position within the pelagic environment. In this context, we investigated the seasonal and size-related changes in the trophic structure of the pelagic ecosystem of the Western Mediterranean Sea. Trophic ecology was analyzed using stable isotopes in thirteen species of fish and cephalopods. Community-level analysis revealed a consistency in the trophic structure throughout the year. Isotope values were also consistent {{with the assumption that}} small pelagic fishes are a potential prey for medium-size pelagic and demersal predators. Isotopic data also highlighted niche partitioning between medium pelagic fish and squid, suggesting that they may feed on a differentially pelagic prey fish guild. These results provide new insights in the trophic dynamics of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>web</b> of Mediterranean marine ecosystems. Such information is essential to move towards an ecosystem-based management of fisheries in the NW Mediterranean regionPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceClimate models {{predict a}} multi-degree warming of the North Atlantic in the 21 st century. A {{research}} {{priority is to}} understand the effect of such changes upon marine organisms. With 40 to 80 million individuals, planktivorous little auks Alle alle are {{an essential component of}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> in this region that is potentially highly susceptible to climatic effects. Using an integrative study of their behaviour, physiology and fitness at 3 study sites, we evaluated the effect of ocean warming on little auks across the Greenland Sea in 2005 to 2007. Contrary to our hypothesis, the birds responded {{to a wide range of}} sea surface temperatures via plasticity of their foraging behaviour, allowing them to maintain their fitness levels. Predicted effects of climate change are significantly attenuated by such plasticity, confounding attempts to forecast future effects of climate change using envelope models...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{projections}} indicate increased precipitation {{in northern}} Europe, leading to increased inﬂow of {{allochthonous organic matter}} to aquatic systems. The <b>food</b> <b>web</b> responses are poorly known, and may differ depending on the trophic structure. We performed an experimental mesocosm study where effects of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on two different <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> were investigated, one having zooplankton as highest trophic level {{and the other with}} planktivorous ﬁsh as top consumer. In both <b>food</b> <b>webs,</b> DOC caused higher bacterial production and lower <b>food</b> <b>web</b> efﬁciency, i. e., energy transfer efﬁciency from the base {{to the top of the}} <b>food</b> <b>web.</b> However, the top-level response to DOC addition differed in the zooplankton and the ﬁsh systems. The zooplankton production increased due to efﬁcient channeling of energy via both the bacteria land the phytoplankton pathway, while the ﬁsh production decreased due to channeling of energy mainly via the longer and less efﬁcient bacterial pathway. We conclude that the added DOC either acted as a subsidy by increasing the production of the top trophic level (mesozooplankton), or as a sink causing decreased top consumer production (planktivorous ﬁsh). Originally published in manuscript form with title <b>Food</b> <b>web</b> interactions determine transfer efficiency and top consumer responses to increased allochthonous carbon input </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of data, obtained during four indoor-mesocosm experiments with natural spring plankton communities from the Baltic Sea, {{was conducted to}} investigate whether biogeochemical cycling is affected {{by an increase in}} water temperature of up to 6 °C above present-day conditions. In all experiments, warming stimulated in particular heterotrophic bacterial processes and had an accelerating effect on the temporal development of phytoplankton blooms. This was also mirrored in the build-up and partitioning of organic matter between particulate and dissolved phases. Thus, warming increased both the magnitude and rate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) build-up, whereas the accumulation of particulate organic carbon (POC) and phosphorus (POP) decreased with rising temperature. In concert, the observed temperature-mediated changes in biogeochemical components suggest strong shifts in the functioning of marine <b>pelagic</b> <b>food</b> <b>webs</b> and the ocean’s biological carbon pump, hence providing potential feedback mechanisms to Earth’s climate system...|$|R
