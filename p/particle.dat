5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a <b>particle.</b> Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point <b>particle.</b> This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of <b>particle</b> versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced.

40|$|Procedures {{which make}} {{possible}} the enumeration of both infective and hemagglutinating influenza A virus <b>particles</b> {{have been developed}} and used in a quantitative investigation on the reproduction of the agent. Infective <b>particles</b> {{were found to be}} highly unstable and their half-life was only 147 minutes in allantoic fluid at 35 °C. both in vitro and in vivo. The instability of infective <b>particles</b> provides an explanation for the rapid accumulation of non-infective <b>particles</b> which retained the hemagglutinating property. The number of non-infective (N) <b>particles</b> was determined from the difference between the number of hemagglutinating (H) <b>particles</b> and the number of infective (I) <b>particles</b> as indicated by the relation: [N] = [H]– [1]. When the half-life of infective <b>particles</b> was taken into account, both infective and hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> were found to disappear from the allantoic fluid; i. e., were adsorbed by the allantoic membrane, at the same logarithmic rate after inoculation. Inoculation of any number of <b>particles</b> up to 3 x 107 was followed by a constant and progressive decrease in the proportion of unadsorbed <b>particles</b> from 0 to 4 hours. Approximately 20 per cent of <b>particles</b> were unadsorbed at 2 hours and about 5 per cent at 4 hours. Inoculation of 3 x 108 or more <b>particles</b> led to a larger proportion of unadsorbed <b>particles</b> at 4 hours. The maximum number of <b>particles</b> adsorbed was computed to be about 1. 6 x 109. The concentration of both infective and hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> increased rapidly in the allantoic fluid after 4 hours when any number of infective <b>particles</b> up to 3 x 107 was inoculated. With such inocula, the rate of increase during the logarithmic period was constant and the time to double the concentration of infective or hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> was 46 minutes. With larger inocula, i. e. 3 x 108 <b>particles,</b> the concentrations of infective and hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> did not increase until after 8 hours and the rate of increase was much slower. The time to double the concentration of either then became 92 minutes. The number of infective <b>particles</b> was approximately equal to the number of hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> during the logarithmic increase period when any number of infective <b>particles</b> up to 3 x 106 was inoculated and no more than 106 non-infective <b>particles</b> were included in the inoculum. This finding was taken to indicate that all or almost all <b>particles</b> produced and released under these conditions were infective. That such <b>particles</b> became inactivated rapidly and led to the accumulation of an increasing number of non-infective <b>particles</b> after the logarithmic period {{can be explained by the}} short half-life of infective <b>particles.</b> The number of infective <b>particles</b> was no larger than one-tenth the number of hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> during the logarithmic increase period after 3 x 107 or more infective <b>particles</b> had been inoculated or when smaller inocula were used which also contained 3 x 107 or more non-infective <b>particles.</b> Non-infective <b>particles</b> prepared in vitro at 35 ° or 22 °C. were as effective as those which accumulated in vivo in diminishing the proportion of infective <b>particles</b> in the yield. The extent of the reduction in the proportion of infective <b>particles</b> was directly related to the number of non-infective <b>particles</b> included in the inoculum. The yield of hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> was diminished when the inoculum contained 3 x 107 or more non-infective <b>particles.</b> The rate of increase was reduced so that the time to double the concentration became 92 minutes when the inoculum contained 3 x 108 non-infective <b>particles.</b> It appears from these findings that the single condition which will lead to the emergence of non-infective <b>particles</b> during the logarithmic period is a high initial particle-cell ratio. Because non-infective <b>particles</b> are equally as effective as infective <b>particles</b> in producing this result, it seems probable that the appearance of non-infective but hemagglutinating <b>particles</b> is not a necessary accompaniment of the reproductive process...|$|R
