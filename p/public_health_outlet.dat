40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} women who take daily folic acid supplements in the month before conception and to identify factors associated with supplement use. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey by self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital in Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty-four (43 %) of 1132 women who delivered normal babies between November 1997 and March 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reports of daily vitamin supplement use in the month before pregnancy and after pregnancy, and having heard or read {{about the need to}} take folic acid before pregnancy; sources of information about folic acid; factors associated with preconceptional vitamin use. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of respondents reported taking vitamins before conception (use ranged from 21 % for those with unplanned pregnancies to 40 % for those with planned pregnancies); 80 % after conception. Of all respondents, 63 % were aware of the need for preconceptional folic acid. Key information sources were family doctors and the mass media: the media were more important before conception, doctors after. Being older (30 years or more), having post-secondary education, and having a planned pregnancy were associated with knowing about the benefits of folic acid; knowledge, regular exercise, perceived good health, and planned pregnancy were associated with preconceptional use of vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Even in this sample of well educated, English-speaking women, only one third took vitamin supplements before conception, which indicates that current educational efforts do not reach most women early enough. A coordinated, multi-pronged strategy that targets and involves physicians and capitalizes on opportunities to work with schools, <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>outlets,</b> and the media is needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study consists in quantifying in money terms the potential reduction in usage of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> care <b>outlets</b> associated to the tenure of double (public plus private) insurance. In order to address the problem, a probabilistic model for visits to physicians is specified and estimated {{using data from the}} Catalonian Health Survey. Also, a model for the marginal cost of a visit to a physician is estimated using data from a representative sample of fee-for-service payments from a major insurer. Combining the estimates from the two models it is possible to quantify in money terms the cost/savings of alternative policies which bear an impact on the adoption of double insurance by the population. The results suggest that the private sector absorbs an important volume of demand which would be re-directed to the public sector if consumers cease to hold double insurance.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2003, 11 <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists {{were placed}} in North Carolina's largest {{hospitals}} to enhance communication between <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies and healthcare systems for improved emergency preparedness. We describe the specific services <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists provide to local health departments, the North Carolina Division of <b>Public</b> <b>Health,</b> and the hospitals {{in which they are}} based, and assess the value of these services to stakeholders. Methods We surveyed and/or interviewed <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists, communicable disease nurses based at local health departments, North Carolina Division of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> staff, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists' hospital supervisors to 1) elicit the services provided by <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists in daily practice and during emergencies and 2) examine the value of these services. Interviews were transcribed and imported into ATLAS. ti for coding and analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed on quantitative survey data. Results <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists conduct syndromic surveillance of community-acquired infections and potential bioterrorism events, assist local health departments and the North Carolina Division of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> with <b>public</b> <b>health</b> investigations, educate clinicians on diseases of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> importance, and enhance communication between hospitals and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies. Stakeholders place on a high value on the unique services provided by <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists. Conclusions <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists effectively link <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies and hospitals to enhance syndromic surveillance, communicable disease management, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> emergency preparedness and response. This comprehensive description of the program and its value to stakeholders, both in routine daily practice and in responding to a major <b>public</b> <b>health</b> emergency, can inform other states that may wish to establish a similar program as part of their larger <b>public</b> <b>health</b> emergency preparedness and response system. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>health</b> {{workers have}} always been the most im-portant {{component}} of <b>public</b> <b>health’s</b> infrastructure, yet attention to the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce has seldom been a priority of policy makers, national <b>public</b> <b>health</b> organizations, academic institutions, or even federal, state, and local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies. On those oc-casions when the spotlight was cast on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers, the targets were generally high-profile indi-viduals leading state and local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies and others in the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce who had achieved levels of professional academic-based creden-tials that were well beyond the reach and aspirations of the vast majority of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers. Examples of this phenomenon are many. National <b>public</b> <b>health</b> leadership development programs, including the Na-tional <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> Leadership Institute, serve top-level leaders of state and local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies. 1 State and regional <b>public</b> <b>health</b> leadership efforts often replicate this approach by serving top- and midlevel professionals a little closer to home. Books that focus on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers generally, including two ex-cellent works recently produced by the Pfizer Pharma-ceutical Group, highlight the careers of leading pub-lic health figures, virtually all of whom have master’s and doctoral-level degrees. 2, 3 It is likely that the only national initiative to recognize <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers through a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> credential will require comple-tion of master’s-level training in <b>public</b> <b>health</b> to sit for the examination. These examples argue that when the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce has been in the spotlight the bright lights have been directed toward workers in leadership and professional occupational categories, such as pub-lic health nurses, environmental health practitioners, health educators, and epidemiologists. While these are critical components of the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce, there are several hundred thousand other <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers in less visible and celebrated occupational categories left in the shadows with little attention...|$|R

40|$|Why is <b>public</b> <b>health</b> important? An Introduction to <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> {{is about}} the {{discipline}} of <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> the nature and scope of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> activity, and the challenges that face <b>public</b> <b>health</b> in the twenty-first century. The book is designed as an introductory text to the principles and practice of <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> This is a complex and multifaceted area. What {{we have tried to}} do in this book is make <b>public</b> <b>health</b> easy to understand without making it simplistic. As many authors have stated, <b>public</b> <b>health</b> is essentially about the organised efforts of society to promote, protect and restore the <b>public’s</b> <b>health</b> (Brownson 2011, Last 2001, Schneider 2011, Turnock 2012, Winslow 1920). It is multidisciplinary in nature, and it is influenced by genetic, physical, social, cultural, economic and political determinants of health. How do we define <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> and what are the disciplines that contribute to <b>public</b> <b>health?</b> How has the area changed over time? Are there health issues in the twenty-first century that change the focus and activity of <b>public</b> <b>health?</b> Yes, there are! There are many challenges facing <b>public</b> <b>health</b> now and in the future, just as there have been {{over the course of the}} history of organised <b>public</b> <b>health</b> efforts, dating from around 1850 in the Western world. Of what relevance is <b>public</b> <b>health</b> to the many health disciplines that contribute to it? How might an understanding of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> contribute to a range of health professionals who use the principles and practices of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> in their professional activities? These are the questions that this book addresses. Introduction to <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> leads the reader on a journey of discovery that concludes with an understanding of the nature and scope of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and the challenges facing the field into the future. In this edition we have included one new chapter, ‘Public health and social policy’, in order to broaden our understanding of the policy influences on <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> The book is designed for a range of students undertaking health courses where there is a focus on advancing the health of the population. While it is imperative that people wanting to be <b>public</b> <b>health</b> professionals understand the theory and practice of <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> many other health workers contribute to effective <b>public</b> <b>health</b> practice.
