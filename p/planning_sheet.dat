Although rarely used {{in comparison to the}} frequencies with which normalization process and entity-relationship model are used to illus-trate the information-level phase of a data structure, the <b>planning</b> <b>sheet</b> describes each data field’s requirement, including the field’s rules for storing reliable data that defines the structure of the data table. The tool uses the declarative data restriction approach to mark out the required rules for each field of a user table. These rules are the underlying factor for establishing the reliability and the dependability of data within the data table of an information system. In addition, the instru-ment follows the data modeling principles of the second level of the planning phase of information engineering and it is used to model data to meet the reliability requirement stipulated for the data table used by an information system. This paper shows how the <b>planning</b> <b>sheet</b> is used to optimize the data table an information system uses. In other words, the paper demonstrates how the tool helps achieve the quality of data for an information system, as well as, maintaining the worthiness of data for the system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the location and quantities of debonding in selected portland cement concrete (PCC) overlays. The project entailed an infrared thermographic survey and a ground penetrating radar survey of the PCC overlays to locate areas of debonding between the overlays and the original pavement. An infrared scanner is capable of locating these areas because of the temperature differential which is established between bonded and debonded areas under certain environmental conditions. A conventional video inspection of the top surface of the pavement was also completed {{in conjunction with the}} infrared thermographic survey to record the visual condition of the pavement surface. The ground penetrating radar system is capable of locating areas of debonding by detecting return wave forms generated by changes in the dielectric properties at the PCC overlay original pavement interface.

This dissertation describes the action research undertaken in the Mead School District to address requirements {{of the new law}} to successfully reenter students after being absent due to exclusionary discipline. The study followed Lewin's (1946) action research principles and was comprised of four cycles of inquiry. Participants in the study included seven secondary school administrators and one high school counselor. Participants reviewed and incorporated research and theory on student engagement, parent involvement, and student advocates, and high reliability organizing to frame and assess protocols and checklists developed to reflect best practices. Specifically, a Student Pre-reengagement <b>Planning</b> <b>Sheet,</b> a Student Reengagement Checklist, and accompanying standardized protocols were generated and have been submitted for adoption by the district. The Student Pre-reengagement <b>Planning</b> <b>Sheet</b> is a series of questions to be completed by the student and their parent or guardian prior to the reengagement meeting with the student, parent(s) or guardian(s), and school personnel. There are nine sections in the Student Reengagement Checklist. Each section attempts to address the student’s academic, relational, and behavioral schooling needs: Section I includes information on the student’s graduation date, current credits, and demographic information; Section II requests for a recollection of the student’s discipline infraction and asks for the parent’s and student’s ideas to avoid a recurrence of the violation; Section III requests for the student’s positive and negative personal relations at school; Section IV requests the student to disclose their most difficult academic subjects; Section V requests teachers to list the most critical missing or incomplete assignments; Section VI includes the student’s plan to minimize the drama when returning to school; Section VII is a check-in plan to meet periodically with school personnel; Section VIII is for stakeholder signatures (i. e., student, parent or guardian, administrator, and student advocate); Section IX is for adding additional documents, such as Safety or Section 504 plans.

The first type refers to factors such as blank-holding force, punching force, die-punch clearance, forming velocity, die and punch radii of curvature etc. and can be termed ""technological decisions"".

Parents and counselors were sent questionnaires to ascertain their respective perceptions of the parents??? counseling need. A parent counseling program <b>planning</b> <b>sheet</b> was sent to parents who responded to the questionnaire to discover the format in which parents would be most likely to participate. A large majority of both parents and counselors responded that they thought a parents' job was made more difficult by having a child with learning difficulties. Parents perceived learning specific methods to help their child and obtaining information about learning problems as their most important counseling needs. Counselors considered dealing with feelings the most important parental counseling need. An interesting supplementary finding was that the group of parents most interested in counseling were female parent figures of one-parent families. Based on the results of the study, several implications were drawn concerning the development of a parent counseling program. Parents seem to be more interested in a content-oriented rather than a process-oriented approach. Most parents would prefer a short-term program giving them something tangible that they could directly use to deal with the effects of the learning problems of their child. The counseling program and the parent counselor need to be flexible enough to meet the varying needs of different parents...|$|E

First phase contains the calculations of all curve elements of the four types of the horizontal&# 13; curve and second phase contains the modeling of the ten methods of estimating the radius of the&# 13; horizontal curve. Approach: The program is named as HCRET, which stands for Horizontal Curves&# 13; and Radius Estimating Techniques. The program is written in Visual Basic-Version 6 language. The&# 13; developed program deals with the calculation of all elements of the horizontal curve of the four types&# 13; of the horizontal curves, which consists of simple, compound, reverse and transition. Results: The&# 13; program also used for modeling of the ten methods of radius-estimating of horizontal curve, which&# 13; consist of Ball Bank Indicator, Chord Length, Compass, Lateral Acceleration, <b>Plan</b> <b>Sheet,</b> Advisory&# 13; Speed Plate, Modified Yaw Rate, Field Survey, and Global Positioning System for the calculation of&# 13; estimated-radius. The program output is comprehensive and easy to understand, while the program&# 13; input is used friendly and provided with many graphical objects to facilitate ease of use. A case study&# 13; of three examples presented to evaluate the modeled software of three horizontal curves. Two curves&# 13; were located in university of Baghdad and a third curve was designed and includes also the&# 13; experimental work of radius-estimating methods of horizontal curves as follow field survey, plan&# 13; sheet, compass, Global Positioning System (GPS). Conclusion/Recommendations: The results that&# 13; obtained of the three curves by using the radius-estimating methods include the true and estimated&# 13; radius of each method.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design and {{implementation}} of a system for automatic recognition of features from freeform surface CAD models of sheet metal parts represented in STL format. The developed methodology has three major steps viz. STL model preprocessing, Region segmentation and automated Feature recognition. The input CAD model is preprocessed to get a healed and topology enriched STL model. A new hybrid region segmentation algorithm based on both edge- and region-based approaches has been developed to segment the preprocessed STL model into meaningful regions. Geometrical properties of facets, edges and vertices such as gauss and mean curvature at vertices, orientations of facet normals, shape structure of triangles, dihedral edge angle (angle between facets), etc. have been computed to identify and classify the regions. Feature on a freeform surface {{is defined as a}} set of connected meaningful regions having a particular geometry and topology which has some significance in design and manufacturing. Feature recognition rules have been formulated for recognizing a variety of protrusion and depression features such as holes, bends, darts, beads, louvres, dimples, dents, ridges/channels (blind and through) etc. occurring on automotive sheet metal panels. The developed system has been extensively tested with various industrial sheet metal parts and is found to be robust and consistent. The features data can be post processed and linked to various downstream CAD/CAM applications like automated process <b>planning,</b> <b>sheet</b> metal tool design, refinement of FEM meshes and product redesign.
