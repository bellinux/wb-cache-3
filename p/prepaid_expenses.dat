50|$|A Deferred <b>expense</b> or prepayment, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense,</b> plural often <b>prepaids,</b> is {{an asset}} {{representing}} cash paid {{out to a}} counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later accounting period. For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, {{at the end of}} the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense. In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment. The deferred expense shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> such as {{employee}} wages or subcontractor fees paid out or promised, are not recognized as expenses; {{they are considered}} assets because they will provide probable future benefits. As a prepaid expense is used, an adjusting entry is made to update {{the value of the}} asset. In the case of prepaid rent, for instance, the cost of rent for the period would be deducted from the Prepaid Rent account.|$|E
50|$|In accounting, {{a current}} asset is any asset which can {{reasonably}} {{be expected to}} be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year or operating cycle (whichever period is longer). Typical current assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments (marketable securities), accounts receivable, stock inventory, supplies, and the portion of prepaid liabilities, sometimes referred to as <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> which will be paid within a year.|$|E
5000|$|Deferred expense: cash {{has left}} the company, but the event has not {{actually}} occurred yet. <b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> {{are the most common}} type. For instance, a company may purchase a year of insurance. After six months, only half of the insurance will have been 'used' with another six months of the insurance still owed to the company. Thus, the company records half of the payment as an outflow (an expense) and the other half as a receivable from the insurance company (an asset).|$|E

50|$|Taxpayers in the United States often seek to {{maximize}} their income and decrease their tax liability by prepaying deductible expenses and taking a deduction earlier {{rather than in a}} later tax year. In Grynberg v.

50|$|If no cause-and-effect {{relationship}} exists (e.g., a sale is impossible), {{costs are}} recognized as expenses in the accounting period they expired: i.e., when have been used up or consumed (e.g., of spoiled, dated, or substandard goods, or not demanded services). <b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> are not recognized as expenses, but as assets until one of the qualifying conditions is met resulting in a recognition as expenses. Lastly, if no connection with revenues can be established, costs are recognized immediately as expenses (e.g., general administrative and research and development costs).|$|E
50|$|For example, {{when the}} {{accounting}} periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid insurance cost {{is added to}} <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an expense, rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as prepayments (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.|$|E

50|$|Deferred charge (or deferral) is {{cost that}} is accounted-for in latter {{accounting}} period for its anticipated future benefit, or {{to comply with}} the requirement of matching costs with revenues. Deferred charges include costs of starting up, obtaining long-term debt, advertising campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current asset on the balance sheet pending amortization. Deferred charges often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial ratios are based on the total assets excluding deferred charges since they have no physical substance (cash realization) and cannot be used in reducing total liabilities.|$|E

It shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered latter are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|E
50|$|The {{going concern}} {{principle}} allows {{the company to}} defer some of its <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> until future accounting periods.

Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, unless the going concern assumption is inappropriate in the circumstances of the entity, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets, discharge its liabilities, and obtain refinancing (if necessary) in the normal course of business.|$|E

40|$|On June 23, 1999, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} three {{noteworthy}} decisions {{bearing on the}} law of constitutional remedies. Alden v. Maine struck down an attempt by Congress, acting under its Article I powers, to subject states to suits in state court on federal statutory grounds. Florida <b>Prepaid</b> Postsecondary Education <b>Expense</b> Board v. College Savings Bank curbed Congress 2 ̆ 7 power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to authorize suits against state governments on constitutional grounds, reasoning that a case cannot be made for the federal cause of action unless state law remedies are inadequate. A companion case, College Savings Bank v. Florida <b>Prepaid</b> Postsecondary Education <b>Expense</b> Board, repudiated the notion that a state may 2 ̆ 2 constructively 2 ̆ 2 waive its sovereign immunity by engaging in conduct that is regulated by federal law. Viewed as decisions about federal-state relations, these cases demonstrate once again the determination of the contemporary Court 2 ̆ 7 s conservative majority to find ways to shield states from Congress 2 ̆ 7 regulatory agenda. In terms of the allocation of decision making between federal and state courts, Alden, Florida Prepaid, and College Savings Bank are the latest in an even longer line of cases, stretching back to Younger v. Harris in which the post-Warren Supreme Court has, by one means or another, channeled constitutional litigation to the state courts and limited the remedies available to persons injured by state governments 2 ̆ 7 violations of federal law. This Article makes three points. First, contrary to concerns some have expressed about the implications of Alden, the reasoning of the opinion rests on the implicit premise that, as a matter of due process, state courts must be open for certain constitutional claims. This is not an original contribution to constitutional doctrine. But, a footnote in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida cast doubt on the authority of Reich, and Alden provides a needed correction. My second point addresses the ruling in Florida Prepaid and its interaction with Alden. Though the Court purported to be applying relatively uncontroversial principles developed in earlier cases, it in fact forged novel restrictions on the scope of Congress 2 ̆ 7 Section 5 power. Taken together, Alden 2 ̆ 7 s holding that states enjoy sovereign immunity in their own courts against suits based on federal law and Florida Prepaid 2 ̆ 7 s limits on Congress 2 ̆ 7 Section 5 power demonstrates that Congress may subject states to suit in the federal or state courts only when the statute satisfies the Court 2 ̆ 7 s new and as yet undefined conditions for Section 5 legislation. Third, the similarities between Alden and Florida Prepaid conceal a difference between the two cases regarding the allocation of power between Congress and the Supreme Court in the federal system. In its reaffirmation of Reich, the Alden majority relies on the traditional doctrine that decisions about the scope of lower federal court jurisdiction are for Congress to make, with the state courts serving as the ultimate protectors of constitutional rights in the event Congress takes away federal jurisdiction. Florida Prepaid diverges from the principle of congressional control. In the course of determining what is 2 ̆ 2 appropriate 2 ̆ 2 legislation within Section 5, the opinion sets forth a potentially far-reaching doctrine that may hobble efforts by Congress to assign litigation over constitutional remedies to the federal courts. In my view, the Court fails to identify valid reasons why congressional power over jurisdiction should be any narrower when acting under Section 5 than in any other context...|$|R
