5|$|The M9 {{used the}} same chassis and {{mechanical}} components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a pedestal machine gun mount as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine gun mount and three <b>pintle</b> machine gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycles}} used in {{the chase}} from the castle were a mixed bag: the scout model with sidecar in which Indy and Henry escape was an original Dnepr, complete with machine gun <b>pintle</b> on the sidecar, while the pursuing vehicles were more modern machines dressed up with equipment and logos to make them resemble German army models.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating <b>pintle</b> inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

5000|$|This {{segment of}} {{mountains}} was {{designated as a}} Primitive Area in 1937, and reclassified as a Wilderness Area in 1964. It is administered jointly by the Beaverhead-Deerlodge and Bitterroot National Forests. The name {{is derived from the}} town and its copper mining company and from Charles and Katie <b>Pintler,</b> homesteaders who in 1885 settled along <b>Pintler</b> Creek between the Big Hole National Battlefield and Wisdom. [...] The forest north of <b>Pintler</b> Pass, including Johnson Lake, was heavily burnt by the Mussigbrod and other fires of 2000.|$|R
5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European <b>pintle</b> and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E

5000|$|Strap hinges {{continued}} to dominate {{in the market}} place, however, for hanging shutters. But here, too, changes were afoot. Drive <b>pintles</b> started {{to be replaced by}} similar <b>pintles</b> cut off and mounted on a piece of thin plate material and again fastened with the new screws. This is the precursor of the [...] "plate pintle" [...] that's still very much around.|$|R
25|$|An iron {{collar and}} plate bearing that fits over the <b>pintle</b> of a post-mill's post, that {{supports}} {{the weight of the}} crown tree, around which the buck of the mill is constructed. An example is visible at High Salvington windmill.|$|E
25|$|The XM29 was an {{experimental}} door <b>pintle</b> {{for the main}} cabin doors of short fuselage UH-1s (at the time the UH-1B/C), for an M60D 7.62×51mm machine gun. The problem with this system was {{that it could not}} be used in conjunction with external armament subsystems.|$|E
25|$|Note: The US Army {{phased out}} the M60D {{in favor of}} the M240D and {{subsequently}} M240H. While the mount system designation remains the same, the mount itself has been extensively redesigned to accommodate the ammunition magazine and a bag for catching expended ammunition casings and ammunition links, as well as an improved roller on the <b>pintle</b> to prevent excessive and premature wear to the mount assembly.|$|E

25|$|Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 {{pressure-fed}} rocket engine, and {{was used}} as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. It is built around the same <b>pintle</b> architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbo-pump, and is fed only by tank pressure. Its nozzle is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, is also radiatively cooled, and is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.|$|E
25|$|For {{so light}} a weapon, it {{embodied}} a remarkable number of modern construction features. It had a Schneider type, hydropneumatic independent recoil system, a Krupp type horizontal sliding-wedge breechblock, split trails with spade plates for stabilizers, <b>pintle</b> traverse, and an equalizing arrangement which gave it three-point suspension. Since it was trunnioned {{at the center}} of balance, it did not require equilibrators. It could be fired with trails closed or open.|$|E
25|$|Merlin is {{a family}} of rocket engines {{developed}} by SpaceX for use on its Falcon rocket family of launch vehicles. Merlin engines use LOX and RP-1 as propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. The injector {{at the heart of}} Merlin is of the <b>pintle</b> type that was first used in the Apollo Program for the lunar module landing engine. Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbo-pump.|$|E

25|$|Oars {{mounted on}} the side of ships evolved into quarter rudders, which were used from antiquity {{until the end of the}} Middle Ages in Europe. As the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased, quarter-rudders became {{unwieldy}} and were replaced by the more sturdy stern-mounted rudders with <b>pintle</b> and gudgeon attachment. While stern-mounted rudders were found in Europe on a wide range of vessels since Roman times, including light war galleys in Mediterranean, the oldest known depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder can be found on church carvings of Zedelgem and Winchester dating to around 1180.|$|E
25|$|Overnight {{there was}} a strong {{northwest}} wind and heavy sea, drenching everyone in the boats. At first light on 24 October the boats could not see each other. Mr Vernon's boat hoisted its sail and set off before the wind, until at 1010 hrs his crew sighted the Third Officer's boat several miles to the southwest. They tried to steer towards it, but the heavy weather prevented them. At 1230 hrs Vernon abandoned the attempt and altered course to the southeast. At 1700 hrs he ordered the sail lowered and the boat to heave to with her sea anchor. At 2300 hrs the rudder broke off at the top <b>pintle,</b> so two of Vernon's men used an oar as an improvised and unsatisfactory steering oar. On 25 October the weather was still wild so Mr Vernon's boat drifted before the wind with her sea anchor and sail.|$|E
