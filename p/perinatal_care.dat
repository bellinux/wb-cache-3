5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and <b>perinatal</b> <b>care.</b> Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{barriers}} to access, health services {{have shown a}} trend toward improvement {{over the past twenty}} years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in <b>perinatal</b> <b>care</b> following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To explore <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals’ {{perspectives}} on barriers and facilitators to addressing perinatal depression. Background: Perinatal depression is common and associated with deleterious effects on mother, foetus, child and family. Although the regular contact between mothers and <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals {{may make the}} obstetric setting ideal for addressing depression, barriers persist, and depression remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Methods: Four 90 -minute focus groups were conducted with <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals, including obstetric resident and attending physicians, licensed independent practitioners, nurses, patient care assistants, social workers and administrative support staff. Focus groups were transcribed, and resulting data were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results: Participants identified patient-, provider- and system-level barriers and facilitators to addressing perinatal depression. Provider-level barriers included lack of resources, skills and confidence needed to diagnose, refer and treat perinatal depression. Limited access to mental health care and resources were identified as system-level barriers. Facilitators identified included targeted training for <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals’, structured screening and referral processes, and enhanced support and guidance from mental health providers. Conclusion: A complex set of interactions between women and <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals contributes to perinatal depression being untreated. Service gaps could be closed by addressing identified barriers through integrated obstetric and depression care and enhanced collaborations. Future intervention testing could include targeted training, improved access, and mental health provider support to empower <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals’ to address perinatal depression, and thereby improve delivery of depression treatment in obstetric settings...|$|R

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the recent substantial decline in the United States neonatal mortality rate (20. 0 / 1000 in 1950 to 11. 6 / 1000 in 1975) is associated with improvements in <b>perinatal</b> medical <b>care,</b> we examined this change in relation to the two primary components which determine neonatal mortality: birthweight distribution and birthweight-specific mortality. No improvement in the weight distribution of U. S. live births has occurred during this 25 -year period, indicating that the change in neonatal mortality is attributable to improved survival for one or more birthweight groups. Decline in the mortality rate in the first 15 years was slow; three-fourths of the decline in the entire 25 -year period occurred since 1965. With the exception of <b>perinatal</b> medical <b>care,</b> factors known to affect survival at a given birthweight have not changed in prevalence in the 25 -year period.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore nurses’ attitudes towards <b>perinatal</b> {{bereavement}} <b>care</b> and to identify factors associate with such attitudes. Background: Caring for and supporting parents whose infant has died is extremely demanding, difficult and stressful. It is likely that the attitude of nursing staff can influence recovery from a pregnancy loss and nurses with positive attitude to bereavement care can help bereaved parents to cope during their grieving period. Method: Data were collected through a structured questionnaire; 334 nurses were recruited (63 % response rate) from the Obstetrics and Gynaecology unit in five hospitals in Hong Kong during May–August 2006. Outcome measures including attitudes towards <b>perinatal</b> bereavement <b>care,</b> importance on hospital policy and training support for bereavement care. Results: Majority of nurses in this study held a positive attitude towards bereavement care. Results showed that only 39 · 3 % (n = 130) of nurses had bereavement related training. By contrast, about 89 · 8 % of nurses (n = 300) showed they need to be equipped with relevant knowledge, skills and understanding in the care and support of bereaved parents and more than 88 · 0 % (n = 296) would share experiences with colleagues and seek support when feeling under stress. Regression model showed that age, past experience in handling grieving parents and nurses’ perceived attitudes to hospital policy and training provided for bereavement cares were factors associate with nurses’ attitudes towards <b>perinatal</b> bereavement <b>care.</b> Conclusions: Hong Kong nurses emphasized their need for increased knowledge and experience, improved communication skills and greater support from team members and the hospital for <b>perinatal</b> bereavement <b>care...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} were to examine patients 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on patient-, provider- and systems-level barriers and facilitators to addressing perinatal depression in outpatient obstetric settings. We also compare {{the views of}} patients and <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals. METHOD: Four 90 -min focus groups were conducted with women 3 - 36 months after delivery (n= 27) who experienced symptoms of perinatal depression, anxiety or emotional distress. Focus groups were transcribed, and resulting {{data were analyzed using}} a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Barriers to addressing perinatal depression included fear of stigma and loss of parental rights, negative experiences with <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> providers and lack of depression management knowledge/skills among professionals. Facilitators included psychoeducation, peer support and training for professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients perceive many multilevel barriers to treatment that are similar to those found in our previous similar study of <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> professionals 2 ̆ 7 perspectives. However, patients and professionals do differ in their perceptions of one another. Interventions would need to close these gaps and include an empathic screening and referral process that facilitates discussion of mental health concerns.

40|$|There {{have been}} publically {{expressed}} {{concerns about the}} costs and allocation of neonatal and <b>perinatal</b> health <b>care</b> resources in Canada and elsewhere for the past 15 years. This paper reports information from a symposium held during the 1996 Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) annual meeting sponsored by the CPS Section on Perinatal Medicine. Experts in <b>perinatal</b> epidemiology, health <b>care</b> economics, public policy and finance, and consumer perspectives on the outcomes of neonatal and <b>perinatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> explored the following questions: How should the need for health care resources in the neonatal and perinatal area be objectively determined? When there are competing needs between the maternal-newborn area and other areas, how should these be rationalized? What evidence should be used (or should be available) to support the present use of resources? What evidence should be available (or is needed) to change or introduce new uses of resources? The conclusions indicated {{that there are no}} generally accepted methods to determine the allocation of health care resources but that considerations need to include population characteristics, desired outcomes, achievable results, values, ethics, legalities, cost-benefit analyses and political objectives. Information from families and adolescents who required the use of high technology and/or high cost programs will contribute individual, family and societal values that complement cost-efficacy analyses...|$|R
