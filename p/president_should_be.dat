5|$|Lukashenko {{believes}} that the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a conservative person and avoid using modern electronic gadgets such as an iPad or iPhone. He used to play bayan and football, but abandoned both during his presidency. He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward, who played exhibition games alongside international hockey stars. His two elder sons also play hockey, sometimes alongside their father.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E
50|$|Adams was a {{supported}} {{of limited}} presidential terms, {{well before the}} 22nd Amendment passed, and advocated that the <b>Presidents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> required to renounce political parties and that after they left the presidency, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> made ex-officio members of the United States Senate.|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Fimcap is being handled by the intercontinental presidium which consists of two presidents, a Praeses and a Secretary-General.

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey {{on the morning of}} July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|Woon {{was called}} to the Singapore Bar in 1985. The first edition of his book Company Law was {{published}} in 1988. The same year he became a Sub-Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law, then served as Vice-Dean from 1991 to 1995. On 1 February 1999 Woon was appointed a professor of law. In November 1990, Woon appeared before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill (Bill No. 23/90) to make representations on the proposed introduction of an elected President for Singapore. He took the view that since the elected <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> politically neutral, Cabinet members should only be eligible to stand for election five years after leaving politics.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe the}} <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> impeached and removed from office. Instead of {{unequivocally}} condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said ‘there were very fine {{people on both}} sides.’ There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen.|$|E
5000|$|The Secretary to the <b>President</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the modern President's personal secretary who is officially an Administrative Assistant in the President's Office.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Macapagal is {{credited}} with transforming Malacañang from a dirty and dishevelled place to a clean and magnificent palace. Her training as a physician enabled her to bring about cleanliness and neatness in the rooms and appointments of the presidential residence. The Macapagals shared the view that Malacañang, being a historical structure intended for all <b>presidents,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sparingly remodeled and <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> tampered with for the individual convenience of temporary occupants.|$|R
50|$|O'Reilly {{took the}} {{position}} that <b>President</b> Bush <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to sue Jadakiss for slander. The track was eventually banned on some radio stations or played with the lyrics in question censored.|$|R
25|$|Vinson {{referenced}} Federalist No. 70’s {{arguments about}} {{energy in the}} executive {{to argue that the}} <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to seize private property in a time of national crisis. In a more recent 2004 case, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice Clarence Thomas utilized Federalist No. 70 {{to make the case that}} the president should have the power to suspend Habeas Corpus for American citizens in order to fight the war on terror.|$|E
25|$|An {{opinion poll}} held in November 2008 that {{separated}} the questions found support for a republic at 50% with 28% opposed. Asked how the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> chosen if {{there were to be}} a republic, 80 percent said elected by the people, against 12 percent who favoured appointment by parliament. In October 2009 another poll by UMR found 59% support for a republic and 33% opposition. 73% supported direct election, versus 18% support for parliamentary appointment.|$|E
25|$|By October 28, the Senate {{had already}} been {{discussing}} the designation amendment. Republican DeWitt Clinton expected that the Senate, with a 24-9 Republican majority would quickly passing the amendment. Federalist Jonathan Dayton proposed that {{the office of the}} Vice <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> eliminated and his colleague, Uriah Tracy, seconded it. On the other side, Wilson Cary Nicholas was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time for the states to ratify it before the 1804 election. Despite Nicholas’ concern, the Senate would not seriously deal with the amendment again until November 23.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, such {{endorsements}} {{can be said}} {{to undermine}} the principle that a candidate for <b>President</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> beholden to any political formation, which is reflected in the requirement for a candidate not {{to be a member of}} any political party.|$|R

5000|$|The {{political}} {{comedy is}} directed by Jang Jin, well known for using a unique sense of humor to add spice to a plot, poking fun at politics, and providing some good laughs. On top of good humor and laughter, the movie presents the director's ideal vision of how Korean <b>presidents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> The three <b>presidents</b> depicted in the movie are charismatic, moral and unselfish, although they agonize over their choices between public interest and personal happiness. The director, who also wrote the script, said it was free of political ideology and instead was a [...] "fun movie everyone can enjoy." ...|$|R
25|$|According to a {{more recent}} Universidad de Lima survey, Fujimori still retains public support, ranking fifth in {{personal}} popularity among other political figures. Popular approval for his decade-long presidency (1990–2000) has reportedly grown (from 31.5% in 2002 to 49.5% in May 2007). Despite accusations of corruption and human rights violations, {{nearly half of the}} individuals interviewed in the survey approved of Fujimori's presidential regime. In a 2007 Universidad de Lima survey of 600 Peruvians in Lima and the port of Callao, 82.6% agreed that the former <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> extradited from Chile to stand trial in Peru.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, Polk {{ran for the}} United States House of Representatives in the Tennessee's 6th congressional district. Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah {{began to}} worry about his health. During the campaign, Polk's opponents said that {{at the age of}} 29 Polk was too young for a spot in the House, but he won the {{election}} and took his seat in Congress. When Polk arrived in Washington, D.C. he roomed in Benjamin Burch's boarding house with some other Tennessee representatives, including Sam Houston. Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that the <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> elected by the popular vote. Polk became a vocal critic of the Adams administration, frequently voting against its policies.|$|E

In addition to its own nuclear weapons, Britain had hosted American Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers since 1948.

The effectiveness of the Fellowship program is evaluated by the participants each year through questionnaires. Based on information gathered from the initial class of 1994 Fellows, the following recommendations <b>are</b> included: (1) <b>presidents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> encouraged to consider diversity when nominating fellows, and balance <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sought between vocational and academic administrators; (2) the program <b>should</b> <b>be</b> opened to private community colleges; (3) program auditing <b>should</b> <b>be</b> investigated; (4) ...|$|R

500|$|His first {{incursion}} {{into the}} legislative realm occurred {{shortly after he}} assumed office, during the Senate debates over titles {{for the president and}} executive officers of the new government. Although the House of Representatives agreed in short order that the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> addressed simply as [...] "George Washington, President of the United States," [...] the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [...] Liberties) for the president. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency." [...] Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all. In the end, Washington yielded to their objections and the House decided that the title of [...] "Mr. President" [...] would be used.|$|E
500|$|The new Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, {{was not as}} {{aggressive}} in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped. [...] It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether the <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> impeached. [...] Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's Benjamin Wade as its president pro tempore, next in line to the presidency {{in the absence of}} a vice president. [...] Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of Das Kapital. Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant. [...] Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.|$|E
500|$|Primarily {{established}} {{to provide a}} successor {{in the event of}} the president's death, disability, or resignation, The vice president's sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility is to preside over the U.S. Senate as its president. The vice president also has the authority (ex officio, for he is not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Adams played {{an active role in the}} Senate's deliberations, particularly during his first term. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed, and he frequently lectured the body on procedural and policy matters. At the start of Washington's presidency, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House of Representatives agreed in short order that the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> addressed simply as [...] "George Washington, President of the United States," [...] the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [...] Liberties) for the president.

On 14 May, Ravalomanana ridiculed the proposal and said that [...] "anyone who is legally eligible to run for <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to do so".
