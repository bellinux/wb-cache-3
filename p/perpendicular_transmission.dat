40|$|Cellulose {{crystallinity}} {{assessment is}} important for optimizing the yield of cellulose products, such as bioethanol. X-ray diffraction is often {{used for this purpose}} for its perceived robustness and availability. In this work, the five most common analysis methods (the Segal peak height method and those based on peak fitting and/or amorphous standards) are critically reviewed and compared to two-dimensional Rietveld refinement. A larger () and more varied collection of samples than previous studies have presented is used. In particular, samples () with low crystallinity and small crystallite sizes are included. A good linear correlation () between the five most common methods suggests that they agree on large-scale crystallinity differences between samples. For small crystallinity differences, however, correlation was not seen for samples that were from distinct sample sets. The least-squares fitting using an amorphous standard shows the smallest crystallite size dependence and this method combined with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>transmission</b> geometry also yielded values closest to independently obtained cellulose crystallinity values. On the other hand, these values are too low according to the Rietveld refinement. All analysis methods have weaknesses that should be considered when assessing differences in sample crystallinity...|$|E

Our results {{reveal that the}} conductance peaks move to high energy as the CQDs radius decreases or the period increases. If we increase the transverse momentum the conductance peaks move to high energy. Applying this characteristic, we can design a switch device using CQDs by applying a static electric field <b>perpendicular</b> to <b>transmission</b> direction. The theoretical results qualitatively agree with the available experimental data. Our calculated results may be useful {{for the application of}} CQDs to photoelectric devices.

50|$|The boxer design also {{provides}} near-perfect vibration mitigation because {{the movement of}} each piston is exactly countered by the corresponding piston in the opposing cylinder bank, {{eliminating the need for}} a counterbalance shaft, and that the movement of the pistons is on a horizontal plane. The only vibration caused by the boxer engine is secondary caused by the cylinders being slightly offset on opposing banks. This vibration, however, is minimal and is largely absorbed by rubber engine mounts. Torque steer is also reduced with this type of power train layout. This is achieved by having the front driveshafts being of equal weight and length, and extend from the transmission to the front wheels at almost <b>perpendicular</b> from the <b>transmission.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} magnetization configuration evolution during insitu magnetic processes, in materials exhibiting planar and <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic anisotropy. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy (TEM) {{has been used to}} perform magnetic imaging. Fresnel contrast in Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (LTEM), phase retrieval methods such as Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE) solving and electron holography have all been implemented. These techniques are sensitive to magnetic induction perpendicular to the electron beam, allowing the mapping of magnetic induction distribution with a spatial resolution better than 10 nm and can be extended to allow dynamical studies during in-situ observation. Thin foils of FePd alloys with a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and self-assembled Fe dots have been examined. Both are studied during magnetization processes, exhibiting the capacities of in-situ magnetic imaging in a TEM...|$|R

40|$|Conference Name:Conference on Optical Transmission, Switching and Subsystems III. Conference Address: Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:NOV 07 - 10, 2005. An all-fiber {{magneto-optic}} switch {{is designed}} in this paper, which {{makes use of}} Faraday Effect, fiber-type polarizing beam splitter/combiner (PBS/PBC), magneto-optic crystal fiber, nanosecond impulser and high-speed magnetic field control technology. The design scheme uses magneto-optic crystal fiber instead of bulky magneto-optic crystal. The optical route design includes linear layout of magneto-optic crystal fiber, the optical route design of polarized light in fiber PBS/PBC, magnetic route design and analysis of linear solenoid, etc. A solenoid which is driven by nanosecond current and can generate high-speed magnetic field is designed and manufactured. The result analysis shows that pulse signal can be greatly strengthened by impressed-bias static magnetic field which is <b>perpendicular</b> to <b>transmission</b> direction of light beam. Static magnetic field insures the intensity of induced magnetization where the light passes come back to original value, {{so that it can}} offer high-extent magnetization equality. The intensity of magnetic field can be improved to two orders when the length ratio of magneto-optic crystal fiber to solenoid is increased eight times. When the diameter of magneto-optic crystal and solenoid is decreased from three millimeters to one millimeter, the intensity of magnetic field can be improved to one order. The all fiber magneto-optic switch is slim in structure, flexible, easy to high-density integration and expansion, so there are many integration methods to design all-fiber magneto-optic switch array, which is characterized of smaller bulk, higher magnetic field usage, lower consumption and driving voltage, etc...|$|R
40|$|Thick {{silicon nitride}} blocks {{embedded}} in silicon wafers were recently proposed {{as a substrate}} for RF devices. In this paper we show that deep trenches filled with silicon nitride—having thin slices of monocrystalline silicon in between—already result in a significantly improved RF behavior. Measurement results are presented on RF coplanar waveguides using solid silicon nitride blocks and silicon nitride filled trenches with various dimensions and orientations {{with respect to the}} transmission line. A clear difference exists between trenches parallel and <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>transmission</b> line due to the different associated loss mechanisms. S-parameter measurements on the coplanar waveguides show an improvement of the transmission losses at 4 GHz from 3. 5 dB mm- 1 on a standard silicon substrate to 0. 7 dB mm- 1 on silicon nitride filled trenches and 0. 2 dB mm- 1 on a solid silicon nitride block. In this way, an RF performance very close to dedicated glass substrates such as AF 45 is obtained (with transmission losses of 0. 1 dB mm- 1 at 4 GHz) ...|$|R
30|$|We {{investigate}} the optimal design of uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) employed in multiple-input multiple-output communications, where a strong line-of-sight (LOS) component is present. A general geometrical model is introduced {{to model the}} LOS component, which allows for any orientation of the transmit and receive arrays, and incorporates the uniform linear array as a special case of the URA. A spherical wave propagation model is used. Based on this model, we derive the optimal array design equations with respect to mutual information, resulting in orthogonal LOS subchannels. The equations reveal {{that it is the}} distance between the antennas projected onto the plane <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>transmission</b> direction that is of importance with respect to design. Further, we {{investigate the}} influence of nonoptimal design, and derive analytical expressions for the singular values of the LOS matrix {{as a function of the}} quality of the array design. To evaluate a more realistic channel, the LOS channel matrix is employed in a Ricean channel model. Performance results show that even with some deviation from the optimal design, we get better performance than in the case of uncorrelated Rayleigh subchannels.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{production}} {{technology for}} a geometrically accurate Solid {{model of a}} helical-gear set in the SolidWorks package is suggested. The construction stages are calculation, development of blanks, development of tooth rims and involute gears. The involute meshing is formed in the normal as related to a tooth curve plane using equivalent wheels and making involutes according to parametric equations. The closed region of a tooth contour is pressed out along the trajectory, a helix with an angle of lead equal to the helix angle is used in such capacity. Then the tooth is distributed following the Circular Sketch Pattern along a blank, forming a rim of the wheel. The gear assembly is carried out {{with the help of}} a layout sketch. The teeth are matched with gashes by using a pitch point and cutting the teeth by a plane which is <b>perpendicular</b> to a <b>transmission</b> axis. The accuracy of a gear model is analyzed by clearance measuring, interference, parameters of rims, and sizing of contact patterns. The examination shows a lack of interference between the gear and the wheel, side clearance satisfies mating H, E, tolerance h, which corresponds to the highest class of accuracy, specified by a state standard GOST 1643 - 81 for the helical-gear set...|$|R
40|$|Background: The tectorial {{membrane}} (TM) in the mammalian cochlea displays anisotropy, where mechanical or structural properties differ along varying directions. The anisotropy {{arises from}} the presence of collagen fibrils organized in fibers of, 1 mm diameter that run radially across the TM. Mechanical coupling between the TM and the sensory epithelia is required for normal hearing. However, {{the lack of a}} suitable technique to measure mechanical anisotropy at the microscale level has hindered understanding of the TM’s precise role. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report values of the three elastic moduli that characterize the anisotropic mechanical properties of the TM. Our novel technique combined Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), modeling, and optical tracking of microspheres to determine the elastic moduli. We found that the TM’s large mechanical anisotropy results in a marked transmission of deformations along the direction that maximizes sensory cell excitation, whereas in the <b>perpendicular</b> direction the <b>transmission</b> is greatly reduced. Conclusions/Significance: Computational results, based on our values of elastic moduli, suggest that the TM facilitates the directional cooperativity of sensory cells in the cochlea, and that mechanical properties of the TM are tuned to guarantee that the magnitude of sound-induced tip-link stretching remains similar {{along the length of the}} cochlea. Furthermore, we anticipate our assay to be a starting point for other studies of biological tissues that require directional functionality...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{calculate}} the location of all Bragg diffraction peaks from nanostructured thin films for arbitrary angles of incidence from just above the critical angle to <b>transmission</b> <b>perpendicular</b> to the film is reported. At grazing angles, the positions are calculated using the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), whereas for larger angles where the diffracted beams are transmitted though the substrate, the Born approximation (BA) is used. This method has been incorporated into simulation code (called NANOCELL) and {{may be used to}} overlay simulated spot patterns directly onto two-dimensional (2 D) grazing angle of incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) patterns and 2 D SAXS patterns. The GISAXS simulations are limited to the case where the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle (alpha(i) 3 ̆e alpha(c)) and the diffraction occurs above the critical angle (alpha(f) 3 ̆e alpha(c)). For cases of surfactant self-assembled films, the limitations are not restrictive because, typically, the critical angle is around 0. 2 degrees but the largest d spacings occur around 0. 8 degrees 2 theta. For these materials, one finds that the DWBA predicts that the spot positions from the transmitted main beam deviate only slightly from the BA and only for diffraction peaks close the critical angle. Additional diffraction peaks from the reflected main beam are observed in GISAXS geometry but are much less intense. Using these simulations, 2 D spot patterns may be used to identify space group, identify the orientation, and quantitatively fit the lattice constants for SAXS data from any angle of incidence. Characteristic patterns for 2 D GISAXS and 2 D low-angle transmission SAXS patterns are generated for the most common thin film structures, and as a result, GISAXS and SAXS patterns that were previously difficult to interpret are now relatively straightforward. The simulation code (NANOCELL) is written in Mathematica and is available from the author upon request...|$|R
40|$|Amyloid stained by Congo red is {{traditionally}} said to show apple-green birefringence in polarized light, although in practice various colors {{may be seen}} between accurately crossed polarizing filters, called polarizer and analyzer. Other colors are seen as the polarizer and analyzer are uncrossed and sometimes when the slide is rotated. Previously, {{there has been no}} satisfactory explanation of these properties. Birefringence means that a material has two refractive indices, depending on its orientation in polarized light. Birefringence can change linearly polarized light to elliptically polarized, which allows light to pass a crossed analyzer. The birefringence of orientated Congo red varied with wavelength and was maximal near its absorption peak, changing from negative (slow axis of <b>transmission</b> <b>perpendicular</b> to smears or amyloid fibrils) on the shortwave side of the peak to positive (slow axis parallel) on the longwave side. This was explained by a property of any light-absorbing substance called anomalous dispersion of the refractive index around an absorption peak. Negative birefringence gave transmission of blue, positive gave yellow, and the mixture was perceived as green. This explains how green occurs in ideal conditions. Additional or strain birefringence in the optical system, such as in glass slides, partly or completely eliminated blue or yellow, giving yellow/green or yellow, and blue/green or blue, which are commonly seen in practice and in illustrations. With uncrossing of polarizer or analyzer, birefringent effects declined and dichroic effects appeared, giving progressive changes from green to red as the plane of polarization approached the absorbing axis and from green to colorless in the opposite way. This asymmetry of effects is useful to pathologists as a confirmation of amyloid. Rather than showing 'apple-green birefringence in polarized light' as often reported, Congo red-stained amyloid, when examined between crossed polarizer and analyzer, should more accurately be said to show anomalous colors. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Structural timber {{including}} {{finger joints}} is an economically interesting product, {{because it is}} made from timber with smaller dimensions. Requirements for material properties and guidelines for the manufacturing process and the factory's internal quality control are composed in DIN 68140 - 1 and DIN EN 385. However, to support quality assurance and to avoid quality problems, nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are requested. Possible methods for NDT of finger joints can be taken from the numerous publications about NDT of wood. These methods are reviewed and evaluated regarding the special features of finger jointed timber: For ultrasound <b>transmission</b> (<b>perpendicular</b> to the wood fiber or diagonally through the joint) transmitters and receivers have to be coupled well to the timber. Stress-wave techniques along the beam are easier to apply but the measured parameters (stress wave velocity, frequency spectrum) and evaluation methods have to be selected very carefully to localize weak zones. Excitation and measurement of bending vibrations is easy to handle as well but this method works properly only if weak joints in the beam affect the vibration modes. A novel method is local ultrasound excitation together with a thermographic detection of heat which is generated by friction in splits or poorly glued joints. Among the mechanical techniques stress-grading (bending test) is not suitable for large cross-sections and proof-loading (tension test) is a destructive method. Tomography using X-rays is also available but at high expenditures. Several of these possible methods have been tested but {{for the time being}} there is no favorite technique which has already proved to solve the problem. The wood industry is still looking for a safe technique with only small expenses for sensors and data acquisition but the first steps to achieve this goal have been made...|$|R
40|$|Near {{infrared}} photonic crystals {{were generated}} by two-photon photopolymerization of urethane acrylate monomers and oligomers {{in a commercial}} UV-absorbing resin (SCR 500, Japan Synthetic Rubber Co. Ltd.), followed by a washout of the unpolymerized material using Ethanol. We fabricated woodpile structures consisting of 40 layers spaced at 350 - 500 nm with a lateral size of 60 - 65 x 60 - 70 micrometers. Adjacent layers were oriented perpendicularly. Corresponding layers were displaced by half the in-plane period of 1. 25 - 1. 5 micrometers. The structures were produced using 0. 5 - 1. 1 mW femtosecond pulsed 540 nm light from a Ti:Sapphire laser combined with an optical parametric oscillator with an intra-cavity frequency doubler. Scan speeds were chosen between 30 and 90 microns/s. Ellipsoidal rods with 200 - 300 nm lateral and 600 - 900 nm axial diameters acted as basic structural elements. The ratio of 3. 1 between the diameters reflects the two-photon point-spread function for our Zeiss 40 x NA 1. 3 objective. All structures showed pronounced photonic bandgaps, which were investigated using our FTIR microspectroscopy system (Nicolet Nexus/Continuum). Dependent on their quality for <b>perpendicular</b> incident light <b>transmission</b> was suppressed by up to 50 % at wavelengths around 2. 0 micrometers with gap/midgap ratios up to 0. 18. Increasing the rod cross section {{by a factor of}} two shifted the bandgap to 10 % larger wavelengths due to the higher filling ratio. As a peculiarity of the woodpile structure the reduction of the in-plane rod spacing leads to a proportional decrease of the gap wavelength. For well-correlated structures sizable higher-order bandgaps were observed at wavelengths near 1. 4 micrometers still providing a suppression of transmission by up to 25 %. Reduction of the layer spacing from 500 nm down to 350 nm shifts the bandgap into the important telecommunication wavelength range 1. 3 - 1. 55 microns. However, the gap shape strongly changes with increased overlapping of the rods. A shoulder appears on the shorter wavelength side, and finally the gap splits into two smaller peaks. Axial superresolution is desirable to further improve our near infrared photonic crystals...|$|R
40|$|The {{main subject}} of this master s thesis is ground {{resistance}} measurements on interconnected transmission towers. Statnett, which is the Norwegian transmission system operator, initiated the assignment {{as a result of}} experienced problems with the currently used method. The purpose of the master s thesis is to select an adequate method for measurement of ground resistance at interconnected transmission towers, by evaluation of different methods. In this thesis six methods are explained, and their qualities are investigated by simulations in CDEGS as well as practical research measurements. Based on this investigation it was possible to identify a method that met the complex requirements for ground resistance measurements on interconnected transmission towers, as well as Statnett s preferences regarding time-consumption. The most adequate method for Statnett to use is one particular variation of the Fall of Potential method. This method involves a correction factor to find the real resistance of the ground electrode. When performing measurements on counterpoise electrodes, the current electrode is located <b>perpendicular</b> to the <b>transmission</b> line, at a distance equal to the ground electrode s extension in the measuring direction. Similarly, for ring electrodes it is located at a distance of four times the ground electrode s extension. The potential electrode is located {{in the middle of the}} ground electrode and the current electrode for both counterpoise and ring electrodes. Simulations performed using this measuring method, with soil conditions representative for Norwegian tower sites, show that it has an accuracy of ± 22 %, which is acceptable. The method requires short test electrode distances. As a result of this it is less time-consuming and less sensitive to local variations in soil resistivity nearby the ground electrode, compared to the other methods. Other investigated methods also resulted in good accuracy when simulating the measurement methods. However, these methods are more time-consuming and more sensitive to soil conditions or the potential electrode s location. Some of the methods resulted in resistances that were substantially lower than the actual resistance of the ground electrode under test. An instruction for ground resistance measurements on interconnected transmission towers has been made. With the help of this, a work instruction will be written and the method will be implemented at Statnett during summer 2007. </p...|$|R
