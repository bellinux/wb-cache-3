5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} <b>played</b> <b>them</b> {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|During the Wushe Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted {{against the}} Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Wushe Incident, since the Japanese had long <b>played</b> <b>them</b> off {{against each other}} and the Japanese used Toda and Truku (Taroko) {{collaborators}} to massacre the Tkdaya. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident. The Truku had resisted and fought the Japanese before in the 1914 Truku war 太魯閣戰爭 but had since been pacified and collaborated with the Japanese in the 1930 Wushe against the Tkdaya.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only <b>played</b> <b>them</b> with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine <b>played</b> <b>them</b> confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, he hit his wicket when setting off for a run, but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom {{he did not have a}} good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go for a run.|$|E

5|$|Utopia, Limited (1893), their {{penultimate}} opera, was a {{very modest}} success, and their last, The Grand Duke (1896), was an outright failure. Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also <b>played</b> <b>them</b> in repertory.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull had an {{opportunity}} to inflict more blows on the tourists as Victoria <b>played</b> <b>them</b> for the second time ahead of the final Test. While his state was unable to force a result, Woodfull continued his strong form with 44 and 73 not out. The Australian captain finished the season with a duck from the opening ball of the fifth Test, bowled after failing to offer a shot, but Australia won by an innings an 72 runs in the equivalent of a single day's play on a sticky wicket.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{spent several}} weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949, {{and brought back}} a woman called Clotilde from Copacabana who lived with him in Ithaca for a time. As well as the cold weather, {{there was also the}} Cold War. The Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb in 1949, {{generating}} anti-communist hysteria. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950, and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty. Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950, and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. A girlfriend told Feynman that he should consider moving to South America. He had a sabbatical coming for 1951–52, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas. In Brazil, Feynman was particularly impressed with the Samba music, and learned to play a metal percussion instrument, the frigideira. He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo drums and often <b>played</b> <b>them</b> in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio with his good friend Bohm, but Bohm could not convince Feynman to take up investigating Bohm's ideas on physics.|$|E

5|$|Heskey was {{selected}} in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and {{was used as a}} makeshift option to play in England's left-wing role in the match against Sweden, but did not perform well out of his regular position. He scored against Denmark in England's 3–0 victory, which saw England reach the quarter-finals of the tournament. He featured in this match, where England were beaten 2–1 by the eventual champions Brazil. He and teammate Ashley Cole received abuse from some Slovakia supporters when England <b>played</b> <b>them</b> in a friendly in October 2002, which led to UEFA opening an investigation into the allegations. Slovakia were eventually forced to play their next home international behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Cardiff were drawn away against Bolton Wanderers, the reigning FA Cup champions. In {{front of a}} crowd of 49,465 in Bolton, Cardiff won by two goals to nil, with further goals from Ferguson and Davies. Following this round, {{alongside}} Arsenal, they were {{one of only two}} teams from the Football League First Division who remained in the competition. After an initial goalless draw in the following round against Chelsea, Cardiff <b>played</b> <b>them</b> once again at Ninian Park in the replay. Sam Irving put the Welsh team ahead after nine minutes, before Davies made it two on 21 minutes. Chelsea received a penalty, but the shot by Andrew Wilson was saved by Farquharson. Albert Thain scored for Chelsea a minute before half time. Bob Turnbull equalised for Chelsea, four minutes into the second half. A further penalty was given, this time to Cardiff after Harry Wilding handled the ball. This time, Ferguson scored, putting Cardiff ahead once more and winning them the match.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was joined}} by his skipper Yardley and after playing defensively for a period, the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs in 100 minutes. After the loss of four quick wickets, the Compton and Yardley elected to not play at any balls that {{were not on the}} line of the stumps, and Lindwall and Johnston were taken off to recuperate ahead of the second new ball. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to {{replenish}} their energy levels. Meanwhile, Johnson and Toshack operated, and the English duo <b>played</b> <b>them</b> cautiously and comfortably. At tea, England had recovered to be 129/4, with Compton on 51 and Yardley 42. The English captain had been particularly successful against Johnson, capitalising on a series of overpitched balls and driving them away for runs. After tea, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball, but the former appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, ending his innings for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. Evans came to the crease and tried to counter-attack, hitting Lindwall for a boundary past square leg. Johnston then removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller from a swing of the bat wide outside off stump, leaving the hosts at 145/7.|$|E

Karlheinz Stockhausen and Edgard Varèse later used similar techniques. Les Paul and Mary Ford recorded layered vocal harmonies and guitar parts, modifying prior tracks with effects such as ambient reverb while recording the net result together on a new track. Les Paul placed a loudspeaker at one end of a tunnel and a microphone at the other end. The loudspeaker played back previously recorded material - the microphone recorded the resulting altered sound.|$|E
