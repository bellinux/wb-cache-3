5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats are <b>perfectly</b> <b>capable</b> of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} {{side effect}} {{of the war was}} the collapse of the system of rebuilding. Until the outbreak of the war, it had been the practice to rebuild ships periodically, to maintain the size of the fleet without alarming parliament with requests for new ships. In reality, many of these rebuilds amounted to just that, with little or no timber from the original ship surviving into her rebuilt form. In some cases, ships would be dismantled years before they actually underwent the rebuilding process, but remained on the active list for the entire time. Rebuilding a ship was a lengthy process, more time consuming and more expensive than building a completely new one. The pressures of the war meant that for drydocks to be taken up {{for long periods of time}} whilst a ship was surveyed to determine what timber was reusable in the new ship, and what could find a use elsewhere in the dockyard, disassembled and then rebuilt was counter-productive. Ships intended to be sent to the West Indies for service in the war required the use of drydocks to have their hulls appropriately sheathed to combat such problems as shipworm, and other uses of the drydocks for servicing the fleet meant that rebuilds were given a low priority. It was at this time that the British practise of converting old ships to hulks for expanded storage space in harbours began, as instead of wasting effort and dockyard space on breaking up an old vessel that was still <b>perfectly</b> <b>capable</b> of floating, they were converted to serve the dockyards in this new capacity. Few rebuilds were started after 1739, and none at all were begun after 1742, although any that had been started were allowed to complete.|$|E

Some of the answers are likely to focus around ideas of social identities.

60|$|The {{following}} lectures[1] are {{an attempt}} to show, by means of examples, the nature, capacity, and limitations of the logical-analytic method in philosophy. This method, of which the first complete example {{is to be found}} in the writings of Frege, has gradually, in the course of actual research, increasingly forced itself upon me as something <b>perfectly</b> definite, <b>capable</b> of embodiment in maxims, and adequate, in all branches of philosophy, to yield whatever objective scientific knowledge it is possible to obtain. Most of the methods hitherto practised have professed to lead to more ambitious results than any that logical analysis can claim to reach, but unfortunately these results have always been such as many competent philosophers considered inadmissible. Regarded merely as hypotheses and as aids to imagination, the great systems of the past serve a very useful purpose, and are abundantly worthy of study. But something different is required if philosophy is to become a science, and to aim at results independent of the tastes and temperament of the philosopher who advocates them. In what follows, I have endeavoured to show, however imperfectly, the way by which I believe that this desideratum is to be found.|$|R

Lang had not finished editing the film, and would not have a print for Goebbels to view until March 23. After a screening for Goebbels, he declared that the premiere would be delayed for technical reasons. Goebbels hosted a meeting at his home between himself, Lang and several other German filmmakers on discussions on what films would be permitted by Nazi censorship. Goebbels referred to Lang's films as the style that Hitler wanted for Nazi Germany. By March 30, the Ministry of Propaganda banned The Testament of Dr. Mabuse as a menace to public health and safety. Goebbels stated that he would not accept the film as it [...] "showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are <b>perfectly</b> <b>capable</b> of overthrowing any state with violence". During the 1940s, Lang stated that a meeting occurred between Goebbels and himself with Goebbels wanting Lang to work for him to create films for the Nazis.

40|$|Quorum sensing (QS) is {{a process}} of {{bacterial}} communication and cooperation mediated by the release of jointly exploited signals and "public goods" into the environment. There are conflicting reports on the behavior of mutants deficient in the release of these materials.

Here we show via agent-based computational simulations that this apparent discrepancy is due to the difference between open and closed systems. We suggest that the experimental difference {{is due to the fact}} that wild type cells can easily saturate a well-mixed culture flask with signals and public goods so QS will be not necessary after a certain time point. As a consequence, QS-deficient mutants can continue to grow even after the wild type population has vanished. This phenomenon is not likely to occur in open environments including open surfaces and agar plate models. In other words, even if QS is required for survival, QS deficient mutants may grow faster initially in short term laboratory experiments or computer simulations, while only WT cells appear stable over longer time scales, especially when adaptation to changing environments is important...|$|R

In the case of BRCA1 (and MDC1), the peptide-binding groove lies in a cleft formed by the junction of the two domains.

5000|$|The {{most serious}} {{criticisms of the}} hiddenness {{argument}} have been leveled against {{the idea that a}} perfectly loving God would prevent nonresistant nonbelief. Schellenberg argues in two steps, by first claiming that a loving God would enable humans to partake in a relationship with it, and then, assuming that belief in that god is a necessary condition for such relationships to occur, inferring that a loving God would not permit nonbelief. He states: There is, first of all, the claim {{that if there is a}} personal God who is <b>perfectly</b> loving, creatures <b>capable</b> of explicit and positively meaningful relationship with God, who have not freely shut themselves off from God, are always in a position to participate in such relationship - able to do so just by trying to. He justifies this claim by arguing that a conception of divine love can best be formed by extrapolating the best aspects of love in human relations, and draws an analogy with perfect parental love: The perfectly loving parent, for example, from the time the child can first respond to her at all until death separates them, will, insofar as she can help it, see to it that nothing she does ever puts relationship with herself out of reach for her child. But, says Schellenberg, belief in God's existence is necessary for engaging in such a meaningful relationship with God. He therefore concludes that if there is a perfectly loving God, such creatures will always believe in it. He further argues that since belief is involuntary, these creatures should always have evidence [...] "causally sufficient" [...] for such belief: The presence of God will be for them like a light that - however much the degree of its brightness may fluctuate - remains on unless they close their eyes.|$|R

Although they batted out a draw in four of the Tests they {{collapsed}} twice in the second innings of the Sydney Tests, the only wicket that did not favour the bat. Bill Lawry was a dour left-handed opening batsman with tremendous concentration who was once unfairly described as [...] "a corpse with pads on". He failed to make a century, but still made 324 runs (40.50) and carried his bat through the Australian debacle at Sydney. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out and even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Keith Stackpole was a heavily built opening batsman <b>perfectly</b> <b>capable</b> of hitting the ball round the ground, he made 627 runs (52.25) and two centuries in the series, but had the benefit of five [...] "lives" [...] from the umpires. Ian Redpath was another opening batsman, but tall and ungainly, making 497 safe runs (49.70) at his own slow pace, [...] "I liked bowling to him least of all" [...] Snow wrote, [...] "a real nuisance batsman". Greg Chappell said he was one of only two players he knew who would kill to get into the Australian Test team. The other was wicket-keeper Rod Marsh who was chosen for his batting skills rather than his glovemanship. Despite being right-handed in everything else he batted left-handed and was a very powerful hitter of the ball. The entertaining Doug Walters made 205 not out for New South Wales against the tourists and 112 in the First Test, but had developed a distaste for fast bowling in South Africa and John Snow took advantage of his cavalier play by feeding him short balls on the off-stump with a pair of gully fielders. Ian Chappell would later say [...] "three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me"., as a result of working on his hook shot after his encounters with John Snow, but he still made 452 runs (37.66) and two fighting centuries in the series. His younger brother Greg would be regarded as the best Australian batsmen for decades, but in this series was limited to leg-side play and could not hope to match his famous maiden Test century in the later games.|$|E
