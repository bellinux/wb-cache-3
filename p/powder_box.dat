2500|$|Mary Lincoln was {{so happy}} with the china service that she also ordered a small set for the family’s {{personal}} use, and a [...] "toilet set" [...] {{for use in the}} family bedrooms. The toilet set was ordered on July 18, 1861, and consisted of two services. The one for Abraham and Mary Lincoln consisted of a ewer and basin, covered chamber pot, soap box, brush tray, jug, foot bath, and slop jar. It cost $45, and was decorated with the solferino border, although the Alhambra edging was replaced with a quatrefoil and tassel motif. The Great Seal of the United States was replaced with a Gothic [...] "ML" [...] in the center. A plain white toilet set, with the same items, formed the second set. This less fancy set cost just $24.50. Mrs. Lincoln ordered a third fancy toilet set, this one decorated with the U.S. coat of arms, on July 30. It appears intended for Mrs. Lincoln's bedroom, as it also included a ewer, sponge box, <b>powder</b> <b>box,</b> and pair of candlesticks. The cost of the third toilet set was $115.|$|E

6000|$|To-night John Perkins {{encountered}} a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace {{when he reached}} his door. No Katy was there with her affectionate, confectionate kiss. The three rooms seemed in portentous disorder. All about lay her things in confusion. Shoes {{in the middle of}} the floor, curling tongs, hair bows, kimonos, <b>powder</b> <b>box,</b> jumbled together on dresser and chairs--this was not Katy's way. With a sinking heart John saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth. Some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her, for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine [...] "rat." ...|$|E

Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers. to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and <b>powder</b> <b>boxes</b> were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.|$|R
50|$|As make-up {{became more}} {{mainstream}} {{and women were}} increasingly active outside the home, compacts became more popular. British manufacturer Stratton began importing part-finished <b>powder</b> <b>boxes</b> from the US for assembly at its Birmingham plant in 1923 and by the 1930s it was creating them from scratch and producing half the compacts used by the UK cosmetics industry. The company developed self-opening inner lids in 1948 - {{designed to protect the}} powder and prevent damage to fingernails - and by the 1960s it was exporting to agents worldwide.|$|R

Increasing production costs and competition from large-scale producers have {{reduced the number of}} people involved in the production. The city produces bell metal craft like Thanjavur metal plates, bronze images bowls, napkins and <b>powder</b> <b>boxes</b> made of copper and bronze. The city is a major manufacturer of pith works consisting of models of Hindu idols, mosques, garlands and other bird figurines.

5000|$|Blake {{then went}} to the ship's gun deck and was {{immediately}} knocked down by an exploding Confederate shell. The explosion had killed a powder-boy manning one of the guns. Blake had no assigned combat role and could have retreated to relative safety below decks, but he instead chose to take over the powder boy's duties. He stripped to the waist and began running <b>powder</b> <b>boxes</b> to the gun loaders. When Lieutenant Commander Mead asked him what he was doing, he replied [...] "Went down to the rocks to hide my face, but the rocks said there is no hiding place here. So here I am, Sir."

5000|$|He {{was known}} as a {{chaplain}} who was deeply involved with the troops, not hesitating to go into battle with them. During one battalion march across corn fields and ditches, Chaplain McCarty was the first to start tearing down growing corn stalks and throwing them in ditches to make the effort safer and faster for the troops. During the Battle of Churubusco, August 20, 1847, Chaplain McCarty distinguished himself by ignoring the heavy fire, in order to console the wounded and encouraging the other men to go on fighting. McCarty didn’t agree with war, but as a chaplain he insisted that “when duty called, personal earnestness and bravery should be manifested in the chaplain {{as well as in the}} officers of the line”. Chaplain McCarty thus insisted on going with the fighting troops into battle. The troops called him “the fighting parson”. When they were fording a stream he was quoted as saying “Boys, this is an unholy war, but be careful to keep your <b>powder</b> <b>boxes</b> up and not get your powder wet.” ...|$|R

Those arrested are reported to include several men from Derry and a former Sinn Féin councillor. A suspected IRA member was arrested at Heuston Station, along with two others. Money to the sum of €94,000 was found in their vehicle, in a washing <b>powder</b> <b>box.</b> One of the men, Don Bullman from Co. Cork, was charged on 18 February at the Special Criminal Court with IRA membership. He was jailed for IRA membership but never charged in connection with the Northern Bank robbery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{new church}} was {{designed}} by Eiermann and consists of four buildings grouped around the remaining ruins of the old church. The initial design included the demolition of the spire of the old church but following pressure from the public, {{it was decided to}} incorporate it into the new design. The four buildings comprise, on the west of the ruins, the new church with a foyer to its west, and to the east of the ruins, a tower with a chapel to its northeast. The plan of the church is octagonal while the plan of the tower is hexagonal. These components are sited on a plateau measuring 100 metres long and 40 metres wide. The new buildings are constructed of concrete, steel and glass. The walls of the church are made of a concrete honeycomb containing 21,292 stained glass inlays. The glass, designed by Gabriel Loire, was inspired by the colours of the glass in Chartres Cathedral. The predominant colour is blue, with small areas of ruby red, emerald green and yellow. The church is 35 metres in diameter and 20.5 metres high with a capacity of over 1,000. Because of the distinctive appearance of the new buildings, it is sometimes nicknamed [...] "Lippenstift und Puderdose" [...] (the lipstick and the <b>powder</b> <b>box)</b> by Berliners.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{component}} was {{a length of}} metal pipe, about [...] in diameter and [...] long, containing smokeless explosive <b>powder.</b> The <b>box</b> and the plugs sealing the pipe's ends were handcrafted from wood. Most pipe bombs use threaded metal ends easily obtained by consumers; the wooden ends lacked the strength for significant pressure to build within the pipe, weakening the blast. The trigger was primitive: a nail, tensioned by rubber bands, which would strike six common match heads when the box was opened; the match heads would ignite and initiate combustion of the powder. Kaczynski later used batteries and heat filament wire to ignite the powder more effectively.|$|R
2500|$|On 15 March 1808 Terpsichore was sailing some 60 {{miles off}} Ceylon when a mysterious sail was spotted coming up fast. The ship came up at 5.50 that evening, hoisted English colours and fired a shot, before {{changing}} tack. She fired a second shot at 6.45, at which Montagu hauled up and hove-to. As the strange ship approached, Montagu {{was able to}} determine her to be hostile, and Terpsichore opened fire, which was returned and a general action began. The enemy ship, which was the 40-gun French frigate Sémillante under Captain Léonard-Bernard Motard, closed at 7.10 and threw some combustible materials onto the deck, which caused a large explosion amongst <b>boxes</b> of <b>powder.</b> The explosion unmanned four guns and started fires, which the officers and men of Terpsichore struggled with but successfully extinguished. The two ships exchanged fire for sometime, each trying to manoeuvre into an advantageous position, until the Sémillante ceased fire at 8 and bore round to escape. Terpsichore had been badly damaged in her sails and rigging, but gave chase, {{and for the next}} four days pursued the fleeing French. By 20 March most of the damage to Terpsichore had been repaired, and she was fast closing on the French ship, under fire from her stern-chasers. The French eventually resorted to throwing overboard her boats, lumber, water and provisions and so Sémillante was finally able to pull away and escape her pursuers. Terpsichores losses were almost entirely caused by the explosion of the <b>powder</b> <b>boxes,</b> and amounted to one lieutenant and twenty men killed and twenty-two wounded, two of them mortally.|$|R

50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, {{he was given the}} sloop Zebra, in June 1793, stationed in the English Channel and then - through his mother's lobbying of Lord Chatham - attached to Sir John Jervis's expedition to the West Indies. There, in the February 1794 attack on Martinique, HMS Zebra and HMS Asia (64 guns) were ordered to give covering fire for the landing of ground troops and seamen (from other smaller ships, under the direct command of Captains Riou and Nugent) by anchoring close under the walls of Fort St Louis. But - when the Asia failed to reach her allotted position - Faulknor instead took the Zebra even closer to the fort, scaled its walls at the head of his men and had a lucky escape when a wooden cartouche (<b>powder</b> cartridge) <b>box</b> strapped to his waist was struck by grapeshot but left him unharmed. Riou and Nugent's force had probably already entered the fort by this point, but Jervis witnessed Faulknor's action, publicly praised him for it and promoted him captain of the frigate Rose. He then took command of the heavier frigate Blanche (32 guns) several months later, (as the expedition moved to attack the island of Guadeloupe).|$|R

Drawers in the counter contained needles, pins, scissors, thimbles, fish-hooks, and vermilion for painting canoes and faces. The floor was strewn with a variety of copper and tin kettles, from half a pint to a gallon; and on a stand in the furthest corner of the room stood about a dozen trading guns, and beside them a keg of <b>powder</b> and a <b>box</b> of shot.|$|R
