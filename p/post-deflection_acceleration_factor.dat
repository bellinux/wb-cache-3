The automatic <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> decision method, using the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of a coefficient matrix, has been previously proposed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{short history}} is given of {{cathode-ray}} tubes, {{from the earliest}} laboratory tubes available during the early 1900 's through present day high performance tubes. Special {{attention is paid to}} the development of <b>post-deflection</b> <b>acceleration</b> types especially band-type PDA tubes and an improvement on that type known as the helix-type PDA tube. One of the most severe complications of the band or helix-type PDA tube has been scan compression. Analysis of this problem has led directly into the noncompressing method developed here. A model of this noncompressing method, i. e. the voltage and gradient between two spheres, is applied to a practical system. Some of the constraints of the practical system including the problem of two virtual sources for the beam, the design of the field-forming element and the limitations on the application of the required boundary conditions, have complicated the design somewhat. These constraints have not prevented the achievement of a close approximation to the voltage and gradient required from the analysis. Evaluation of this new noncompressing CRT (now called a mesh-type tube) shows it to be superior to the older types of PDA tubes in every respect except for minimum spot size. In addition to the mesh tube's low sensibility and high writing speed, the mesh tube is compact and adapts nicely to the small package size required for modern day equipment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{proposes a}} new {{acceleration}} method for neutron transport calculations: the gen-eralized coarse-mesh rebalance (GCMR) method. The GCMR method is a unified scheme {{of the traditional}} coarse-mesh rebalance (CMR) and the coarse-mesh finite difference (CMFD) acceleration methods. Namely, by using an appropriate <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor,</b> formulation of the GCMR method becomes identical {{to that of the}} CMR or CMFD method. This also indicates that the convergence property of the GCMR method can be controlled by the <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> since the convergence properties of the CMR and CMFD methods are generally different. In order to evaluate the convergence property of the GCMR method, a linearized Fourier analysis was carried out for a one-group homogeneous medium, and the results clarified the relationship between the <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> and the spectral radius. It was also shown that the spectral radius of the GCMR method is smaller than those of the CMR and CMFD methods. Furthermore, the Fourier analysis showed that when an appropriate <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> was used, the spectral radius of the GCMR method did not exceed unity in this study, which was in contrast to the results of the CMR or the CMFD method. Application of the GCMR method to practical calculations will be easy when the CMFD acceleration is already adopted in a transport code. By multiplying a suitable <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> to a coefficient (DFD) of a finite difference formulation, one can improve the numerical instability of the CMFD acceleration method.

In this work, we propose a novel method that accelerates the acquisition of MR diffusion data by undersampling in both spatial and b-value dimensions, thanks to incorporating knowledge about the signal decay into the reconstruction (SIDER). SIDER is compared to total variation (TV) reconstruction by assessing their effect on both the recovery of ventilation images and estimated mean alveolar dimensions (MAD). Both methods are assessed by retrospectively undersampling diffusion datasets of normal volunteers and COPD patients (n= 8) for <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> between x 2 and x 10. TV led to large errors and artefacts for <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors</b> equal or larger than x 5.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{enforcing}} sparsity during {{magnetic resonance imaging}} reconstruction has been successfully applied to partially parallel imaging (PPI) techniques to reduce noise and artifact levels and hence to achieve even higher <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors.</b> However, {{there are two major}} problems in the existing sparsity-constrained PPI techniques: speed and robustness. By introducing an auxiliary variable and decomposing the original minimization problem into two subproblems that are much easier to solve, a fast and robust numerical algorithm for sparsity-constrained PPI technique is developed in this work. The specific implementation for a conventional Cartesian trajectory data set is named self-feeding Sparse Sensitivity Encoding (SENSE). The computational cost for the proposed method is two conventional SENSE reconstructions plus one spatially adaptive image denoising procedure. With reconstruction time approximately doubled, images with a much lower root mean square error (RMSE) can be achieved at high <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors.</b> Using a standard eight-channel head coil, a net <b>acceleration</b> <b>factor</b> of 5 along one dimension can be achieved with low RMSE.

In this study, we aimed to identify which factors are important in estimating a patient’s time {{to return to work}} following primary total knee arthroplasty, how long patients can anticipate being off from work, and the types of jobs to which patients are able to return following primary total knee arthroplasty. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in which patients scheduled for a primary total knee arthroplasty completed a validated questionnaire preoperatively and at four to six weeks, three months, and six months postopera-tively. The questionnaire assessed the patient’s occupational physical demands, ability to perform job responsibilities, physical status, and motivation to return to work as well as factors that may impact his or her recovery and other workplace characteristics.

Methods: We propose a novel B-spline-based compressed sensing method (SPLICS) that includes motion estimation and generalizes previous spatiotemporal total variation (ST-TV) methods by taking into account motion between frames. In addition, we assess the effect of an optimum weighting between spatial and temporal sparsity to further improve results. Both methods were implemented using the efficient Split Bregman methodology and were evaluated on rat data comparing animals with myocardial infarction with controls for several <b>acceleration</b> <b>factors.</b> Results: ST-TV with optimum selection of the weighting sparsity parameter led to results {{similar to those of}} SPLICS; ST-TV with large relative temporal sparsity led to temporal blurring effects.
