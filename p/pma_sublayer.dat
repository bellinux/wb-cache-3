50|$|The Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) is a {{networking}} protocol sublayer in the Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards. It resides {{at the top}} of {{the physical}} layer (PHY), and provides an interface between the Physical Medium Attachment (<b>PMA)</b> <b>sublayer</b> and the Media Independent Interface (MII). It is responsible for data encoding/decoding, scrambling/descrambling, alignment marker insertion/removal, block and symbol redistribution, and lane block synchronization and deskew.|$|E
40|$|Clauses 74 and 83 - 88 provide {{definitions}} {{for service}} interfaces, {{but it has}} been agreed that the use of the optional physical instantation for XLAUI / CAUI accompanied by adjacent <b>PMA</b> <b>sublayers</b> means that all of these service itnerfaces are the same SuggestedRemedy give one single definition of a service interface that can be referenced accordingly by the other clause...|$|R
50|$|Gigabit {{and faster}} Ethernet links over twisted pair cable use all four cable pairs for {{simultaneous}} transmission in both directions. For this reason, {{there are no}} dedicated transmit and receive pairs, and consequently, crossover cables are never required for 1000BASE-T communication. The physical medium attachment <b>sublayer</b> (<b>PMA)</b> provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cables where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.|$|R
50|$|In a {{departure}} from both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T and faster use all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions {{through the use of}} adaptive equalization and a five-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-5) technique. For this reason, there are no dedicated transmit and receive pairs, and consequently, crossover cables are never required for 1000BASE-T, 2.5GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T, 10GBASE-T, and 40GBASE-T communication. From 1000BASE-T onwards the physical medium attachment <b>sublayer</b> (<b>PMA)</b> provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cable where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.|$|R
