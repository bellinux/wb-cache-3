40|$|Crop yield map is {{a useful}} means to {{quantify}} yield variations within the fields {{and to provide a}} scientific basis for implementing site-specific crop management strategies. This research explores the feasibility of developing a new silage yield monitoring system by employing a new mass flow sensor based on using the momentum of chopped material impacting a pivoted plate loaded by a retractable spring installed {{at the end of a}} chopper discharge spout. A precise rotary potentiometer was used to measure the degree of pivoted plate rotation. To save and process the output voltage of the potentiometer, a programmable circuit comprising of AVR microcontroller ATMEGA series and MAX 232 microchip was used and the output data was sent to a portable computer for further processing. To calibrate the output signal of the sensor versus instantaneous chopped material flow rate, the chopper was fed artificially with predetermined mass flow rates of 6, 8 and 10 kg s- 1 of silage corn at five replications for each feeding rate. The results of statistical analysis showed high correlation between degrees of the pivoted-plate rotation and instantaneous feed rates with adjusted R 2 of 0. 98. To evaluate the accuracy of mass flow rate estimation, a <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> <b>weighing</b> system was used during the field tests. The statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between sensor mass flow rate estimation and <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> <b>weighing</b> system output. By using the resulted calibration equation, yield map of a silage cornfield was generated...|$|R
30|$|The {{animals were}} weighed {{to the nearest}} {{kilogram}} using an electronic <b>weighing</b> <b>scale</b> (ZEMIC, model H 8 C-C 3 - 1.5 t- 4 -SC) mounted on a wooden <b>platform.</b> The <b>weighing</b> <b>scales</b> were calibrated prior to the data collection events and again opportunistically, during data collection events. Body measurements were taken by two observers using an ordinary measuring tape and recorded in centimeters. BL was measured as {{the distance from the}} highest point of the shoulders to the pin bone; HG was measured as the body circumference immediately behind the front shoulder at the fourth ribs, posterior to the front leg. Height at withers (HW) was measured as the distance from the ground to the highest point of the withers (Brown et al. 1973; Sawanon et al. 2011; Touchberry and Lush 1950). Body condition (BCS) was scored by two observers on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (fat) (DEFRA 2001; McNamara 2011; Msangi et al. 1999). A total of 352 mature cows and 100 heifers were used for the study. The animals were grouped by visual appraisal of genotype and from farmer recall as 40 – 60, 61 – 80 or 81 – 100  % exotic and grouped by age as mature cows (having calved) or heifers (at least 1  year old and not calved). Visual appraisal was based on the visible characteristics (such as absence of a hump, coat colour, body size) of the respective exotic compared with indigenous breed. The visual appraisal was supported with farmer recall of the breed history. From farmers’ recall of pregnancy status and visual appraisal (udder development and abdominal distension), cows that were at an advanced stage of pregnancy were excluded from the study. There were no notably serious cases of discrepancies between observers hence the full dataset was used for analysis.|$|R

An ensemble average representative of each subject and <b>weighing</b> <b>scale</b> has been obtained by applying Woody’s method with the ECG as a timing reference.
