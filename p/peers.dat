5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{representative}} <b>peers</b> {{were those}} <b>peers</b> {{elected by the}} members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland to sit in the British House of Lords. Until 1999, all members of the Peerage of England held the right to sit in the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives.

Speaking to <b>peers</b> is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their <b>peers.</b> Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} <b>peers,</b> while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish <b>peers</b> were elected. In contrast, Irish representative <b>peers</b> sat for life.

5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish <b>peers,</b> {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative <b>peers,</b> were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish <b>peers</b> were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative <b>peers</b> were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish <b>peers</b> ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal <b>peers,</b> The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative <b>peers</b> could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish <b>peers</b> petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all <b>peers</b> in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish <b>peers</b> to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish <b>peers</b> the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E

5|$|Representative <b>peers</b> were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain.

5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of hereditary <b>peers</b> {{to a seat}} in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All <b>peers</b> receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life <b>peers</b> and the 92 hereditary <b>peers</b> left in the House of Lords.

40|$|Abstract Objectives Projection {{effects have}} been shown to bias {{respondent}} perceptions of <b>peer</b> delinquency, but network data required to measure <b>peer</b> delinquency directly are unavailable in most existing datasets. Some researchers have therefore attempted to adjust perceived <b>peer</b> behavior measures for bias via latent variable modeling techniques. The present study tested whether such adjustments render perceived <b>peer</b> coefficients equal to direct <b>peer</b> coefficients, using original data collected from 538 young adults (269 dyads). Methods After first replicating projection effects in our own data and examining the degree to which measures of personal, perceived <b>peer,</b> and direct <b>peer</b> violence represent empirically distinct constructs, we compared coefficients derived from two alternative models of personal violence. The first model included an error-adjusted latent measure of perceived <b>peer</b> violence as a predictor, whereas the second substituted a latent measure of directly-assessed, peer-reported violence. Results Results suggest that personal, perceived <b>peer,</b> and direct <b>peer</b> measures each reflect fundamentally separate constructs, but call into question whether latent variable techniques used by prior researchers to correct for respondent bias are capable of rendering perceived <b>peer</b> coefficients equal to direct <b>peer</b> coefficients. Conclusions Research cannot bypass the collection of direct <b>peer</b> delinquency measures via latent variable modeling adjustments to perceived <b>peer</b> measures, nor should models of deviance view perceived <b>peer</b> and direct <b>peer</b> measures as alternative measures of the same underlying construct. Rather, theories of <b>peer</b> influence should elaborate and test models that simultaneously include both <b>peer</b> measures and, further, should attempt to identify those factors that account for currently unexplained variance in perceptions of <b>peer</b> behavior...|$|R

5|$|The last {{trial in}} the House of Lords was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for {{manslaughter}} (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by <b>peers</b> but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial by <b>peers</b> was abolished when the Lords added {{an amendment to the}} Criminal Justice Act 1948, which the Commons accepted. Now <b>peers</b> are tried by juries composed of commoners, though <b>peers</b> were themselves excused from jury service until the House of Lords Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords.

5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage extends to all temporal <b>peers</b> and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some <b>peers</b> (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish <b>peers</b> from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish <b>peers</b> from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the {{privilege of}} peerage. From 1800, Irish <b>peers</b> have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary <b>peers</b> of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of <b>peers.</b> A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not <b>peers.</b>|$|E

Regarding the floor described by Dowker, <b>Peers</b> noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross.
