5|$|Birmingham as a {{settlement}} {{dates from the}} Anglo-Saxon era. The city's name comes from the Old English Beormingahām, meaning the home or settlement of the Beormingas – indicating that Birmingham {{was established in the}} 6th or early 7th century as the <b>primary</b> <b>settlement</b> of an Anglian tribal grouping and regio of that name. Despite this early importance, {{by the time of the}} Domesday Book of 1086 the manor of Birmingham was one of the poorest and least populated in Warwickshire, valued at only 20 shillings, with the area of the modern city divided between the counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} {{geography of}} colonial Virginia gradually evolved, {{with a variety}} of settlement and jurisdiction models experimented with.

25|$|On November 17, 1753, {{the first}} {{settlers}} arrived at what {{would later become}} the town of Bethabara. This town, despite its rapid growth, was not designed to be the <b>primary</b> <b>settlement</b> on the tract. Some residents expanded to a nearby settlement called Bethania in 1759.

25|$|Upgrading of {{the first}} Activated Sludge plant to use the 'Simplex' system took place between 1970 and 1973. Because of the {{proximity}} of the M60 motorway and the risk that deep excavations might damage it, seven of the final settling tanks were built above ground. Effluent from the Activated Sludge plant was raised up {{to the level of the}} tanks by screw pumps, and the increased hydraulic head improved their performance. The upgrade also included five <b>primary</b> <b>settlement</b> tanks and eight sludge consolidation tanks. Two new sludge boats were purchased in 1971 and 1972, and a new dock was constructed on land which had formerly been used for secondary beds.|$|E
25|$|Discharges {{from the}} Darton sewage {{treatment}} works contained residues from dyes {{used by a}} local carpet manufacturer, which reached the works by a foul sewer, but could not be adequately treated by the existing processes. As a result, the final effluent was a deep red colour, and was {{a major factor in}} the poor biochemical oxygen demand ratings for the river. Major improvements, including new <b>primary</b> <b>settlement</b> tanks and tertiary treatment lagoons, were made to the treatment works, and the carpet manufacturers installed facilities to treat their effluent before it was discharged to the sewer. By 1994, fish were again appearing below the Star Paper Mill weir, and Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency carried out another fish restocking programme.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{had gained}} control of the {{habitats}} {{of the most valuable}} sea otters, the Kurilian-Kamchatkan and Aleutian sea otters. Their fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those of sea otters on the Pacific Northwest Coast and California. The Russians, therefore, advanced to the Northwest Coast only after the superior varieties of sea otters were depleted, around 1788. The Russian entry to the Northwest Coast was slow, however, due to a shortage of ships and sailors. Yakutat Bay was reached in 1794 and the settlement of Slavorossiya was built there in 1795. Reconnaissance of the coast as far as the Queen Charlotte Islands was carried out by James Shields, a British employee of the Golikov-Shelikhov Company. In 1795 Alexandr Baranov, who had been hired in 1790 to manage Shelikhov's fur enterprise, sailed into Sitka Sound, claiming it for Russia. Hunting parties arrived in the following years and by 1800 three-quarters of Russian America's sea otter skins were coming from the Sitka Sound area. In July 1799 Baranov returned on the brig Oryol and established the settlement of Arkhangelsk. It was destroyed by Tlingits in 1802 but rebuilt nearby in 1804 and given the name Novo-Arkhangelsk (New Archangel). It soon become the <b>primary</b> <b>settlement</b> and colonial capital of Russian America. After the Alaska Purchase, it was renamed Sitka, the first capital of Alaska Territory.|$|E
25|$|By the 1700s Lake Minnetonka was {{inhabited}} by the Mdewakanton people, a subtribe of the Dakota Nation. Although their <b>primary</b> <b>settlements</b> lay within the Minnesota River Valley, the Mdewakanton frequented Lake Minnetonka to hunt, fish, and collect maple syrup. Spirit Knob, a peninsula near present-day Wayzata, held spiritual {{significance for the}} Mdewakanton. Following the Dakota War of 1862, however, the Dakota were banished from Minnesota and forced to leave the area.|$|R

25|$|The dumping of sludge {{in the sea}} {{ended in}} 1998, {{following}} a European Community Directive, and the remaining sludge boats were sold. The sludge pipeline was used to transfer sludge to Shell Green, near Widnes, where it is turned into ash, or used in agriculture. Parts of the old secondary beds became the Davyhulme Millennium Nature Reserve in 2000, and low-profile geodesic domes were built over the <b>primary</b> <b>settlement</b> tanks in 2003, {{as part of a}} £20 million odour control scheme. The works continues to be innovative. In 2013, the world's largest thermal hydrolysis plant was commissioned. Sludge is heated to 165 degrees Celsius under pressure, and the pressure is then released in a flash tank. This process breaks up complex organic substances, allowing it to be digested more easily. Large volumes of methane are a by-product, which enables the site to be self-sufficient for gas and electricity. A £200 million upgrade to the second Activated Sludge Plant began in 2014, and is expected to be completed in 2018. The works now handles sewage for a population of 1.2 million people, most of which is water. Income is generated from the processing of trade effluent, which accounts for 70 percent of the organic load. Its output forms around 40 percent of the ship canal below Barton Locks.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the settlement-time {{behavior}} of a typical sabkha formation is investigated. Prediction is made using a generally applicable time-dependent constitutive model for cohesive soils implemented into a finite element program. The numerical solution is evaluated {{on the basis of}} its ability to predict accurately the results of laboratory tests and an instrumented test embankment constructed on sabkha deposit. Although substantially overestimates the time required for completion of <b>primary</b> <b>settlements,</b> the finite element predictions of the magnitude and the rate of settlements are considered satisfactory. 1...|$|R
50|$|Analise {{of archaeological}} {{patrimony}} {{in the region}} suggest that human occupation in the region extends to the 4 millennium B.C., from investigations at the megalithic site of Carapito and the Dolmen of Carapito. Within the proto-historic period, three sites (Castro de Carapito, Castro da Gralheira and Castro das Albelhas) were <b>primary</b> <b>settlements</b> {{in the region that}} collected small populations. On these sites were evidence of Roman tiles (specifically Castro da Gralheira and Castro das Albelhas), suggesting a longer period of settlement, beyond the Roman occupation.|$|R
