Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle's and Fujitsu's SPARC <b>processors</b> and IBM's POWER microprocessors. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 <b>processors</b> including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line.

5|$|Both Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law {{assume that}} the running time of the serial {{part of the program}} is {{independent}} of the number of <b>processors.</b> Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount {{of work to be done}} in parallel is also independent of the number of <b>processors,</b> whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work to be done in parallel varies linearly with the number of <b>processors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically, 4-bit {{microprocessors}} {{were replaced}} with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors.

40|$|Abstract Consider a {{two-stage}} manufacturing system {{composed of}} a batch <b>processor</b> and its upstream feeder <b>processor.</b> Jobs exit the feeder <b>processor</b> and join a queue {{in front of the}} batch <b>processor,</b> where they wait to be processed. The batch <b>processor</b> has a finite capacity Q, and the processing time is independent of the number of jobs loaded into the batch <b>processor.</b> In certain manufacturing systems (including semiconductor wafer fabrication), a processing time window exists from the time the job exits the feeder <b>processor</b> till the time it enters the batch <b>processor.</b> If the batch <b>processor</b> has not started processing a job within the job’s processing time window, the job cannot proceed without undergoing rework or validation by process engineers. We generalize this scenario by assigning a reward R for each successfully processed job by the feeder <b>processor,</b> and a cost C for each job that exceeds its processing time window without being processed by the batch <b>processor.</b> We examine a problem where the feeder <b>processor</b> has a deterministic processing time and the batch <b>processor</b> has stochastic processing time, and determine that the optimal control policy at the feeder <b>processor</b> is insensitive to whether the batch <b>processor</b> is under no-idling or full-batch policy...|$|R
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical <b>processors</b> that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the <b>processors</b> and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- To {{maximize}} the available performance {{is always a}} goal in microprocessor design. In this paper a new technique has been implemented which exploits the advantage of both superscalar and vector processing technique in a proposed <b>processor</b> called Supervector <b>processor.</b> Vector <b>processor</b> operates on array of data called vector and can greatly improve certain task such as numerical simulation and tasks which requires huge number crunching. On other hand superscalar <b>processor</b> issues multiple instructions per cycle which can enhance the throughput. To implement parallelism multiple vector instructions were issued and executed per cycle in superscalar fashion. Case study {{has been done on}} various benchmarks to compare the performance of proposed supervector <b>processor</b> architecture with superscalar and vector <b>processor</b> architecture. Trimaran Framework has been used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed supervector <b>processor</b> scheme.
