2500|$|As a garnish to meat {{dishes in}} the past the most common were porridges and cereals, in which the meat was boiled, later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root {{vegetables}} (turnips, carrots) as well as mushrooms; additionally the meat, without taking account its type, was garnished with pickled products—pickled cabbage, or sour and [...] "soaked" [...] (marinated) apples (mochoniye yabloki) or cranberries. <b>Pan</b> <b>juices,</b> alone or mixed with sour cream or melted butter, were used as gravy to pour on garnishing vegetables and porridges. Meat sauces, i.e. gravies based on flour, butter, eggs and milk, are not common for traditional Russian cuisine.|$|E
50|$|Steak Diane is an American dish of a pan-fried beefsteak with a sauce {{made from}} the {{seasoned}} <b>pan</b> <b>juices,</b> generally prepared in restaurants tableside, and flambéed. It was popular {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, but was considered dated by 1980.|$|E

50|$|A {{chicken breast}} is butterflied or sliced along its width. It is {{flattened}} with a tenderizer between {{two pieces of}} wax paper. It is seasoned and dredged in flour before being browned in butter or olive oil. The sauce is made using the <b>pan</b> drippings. Lemon <b>juice</b> and white wine are added and reduced. Shallots or garlic can be added with capers and slices of lemon. After reduction, butter is stirred in to finish the sauce.|$|R
50|$|William Begg Fordyce {{arrived from}} Scotland in 1888. He {{came to the}} mill as a ploughman and was later {{appointed}} caretaker/manager. After his appointment Fordyce {{appears to have been}} involved in dismantling the mill. The buildings were removed along with most of the mill machinery. The stack, boiler, <b>juice</b> <b>pan,</b> well and machinery foundations remain on the site. Fordyce, who as manager shared in the mill profits, later purchased up to 1,000 acres of the former Richmond Estate, including the Richmond Mill site.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{factor that}} distinguishes Maryland fried chicken from other Southern fried chicken is {{that rather than}} cooking the chicken in several inches of oil or shortening, the chicken is pan-fried in a heavy (traditionally cast-iron) skillet and covered tightly after the initial {{browning}} so that the chicken steams as well as fries. Milk or cream is then added to the <b>pan</b> <b>juices</b> to create a white cream gravy, another Maryland characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Steak Diane {{is similar}} to steak au poivre.The steak is either cut thinly, or pounded thin {{so that it will}} cook rapidly. It is {{seasoned}} and quickly sautéed in butter. A sauce is prepared from the <b>pan</b> <b>juices.</b> Ingredients vary; they may include butter, mushrooms, mustard, shallots, cream, truffles, meat stock, A1 Steak Sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. The sauce is flambéed with brandy or Madeira and the sauce poured over the steak.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} the failure of the collaboration, Norbert Rillieux {{remained}} focused on improving the sugar refining process, developing his machine between 1834 and 1843, when he patented it. The multiple-effect evaporation system that he invented addressed both the spillage that resulted from transfer and the uneven application of heat, as well as making the process safer for workers. The system utilizes a vacuum chamber or a container with reduced air to lower the boiling point of the liquids. Inside this several pans are stacked to contain the sugarcane juice. As the bottom pans heat, they release steam to transfer heat to the pans above. The heat is more easily controlled than in the Jamaican Train method, because one source is needed, at a lower temperature, for multiple <b>pans</b> of sugarcane <b>juice.</b> This prevents the sugar from being burned and discolored. As the workers do not have to transfer the liquid, sugarcane is not spilled, and they are at a reduced risk for burns.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} two {{epidemiological}} {{studies suggest that}} high intake of heterocyclic amines, which are formed {{on the surface of}} meats cooked at high temperatures, might be associated with increased risk of esophageal or cardia cancers. Our aim was to further investigate heterocyclic amine intake and risk of these cancers. We examined data from a nationwide, population-based, case-control study of risk factors for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in Sweden, with 185, 258, and 165 cases, respectively, and 815 controls. Heterocyclic amine intake was estimated based on the frequency of consumption and degree of surface browning of commonly fried meats, and the consumption of <b>pan</b> <b>juices.</b> Statistically nonsignificant 50 – 70 % higher risks of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were observed among individuals in the highest quartile levels of 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline, 2 -amino- 3, 4, 8 -trimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline, and 2 -amino- 1 methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine relative to those in the lowest. Dose-risk trends were evident. Subjects reporting high intake of all three heterocyclic amines had an odds ratio of 2. 4 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 – 4. 8) relative to those with low intake of all three substances. In contrast, no association was found with risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastric cardia. Heterocyclic amine intake might be associated with an increase in risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Given the dearth of epidemiological data regarding these cancers and the lack of established biological mechanisms, confirmatory data are needed...|$|E
