5|$|Many of {{the cast}} members {{at the time were}} {{relatively}} unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.|$|E
5|$|River refuses the Doctor's {{offer to}} travel with him, {{returning}} to her Stormcage prison {{in order to keep}} a promise. She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as the Doctor has never kissed her before she deduces that this will be her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{gaining the}} {{rights for the}} film Superman, Alexander Salkind and his son, Ilya Salkind, also {{purchased}} {{the rights to the}} character of Superman's cousin Supergirl. Supergirl was released in 1984 as a spin-off of the Reeve films; Reeve was slated to have a cameo but he ultimately backed out of the production. It stars Helen Slater in her first motion <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> title role, while Faye Dunaway (who received top billing) played the primary villain, Selena; the film also featured Marc McClure reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen. Even though the film performed poorly at the box office, Helen Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award.|$|E

25|$|Coppola was {{the third}} {{director}} to have two nominations for Best <b>Picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year. Victor Fleming {{was the first in}} 1939 with Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with Foreign Correspondent and Rebecca. Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross in 1977 with The Goodbye Girl and The Turning Point, and Steven Soderbergh in 2000 with Erin Brockovich and Traffic. Coppola, however, is the only one to have produced the pictures.|$|E

Ludmila Savelyeva was presented with an honorary diploma.

25|$|Around 1922, Curtis {{moved to}} Los Angeles with Beth {{and opened a}} new photo studio. To earn money he worked as an {{assistant}} cameraman for Cecil B.

On October 16, 1924, Curtis sold the rights to his ethnographic motion <b>picture</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Land of the Head-Hunters to the American Museum of Natural History. He was paid $1,500 for the master print and the original camera negative. It had cost him over $20,000 to create the film.|$|E

25|$|Although Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia {{as one of}} {{the poorest}} republics, {{socio-economic}} interventions undertaken by the consecutive democratically elected governments managed to improve the economic <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. According to the International Crisis Group, there was nearly 3% growth in 1999. The second half of 2000 also saw steady growth, leading to a 5% GDP increase for the year. In January 2001, the government projected a budget surplus {{for the second year in}} a row. In 2000 the country's emerging middle class began buying new cars, adding extensions to apartments and planning summer vacations abroad.|$|E
25|$|Breaking {{down the}} {{distinction}} between the fine and applied arts was a key aim of the movement, and Birmingham Group artists practiced across a variety of disciplines, producing stained glass, jewellery, metalwork, embroidery, hand printed books and furniture as well as pictures. In painting they emphasised the role of a <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of a wider work or space, often producing murals or frescos for specific buildings, presenting easel pictures in custom-built frames considered integral to the work of art, and working in exacting media such as tempera or watercolour on vellum, where the creation of the materials was {{an essential part of the}} creation of the work.|$|E
25|$|His next {{period of}} {{imprisonment}} occurred in 1899 {{when he was}} identified from his <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Police Gazette and held to account for multiple signature forgeries. The trial and subsequent newspaper reports reveal the extent of Hardy's unraveling. His past was completely exposed, back to the abandoning of his first wife and numerous periods in prison. After being held briefly in Holloway Gaol, {{he was sentenced to}} seven years in Dartmoor Prison for forgery and bigamy, including making false entries in the marriage register. He had apparently anticipated his detainment, as two loaded revolvers were found among his possessions when he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the film was {{nominated}} for best <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 35th Hong Kong Film Awards, the state-owned China Central Television announced that it would not live telecast the ceremony, as it had done every year since 1991. The online video website Tencent has said that it will also not cover the event. China's leading film review websites Douban and Mtime.com do not allow users to create a page for the film. Derek Yee, chairman of Hong Kong Film Awards, who presented the award to the directors, said that it had been hard to find anyone else to present the award, due to fears of being blacklisted for mainland opportunities.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Tate made {{a screen}} test for Sam Peckinpah {{opposite}} Steve McQueen {{for the film}} The Cincinnati Kid. Ransohoff and Peckinpah agreed that Tate's timidity and lack of experience would cause her to flounder in such a large part, and she was rejected in favor of Tuesday Weld. She continued to gain experience with minor television appearances, and after she auditioned unsuccessfully {{for the role of}} Liesl in the film version of The Sound of Music, Ransohoff gave Tate walk-on roles in two motion pictures in which he was the producer: The Americanization of Emily and The Sandpiper. In late 1965, Ransohoff finally gave Tate her first major role in a motion <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film Eye of the Devil, costarring David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Donald Pleasence, and David Hemmings.|$|E
25|$|Malise is {{believed}} to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and his lady. Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, there was a <b>picture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for a blessing to St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.|$|E
