As suggested by results obtained with various <b>phenolics</b> and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, the functional groups required for the mordanting effect of such agents are the carboxyl group, and at least one hydroxyl group concomitantly present on the benzene ring. In the case of galloylglucoses, it is assumed that the effect is due to hydrolysis products (gallic, digallic, or trigallic acids) or to the multiple hydroxyl groups of the intact molecule.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of the main non-aromatic organic acids in beer using capillary electrophoresis is presented. In this work, malic, citric, succinic, pyruvic, acetic and lactic acids are separated using a sodium hydrogen phosphate background electrolyte with direct detection mode with a diode array detector. The separation exhibits lower sensitivity than equivalent methods with indirect detection mode, however, the risk of co-migration with unknown compounds in beer matrixes is significantly reduced. This is due to (i) a higher efficiency (250, 000 – 400, 000 theoretical plates), (ii) a higher selectivity than any equivalent method using an indirect detection mode, and (iii) the possibility to monitor other wavelengths in parallel (260 nm for example) to check for possible co-migration with <b>phenolic</b> or <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids.</b> This was critical when working with beer samples as an unknown compound absorbing at 200 and 260 nm was detected in the neighbourhood of malic, citric and succinic acids.

The objectives in experiment 1 were to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of persimmon puree on BioballTM Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O 157 in a liquid medium. Persimmon puree was added at 1, 3, 5, and 10 % wt. /vol concentrations to brain heart infusion broth and inoculated with BioballTM Listeria monoctogenes and BioballTM Escherichia coli 0157. Microbial growth was evaluated at 0, 24, 36 and 72 h. Results indicated that at 24 h, persimmon puree at all concentrations suppressed (P< 0. 05) growth of L. monocytogenes compared to the control. Suppressed (P< 0. 05) growth of L. monocytogenes continued through 36 and 72 h for all concentrations of persimmon puree tested. However, due to non-pathogenic background Gram-negative micoflora, inhibition of E. coli O 157 could not be ascertained. The objectives of experiment 2 were to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of selected <b>phenolic</b> compounds (<b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> gallic acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin on E. coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, L. monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus.

Gallic acid was the most effective against Y. enterocolitica, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus at concentrations of 11. 01, 29. 06 and 22. 45 µg/ml, respectively. The objective of experiment 3 were to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of persimmon puree at concentrations of 0, 3, 5 and 10 % wt. /wt on a five strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes in ground beef.

40|$|Abstract Background Several low-molecular-weight {{phenolic}} acids {{are present}} in the blood of septic patients at high levels. The microbial origin of the most of phenolic acids in the human body was shown previously, but pathophysiological role of the phenolic acids is not clear. Sepsis is associated with the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both the circulation and the affected organs. In this work the influence of phenolic acids on ROS production in mitochondria and neutrophils was investigated. Methods ROS production in mitochondria and neutrophils was determined by MCLA- and luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. The rate of oxygen consumption by mitochondria was determined polarographically. The difference of electric potentials on the inner mitochondrial membrane was registered using a TPP + -selective electrode. The formation of phenolic metabolites in monocultures by the members of the main groups of the anaerobic human microflora and aerobic pathogenic bacteria was investigated by the method of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Results All phenolic acids had impact on mitochondria and neutrophils, the main producers of ROS in tissues and circulation. <b>Phenolic</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>benzoic</b> and cinnamic <b>acids)</b> producing the pro-oxidant effect on mitochondria inhibited ROS formation in neutrophils. Their effect on mitochondria was abolished by dithiothreitol (DTT). Phenyllactate and p-hydroxyphenyllactate decreased ROS production in both mitochondria and neutrophils. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli produced in vitro considerable amounts of phenyllactic and p -hydroxyphenyllactic acids, Clostridia s. produced great quantities of phenylpropionic and p -hydroxyphenylpropionic acids, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii; and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> by Serratia marcescens. Conclusions The most potent activators of ROS production in mitochondria are phenolic acids whose effect is mediated via the interaction with thiol groups. Among these are <b>benzoic</b> and cinnamic <b>acids.</b> Some phenolic acids, in particular phenyllactate and p-hydroxyphenyllactate, which decrease ROS production in mitochondria and neutrophils, can play a role of natural antioxidants. The results indicate that low-molecular weight phenolic acids of microbial origin participate in the regulation of the ROS production in both the circulation and tissues, thereby affecting the level of oxidative stress in sepsis. </p...|$|R

The results showed {{no significant difference in}} apoptotic germ cell counts in the 0. 001 % <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment, and a significantly higher number of apoptotic cells in 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 5 % <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> treated C. elegans...|$|R
40|$|Trembling aspen (Populustremuloides Michx.) bearing {{certain types}} of black galls have a lower {{incidence}} of Phellinustremulae (Bond.) Bond. 2 ̆ 6 Boriss. heartwood rot than do nongall-bearing trees. Extraction of finely ground black gall tissue with ethyl acetate and separation of the acidic components of the extract led to the isolation of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> trans-cinnamic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid, naringenin, 7 ′-methyl- 3 -hydroxynaringen, aromadendrin, and taxifolin. Bioassays revealed that among these compounds, only <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> showed significant activity against P. tremulae. An analytical procedure was developed to measure the concentration of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> in various types of aspen tissue. Tissue from the black galls showed {{a high concentration of}} <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and tissue from gall-bearing trees contained significantly more <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> than healthy nongalled trees. However, the amount of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> present in the gall-bearing trees may not be sufficient to prevent Phellinus decay. It is suggested that perhaps the <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> serves as a precursor of salicylic acid, a signal molecule in systemic acquired resistance of plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of oral administration of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and combination of <b>benzoic</b> with citric <b>acid</b> (1 : 1 v/v) on the renal functions of white American rats. Twenty one rats were divided in to seven groups (3 rats each). One group serves as a control. The rest of the 6 groups were differently treated (at rates of 100, 500 and 1250 mg kg - 1 body weightwere applied) with <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>benzoic</b> plus citric <b>acid.</b> Compared to the control, significant (p≤ 0. 05) gradual increase in the serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels in the rats with increasing the dose of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and <b>benzoic</b> with citric <b>acid</b> was observed. Results also revealed an insignificant difference in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen on administering <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> or its combination with citric acid.

50|$|Benzyl {{benzoate}} has low {{acute toxicity}} in laboratory animals. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol is subsequently metabolized to <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The conjugates of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> are rapidly eliminated in urine. When given in large doses to laboratory animals, benzyl benzoate can cause hyperexcitation, loss of coordination, ataxia, convulsions, and respiratory paralysis.|$|R
