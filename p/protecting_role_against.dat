Additionally, sex hormones can also affect HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis by inducing epigenetic changes such as the regulation of mRNA levels by microRNAs (miRNAs), DNA methylation, and histone modification in liver tissue. This review describes the molecular mechanisms underlying the gender disparity in HBV-related HCC with the aim of improving the understanding of key factors underneath the sex disparity often observed in HBV infections. Furthermore, the review will propose more effective prevention strategies and treatments of HBV-derived diseases...|$|E
40|$|Copper and cadmium uptake and {{distribution}} in 2 -week-old seedlings of stone pine (Pinus pinea L.), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl.) were investigated. Seedlings were grown in culture solution at increasing concentrations of CuSO 4 (0. 012 - 5 mu M) and CdSO 4 (0. 0 - 5 mu M). All species accumulated copper {{in a larger}} amount than cadmium, Translocation to the shoot was strongly restricted for both metals, though higher cadmium mobility within the plant could be evidenced. A strong relationship between root content and growth inhibition was detected in the roots in response to copper but not to cadmium treatments, Among species P. pinea {{seemed to be more}} tolerant to cadmium, whereas F: angustifolia was highly sensitive to both cadmium and copper. X-ray microanalysis of root tip sections showed that copper and cadmium only accumulated in the root tips of F. angustifolia, copper mostly in the cell walls of the cortex layer, cadmium in the inner compartments of the cortex cells. It is suggested that in the two Pinus species the well developed root cap plays a <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> metal uptake at the root-tip zone...|$|E

We used this septic shock model {{to confirm the}} role of tumor necrosis factor in mortality using a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor to prevent lethality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interleukin 6, rather than playing a lethal <b>role,</b> <b>protected</b> mice <b>against</b> death in this septic shock model. Antibody to interleukin 6 {{did not affect the}} fatal outcome in this low-LPS-dose model. However, pretreatment with antibody to tumor necrosis factor did protect the mice against death, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mortality was enhanced by pretreatment with antibody to interleukin 6 when tumor necrosis factor was partly limited by anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment. Mortality was significantly reduced by pretreatment with both recombinant interleukin 6 and low doses of antibody to tumor necrosis factor; {{in the absence of the}} low dose of antibody to tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6 alone did not confer any protection. These data demonstrate in vivo antagonistic activities of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 and show that interleukin 6 can play a protective <b>role</b> <b>against</b> death from septic shock...|$|R
40|$|Alveolar macrophages (AMs) {{express the}} class A {{scavenger}} receptors (SRAs) macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) and scavenger receptor AI/II (SRA-I/II), which recognize oxidized lipids and provide innate defense against inhaled pathogens and particles. Increased MARCO expression in lungs of ozone-resistant mice suggested an additional <b>role</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>against</b> inhaled oxidants. After ozone exposure, MARCO–/– mice showed greater lung injury than did MARCO+/+ mice. Ozone {{is known to}} generate oxidized, proinflammatory lipids in lung lining fluid, such as 5 β, 6 β-epoxycholesterol (β-epoxide) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(9 ′-oxo-nonanoyl) -glycerophosphocholine (PON-GPC). Intratracheal instillation of either lipid caused substantial neutrophil influx in MARCO–/– mice, but had no effect in MARCO+/+ mice. Normal AMs showed greater uptake in vitro of β-epoxide compared with MARCO–/– AMs, consistent with SRA function in binding oxidized lipids. SR-AI/II–/– mice showed similar enhanced acute lung inflammation after β-epoxide or another inhaled oxidant (aerosolized leachate of residual oil fly ash). In contrast, subacute ozone exposure did not enhance inflammation in SR-AI/II–/– versus SR-AI/II+/+ mice, reflecting increased AM expression of MARCO. These data identify what {{we believe to be}} a novel function for AM SRAs in decreasing pulmonary inflammation after oxidant inhalation by scavenging proinflammatory oxidized lipids from lung lining fluids...|$|R
40|$|Opuntia scrublands are {{important}} ecological-economic {{systems in the}} Andean area. They perform a major <b>role</b> <b>protecting</b> slopes <b>against</b> erosion, improving the soil properties and providing a variety of products employed in the human diet, and in animal feeding, as well as cochineal insects, a highly valued source of dyes. The collection of the insects has represented an important economic activity for the local communities since pre-Columbian times. Current Peruvian production represents between 85 % and 90 % of the global market, and is mainly based on collection of the insect in natural Opuntia scrublands located in the poorest Andean areas of Ayacucho. Although much {{is known about the}} financial benefits of cochineal for exporters and dye manufacturers, information about the value of standing Opuntia scrubs to collectors and the relative contribution of Opuntia scrubs to their household economies is scarce. Here we contribute to the estimation of the use value of Opuntia scrublands to local communities in Ayacucho by initially exploring the cultural domain of Opuntia in order to identify the ecosystem goods and services recognized by peasants, and later presenting empirical estimates of their importance to annual household income...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{surfaces}} {{have been}} found to have a major chemical and physical heterogeneity and play a key <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> multiple stress factors. During the last decade, there is a raising interest in examining plant surface properties for the development of biomimetic materials. Contact angle measurement of different liquids is a common tool for characterizing synthetic materials, which is just beginning to be applied to plant surfaces. However, some studies performed with polymers and other materials showed that for the same surface, different surface free energy values may be obtained depending on the number and nature of the test liquids analyzed, materials' properties, and surface free energy calculation methods employed. For 3 rough and 3 rather smooth plant materials, we calculated their surface free energy using 2 or 3 test liquids and 3 different calculation methods. Regardless of the degree of surface roughness, the methods based on 2 test liquids often led to the under- or over-estimation of surface free energies as compared to the results derived from the 3 Liquids method. Given the major chemical and structural diversity of plant surfaces, it is concluded that 3 different liquids must be considered for characterizing materials of unknown physico-chemical properties, which may significantly differ in terms of polar and dispersive interactions. Since there are just few surface free energy data of plant surfaces with the aim of standardizing the calculation procedure and interpretation of the results among for instance, different species, organs, or phenological states, we suggest the use of 3 liquids and the mean surface tension values provided in this study...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{chemoprevention}} {{is the use}} of synthetic, {{natural or}} biological agents to prevent or delay the development or progression of malignancies. Intriguingly, many phytochemicals with anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects, recently proposed as chemoprevention strategies, are inhibitors of Cytochrome P 450 family 1 B 1 (CYP 1 B 1), an enzyme overexpressed {{in a wide variety of}} tumors and associated with angiogenesis. In turn, pro-inflammatory cytokines were reported to boost CYP 1 B 1 expression, suggesting a key role of CYP 1 B 1 in a positive loop of inflammatory angiogenesis. Other well-known pro-tumorigenic activities of CYP 1 B 1 rely on metabolic bioactivation of xenobiotics and steroid hormones into their carcinogenic derivatives. In contrast to initial in vitro observations, in vivo studies demonstrated a <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> cancer for the other CYP 1 family members (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2), suggesting that the specificity of CYP 1 family inhibitors should be carefully taken into account for developing potential chemoprevention strategies. Recent studies also proposed a role of CYP 1 B 1 in multiple cell types found within the tumor microenvironment, including fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells. Overall, our review of the current literature suggests a positive loop between inflammatory cytokines and CYP 1 B 1, which in turn may play a key role in cancer angiogenesis, acting on both cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Strategies aiming at specific CYP 1 B 1 inhibition in multiple cell types may translate into clinical chemoprevention and angioprevention approaches...|$|E
40|$|Algaenans are non-hydrolysable {{insoluble}} aliphatic biopolymeric materials {{present in}} the cell walls of some green microalgae. In these cell walls it serves a <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> microbial attack and/or desiccation. In the cell wall, algaenan is probably present as an intricate part of a greater chemical structure most likely involving compounds like proteins and polysaccharides. Earlier studies have shown that, because of its resistant nature, algaenan is selectively preserved in sediments and suggested to constitute {{a significant part of}} the insoluble non-hydrolysable macromolecular part of sedimentary organic matter, termed kerogen. Here it can serve as a source material for the formation of oil and gas upon further catagenesis. The first part of this thesis mainly focuses on the distribution of algaenan-containing algae within the division Chlorophyta and the chemical composition of these algaenans. Most of the algae investigated in the first part of the thesis are reported from sediments and were likely candidates to fmd the resistant biopolymer algaenan. The second part of the thesis mainly focuses on the analysis of algal microfossils in order to determine if the specific chemistry of the algaenans as deduced from the extant species investigated in part I is preserved as such. Furthermore, upon comparison of these results with algaenans isolated from cultured algae it was possible to investigate if chemical changes have occurred during diagenesis. The final two Chapters involved the analysis of some very peculiar microfossils in order to determine if these consist of preserved algaenans. In this PhD study the techniques that have become available over the years to analyse these recalcitrant biopolymers were applied. Although each technique by itself only provided a small piece of the macromolecular puzzle, in combination the data provided new information about these resistant biopolymers, which are able to survive burial in sediments for millions of years...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjevtiveTo {{investigate}} the antioxidant and hepatoprotective {{properties of the}} different extracts Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) against liver injury in hyperlipidemia rats. MethodsThe rats were divided into 7 groups, with 10 rats in each. Rats were treated with high-fat diet for 18 weeks besides the normal control group, then rats in both normal control and model groups were received 5 mL/kg− 1 ·day− 1 of saline {{and those in the}} positive control group with 2 mg/kg− 1 ·day− 1 of lovastatin. Rats in the positive control group and different Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) extracts treatment groups (ethyl acetate extract group, n-hexane extract group, ethanol extract group, and aqueous extract group) were treated with corresponding extract at a concentration of 5 mL/kg− 1 ·day− 1. After 8 weeks treatment, all rats were sacrificed and total blood samples were collected. Histological analysis of liver was underdone by hematoxylin and eosin. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glouse (GLU), cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were measured according to standard procedure using auto-analyzer. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver were ananlyzed by procedure instruction. ResultsThe histopathological analysis implied that the administration of Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) extracts resulted in hepatoprotective role compared with that of the model group. In addition, the high-fat diet caused a remarkable increase of ALT, AST, GLU, TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA levels. A decline in HDL-C and SOD concentrations and a reversal of effects were observed in different Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) extracts groups, especially in the aqueous extract and ethanol extract groups. ConclusionsThe different extracts of Guizhencao (Herba Bidentis Bipinnatae) can play a <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> liver injury in hyperlipidemia rats maybe through decreasing ALT, AST, GLU, TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA levels and enhancing the liver anti-oxidative ability...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the link between salivary {{concentrations}} of cortisol, testosterone, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) as a measure of internal load after two final matches played 3 days apart by professional women football players. Saliva samples were taken before and after the two matches (M 1, M 2). RPE was used to monitor the exercise intensity after each match. Testosterone concentrations increased after each match (M 1 : + 42 %, p = 0. 002; M 2 : + 50 %, p < 0. 001) while cortisol increased only after M 1 (+ 116 %, p < 0. 001). The testosterone-to-cortisol ratio decreased only after M 1 (- 32. 4 %, p < 0. 001). IgA concentration did not change after any match. Testosterone concentrations were correlated with IgA concentrations after each match (M 1 : R = 0. 59, p = 0. 008; M 2 : R= 0. 51, p = 0. 02). RPE was correlated with cortisol concentrations after M 1 (R = 0. 57; p = 0. 01), but not after M 2 (R = 0. 38; p = 0. 07). All these results suggest that salivary cortisol and testosterone concentrations increase especially after the first match of a final, without affecting IgA levels. We speculate that increased testosterone concentration in women after football matches may play a <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> immune suppression usually observed after intense exercise. Key pointsIn our sample space, IgA concentrations did not change for teams even, before and after separated match. Suggesting that salivary IgA determinations after physical activities remain under debate. Testosterone concentrations were the only one hormone showing a consequent increase in both matches after physical activity carrying. The T/C ratio decrease only after M 1 according with a higher cortisol level reach after M 1 get-together, suggesting a differential impact over anxiety-associated team performance. So M 2 play gives a more stable psychological state...|$|E
40|$|The N-terminally pyroglutamyl-modified Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) {{peptides}} {{are found}} in abundance in the pathological Alzheimer disease (AD) brain deposits. Such modification not only increases the hydrophobic properties of a given molecule, but also plays a <b>protecting</b> <b>role</b> <b>against</b> proteolytic degradation. This project involved {{the study of the}} human type I and type II pyroglutamyl peptidases and their involvement in AÎ² processing in AD. Human PcpI has been successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain and purified to homogeneity. The protein displayed significant instability in vitro. To overcome this problem a number of methods were employed such as screening for an optimal protein expression system and buffer composition, site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification of selected surface residues. This resulted in the selection of the HEPPS buffer system as providing the most stabilising conditions for human PcpI. Improvement in the protein stability enabled initial crystallisation experiments and the identification of favourable conditions for crystal production. Further optimization of this process is needed in order to obtain good quality crystals which are required for structural study. The study on human PcpII involved an extensive screening for optimal expression conditions in bacterial, baculovirus/insect and mammalian systems. The truncated PcpII isoform PcpII/S 62 -H 1024, which lacks the N-terminal transmembrane domain, was successfully expressed and secreted from the HEK 293 T cell line using three different pOPIN-based constructs. Moreover, homology modelling of human PcpII catalytic domain was performed, which helped to gain an insight into the three-dimensional structure of the protein and its mode of substrate binding. Lastly, immunohistochemical staining of the human AD brain tissue sections was performed to compare the level and distribution of PcpI and PcpII enzymes between diseased and control cases. The results confirmed that the neurodegenerative conditions lead to the increased synthesis of both enzymes in the cortical AD tissues. Additionally PcpI was shown to be able to participate in the degradation of pGlu-modified AÎ² peptides. Norman Family Trus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Comparative {{evidence}} {{regarding the}} effects of social relationships on mortality in Mediterranean communities will increase our knowledge of their strengths {{and the ways in}} which they influence longevity across cultures. Men and women may benefit differently from social relationships because of cultural differences in gender roles. Psychosocial mechanisms such as social support, which may explain {{the effects of}} social networks, may also vary by culture. Methods Detailed information on the social relationships of a representative sample of 1, 174 community-dwelling older adults was collected in Leganés, a city in central Spain. Mortality over a 6 -year follow-up period was ascertained. Information on socio-demographic, health and disability variables was also collected. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted separately for men and women and for the combined sample. Results Having a confidant was associated with a 25 % (95 % CI 5 – 40 %) reduction in the mortality risk. The hazard ratio for lack of social participation was 1. 5 (95 % CI 1. 3 – 1. 7). Being engaged in meaningful <b>roles</b> <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> mortality, while receipt of emotional support did not affect survival. These results were comparable for men and women. Having contact with all family ties was associated with reduced mortality only in men. Structural aspects of social networks make a unique contribution to survival, independently of emotional support and the role played in the lives of significant others. Conclusion In this elderly Southern European population, the beneficial effects of social networks, social participation, engagement in the life of significant others and having a confidant call for public policies that foster intergenerational and community exchanges. </p...|$|R
