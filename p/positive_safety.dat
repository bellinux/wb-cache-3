Examples of psychosocial injury hazards of interest to I/O psychology include fatigue, workplace violence, workplace bullying, and working night shifts.

Psychosocial hazards can affect musculoskeletal disorders. A psychosocial factor related to accident risk is safety climate, which refers to employees' perceptions {{of the extent to}} which their work organization prioritizes safety.

Survey data collected from 322 respondents working in dry bulk carriers was used, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of national culture and leadership styles (i. e. transformational, passive management, and contingent reward) on safety attitude and safety behavior. The results indicate that national culture dimensions such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and long-term orientation had a <b>positive</b> influence on <b>safety</b> behaviour. Long-term orientation had a <b>positive</b> influence on <b>safety</b> attitude, whereas masculinity had a negative influence on safety attitude of seafarers.

40|$|The {{position}} of the Health Physics Society is that users of radiation and radioactive material should establish a collective commitment by their managers and employees to emphasize safety over competing goals to ensure protection of people and the environment. The precepts of this position are: 1. Individuals and organizations performing activities with radioactive materials and radiation-producing machines should establish and maintain a <b>positive</b> radiation <b>safety</b> culture commensurate with the safety and security significance of their actions and the nature and complexity of their organizations and functions. 2. The responsibility for establishing a radiation safety culture is a shared responsibility by management and workers. The active participation of both is essential for success. 3. Management should establish incentives and sanctions to reinforce desired <b>positive</b> radiation <b>safety</b> behaviors. Management communications of expectations must be continual and clear. 4. Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies cannot successfully regulate workplace culture. Their role should be to encourage and mentor {{the development of a}} robust safety culture, rather than to attempt to impose and enforce specific behaviors appropriate to radiation safety culture. 5. Resources should be effectively allocated by management to address safety and schedule. Protecting workers, the public, and the environment must be the top priorities whenever work activities are planned and performed. 6. The role of radiation protection professionals and their scientific and professional societies is to promote a <b>positive</b> radiation <b>safety</b> culture in the workplace...|$|R

The present paper draws from positive organizational behavior theory to test workplace and individual factors that may affect safety climate. Specifically, we explore the potential influence of authentic leadership style and psychological capital on safety climate and risk outcomes. Across two samples of offshore oil-workers and seafarers working on oil platform supply ships, structural equation modeling yielded results that support a model in which authentic leadership exerts a direct effect on safety climate, as well as an indirect effect via psychological capital. This study shows the importance of leadership qualities as well as psychological factors in shaping a <b>positive</b> work <b>safety</b> climate and lowering the risk of accidents...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between safety culture, safety climate, and leading safety indicators in enhancing safety performance in the workplace. The research showed that an organisationâ€™s <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture is believed to be important in improving safety performance. Achieving a <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture takes time and relies on a top-down approach, with a visible commitment to safety by management. On the other hand, safety climate relies on a bottom-up perceptual approach, corresponding to individual values, attitudes, and perceptions regarding safety. No universally agreed method exists for stablishing and correlating safety culture factors with leading safety indicators for the oil and gas industry, nor is there a generic set of safety indicators to cover all relevant aspects of a <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture. However, it is possible to link the safety culture maturity model to a set of leading safety indicators so that management can act on the early warning signs...|$|E
40|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> {{culture has}} been shown to {{contribute}} to a firm 2 Ì† 7 s ability to avoid or reduce the occurrence of occupational accidents and injuries. In American workplaces alone 3, 582 people died and 5. 1 million people were disabled in 2009 and the cost to corporate America was 169 billion and an additional productivity loss of 95 million work days. The economic cost to each American household is about 1, 200. Firms that establish and maintain a <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture are able to achieve a competitive advantage in the market. While much research exists showing the relationship between safety culture and accident reduction, less guidance is found on how companies might achieve such improvement through cultural change. Attempts have been made to determine the factor structure of safety culture, that is, the identification of the antecedents of a <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture. However, to date no general consensus has emerged among researchers about the exact elements of the factor structure. Research methodologies have been blamed for biasing the research results and thereby causing the lack of consensus. This dissertation uses a different methodology, the Delphi method combined with Hofstede 2 Ì† 7 s well-known onion model of organizational culture, to determine those organizational practices that lead to a <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture. Delphi is a mixed methodology that begins with an exploratory approach followed by the more traditional quantitative method. The exploratory front-end was deemed appropriate given that prior traditional survey instruments most likely introduced researcher bias through a myopic view of safety culture. Delphi also differs by utilizing purposeful sampling versus random sampling which provides a high level of expertise to inform the research. After four rounds of inquiry with a panel of experts, a consensus was reached on 18 organizational practices that lead to a <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> culture. This research adds to the understanding of safety culture, provides useful information for both practitioners and academic researchers, and offers launch points for extensions of the research...|$|E
40|$|Although much {{research}} indicates <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> climate {{is associated with}} reduced safety risk, we argue this association is not universal and may even be reversed in some contexts. Specifically, we argue that <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> climate {{can be associated with}} increased safety risk when there is pressure to prioritize production over safety and where workers have some detachment from the consequences of their actions, such as found in engineering design work. We used two indicators of safety risk: use of heuristics at the individual level and design complexity at the design team level. Using experience sampling data (N = 165, 42 design teams, k = 5752 observations), we found design engineersâ€™ perceptions of team <b>positive</b> <b>safety</b> climate were associated with a less use of heuristics when engineers were not working to deadlines, but more use of heuristics when engineers were working to deadlines. Independent ratings were obtained of 31 teamsâ€™ designs of offshore oil and gas platforms (N = 121). For teams that worked infrequently to deadlines, positive team safety climate was associated with less design complexity. For teams that worked frequently to deadlines, positive team safety climate was associated with more design complexity...|$|E
