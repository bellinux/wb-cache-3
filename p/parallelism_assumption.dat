40|$|Linear scoring {{coupled with}} {{parametric}} regression or ANOVA often {{is used to}} analyze responses measured on a Likert scale. Alternatively, we have had success in numerous cases by modeling the same data under relaxed assumptions of the proportional odds model. This is implemented conveniently by procedure LOGISTIC, where {{a test of the}} proportional odds <b>parallelism</b> <b>assumption</b> is displayed automatically. When this test fails, a satisfactory model sometimes results by switching from the default cumulative logit link to use of the complementary log-log link, implemented by option LINK=CLOGLOG. Model fit by means of the log-log link also can be assessed using the CLOGLOG option, after minimal data manipulation. Either link induces the equivalent of a proportional hazards model. Interpretation of proportional odds and hazards models {{in the context of a}} Likert scale response is illustrated using data obtained from a survey of 849 teachers and administrators involved in implementing a new teaching program in their schools. Of 8 items relating to the perceived degree of implementation of the program, the proportional hazards model represents responses for seven items very well. This paper is directed at survey specialists who employ Likert scale instruments and who are familiar with logistic regression...|$|E
40|$|A 2 D {{perspective}} {{image of}} a slanted rectangular object is sufficient for a strong 3 D percept. Two computational assumptions {{that could be used}} to interpret 3 D from images of rectangles are as follows: (1) converging lines in an image are parallel in the world, and (2) skewed angles in an image are orthogonal in the world. For an accurate perspective {{image of a}} slanted rectangle, either constraint implies the same 3 D interpretation. However, if an image is rescaled, the 3 D interpretations based on parallelism and orthogonality generally conflict. We tested the roles of parallelism and orthogonality by measuring perceived depth within scaled perspective images. Stimuli were monocular images of squares, slanted about a horizontal axis, with an elliptical hole. Subjects judged the length-to-width ratio of the holes, which provided a measure of perceived depth along the object. The rotational alignment of squares within their surface plane was varied from 0 - (trapezoidal projected contours) to 20 - (skewed projected contours). In consistent-cue conditions, images were accurate projections of either a 10 or 20 [...] wide square, with slants of 75 - and 62 -, respectively. In cue-conflict conditions, images were generated either by magnifying a 10 - image to have a projected size of 20 - or by minifying a 20 - image to have a projected size of 10 -. For the aligned squares, which do not produce a conflicting skew cue, we found that subjects, judgments depended primarily on projected size and not on the size used to generate the prescaled images. This is consistent with reliance on the convergence cue, corresponding to a <b>parallelism</b> <b>assumption.</b> As squares were rotated away from alignment, producing skewed projected contours, judgments were increasingly determined by the original image size. This is consistent with use of the skew cue...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} review of the main {{reliability}} measures. We first introduce the Classical Test Theory and define reliability within this framework. Some reliability estimates are considered, among which is Cronbach’s a, the most popular reliability index, which relies on the assumptions of unidimensionality and <b>parallelism.</b> The latter <b>assumptions</b> are relaxed by considering estimates of reliability in the frameworks of Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Models with Latent Variables, where the construct usually consists of more than one single dimension. In particular we make use of the Average Variance Explained indicators to assess a global evaluation of reliability. In case of test items of the ordinal nature we consider polychoric correlations instead of Pearson’s ones when computing reliability measures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{ellipsis}} phenomena. One of {{the goals}} of this thesis is to formulate proper identity conditions. One of such conditions that this thesis focuses on {{is often referred to as}} Parallelism in the literature. Under the standard <b>assumption,</b> <b>Parallelism</b> as a syntactic condition must be satisfied in order to license ellipsis. Parallelism requires that there be a parallel dependency between the antecedent and the elliptical clause (Fiengo and May 1994). It is standardly assumed that Parallelism needs to be satisfied outside the elliptical constituents. In contrast to this assumption, I argue that Parallelism needs to be satisfied only within the elided constituents. I also argue that Parallelism needs to be combined with certain semantic conditions. Examining various scope interactions in elliptical constructions in Korean, I maintain that focus effects play a crucial role in licensing ellipsis. ^ Another goal of this thesis is to use ellipsis to investigate the locality of movement and explores properties of chains. It is shown that while locality-violating movement is allowed in some elliptical contexts, certain types of movement that intermingle locality-observing movement and locality-violating movement are not allowed. I argue that these types of movement are ruled out by a version of Chain Uniformity (Chomsky 1991, Chomsky and Lasnik 1993). This thesis also shows that Chain Uniformity, combined with Parallelism, provides an account of the contrasts among various elliptical constructions in English and Korean with respect to island-(in) sensitivity (cf. Ross 1969, Merchant 2001). ^ Finally, this thesis examines Superiority. First, it is shown that examples like What do you think who bought? constitutes a problem for any analysis that assumes movement to the intermediate Spec of C before the matrix interrogative C enters the structure (whether or not feature checking with the intermediate head C is involved). The same problem arises in multiple wh-fronting languages such as Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. It is also shown that contra the standard assumption (Stjepanovi 2 ̆ 6 cacute; 1999 a, Merchant 2001), Superiority violations can be repaired by a later operation. On the basis of Chain Uniformity, I propose a novel analysis of Superiority. Under this analysis, Superiority has both derivational and representational aspect, which enables us to account for the possibility of repairing Superiority violations. ...|$|R
