5|$|Manchester {{became the}} first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. In 2016–17, 37.8 million {{passenger}} journeys were made on the system. The <b>present</b> <b>system</b> mostly runs on former commuter rail lines converted for light rail use, and crosses the city centre via on-street tram lines. The network consists of seven lines with 93 stops. A new line to the Trafford Centre is currently under construction and is due to open by 2020.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we extend certain central results of zero {{dimensional}} systems to higher dimensions. The first main result shows that if (Y, f) is a finitely <b>presented</b> <b>system,</b> then {{there exists a}} Smale space (X, F) and a u-resolving factor map π+: X → Y. If the finitely <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> is transitive, then we show there is a canonical minimal u-resolving Smale space extension. Additionally, we show that any finite-to-one factor map between transitive finitely <b>presented</b> <b>systems</b> lifts through u-resolving maps to an s-resolving map. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{multilayer}} thickness measurement {{system based on}} optoelectronic continuous wave THz spectroscopy. Due to its wide tuning range, high frequency resolution, and fast data acquisition the system combines micrometer precision with short measurement time. In addition, the <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> is not limited by the 2 uncertainty of previous continuous wave signals and is therefore capable of measuring thick layers. Thus, the <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> and measurement method are a cost effective alternative to THz time-domain systems {{in the field of}} thickness measurements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new public key {{system based on}} polynomials over fields GF (2) is developed. The {{security}} {{of the system is}} based on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithms over GF (2 k) with sufficiently large k. The <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> has all features of ordinary public key schemes such as public key encryption and digital signatures. The security and implementation aspects of the <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> are also introduced along with comparison with other well known public key systems...|$|R
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the <b>present</b> <b>system,</b> which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E
25|$|The <b>present</b> <b>system</b> {{includes}} {{the present tense}} and the imperfect (past imperfective), the optative and imperative moods, {{as well as some}} of the remnant forms of the old subjunctive.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for the systematic design of application-specific architectures is presented. The behavioral specifications {{are given in}} an extended version of Prolog that allows the high-level description of algorithms to be implemented in special-purpose VLSI circuits. The <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> facilitates the development of many alternative architectures from the same specifications. It is also capable of supporting both synchronous and asynchronous components, depending on the requirements of each particular problem. Automatic recursion elimination is another feature of the <b>presented</b> <b>system,</b> therefore allowing the implementation of fast special-purpose architectures {{for a wide range}} of practical computing problems. © 1991...|$|R
30|$|In addition, we {{observed}} a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.35) between the users’ ratings of their general trust into software and their reported trust into the <b>presented</b> <b>system</b> at the significance level of p = 0.01. We did not {{did not find}} any correlation between the user’s self assessment of competence and their reported trust into the <b>presented</b> <b>system.</b> As a potential reason, we indicate {{that the majority of the}} users had a background in computer science. As a consequence, their self assessment of competence was rather high with a mean value of 4.03 (STD = 0.75).|$|R
3000|$|All the <b>presented</b> <b>systems</b> used typical speech {{recognition}} features (MFCC, PLP, or FF), and most systems employed HMM-based Viterbi decoding for segmentation. The best two results {{were obtained by}} the systems that exploited segment-based features. Four <b>presented</b> <b>systems</b> reported an improvement by using a hierarchical organization of the detection process, so that the detection of the easiest classes (like [...] "Music," [...] in our task) {{at the beginning of}} the detection process is beneficial. Owing to the omnipresence of repeated programs and sounds in the BN data, the detection of repetitions seems to be effective for music segmentation.|$|R

25|$|Local {{government}} in Northern Ireland has since 1973 been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers {{are limited to}} services such as collecting waste, controlling dogs and maintaining parks and cemeteries.

30|$|Furthermore, the new {{approach}} has two practical advantages for the <b>present</b> EEW <b>systems.</b> The first is that the {{new approach}} is so simple that the CPU requirement will hardly be increased even in a real-time process.

25|$|There are six tenses in the Latin language. These {{are divided}} into two tense systems: the <b>present</b> <b>system,</b> which {{is made up of}} the present, {{imperfect}} and future tenses, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses. Each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person and number referred to. Subject (nominative) pronouns are generally omitted for the first (I, we) and second (you) persons unless emphasis on the subject is desired.|$|E

A Level 1 {{franchise}} required {{a team to}} race at least one car at all events, and at various times allowed a team to enter up to four cars. Other teams received Level 2 and Level 3 franchises based on their level of participation. The structure was changed {{a number of times}} before the <b>present</b> <b>system</b> of 28 RECs was arrived at in 2011. Supercars bought a number of RECs as they became available in order to achieve a long-held desire to reduce the field to 28 cars.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the NSW Government had {{realised}} {{that its}} ideas of infrastructure expansion could not be realised by the <b>present</b> <b>system</b> of the mostly-poor inner-city municipal councils and the Minister for Local Government, Joseph Cahill, pushed through a bill in 1948 that abolished a significant number of those councils. Darlington was abolished and amalgamated with the City of Sydney following the enactment of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, which came into effect from 1 January 1949. The former council area subsequently became part of the South Sydney Municipality from 1968 to 1982 and from 1988 to 1992.|$|E

25|$|The Local Government Act 1898 is the {{founding}} document of the <b>present</b> <b>system</b> of local government, while the Twentieth Amendment {{to the constitution}} of 1999 provided for its constitutional recognition. The twenty-six traditional counties of Ireland are not always coterminous with administrative divisions although they are generally used as a geographical frame of reference by the population of Ireland. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a system of thirty-one local authorities - twenty-six county councils, two city and county councils and three city councils. Below this (with {{the exception of the}} Dublin Region and the three city councils) are municipal districts, replacing a previous system of town councils.|$|E

The BNP know the <b>present</b> <b>system</b> is their only chance of election. This is another example of the increasingly Goebbels-like campaign from the anti-AV people, for whom no lie is too idiotic given the truth is so unpalatable to them. AV makes lazy MPs work harder and reach out beyond their tribe. It is what Britain needs to clean up politics.|$|E
25|$|From its {{foundation}} in the 13th century Sligo was administered under local Fénechus (Brehon law) until {{the establishment of}} English Common law in the early 17th century after the battle of Kinsale. Courts were held regularly throughout the tuath at various buildings and on hilltops reserved for the purpose. Law enforcement was {{a function of the}} nobility and freemen of the area as no police force existed. No records survive from these early courts, but a case is recorded of a Dublin merchant being reimbursed by the local courts after he was fraudulently sold an out of date poem in the 1540s. Sligo then came under English martial law and eventually the common law as administered from Dublin and from which descends the <b>present</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
