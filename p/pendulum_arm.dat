He used the period of oscillation and mass of the pendulum (both measured with the bullet included) to calculate the rotational inertia of the pendulum, which was then used in the calculations.

50|$|A gravity {{escapement}} uses a small {{weight or}} a weak spring {{to give an}} impulse directly to the pendulum. The earliest form consisted of two arms which were pivoted {{very close to the}} suspension spring of the <b>pendulum</b> with one <b>arm</b> {{on each side of the}} <b>pendulum.</b> Each <b>arm</b> carried a small dead beat pallet with an angled plane leading to it. When the <b>pendulum</b> lifted one <b>arm</b> far enough its pallet would release the escape wheel. Almost immediately another tooth on the escape wheel would start to slide up the angle face on the other arm thereby lifting the arm. It would reach the pallet and stop. The other arm meanwhile was still in contact with pendulum and coming down again to a point lower than it had started from. This lowering of the arm provides the impulse to the pendulum. The design was developed steadily from the middle of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. It eventually became the escapement of choice for turret clocks, because their wheel trains are subjected to large variations in drive force caused by the large exterior hands, with their varying wind, snow, and ice loads. Since in a gravity escapement the drive force from the wheel train does not itself impel the pendulum but merely resets the weights that provide the impulse, the escapement is not affected by variations in drive force.|$|R

This mass-suspension arrangement acts as pivot and restoring mechanism and reveals a relatively long natural period (3 – 4 sec), considering the overall dimensions of the pendulum. The application of multiple frequency-dependent feedback paths gave a flat to ground velocity response from 100 to 0. 023 sec with a differential output 2 � 750 V/m/sec. The present study focused mainly on the pendulum arrangement with some emphasis on the suspension flexure and the feedback actuator design, whereas the electronic circuitry used was maintained according to the standard techniques used in the force-balanced sensors. Design and assembly simplicity was introduced {{with the use of a}} single uniform element as flexure without affecting the precision of the motion. Moreover, the planar coil adopted in the feedback actuator ensured a strong motor constant, without the limitations in the effective displacement usually met in the angular motion of the pendulum.

40|$|The rotary cranes {{are widely}} used in common {{industrial}} structures such as construction sites and automotive tracks to transfer loads and materials. The rotary crane controlling process is difficult without method because the motion expected to be faster. One of the current problems in industry and building construction is that rotary cranes became larger and higher. So {{they need to be}} faster to achieve acceptable transfer times. But unfortunately, rotary cranes with large structures that are moving at high speed are always associated undesirable payload oscillations resulting from the system dynamics. The purpose of controlling the rotary crane is transporting the load faster without causing any excessive swing at the final position. Rotary cranes have very strong structures in order to lift heavy payloads. The oscillations of the loads must be reduced to prevent hazards for people and equipment in the work place.

Selecting an IMU for a certain application is challenging, so to ease the process, a simultaneous and direct performance comparison of eight of the available units at IOT was proposed. As there was no available apparatus for completing these comparison tests, a suitable apparatus had to be designed and fabricated. The concept selected for the test apparatus was a pendulum capable of swinging in two axis by means of a two degree-of-freedom universal joint. The <b>pendulum</b> <b>arm</b> itself was four meters in length such that the natural frequency of the apparatus was 0. 25 Hz. The <b>pendulum</b> <b>arm</b> assembly was supported by a four-legged frame, similar in design to a tripod, with the universal joint joining the top of the frame to the top of the arm. Two angle encoders coupled to the universal joint measured the angle of the arm, and a platform that contained all of the IMUs was fastened to the bottom of the arm.

40|$|A {{variation}} of a hanging pendulum thrust stand capable of measuring {{the performance of}} an electric thruster operating in the vertical orientation is presented. The vertical orientation of the thruster dictates that the thruster must be horizontally offset from the pendulum pivot arm, necessitating {{the use of a}} counterweight system to provide a neutrally-stable system. Motion of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>arm</b> is transferred through a balance mechanism to a secondary arm on which deflection is measured. A non-contact light-based transducer is used to measure displacement of the secondary beam. The members experience very little friction, rotating on twisting torsional pivots with oscillatory motion attenuated by a passive, eddy current damper. Displacement is calibrated using an in situ thrust calibration system. Thermal management and self-leveling systems are incorporated to mitigate thermal and mechanical drifts. Gravitational restoring force and torsional spring constants associated with flexure pivots provide restoring moments. An analysis of the design indicates that the thrust measurement range spans roughly four decades, with the stand capable of measuring thrust up to 12 N for a 200 kg thruster and up to approximately 800 mN for a 10 kg thruster.

The level of amplification is changed through adjustment of the location {{of one of the}} pivot points linking the system. Response of the system depends on the relative magnitudes of the restoring moments applied by the displaced thruster mass and the twisting torsional pivots connecting the members of the balance mechanism. Displacement is measured using a non-contact, optical linear gap displacement transducer and balance oscillatory motion is attenuated using a passive, eddy-current damper. The thrust stand employs an automated leveling and thermal control system. Pools of liquid gallium are used to deliver power to the thruster without using solid wire connections, which can exert undesirable time-varying forces on the balance. These systems serve to eliminate sources of zero-drift that can occur as the stand thermally or mechanically shifts during the course of an experiment. An in-situ calibration rig allows for steady-state calibration before, during and after thruster operation. Thrust measurements were carried out on a cylindrical Hall thruster that produces mN-level thrust. The measurements were very repeatable, producing results that compare favorably with previously published performance data, but with considerably smaller uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|This tromometer {{constructed}} with {{the object of}} observing with it microseisms of 4 sec period at three or more places simultaneously in order to enable investigation {{into the nature of}} microseisms. It consists of a horizontal pendulum, suspended with two flat springs, and an optical recording device. The pendulum bob weighs 1550 g, the length of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>arm</b> being 20 cm. A copper plate, attached {{to the end of the}} pendulum, which swings the poles of an MK magnet, serves as an electromagnetic damper. In order to avoid the resonance of the pendulum to microseisms of 4 sec period, the period of free vibration of the pendulum can be made to exceed ten seconds. The geometrical magnification is about 400 when lens of 50 cm focal length is used in the optical recording system, and about 800 when the focal length is 100 cm. For recording, in place of the recording drum, a sheet of bromide paper, about 56 × 11. 5 cm, is wound directly round two wheels which are fixed on an axis of rotation, the rate of rotation being once in ten minutes, the driving power being an AC 100 V synchronous motor. The pendulum and the recording apparatus are placed each in a separate wooden box. The sizes of the two boxes are 58 × 33 × 27 cm and 42 × 22 × 25 cm and their weights 7 and 4. 5 kg. respectively...|$|E
