It is shown that although orthogonal devices have a potential efficiency gain compared to planar devices, a careful design is {{required in order to}} achieve their optimum performance efficiency. We discuss the role of optical non-uniformity across the depth of the solar cell. As light travels through the orthogonal solar cell, its intensity and spectrum change. This change in the illumination translates in a variable output characteristics from parallel-connected segments of the solar cell. Lower segments, owing to their lower open circuit voltage due to lower intensity illumination, act as <b>power</b> <b>sink</b> consuming the power generated by the upper segments.

40|$|Optimizing {{wireless}} network operations {{can be achieved}} by transmission power control of wireless nodes, which is mostly performed by regulating the final power amplifier. Depending on the desired transmission power level, currently popular amplifiers work at different levels of efficiency: highest in case of maximum output power, lower in case of reduced output power. As the power amplifier is the major <b>power</b> <b>sink</b> in most common network interfaces, operating at high efficiency is desirable. Ideally, a node would operate using a power amplifier which is tuned to provide its highest efficiency at the node’s (single or typically used) transmission power level. Our idea is to use specialization of nodes to allow for efficient short-range communication using (mostly) ”shortrange” specialists – nodes where the power amplifier is optimized for low output power values – and to use the corresponding ”long-range specialists ” for the long-distance communication in one network. However, the node deployment strategy should stay the same and all nodes {{have to be able to}} provide all power levels, albeit at different costs. We discuss the implementation and performance characteristics of such heterogenous networks in this paper. The results show a potential reduction in energy consumption to less than 65 % compared to classical networks with uniform amplifiers.

By comparing different configurations of micro-CHP systems, [16] quantified the behavior of integrated hybrid solar thermal, photovoltaic (PV), and micro-CHP systems. Based on linear programming techniques, [17] addressed the optimal sizing of hybrid micro-CHP to satisfy the energy demand in dwellings. In order to design superior integrated systems, [18] reviewed the existing design options for heating systems incorporating fuel cell micro-CHP in dwellings, motivating a new methodology considering all possible interconnections of plant. [19] explored the potential overall benefit of integrating a resistor for storage heating, which acts as a <b>power</b> <b>sink</b> when needed, presenting a cost-minimizing control strategy for a residential micro-CHP system. Considering fuel cell output compared to user thermal and electrical demand, [12] employed four operational modes to evaluate the system behavior under both for the electrical-led and thermal-led operation in single-family buildings. To fulfill domestic user energy demand and reduce the primary energy consumption, [20] investigated the potential to integrate a solid oxide fuel cell prime mover and ZEBRA batteries by comparing alternative micro-CHP technologies. By considering two heat-led operational strategies, [21] addressed the economic optimization of a micro-CHP system during the cold season for multi-apartment housing. The four different micro-CHP systems are analyzed in [22] to evaluate the effect of heat dumping on economic performance and emission of pollutants. To investigate various designs of a district heating pipe network, [23] constructed an objective formula to minimize the annual total energy consumption and costs so as to arrive at the optimal flow rate and supply temperature operating strategy.
