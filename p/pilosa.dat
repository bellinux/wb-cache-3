40|$|Low {{productivity}} of <b>pilosae</b> type lentils grown in South Asia {{is attributed to}} narrow genetic base of the released cultivars which results in susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stresses. For enhancement of productivity and production, broadening of genetic base is essentially required. The genetic base of released cultivars can be broadened by using diverse types including bold seeded and early maturing lentils from Mediterranean region and related wild species. Genetic diversity in eighty six accessions of three species of genus Lens was assessed based on twelve genomic and thirty one EST-SSR markers. The evaluated set of genotypes included diverse lentil varieties and advanced breeding lines from Indian pro-gramme, two early maturing ICARDA lines and five related wild subspecies/species endemic to the Mediterranean region. Genomic SSRs exhibited higher polymorphism in comparison to EST SSRs. GLLC 598 produced 5 alleles with highest gene diversity value of 0. 80. Among the studied subspecies/species 43 SSRs detected maximum number of alleles in L. orientalis.

40|$|Interest in {{morphological}} {{variation in}} food legume species is increasing as plant breeders {{search for new}} variants to satisfy the adaptation requirements from new or changing environments or the needs of new end-users. Examination of evolutionary pathways often provides leads in understanding morphological or physiological variation, which may offer opportunities for exploitation in plant breeding. Variation has direct and indirect effects on yield stability and quality through several parameters acting within the plant and the crop. Traits affecting {{the development of the}} crop canopy or the seed, including for example photosynthate repartitions, can have an impact on yield, quality and diseases. Yet the information available is often incomplete for practical use or is very environment specific. Examples are given of the potential utilisation of genetic diversity conserved in different geographic areas as are available in lentils (<b>pilosae</b> types) and chickpeas (kabuli-desi introgression). The concept of quality in pulses is often dominated by morphological traits and the appearance of the seed. There are also instances where the morphological traits affect nutritional and processing quality, (e. g., the novel alleles at the loci controlling both seed shape and starch composition in pea or the gene for zero tannin in lentil). Where prospects are still remote for developing cultivars with high levels of resistance to important diseases, more emphasis needs to be put on other components of integrated disease management. Some plant characteristics, such as growth habit and canopy structure (modulated by sowing date, plant density, etc.), can contribute to control of diseases. However, experiments have shown that an increase in disease incidence due to increased plant density can be compensated for by a yield increase {{as is the case with}} chocolate spot and rust in faba bean. Of interest also are morphological traits, which can slow penetration by the pathogen, enabling the plant to deploy post-infection physiological mechanisms of resistance. ...|$|R

40|$|Lentil is {{not only}} the oldest legume crop but also the oldest of the crops that have been domesticated in the Fertile Crescent and {{distributed}} to other regions during the Bronze Age, making it an ideal model to study the evolution of rhizobia associated with crop legumes. This study investigates lentil-nodulating rhizobia from the region where lentil originated (Turkey and Syria) and from regions to which lentil was introduced later (Germany and Bangladesh). There are few studies on lentil-nodulating rhizobia, and no phylogenetic studies on lentil rhizobia using multi locus sequence analyses. Therefore, rhizobia from lentil nodules were chosen to study 1) the genetic diversity 2) the taxonomic position and 3) the transmissible nature of nodulation genes. I have sequenced four housekeeping genes (16 S rRNA, recA, atpD, glnII) and three nodulation genes (nodA, nodC, nodD) and analyzed these using phylogenetic and population genetic approaches to achieve these objectives. To supplement these approaches I have also used DNA fingerprinting and phenotypic characterization. Moreover, the symbiotic performance was assessed by nodulation and cross inoculation tests. I identified four different lineages of rhizobia associated with lentil, of which three are new and endemic to Bangladesh, and one lineage was found in the Mediterranean region and Central Europe. The new lineages from Bangladesh are close to Rhizobium etli and correspond to new species in the genus Rhizobium. The endemic lentil grex <b>pilosae</b> may have {{played a significant role in}} the origin of these new lineages in Bangladesh. The single lineage from the Mediterranean and Central Europe belongs to Rhizobium leguminosarum. The association of Rhizobium leguminosarum with lentil at the centre of lentil origin and in countries where lentil was introduced later suggests that Rhizobium leguminosarum is the original symbiont of lentil. Lentil seeds might have played a significant role in the initial dispersal of Rhizobium leguminosarum within the Middle East and on to other countries. Analysis of nodulation genes showed that they are prone to horizontal transfer between different chromosomal lineages and sub-lineages of rhizobia. Nodulation genes showed bias to their geographical origin, evidencing that plasmid-borne characters in bacteria rapidly change according to their adaptation to particular environment.

40|$|The {{transition}} to reproductive development is amongst {{the most significant}} in the developmental cycle of monocarpic plants. This transition, epitomised by the initiation of flowers, is of importance to agriculture. The wild progenitor of cultivated lentil, Lens culinaris subsp. orientalis, is a vernalisation responsive, facultative long day plant. The expansion of cultivated lentil, {{beyond the boundaries of}} its progenitor, coupled with the adoption of new agronomic practices, would have required the selection of landraces that were diverse in their response to both photoperiod and temperature. This diversity is reflected through the reported variation in flowering time observed in cultivated lentil. The genetic basis for this variation is of interest to plant breeding. The genetic control of flowering time in lentil however, is poorly understood. This study expands our current understanding of the genetic basis for the control of flowering time in cultivated lentil. The current understanding of the genetic control of flowering time in lentil is shaped by the discovery of the lentil Sn locus. It was then proposed that the genetic control of flowering time in cultivated lentil {{is a function of the}} lentil Sn locus and several minor loci. The lentil Sn locus was first characterised in cv. Precoz, an early-flowering cultivar that has been described to be photoperiod-insensitive. This study (Chapter 3), through the use of a candidate gene approach, proposes that the Arabidopsis ELF 3 orthologue is the likely candidate for the lentil Sn locus, and concurs with the literature that the lentil Sn locus confers an early-flowering habit in its recessive state. It is also proposed that the lentil Sn is involved in the control of internode length, and early lateral branching. Additionally, the study suggests that the existing variation in flowering time observed in the unimproved lentil germplasm cannot be attributed to early-flowering habit conferred by the lentil Sn. The <b>pilosae</b> ecotype that characterises the Indian lentil germplasm has been previously described to be early flowering. This study (Chapter 4) investigated the genetic basis for the observed earliness in ILL 2601, a landrace that been evaluated to be amongst the earliest in the lentil germplasm. A segregating F 2 population (n= 173) was established between ILL 2601 and ILL 5588 (cv. Northfield), and a genetic linkage map was constructed from 734 `DArT-Seq^T`^M markers to identify loci contributing to the observed earliness through the use of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping. The study identified two major loci controlling flowering time, and two major loci controlling the time to emergence from sowing, as being integral to the observed earliness in the Indian landrace. The four described loci have not been previously reported. This study (Chapter 5) additionally explored the genetic basis of the two major loci controlling flowering time in ILL 2601 through comparative genetics, and co-segregation analysis in segregating F 3 populations. The study proposes that the non-coding genomic sequence in the intergenic region between the Medicago orthologues FTa 1 and FTa 2 as having a role in conferring ILL 2601 the early-flowering habit. The study also proposes that a legume-specific paralogue of the Arabidopsis PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR, PRR 59 c is the likely candidate for the second locus described to confer an early-flowering habit. Amongst the cultivated lentil germplasm, several accessions have been previously reported to be demonstrably late flowering. This study (Chapter 6) explored the genetic basis for the late flowering habit observed in cv. Indian Head. A Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population derived from a cross between cv. Indianhead and ILL 5588 was evaluated, and QTL determined in a genetic linkage map. Two loci contributing to the observed late flowering habit are proposed through this study. This study, on the whole, contributes significantly through its findings to the current understanding of the genetic control of flowering time, and flowering time variation in lentil...|$|R
