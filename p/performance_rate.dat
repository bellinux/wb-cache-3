40|$|This Thesis {{reports on}} the {{principles}} and usefulness of <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating</b> as developed by the writer {{over a number of}} years. In Part one a brief analysis is made of the Quality scene and its development up to the present. The need is exposed for <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating</b> as a tool for all areas of management*. At the same time a system of Quality Control is described which the writer has further developed under the title of 'Operator Control'. This system is based on the integration of all Quality control functions with the creative functions required for Quality achievement. The discussions are mainly focussed on the general philosophy of Quality, its creation and control and that part of Operator Control which affects <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating.</b> Whereas it is shown that the combination of Operator Control and <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating</b> is both economically and technically advantageous, <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating</b> can also usefully be applied under inspection control conditions. Part two describes the principles of Area <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating.</b> *The need for, and the advantages of, <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating</b> are particularly demonstrated in Case study No. 1. From this a summation expression is derived which gives the key for grouping of areas with similar <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating</b> (P). A model is devised on which the theory is demonstrated. Relevant case studies, carried out in practice in factories are quoted in Part two, Chapter 4, one written by the Quality manager of that particular factory. Particular stress is laid in the final conclusions on management's function in the Quality field and how greatly this function is eased and improved through the introduction of Area <b>Performance</b> <b>Rating...</b>|$|R
