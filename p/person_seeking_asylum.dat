25|$|In 1986 an Immigration Judge {{agreed not}} to send Fidel Armando-Alfanso back to Cuba, based on his {{membership}} in a particular social group (gay people) who were persecuted and feared further persecution {{by the government of}} Cuba. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision in 1990, and in 1994, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered this decision to be a legal precedent binding on Immigration Judges and the Asylum Office, and established sexual orientation as a grounds for asylum. However, in 2002 the Board of Immigration Appeals “suggested in an ambiguous and internally inconsistent decision that the ‘protected characteristic’ and ‘social visibility’ tests may represent dual requirements in all social group cases.” The requirement for social visibility means that the government of a country from which the <b>person</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum</b> is fleeing must recognize their social group, and that LGBT people who hide their sexual orientation, for example out of fear of persecution, may not be eligible for asylum under this mandate.|$|E
40|$|When {{does the}} refugee {{encounter}} the State? The straightforward and traditional {{answer to this}} question would be, when arriving at the border and surrendering herself to the authorities uttering the magical word, asylum. Reality, however, only seldom conforms to this picture. Today, the <b>person</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum</b> in the EU is much more likely to encounter the State before reaching the EU border - at the visa consulate, through the EU Immigration Liaison Officers posted at the airports of key migration transit and origin countries, during passage over the Mediterranean where navy vessels are patrolling. Alternatively, the refugee may not meet EU in persona, but through delegation, either {{in the form of an}} airline company bound by EU regulations ro carry out migration control or as a third State having in EU cooperation to perform exit border control or provide alternative protection in the region. This paper explores the growing nexus of these external or extraterritorial policies in the developing EU asylum and immigration policv. From a legal perspective, these developments create a number of challenges for ensuring the rights of asylum seekers and refugees. Looking into three contentious areas (extraterritorial jurisdiction, extraterritorial protection and extraterritorial policy implementation) it is argued that the present drive to move migration control and refugee protection outside the EU is becoming a strategic feature of the common EU asylum and immigration policy, in which States are instrumentalising the territorial principles of the present refugee regime to relieve themselves of international legal obligations and institutionalise a new ethos of ' 2 ̆ 019 protection lite...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years, the Board of Immigration Appeals has imposed a {{requirement}} that <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum</b> based on membership in a particular social group must establish that the social group is “socially visible” throughout society. This Comment argues that the social visibility requirement should be denied administrative deference on several grounds. The requirement should be denied Chevron deference because Congress’s intent behind the Refugee Act of 1980 is clear and unambiguous and, alternatively, the requirement is an impermissible interpretation of the statute. The requirement is also arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act. This Comment argues that courts should instead follow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ definition of a particular social group, in which social visibility {{is one of two}} methods to establish a particular social group.

50|$|As of 2005, the {{government}} has granted refugee and asylum status to those claiming fear of persecution in {{only a small number}} of cases. A nongovernmental organization (NGO), in a statement to the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, noted that, from 1982 to December 2002, 301 persons were accepted as refugees. The Government considered that most <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum</b> in the country did so for economic reasons. In 2003, there were approximately 7,900 refugees and asylum seekers in the country, of whom an estimated 7,700 were Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees. Out of 336 refugee claims submitted in 2003, the Government granted asylum to 10 persons from Burma, Burundi, and Iran and issued long-term residence permits based on humanitarian considerations to 16.

Since 1989, the status and rights of <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum</b> in Australia have been significantly restricted. Moreover, the protection of those who are found to be refugees has been limited to a period of three years and they no longer have access to family reunification and a range of welfare benefits.

S. and Mexico Gustavo Verduzco Igartúa 1 The topic of population movements between countries has been gaining greater importance due both to growth {{in terms of the}} number of migrants and the different implications this phenomenon has had from several different perspectives. Unlike in the past, the theme of migration has now been accompanied by others involving human, labor, and civil rights, besides the more traditional matter of relations between the governments whose citizens are participating in these movements. At present, a migrant – even undocumented – is considered to be a human being with certain basic inalienable rights. Migrants may be <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum,</b> men or women traveling to join a spouse, children who wish to be with their parents, or workers who simply wish to attain better working conditions than in their place of origin. At least as far as collective thinking (imaginaire collectif) is concerned, a migrant, whether legal or illegal, is first of all a person inhabiting this world. However, it would seem that despite this change in attitude...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{times have}} {{witnessed}} a significant {{decline in the}} number of <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum</b> on the territory of European Union (EU) countries. When these trends are observed in the light of Member States' continuous tightening of their border controls, it seems evident that access to the territory and to the asylum procedure is being seriously obstructed in the EU. Border management activities are no longer confined to the physical frontiers of the Member States or to the external borders of the EU; instead, their scope has been extended well beyond these, towards the high seas and into the territory of third countries. From the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), a pan-European network of refugee-assisting NGOs working in 30 countries, we emphasise that Member States' obligations under international and European refugee and human rights law do not stop at the physical boundaries of the EU. This includes interception operations taking place in the high seas or in the territorial waters of third countries. The EU and the Member States should recognise that the power to prevent access to the territory carries with it the responsibility to protect those in need...|$|R

40|$|In the past, most {{refugees}} who permanently resettled {{in the traditional}} recipient countries of North America, Europe, and Australasia were screened prior to arrival in a host country. In the last decade, increasing numbers of unauthorized refugees or asylum seekers, those who formally lodge application for refugee status {{in the country in}} which they are residing, have applied for protection after crossing the borders of these countries. Concerns about uncontrolled migration have encouraged host countries to adopt policies of deterrence in which increasingly restrictive measures are being imposed on <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum.</b> These measures include, variously, confinement in detention centers, enforced dispersal within the community, the implementation of more stringent refugee determination procedures, and temporary forms of asylum, In several countries, asylum seekers living in the community face restricted access to work, education, housing, welfare, and, in some situations, to basic health care services, Allegations of abuse, untreated medical and psychiatric illnesses, suicidal behavior, hunger strikes, and outbreaks of violence among asylum seekers in detention centers have been reported. Although systematic research into the mental health of asylum seekers is in its infancy, and methods are limited by sampling difficulties, there is growing evidence that salient postmigration stress facing asylum seekers adds to the effect of previous trauma in creating risk of ongoing posttraumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric symptoms. The medical profession has a role in educating governments and the public about the potential risks of imposing excessively harsh policies of deterrence on the mental health of asylum seekers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} problem of {{determining}} the status of refugees and internally displaced persons in {{the countries of the}} European Union. Due to the increasing problem of internal involuntary displacement in other countries an understanding of the need to develop common approaches to solving the problems of persons displaced within their own countries and providing the sovereign states with international assistance in this area has gradually formed. It is noted that the legislation on refugees and internally displaced persons is quite developed in many Western European countries. The definition of a «refugee» concept is given in the Refugee Convention of 1951, currently incorporated into the domestic law of a significant number of states. The authors argue that the legal status of refugees has an international nature; in this case a negative decision on the recognition of any refugee status does not release another country to which he/she refers to consider the request for such recognition. The EU migration policy has been characterized by the following provisions: the absence of any obstacles for the movement of EU citizens within the EU common borders; the introduction of common standards of treatment of citizens of other countries entering the EU, creating tough immigration rules in relation to refugees and <b>persons</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>asylum,</b> and the formation of a common procedure for the recognition of their status; the adoption of common European measures to combat and prevent illegal migration. Europe is becoming increasingly closed. A supranational principle of this regulation collides with the provisions of the Convention on the Status of Refugees of 1951. It is emphasized that there has been increasing efforts to provide people with the status of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe. The authors conclude that European countries actively integrate the provisions of the international law governing the legal status of refugees and internally displaced persons into their domestic law...|$|R
