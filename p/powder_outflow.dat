40|$|Air {{abrasion}} as a caries removal {{technique is}} less aggressive than conventional techniques and is compatible {{for use with}} adhesive restorative materials. Alumina, while being currently the most common abrasive used for cutting, has controversial health and safety issues and no remineralisation properties. The alternative, a bioactive glass, 45 S 5, {{has the advantage of}} promoting hard tissue remineralisation. However, 45 S 5 is slow as a cutting abrasive and lacks fluoride in its formulation. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the cutting efficacy of dentine using a customised fluoride-containing bioactive glass Na 0 SR (38 – 80 [*]μm) versus the conventional alumina abrasive (29 [*]μm) in an air abrasion set-up. Fluoride was incorporated into Na 0 SR to enhance its remineralisation properties while strontium was included to increase its radiopacity. <b>Powder</b> <b>outflow</b> rate was recorded prior to the cutting tests. Principal air abrasion cutting tests were carried out on pristine ivory dentine. The abrasion depths were quantified and compared using X-ray microtomography. Na 0 SR was found to create deeper cavities than alumina (p< 0. 05) despite its lower <b>powder</b> <b>outflow</b> rate and predictably reduced hardness. The sharper edges of the Na 0 SR glass particles might improve the cutting efficiency. In conclusion, Na 0 SR was more efficacious than alumina for air abrasion cutting of dentine...|$|E
