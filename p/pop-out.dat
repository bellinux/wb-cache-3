5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a <b>pop-out,</b> and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E

25|$|In Game 5, Gibson's two-run shot in {{the first}} inning would be the {{beginning}} of another early end for the Padres' starter Mark Thurmond. Though the Padres would pull back even at 3–3, chasing Dan Petry in the fourth inning in the process, the Tigers retook the lead on a Rusty Kuntz sacrifice fly (actually a <b>pop-out</b> to retreating second baseman Alan Wiggins that the speedy Gibson was able to score on), and doubled it on a solo homer by Parrish.|$|E

It can be launched from both high and low altitudes, and flies at subsonic speeds at low levels (under 110 m/300nbsp&ft altitude). After launch, the missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine deploy. It is guided through a combination of an inertial guidance system plus a terrain contour-matching guidance system which uses radar and images stored in the memory of an onboard computer to find its target. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|E

25|$|Cherts {{are subject}} to {{problems}} when used as concrete aggregates. Deeply weathered chert develops surface <b>pop-outs</b> when used in concrete that undergoes freezing and thawing {{because of the high}} porosity of weathered chert. The other concern is that certain cherts undergo an alkali-silica reaction with high-alkali cements. This reaction leads to cracking and expansion of concrete and ultimately to failure of the material.|$|R

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the map of Stilwater is fully visible. However, shops and activities will simply be displayed as a question mark until the player discovers them. By completing missions and wiping out enemy strongholds the player gains control of the various neighborhoods the city is split into. There are over 130 interiors within the city, and hidden events can be triggered by some, including over ninety shops which can be purchased when the player controls each shops' associated territory. The player gets a 10% discount at owned stores and buying an entire chain of departments will mean that the protagonist's face appears on in-game billboard advertisements.

2500|$|During {{the design}} of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the 1970s, {{engineers}} debated whether to design the orbiter to glide to an unpowered landing or equip the orbiter with <b>pop-out</b> jet engines {{in order to make a}} powered landing. [...] While powered landing design required carrying the engines and jet fuel, adding weight and complexity to the orbiter, engineers began favoring the powered landing option. [...] In response, NASA conducted unpowered drop tests of the X-24B to demonstrate the feasibility of landing a lifting-body aircraft in unpowered flight. [...] In 1975, the X-24B aircraft was dropped from a Balls 8 at an altitude of 45,000 feet above the Mojave Desert, and then ignited rocket engines to increase speed and propel it to 60,000 feet. [...] Once the rocket engine cut off, the high-speed and high-altitude conditions permitted the X-24B to simulate the path of a Space Shuttle orbiter under post-atmospheric reentry conditions. [...] The X-24B successfully made two unpowered precision landings at Edwards Air Force Base, demonstrating the feasibility of an unpowered lifting body design for the Space Shuttle. [...] These successes convinced those in charge of the Space Shuttle program to commit to an unpowered landing design, which would save weight and increase the orbiter's payload capacity.|$|E
30|$|The load-depth curve (Figure  1) is {{characterized}} by a substantial continuity, i.e., there are no large steps (pop-ins or <b>pop-outs)</b> observed in both loading and unloading. Figure  1 shows high elastic recovery (70.58 %) and low plastic deformation (29.42 %). However, when different loads were applied from 300 to 9, 000 μN, it was observed that there was an appreciable increase in plastic deformation. In fact, from the present calculation of the depth before and after removal of the applied load, it was found that 57.72 % of the total work done during the indentation is attributed to elastic deformation.|$|R

It was found that the crystallographic orientation strongly influenced both the stiffness, load for pop-in formation, the resulting deformation and the stress beneath the indenter.

40|$|I use a {{model to}} show how simple, bottom-up, neural {{mechanisms}} in primary visual cortex can qualitatively explain the preattentive component of complex psychophysical phenomena of visual search for a target among distracters. Depending on the image features, the speed of search ranges from fast, when a target <b>pops-out</b> or is instantaneously detectable, to very slow, {{and it can be}} asymmetric with respect to switches between the target and distracter objects. It has been unclear which neural mechanisms or even cortical areas control the ease of search, and no physiological correlate has been found for search asymmetry.

50|$|The priming of <b>pop-out</b> {{hypothesis}} suggests {{performance in}} a visual search task involving a <b>pop-out</b> target can {{be affected by the}} search history of specific target features in previous trials. If target and distractor features are repeated in subsequent trials, reaction times will be faster than if these features change across trials. The hypothesis proposes the repetition of a target used in a preceding trial makes its <b>pop-out</b> features more salient to an observer and therefore increases the likelihood the observer will attend to it.|$|E

50|$|Various {{types of}} {{aggregate}} undergo chemical reactions in concrete, leading to damaging expansive phenomena. The most common are those containing reactive silica, that can react (in {{the presence of}} water) with the alkalis in concrete (K2O and Na2O, coming principally from cement). Among the more reactive mineral components of some aggregates are opal, chalcedony, flint and strained quartz. Following the alkali-silica reaction (ASR), an expansive gel forms, that creates extensive cracks and damage on structural members. On the surface of concrete pavements the ASR can cause <b>pop-outs,</b> i.e. the expulsion of small cones (up to 3 cm about in diameter) in correspondence of aggregate particles.|$|R
40|$|Intrachromosomal {{recombination}} within heteroallelic duplications {{located on}} chromosomes III and XV of Saccharomyces cerevisae has been examined. Both possible orientations of alleles {{have been used}} in each duplication. Three recombinant classes, gene conversions, <b>pop-outs</b> and triplications, were recovered. Some of the recombinant classes were not anticipated from the particular allele orientation of the duplication. Recovery of these unexpected recombinants requires the RAD 1 gene. These studies show that RAD 1 has a role in recombination between repeated sequences, and that the recombination event is a gene conversion associated with a crossover. These events appear to involve very localized conversion of a heteroduplex region and are distinct from RAD 52 mediated gene conversion events. Evidence is also presented to suggest that most recombination events between direct repeats are intrachromatid, not between sister chromatids...|$|R

The elastic and plastic properties of the thin coating is investigated for three different crystallographic orientations for two different coating thicknesses using nanoindentation. The force-displacement curve and the atomic arrangement are monitored during the indentation process and the precise conditions for the occurrence of so called pop-ins during loading and <b>pop-outs</b> during unloading are investigated. To simulate the nanoindentation process, a molecular dynamics approach is used, where an infinitely stiff spherical indenter is pushed into the coating under displacement control. The coating is modeled as a thin rectangular plate, with the bottom atom layers locked from movement in all directions, simulating the much stiffer substrate, and periodic boundary conditions are applied in {{the plane of the}} plate, simulating an infinitely large plate...|$|R
