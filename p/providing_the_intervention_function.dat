30|$|MAC layer jamming is {{a common}} attack on {{wireless}} networks, which is easy to launch by the attacker and which is very effective in disrupting <b>the</b> service <b>provided</b> by <b>the</b> network. Most of the current MAC protocols for wireless networks, for example, IEEE 802.11, do not provide sufficient protection against MAC layer jamming attacks. In this paper, we first use a non-cooperative game model to characterize the interactions {{among a group of}} self-interested regular users and a malicious user. It can be shown that the Nash equilibrium of this game is either inefficient or unfair for the regular users. We introduce a policer (an intervention user) who uses an <b>intervention</b> <b>function</b> to transform <b>the</b> original non-cooperative game into a new non-cooperative game augmented by <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>function,</b> in which <b>the</b> users will adjust to play a Nash equilibrium of the augmented game. By properly designing <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>function,</b> we show that <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> user can effectively mitigate the jamming attacks from the malicious user, {{and at the same time}} let the regular users choose more efficient transmission strategies. It is proved that any feasible point in the rate region can be achieved as a Nash equilibrium of the augmented game by appropriately designing <b>the</b> <b>intervention.</b>|$|R

40|$|Interventions {{to improve}} {{implementation}} of evidence-based health care have achieved modest and variable success. Improving implementation depends on chan-ging the behaviour of health professionals, managers, commissioners and others working within {{and with the}} health care system. Achieving and maintaining beha-viour change within the ethical and practical constraints that typically operate remains a formidable challenge. Meeting it requires: 1. a systematic method for analyzing the target beha-viours in their context {{as a starting point for}} designing an intervention, 2. selecting interventions that are most likely to be effective given this analysis, 3. specifying <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> in sufficient detail in trial protocols and published reports to allow accurate replication and evidence syntheses, and 4. drawing on relevant theory to guide both the inter-vention design and evaluation. This approach can generate evidence about the mechan-isms of action of effective interventions and about why interventions vary across different types of behaviour and in different populations and settings. Such evidence is essential for designing more effective <b>interventions.</b> <b>The</b> most effective <b>interventions</b> for both initiating and main-taining behaviour change are those that act simultaneously at many different ‘levels’. A framework for analyzing target behaviours in context and considering the full range of <b>intervention</b> <b>functions</b> and policy categories that may be relevant to <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> problem is <b>the</b> Behaviour Change Wheel [1, 2]. This was derived from a systematic review of 19 published frameworks, none of which were found to contain all <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>functions</b> know to be relevant.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{pharmacist}} telephone counseling intervention on patients' medication adherence. Design: Pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting: 53 Community pharmacies in The Netherlands. Participants: Patients ≥ 18 years initiating treatment with antidepressants, bisphosphonates, Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) -inhibitors, or statins (lipid lowering drugs). Pharmacies in arm A <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> for antidepressants and bisphosphonates and usual care for RAS-inhibitors and statins. Pharmacies in arm B <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> for RAS-inhibitors and statins and usual care for antidepressants and bisphosphonates. Intervention: Intervention consisted of a telephone counseling intervention 7 – 21 days after the start of therapy. Counseling included assessment of practical and perceptual barriers and provision of information and motivation. Main outcome measure: Primary outcome was refill adherence measured over 1 year expressed as continuous outcome and dichotomous (refill rate≥ 80 %). Secondary outcome was discontinuation within 1 year. Results: In the control arms 3627 patients were eligible and in <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> arms 3094 patients. Of the latter, 1054 patients (34 %) received <b>the</b> <b>intervention.</b> Intention to treat analysis showed no difference in adherence rates between <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> and <b>the</b> usual care arm (74. 7 %, SD 37. 5 respectively 74. 5 %, 37. 9). More patients starting with RAS-inhibitors had a refill ratio ≥ 80 % in <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> arm compared to usual care (81. 4 vs. 74. 9 % with odds ratio (OR) 1. 43, 95 %CI 1. 11 – 1. 99).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Poorly {{controlled}} type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} (T 2 DM) {{can be seen as}} failure to meet recommended targets for management of key risk factors including glycaemic control, blood pressure and lipids. Poor control of risk factors is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Failure to intensify medications for patients with poor control of T 2 DM when indicated is called clinical inertia and is one contributory factor to poor control of T 2 DM. We aimed to develop a theory and evidence-based complex intervention to improve appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled T 2 DM in Irish general practice. METHODS: The first stage of the Medical Research Council Framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions was utilised. To identify current evidence, we performed a systematic review to examine <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>interventions</b> targeting patients with poorly controlled T 2 DM in community settings. The Behaviour Change Wheel theoretical approach was used to identify suitable <b>intervention</b> <b>functions.</b> Workshops, simulation, collaborations with academic partners and observation of physicians were utilised to operationalise <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>functions</b> and design <b>the</b> elements of <b>the</b> complex <b>intervention.</b> RESULTS: Our systematic review highlighted that professional-based interventions, potentially through clinical decision support systems, could address poorly controlled T 2 DM. Appropriate intensification of anti-glycaemic and cardiovascular medications, by general practitioners (GPs), for adults with poorly controlled T 2 DM was identified as the key behaviour to address clinical inertia. Psychological capability was the key driver of the behaviour, which needed to change, suggesting five key <b>intervention</b> <b>functions</b> (education, training, enablement, environmental restructuring and incentivisation) and nine key behaviour change techniques, which were operationalised into a complex <b>intervention.</b> <b>The</b> <b>intervention</b> has three components: (a) a training program/academic detailing of target GPs, (b) a remote finder tool to help GPs identify patients with poor control of T 2 DM in their practice and (c) A web-based clinical decision support system. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a multifaceted process including an exploration of current evidence and a thorough theoretical understanding of the predictors of the behaviour resulting in the design of a complex <b>intervention</b> to promote <b>the</b> implementation of evidence-based guidelines, through appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled T 2 DM...|$|R
40|$|Background Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{a leading}} cause of premature death and disability and an economic burden worldwide. International guidelines recommend routine availability and delivery of all phases of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Uptake of traditional cardiac rehabilitation remains suboptimal, as attendance at formal hospital-based CR programmes is low, with community-based CR rates and individual long-term exercise maintenance even lower. Home-based CR programs {{have been shown to be}} equally effective in clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes, and yet are not readily available. Purpose The aim of the current study was to develop <b>the</b> PATHway <b>intervention</b> (Physical Activity Towards Health) for the self-management of cardiovascular disease. Increasing physical activity in individuals with CVD was the primary behaviour. Methods <b>The</b> PATHway <b>intervention</b> was theoretically informed by the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). All relevant <b>intervention</b> <b>functions,</b> behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and policy categories were identified and translated into intervention content. Furthermore, a person-centred approach was adopted involving an iterative co-design process and extensive user-testing. Results Education, enablement, modelling, persuasion, training and social restructuring were selected as appropriate <b>intervention</b> <b>functions.</b> Twenty-two BCTs, linked to <b>the</b> 6 <b>intervention</b> <b>functions</b> and 3 policy categories were identified for inclusion and translated into PATHway intervention content.

Existing cancer registries around the United States should be strengthened and other dimensions should be added to their charge to augment their function in prevention research. To convert existing population-based cancer registries, particularly those that serve multiethnic and multicultural populations, into Cancer Prevention Research Registries (CPRRs), three types of data in addition to their existing required data complement should be incorporated. These are exposure information including occupational history, host factors information, and information about family history of cancer and associated conditions. The primary goal of the CPRRs should be to support cancer prevention research in its widest sense. Future research needs must be designed to investigate each of the components of the prevention strategy as well as its integrated performance. Regardless of what we do in the future, we must now promote healthier lifestyles, prevent exposure to known carcinogens, and improve early detection procedures...|$|R

Analysis of intervention consists of two functions, that is the step function and pulse <b>function.</b> <b>Intervention</b> of step <b>function</b> represents an <b>intervention</b> that have long-term effects, whereas pulse <b>function</b> represents an <b>intervention</b> that takes place at a particular time. Step <b>function</b> <b>intervention</b> model was created based on the delay time of <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> (b), <b>the</b> length of <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> effect (s), and <b>the</b> pattern of <b>intervention</b> effects that was occured after b + s period (r). Intervention modeling was done after ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model was acquired. ARIMA model was used to determine the b, s, and r order of intervention. In this study, <b>the</b> step <b>function</b> <b>intervention</b> analysis was used to assess the amount of postage on the period January 2006 to February 2011. Based on the analysis, the ARIMA model produced was ARIMA (0, 1, 1). Based on intervention response obtained residual value b = 4, s = 0, r = 2 is used to form a model of <b>intervention</b> using <b>the</b> least squares method...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] research sought to determine whether a blended information literacy learning and teaching intervention could statistically significantly enhance undergraduates’ information discernment compared to standard face-to-face delivery. A mixture of face-to-face and online activities, including online social media learning, was used. Three interventions were designed to develop the information literacies of first-year undergraduates studying Sport and Exercise at Staffordshire University and focused on one aspect of information literacy: the ability to evaluate source material effectively. An analysis was devised where written evaluations of found information for an assessment were converted into numerical scores and then measured statistically. This helped to evaluate the efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> and <b>provided</b> data for further analysis. An insight into how the information literacy pedagogical <b>intervention</b> and <b>the</b> cognitive processes involved in enabling participants to interact critically with information is <b>provided.</b> <b>The</b> <b>intervention</b> which incorporated social media learning proved to be the most successful learning and teaching approach. The data indicated that undergraduate students’ information literacy can be developed. However, additional long-term data is required to establish whether this intervention would have a lasting impact...|$|R

40|$|Early {{childhood}} {{special educators}} face many challenges teaching {{young children with}} expressive language delays. One of those challenges is teaching parents effective strategies to address the expressive language delays in the home setting. The purpose of this multiple probe single-subject design study {{was to provide a}} systematic approach that included the use of mobile technology for parents to promote their child’s expressive language development. To accomplish this goal, a four-week <b>intervention</b> implementing <b>the</b> Joint Attention Mediated Learning-Focus on Verbal Expression with Technology (JAML-FVET) strategy across four families was conducted. <b>The</b> researcher <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> while training <b>the</b> parent. Specifically, the parents learned how to capture their child 2 ̆ 7 s attention, so the child was focusing on the language-based activity with an app (Make a Scene). The goal was for the child to acquire and independently use the targeted words with intent in the home environment. The results of the study indicated a causal relationship of the parent-implemented Joint Attention Mediated Learning-Focus on Verbal Expression with Technology (JAML-FVET) <b>intervention</b> and <b>the</b> child’s acquisition of two new words...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} students' experiences of participating in a physical activity (PA) intervention. Methodology: A purposive sampling was used; 14 students (four boys and 10 girls) were interviewed and the collected data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. Major findings: One main theme was identified: fun, feasible and functioning. The following two subthemes also emerged: <b>the</b> multi-component <b>intervention</b> fits several, but not all, and manageable measuring can also be motivating. The main theme elucidates that fun was an important factor for joining the study; the students also experienced he empowerment-inspired <b>intervention</b> and <b>the</b> data collection to be fun and feasible. According to <b>the</b> students, <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> was <b>functioning</b> since they experienced that it increased their PA. Principal conclusions: An empowerment approach that includes forming partnerships with students is a promising avenue for developing PA interventions for schools, regardless of whether the person concerned is a parent, teacher, school nurse or physiotherapist, but one size will never fit all...|$|R
