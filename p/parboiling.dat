5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of <b>parboiling</b> reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the <b>parboiling</b> water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|The mushroom's {{common names}} {{refer to the}} {{gastrointestinal}} distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by <b>parboiling</b> or pickling. Although {{it used to be}} widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption. There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished from R.emetica only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by <b>parboiling</b> with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by <b>parboiling,</b> soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E
5|$|Monomethylhydrazine, {{as well as}} its {{precursors}} methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw Gyromitra esculenta, {{have been}} shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by <b>parboiling.</b>|$|E
5|$|Use of this {{mushroom}} as a {{food source}} also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after <b>parboiling,</b> and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed {{as a food}} in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.|$|E

40|$|Each new {{generation}} of GPUs vastly increases the resources available to GPGPU programs. GPU programming models (like CUDA) were designed to scale to use these resources. However, we find that CUDA programs actually do not scale to utilize all available resources, with over 30 % of resources going unused on average for programs of the <b>Parboil</b> 2 suite that we used in our work. Current GPUs therefore allow concurrent execution of kernels to improve utilization. In this work, we study concurrent execution of GPU kernels using multiprogram workloads on current NVIDIA Fermi GPUs. On two-program workloads from the <b>Parboil</b> 2 benchmark suite we find concurrent execution is often no better than serialized execution. We identify {{that the lack of}} control over resource allocation to kernels is a major serialization bottleneck. We propose transformations that convert CUDA kernels into elastic kernels which permit fine-grained control over their resource usage. We then propose several elastic-kernel aware concurrency policies that offer significantly better performance and concurrency compared to the current CUDA policy. We evaluate our proposals on real hardware using multiprogrammed workloads constructed from benchmarks in the <b>Parboil</b> 2 suite. On average, our proposals increase system throughput (STP) by 1. 21 x and improve the average normalized turnaround time (ANTT) by 3. 73 x for two-program workloads when compared to the current CUDA concurrency implementation...|$|R

25|$|Vitamin E was co-discovered by UA Agricultural Chemistry Professor Barnett Sure (1920–51). Sure, {{along with}} fellow {{professor}} Marinus C. Kik (1927–67) made major advances in nutrition science during their long tenures at the University of Arkansas. Sure co-discovered vitamin E, and extended {{knowledge of how}} vitamin E, amino acids and B-vitamins function on reproduction and lactation. Kik developed the process for <b>parboiling</b> rice (a major agricultural crop in the state) to increase retention of vitamins and shorten cooking time. He documented benefits of adding fish and chicken to rice and grain diets to provide adequate protein for a growing world population. Sure and Kik were Agricultural Experiment Station scientists and professors in the UA Department of Agricultural Chemistry, which merged in 1964 with Home Economics, now the School of Human Environmental Sciences.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, {{parboiled}} rice (also known as converted rice) {{is subjected to}} a steaming or <b>parboiling</b> process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.|$|E
50|$|The rice is rinsed a {{few times}} in water and drained until the water turns from milky to clear. The rice should be soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking. The unsoaked rice takes 25 minutes to <b>parboil,</b> whereas the soaked grains take only 15 minutes. Rice should be {{parboiled}} till al dente. Remove the pot from the flame and transfer the rice in a sieve to drain the boiling water. Then transfer the rice back into the pot, and cover it with a lid, to prevent the steam from escaping. Cook the rice in its own steam at the lowest flame possible for a few minutes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Even {{the careful}} GPU {{programmer}} can inadvertently introduce data races while writing and optimizing code. Currently available GPU race checking methods fall short either {{in terms of}} their formal guarantees, ease of use, or practicality. Existing symbolic methods: (1) do not fully support existing CUDA kernels; (2) may require user-specified assertions or invariants; (3) often require users to guess which inputs may be safely made concrete; (4) tend to explode in complexity when the number of threads is increased; and (5) explode in the face of thread-ID based decisions, especially in a loop. We present SESA, a new tool combining Symbolic Execution and Static Analysis to analyze C++ CUDA programs that overcomes all these limitations. SESA also scales well to handle non-trivial benchmarks such as <b>Parboil</b> and Lonestar, and is the only tool of its class that handles such practical examples. This paper presents SESA’s methodological innovations and practical results...|$|R
500|$|A {{lethal dose}} of gyromitrin has been {{estimated}} to be 10–30mg/kg for children and 20–50mg/kg in adults. These doses correspond to around [...] and [...] of fresh mushroom respectively. However, individual responses may vary {{and people who have}} ingested similar amounts may develop anything from minimal to severe toxicity. Evidence suggests that children are more severely affected; it is unclear whether this is due to a larger weight consumed per body mass ratio or to differences in enzyme and metabolic activity. Although the amount of gyromitrin present can be significantly reduced through <b>parboiling,</b> there is evidence that repeated consumption can increase risk of toxicity.|$|E
500|$|The {{bitter taste}} does {{disappear}} on cooking {{and it is}} said to then be edible, though consumption is not recommended. The mushroom used to be widely eaten in eastern European countries and Russia after <b>parboiling</b> (which removes the toxins), and then salting or pickling. In some regions of Hungary and Slovakia, the cap cuticle is removed and used as a spice for goulash. [...] Both the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) and the American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are known to forage for, store and eat R.emetica. Other creatures that have been documented consuming the mushroom include the snail Mesodon thyroidus, several species of slugs (including Arion ater, A.subfuscus, A.intermedius, [...] Limax maximus, L.cinereoniger, and Deroceras reticulatum), the fruit flies Drosophila falleni and D.quinaria, and the fungus gnat Allodia bipexa.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{described}} by some mycologists as inedible or even poisonous, Lactifluus piperatus {{is generally considered}} edible. However, it is not recommended by some, because of its unpleasant taste. It is difficult to digest when eaten raw, but {{is used as a}} seasoning when dried, or sometimes is eaten fresh after <b>parboiling,</b> though its taste is still unappetising. Some recommend frying in butter with bacon and onion or pickling, or baking in a pie or pastry as other ways to prepare it. The milk has a very hot and acrid taste, which is removed if boiled. The mushroom used to be highly regarded in Russia, where it would be picked in dry seasons when other edible species were less available. The mushroom is also popular in Finland, where cooks boil it repeatedly, disposing of the water each time, and then store it in salt water and keep it refrigerated, after which it is pickled or served in salads. When eaten fresh and raw, the mushroom has been known to cause an irritant reaction on the lips and tongue, which subsides after an hour. The close L. glaucescens has been reported to be poisonous, but it has been speculated that the [...] "poisonings" [...] were caused by the extremely strong, peppery taste, rather than by the presence of actual poisons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{effective}} technique for crosschecking a C or C++ program against an accelerated OpenCL version, {{as well as}} a technique for detecting data races in OpenCL programs. Our techniques are implemented in KLEE-CL, a symbolic execution engine based on KLEE and KLEE-FP that supports symbolic reasoning on the equivalence between symbolic values. Our approach is to symbolically model the OpenCL environment using an OpenCL runtime library targeted to symbolic execution. Using this model we are able to run OpenCL programs symbolically, keeping track of memory accesses for the purpose of race detection. We then compare the symbolic result against the plain C or C++ implementation in order to detect mismatches between the two versions. We applied KLEE-CL to the <b>Parboil</b> benchmark suite, the Bullet physics library and the OP 2 library, in which we were able to find a total of seven errors: two mismatches between the OpenCL and C implementations, three memory errors, one OpenCL compiler bug and one race condition. ...|$|R

The vision is that a similar approach would also provide encouraging results for power efficiency in GPUs. In this thesis we have analyzed the power and performance characteristics of GPU at different frequencies. To help us achieve that, we have made a set of  microbenchmarks with different levels of memory boundedness and threads.

500|$|The edibility of {{this species}} is questionable; {{although}} Verpa bohemica is eaten by many, consumption of large amounts in a single sitting, or on successive days, {{has been reported to}} cause poisoning in susceptible individuals. Symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination, similar to the effects reported by some individuals after consuming the false morel species Gyromitra esculenta. The responsible toxin in G.esculenta is gyromitrin; it is suspected that V.bohemica may be able to synthesize low levels of the toxin. Over-consumption of the mushroom has been reported to have induced a coma. Those who do wish to eat this species are often advised to <b>parboil</b> with copious quantities of water (discarding the water before consumption), to dry the specimens before eating, or, if eating for the first time, to restrict consumption to small portions to test their tolerance. Some advocate only eating the caps and discarding the stems. Opinions on the flavor of the mushrooms vary, ranging from [...] "strong but not on a par with true morels", to [...] "pleasant", to [...] "not distinctive".|$|R
40|$|As modern GPUs rely {{partly on}} their on-chip {{memories}} {{to counter the}} imminent off-chip memory wall, the efficient use of their caches has become important for performance and energy. However, optimising cache locality system-atically requires insight into and prediction of cache be-haviour. On sequential processors, stack distance or reuse distance theory is a well-known means to model cache be-haviour. However, it is not straightforward to apply this theory to GPUs, {{mainly because of the}} parallel execution model and fine-grained multi-threading. This work extends reuse distance to GPUs by modelling: 1) the GPU’s hier-archy of threads, warps, threadblocks, and sets of active threads, 2) conditional and non-uniform latencies, 3) cache associativity, 4) miss-status holding-registers, and 5) warp divergence. We implement the model in C++ and extend the Ocelot GPU emulator to extract lists of memory addresses. We compare our model with measured cache miss rates for the <b>Parboil</b> and PolyBench/GPU benchmark suites, showing a mean absolute error of 6 % and 8 % for two cache config-urations. We show that our model is faster and even more accurate compared to the GPGPU-Sim simulator. 1...|$|R
