5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation,</b> and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander {{around looking for}} thinner skin such as is found on the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> inhibitor.|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{myocardial}} <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregations</b> in the coronary microvascula-ture {{of normal}} and of naturally occurring hypertrophied myocardia {{have been documented}} after ischemia and reperfusion. Eleven normal canine (group I) hearts underwent an isolated cardiac bypass preparation and were compared with 5 myocardia (Group II) hypertrophied by congenital aortic stenosis. All 16 hearts experienced transient ischemia during the isolated cardiac bypass and produced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregations</b> (111 In tagged: p < 0. 05). Hypothermic (25 &deg;C) potassium crystalloid cardioplegia did not wash out these depositions, and {{with the onset of}} reperfusion, both platelet and erythrocyte (99 mTc tagged) radioactiv-ity profoundly increased (p= 0. 0101). These increases progressed during the hour of reperfusion (p = 0. 0369) and, specifically, in the endocardium. In summary, intracoronary platelets are activated after transient ischemic episodes, in particular the vulnerable hypertrophied myocardium in naturally occurring aortic stenotic hearts. These ischemia-activated <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregations</b> persist despite the application of hypothermic crystalloid cardioplegia. These depositions, in turn, allowed an ongoing pattern of <b>platelet</b> and erythrocyte <b>aggregations</b> during the reperfusion period. These data have important clinical implications for myocardial protection and reperfusion during acute myocar-dial ischemia and infarction for the normal and hypertrophied myocardium...|$|R

5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. <b>Platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation)</b> or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{the link}} between venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) is still uncertain. In 2003 Prandoni et al published the first study that reported a connection, in term of etiopathogenesis between VTE and atherosclerosis. During {{the last few years}} several other study confirm this association, that could be attributed to common risk factors for the two conditions. The contribution of thrombophilic defects to {{the link between}} VTE and ATE has yet to be defined. Thrombophilic conditions (hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C and antithrombin) have been recognized as most potent thrombophilic conditions for VTE. Whether hereditary protein S, Protein C or antithrombin deficiency also are involved in the development of ATE need to be confirmed and the evidence of a possible association has been showed mainly from case reports. Blood haemostasis is a complex mechanism influenced from coagulation factors, aggregation proteins, blood cells (platelets, leucocytes) and vascular endothelium. Most of biochemical tests focused on coagulation system asses only a part of this complex mechanism and, in particular, the laboratory tests analyze only the coagulations cascade. But the role of platelets and vascular endothelium is not clear. The contribution of thrombophilic defects as common risk factor between VTE and ATE has yet to be defined compared with nondeficient family members. Moreover in this study the endothelial dysfunction could be the real cause for both conditions VTE and ATE. There are no data concerning the role of platelets function or vascular endothelium function in this thrombophilic patients population. The aim of the study is to define, in thrombophilic patients (Prot C, Prot S and antithrombin defects) compared with non-deficient family members. the role of platelets function using a new analyzer named Multiplate® whole blood aggregometry that evaluated <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregations</b> in whole blood and to define also the possible implication of endothelial function, by the non-invasive assessment of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, by B-mode ultrasonography, using a standardized procedure Material and Methods: after signing an informed consent, we enrolled patients with thrombophilic defects (cases) and create three subgroups (cases with deficit of protein C, protein S and antithrombin) with and without a history of thromboembolic disease, and subjects without thrombophilic defects (controls). We collected baseline data of all (cases and controls) on previous episodes of VTE and ATE, risk factors for atherosclerosis (i. e. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking; hyperlipidemia) All patients were tested for thrombophilic defects in addition to their index deficiencies (FV Leiden, G 20210 A prothrombin, lupus anticoagulant; PC and PS, AT). Moreover, we study <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregations</b> with a new analyzer named Multiplate® whole blood aggregometry that evaluated <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregations</b> in whole blood with thrombin inibitor (irudin); this instrument identify the electrical impedance (as area under curve, AUC) caused from <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregation.</b> The <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregation</b> was triggered by different activators: adenosine- 5 diphosphate (ADP test), arachidonic acid (ASPI test) and thrombin receptor activatin peptide (TRAP - 6) All cases and controls underwent evaluation of endothelial function by the non-invasive assessment of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, by B-mode ultrasonography, using a standardized procedure. Results: patients with thromphilic defects versus controls have similar demographical charatistics. The valutation of the <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregation</b> by Multiplate® with different tests (ASPI, ADP and TRAP) show a different in the two groups but it is no statistically significant; we observed the same results if analyze the three subgroups (Protein C defects, Protein S and antithrombin deficiency) protein separately.

30|$|Heparin: Heparin (mucopolysaccharide) is an acidic {{proteoglycan}} and a {{major component}} of MCs for neutralizing the alkaline mediators such as histamine and serotonin within the MCs granules. Upon MCs degranulation, heparin is released to inhibit blood coagulation. Analyses of relevant data suggest that protamine, an inhibitor of heparin-dependent activation of proteases (β-tryptase) from MCs also contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Histamine-heparin actions on <b>platelets</b> <b>aggregation</b> during vascular permeability could be quite important, particularly with regard to cancer drugs-induced venous thromboembolism and related complications that are often life-threatening and require additional treatments.|$|R

50|$|Protectin DX (PDX; i.e. 10R,17S-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) is the 13Z,15E,19Z isomer of NPD1 (which has the 13E,15Z,19Z {{double bond}} configuration)(see {{specialized}} proresolving mediators#Protectins/neuroprotectins). An early study mistakenly used PDX instead of PD1 in attributing anti-replicative and clinically beneficial effects in viral influenza disease in a mouse model to PD1. PDX also inhibits influx of circulating leukocytes into the peritoneum in a mouse model of inflammation. PDX has other anti-inflammatory actions. It inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 thereby blocking {{the formation of}} pro-inflammatory prostaglandins; it also inhibits the platelet-aggregating action of thromboxane A2 thereby blocking the <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregations</b> responses to agents that depend on platelets to release thromboxane A2.|$|R
