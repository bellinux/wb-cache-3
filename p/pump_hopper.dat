40|$|Changes in the {{air content}} of fresh {{concrete}} that is being pumped can occur {{at a number of}} places. These locations include the initial loading of the concrete into the <b>pump</b> <b>hopper,</b> as it passes through the pump line, and when it exits the line. This synthesis reviews the findings of recent research studies which deal with air content change in pumped concrete and summarizes methods of reducing air loss caused by handling. Three main mechanisms by which air content is lost in fresh concrete that is being pumped have been noted. These factors include the high-pressure dissolution of air voids, the bursting of air voids by vacuum, and the loss of air content due to impact force. Entrained air content can be retained by proper attention to the pump operation and set-up. Keeping steeply descending sections of pump line to a minimum, using kinks, elbows, or reducers {{at the end of the}} line to slow the rate of concrete flow, and pumping the concrete at the lowest pressure possible will keep air content losses to a minimum. Further beneficial actions include not allowing rain water to enter the pump’s hopper, and minimizing the distance that the concrete must fall from the end of the pump line to the placement surface. Testing the air content of concrete at the point of placement will yield the most indicative results of the concrete in the finished structure...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{literature}} on quality {{management in the}} construction industry asserts that ISO 9000, a standard established in 1987 and drastically upgraded in 2000, has not been embraced as a holistic approach to improve overall performance. It is felt that management’s insistence on “punch-list inspection” creates barriers to adopting Total Quality Management (TQM), a model that fosters a culture of constant improvement. This research project studies the efficacy of quality as a catalyst to eliminate wasted construction process resources caused by ineffective inter-organizational supply-chain. The literature review showed that process planning and simulation in constructions still builds on the reactive Input-Process-Output (IPO) model found unfit to model the proactive management of supply-chain based quality (SCQ). The need for a feed-forward control approach required the introduction of process resource (Input) quality and causality functions predicting the quality of the output. Thus, the developed model, affirming the importance of feed-forward over feed-back control, was built on measuring quality as a function of process waste generation along the construction supply-chain. Referred to as Supply-Chain Dynamic Quality Control (SC-DQC), it extends the output oriented process model to pursue a continuous improvement of the agile construction operations. A construction site at Kensington, NSW was selected, to test the model while evaluating improvements and barriers to its implementation in the real world of construction. After extensive field observations and discussions with the contractors, two universal material supplies were selected for experimental studies: 1) Concrete Placement and 2) Rebar Installation. Both test cases exhibited poor supply chain quality and information sharing, albeit with different consequences. In a first phase, feed-forward control technologies and methods were designed and field-tested to prove the hypotheses predicting technical feasibilities and measurable improvements. Ruggedized Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) to the flowing concrete as five trucks emptied their drums into a <b>pump</b> <b>hopper</b> after laboratory pre-tests. A RFID reader not only detected fourteen out of the fifteen embedded tags, but a tag’s readability increased with the decreasing water-content indicating the curing of the concrete. While RFID tags attached to rebar bundles opened up new information channels along the supply chain, the significant improvements resulted from feed-forwarding ‘process intelligence’ into the rebar fabrication shop ensuring a high quality delivery process. The comparative field experiments proved the drastic effect of DQC on the work efficiency of placing rebar for the test beams. The high supply quality ensured by the Master Bundle (MSB) concept allowed the steel fixers to increase their productive time from 31 % to 77. 4 %. As expected, this radical change was accompanied by a drastic reduction of process waste from 41. 5 % to 6. 2 % and contributory work from 19. 7 % to 10. 5 %. The relevance of the presented research lies in complying scientific evidence that the DQC model, built on a proactive and holistic management philosophy, targets the elimination of process wastes caused by poor quality supply processes. The realization of the substantial improvements will rest on the industry’s ability to adopt mutually supportive relationships and agile communication across the supply chain...|$|E
50|$|When {{used with}} a vacuum <b>pump</b> and <b>hopper,</b> an inline shear mixer {{can be a very}} {{effective}} way to incorporate powders into liquid streams. Otherwise known as high-shear powder inductors, these systems have the advantage of keeping the process on the floor level instead of working with heavy bags on mezzanines. High-shear powder induction systems also offer easy interchangeability with multiple tanks.|$|R
40|$|Dredging is {{the process}} of {{excavation}} of sediment, usually carried out underwater, with the purpose of the collection of the excavated sediment, such as sand, and subsequently its disposition at another location. In {{order to be able to}} predict the performance of dredging equipment, such as dredging <b>pumps</b> and <b>hoppers,</b> a two-phase numerical flow simulation method has been developed for conditions for which the volume fraction of the solid volume fraction (sand) is high. The method is based on the equations for the two-fluid model. The flow field is described by the conservation equations of mass and momentum for the solid phase (sand) and for the fluid phase (water), in combination with constitutive relations that describe the behaviour of the sand-water mixture, implemented in the commercial CFD-code Ansys CFX 14. 0. The viscosity of suspensions has been analysed experimentally, utilizing a concentric cylinder rheometer. In the experimental work, carried out with neutrally buoyant particles, parameters that determine the behaviour of the suspension have been varied, using the same particulate and liquid material for all experiments. The solid volume fraction, particle diameter, liquid viscosity, and shear rate, have been varied systematically. An investigation has been carried out into a model for the particle pressure, required to model the formation of a particle bed when the volume fraction of the particles reaches its maximum obtainable value. Dredging is often carried out by ships, storing the sediment in a large hold called a hopper. A sand-water mixture is taken from the bottom of the dredging site and <b>pumped</b> into the <b>hopper.</b> As an example of the application of the developed simulation method, the flow in a hopper during the filling process is considered. A parameter study has been carried out by varying the flow conditions at the inlet of the hopper: velocity at the inlet, solid volume fraction at the inlet and particle diameter of the incoming suspension. The results show how these parameters affect the filling curve of the hopper, defined as the total mass of sand present inside the hopper as function of time...|$|R
