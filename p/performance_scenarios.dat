40|$|Objectives: The present {{research}} sought to examine changes in psychological momentum (PM) during sport competitions {{through the lens}} of a dynamical systems approach. Design: Male regional-level cyclists competed in cycling duels on home trainers. Method: Images of moving avatars of the cyclists were projected on a wall, and were manipulated so that one cyclist was exposed to an ascending <b>performance</b> <b>scenario</b> (i. e., positive momentum) and the other to a descending <b>performance</b> <b>scenario</b> (i. e., negative momentum). Every 3 min, the cyclists answered PM items by using a keyboard that was placed on the handlebars of their bicycles. Additionally, exerted power was continuously recorded. Results: Results revealed an asymmetrical critical boundary pattern for PM perceptions indicating that negative PM was triggered more easily than positive PM. Exerted power was generally higher during the negative momentum scenario than during the positive momentum scenario. In addition, exerted power slowly decreased over both momentum scenarios, and this decrease was faster {{at the very beginning of}} the negative momentum scenario. Conclusion: Results indicate that PM perceptions possess the dynamical properties of nonlinearity and history-dependence. Moreover, the finding that exerted power was higher in the negative momentum scenario was interpreted as a resistance behavior that occurs while experiencing negative momentum. The anticipated decreases in both exerted power and PM perceptions in the negative momentum scenario converge to support the notion that negative PM is a stronger attractor than positive PM. The present study confirms that PM is a dynamical phenomenon and offers fruitful avenues for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|In October of 1960, Jackson Mac Low {{created a}} system for {{generating}} poems called Asymmetries. The system evolved from his earlier chance poems to create a situation where poems could be “self-generating. ” Over time, the system itself evolved, generating poems of endlessly varying content, {{each with its own}} self-contained features that could be translated into performance. These features were described in detail by Mac Low in his instructions for performance. However, like his poem-generating system, these instructions also evolved over time. Mac Low’s Asymmetries can be approached from many vantage points: as a reader, listener, performer; through a solo performance or simultaneity; through the original or evolved instructions; or through Mac Low’s copious documentation. Exploring these vantage points generates an evolution in one’s understanding of the poems and their openness or limits {{in the context of the}} many formats in which they can be realized. Where are the limits to Mac Low’s extraordinarily contingent compositional and <b>performance</b> <b>scenarios?</b> How do Mac Low’s countless <b>performance</b> <b>scenarios</b> impact the work’s identity?

40|$|Abstract—Variability in network {{performance}} {{is a major}} obstacle in effectively analyzing the throughput of modern high performance computer systems. High performance interconnection networks offer excellent best-case network latencies; however, highly parallel applications running on parallel machines typically require consistently high levels of performance to adequately leverage the massive amounts of available computing power. Performance analysts have usually quantified {{network performance}} using traditional summary statistics that assume the observational data is sampled from a normal distribution. In our examinations of network performance, we have found this method of analysis often provides too little data to understand anomalous network performance. In particular, we examine a multimodal <b>performance</b> <b>scenario</b> encountered with an Infiniband interconnection network and we explore the performance repeatability on the custom Cray SeaStar 2 interconnection network after a set of software and driver updates...|$|R
