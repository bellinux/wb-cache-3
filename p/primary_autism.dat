40|$|We have {{previously}} described linkage/association between reelin gene polymorphisms and autistic disorder. APOE also {{participates in the}} Reelin signaling pathway, by competitively antagonizing Reelin binding to APOE receptor 2 and to very-low-density lipoprotein receptors. The APOE 2 protein variant displays the lowest receptor binding affinity compared with APOE 3 and APOE 4. In this study, we assess linkage/association between <b>primary</b> <b>autism</b> and APOE alleles in 223 complete trios, from 119 simplex Italian families and 44 simplex and 29 multiplex Caucasian-American families. Statistically significant disequilibrium favors the transmission of epsilon 2 alleles to autistic offspring, over epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 (allele-wise transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT], chi(2) = 6. 16, 2 degrees of freedom [d. f. ], P < 0. 05; genotype-wise TDT, chi(2) = 10. 68, 3 d. f., P < 0. 05). A novel epsilon 3 r allele was also discovered in an autistic child and his mother. Autistic patients do not differ significantly from unaffected siblings (allele-wise TDT comparing autistic patients versus unaffected sibs, chi(2) = 1. 83, 2 d. f., P < 0. 40, not significant). The major {{limitation of this study}} consists of our small sample size of trios including one unaffected sibling, currently not possessing the statistical power necessary to conclusively discriminate a specific association of epsilon 2 with autism, from a distorted segregation pattern characterized by enhanced epsilon 2 transmission rates both to affected and unaffected offspring. Our findings are thus compatible with either (a) pathogenetic contributions by epsilon 2 alleles to autism spectrum vulnerability, requiring additional environmental and/or genetic factors to yield an autistic syndrome, and/or (b) a protective effect of epsilon 2 alleles against the enhanced risk of miscarriage and infertility previously described among parents of autistic children.

40|$|There is a {{reciprocal}} {{relationship between the}} study of language disorders and research in normal language development. Recent studies in normal acquisition {{have led to a}} model of language devel-opment that includes not only lin-guistic achievements, but the de-velopment of social and cognitive abilities that lay the basis for the transition from prelinguistic com-munication to the use of conven-tional forms. This model has been applied to the study of develop-mental disorders of language learning. Such a model allows the more puzzling disorders of lan-guage development, such as child-hood aphasia and <b>primary</b> <b>autism,</b> to be placed in a framework that predicts language disruption when underlying perceptual, cog-nitive, or social abilities are lacking. Assessment procedures that can be drawn from the model of language disorders are pre-sented. It is argued that the study of these disabilities is important in the building of theoretical models of intact language proc-essing that specify more precisely the contribution of underlying skills to overall functioning. Questions for future research that serve this reciprocal purpose are discussed. One of the most frequent present-ing problems in children referred for developmental disorders of any kind is a delay in the acquisition of language. Failure to talk at the ap-propriate age may be the first sig-nal that alerts parents to the fact that their child is different from other children, or it may be the culmination of a long period of vague suspicion that there is something "funny " about the child. In both cases, it is very often the child's lack of speech that finally impels the parents to seek professional help. Psycholinguistic research into these failures in language acquisi-tion has been of interest not only to those who deal with communi-catively impaired youngsters, but also to theorists concerned with the nature of language and the normal course of its developmen...|$|E

40|$|At {{six weeks}} an infant makes eye-contact {{with the mother}} thereby {{stimulating}} her containing behavior (she meets and regulates her infants needs). Eye-contact enables the subsequent development of intersubjectivity. To accomplish reliable eye-contact, the infant must acquire {{an image of the}} mothers eyes. Once acquired, this image becomes associated with containment. The acquisition of this image is therefore a crucial very-early step in psychological development. Evidence for these assertions comes from (1) analyses of patients with early narcissistic injuries, (2) the evolutionary development of the appearance of the primate eye and of its signaling function, (3) experiments on infant visual preferences, and (4) observation of nursing mothers. Existing developmental models have not addressed the acquisition of the image of the eye. A variety of biological predispositions or injuries, together with congenital blindness and severe infant deprivation, all increase the risk of failure to acquire this image. The likely result is a pervasive cascade of developmental failure. Failure to acquire this image might, therefore, represent the <b>primary</b> deficit in <b>autism.</b> Like narcissism and neurosis, the <b>primary</b> deficit in <b>autism</b> may be psychological. This model suggests that autism may be investigated via the analyses of high-functioning patients with mild autistic symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) is a {{class of}} complex neurodevelopmental disabilities that are characterized by the presence and severity of stereotyped behaviors, impaired communication, and abnormal social interactions. The incidence of autism has rapidly increased to 1 in 88 children in the United States, making ASD {{one of the most}} significant medical and social burdens of our time. However, drugs are often used to treat autism-related conditions, including anxiety, hyperactivity, epilepsy, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and therapies for treating the core symptoms of autism are limited. Moreover, molecular diagnostics are not available for the reproducible identification of ASD; as yet, the disorder is diagnosed based on standardized behavioral assessments. Much research into ASD has focused on genetic, behavioral, and neurological aspects of the illness. However, primary roles for environmental risk factors and peripheral disruptions, such as immune dysregulation and gastrointestinal distress, have gained significant attention. The work described in this thesis uncovers molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of autism-related endophenotypes in a mouse model of a <b>primary</b> <b>autism</b> risk factor, maternal immune activation (MIA). MIA is founded upon the strong epidemiological link between maternal infection and increased autism risk in the offspring. This risk factor can be translated to a mouse model with face and construct validity for autism, wherein pregnant mice injected with the immunogenic, double-stranded RNA poly(I:C) yield offspring with the core behavioral and neuropathological features of autism. Specifically, we report that MIA critically alters placental immune status and endocrine function, reflecting a key pathway by which fetal development may be disrupted to manifest in ASD-related phenotypes. We identify signature changes to the fetal brain transcriptome in response to multiple modes of MIA, highlighting a converging pathway involved in the development of autism-related behaviors and neuropathologies. We characterize peripheral, neural, and enteric immune alterations in MIA offspring and uncover an immune contribution to autism-related behavioral abnormalities. Finally we demonstrate that a microbe-based therapeutic can ameliorate intestinal pathology, metabolic function, and autism-related behaviors in MIA mice, which supports a role for the gut-immune-brain axis in ASD. ...|$|E

40|$|Autism {{represents}} a pervasive cascade of developmental (psychological) failures. Therefore the <b>primary</b> deficit in <b>autism,</b> the necessary and sufficient cause, {{should be a}} very early psychological failure. Genes and other biological factors linked to autism are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause autism. Nor could biological factors have changed quickly enough to account for recent changes {{in the incidence of}} autism. Biological factors must work indirectly, by increasing the probability of the primary deficit. Brain differences may be secondary to early social deprivation. The personality, like all other dynamic systems, must self-organize from a few simple components. I summarize in this paper some of the evidence that a very early step in the self-organization of the personality is the internalization of the image of the mother's eyes. I propose that failure to internalize that image is the <b>primary</b> deficit in <b>autism.</b> Recent dramatic increases in the incidence of autism coincide with dramatic increases in the very early use of non-maternal child care including TV, video and computer games. Reduced exposure to the mother's gaze would mitigate against internalizing the image of the mother's eyes. My hypothesis predicts that autism is statistically linked to early non-maternal child care. This prediction has implications for preventing autism. It should be confirmed or refuted by the current Norwegian-American study, The Autism Birth Cohort...|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{with autism}} {{experience}} specific deficits {{in the area}} of executive function. A differentiated view of executive function was recently described by Metcalfe and Mishel, in which a distinction was made between hot, affective components and cold more purely cognitive, non-affective components. The "Hot/Cold" distinction of executive function was examined in a group of children with autism in relation to a group of typically developing children matched on verbal, pattern and Leiter mental ages. Two hot (Gamble and Delay of Gratification) and two cold tasks (DCCS and SOP) were administered. Children with autism successfully completed fewer trials of the SOP, irrespective of the matching variable, and experienced more difficulty switching rules on the DCCS in relation to typically developing children when matched on non-verbal and performance mental ages. No differences were found on the hot executive function tasks, except for the group matched on VMA. These findings underscore the importance of using multiple matching groups in the study of persons with autism, and provide evidence for cold rather than hot executive function deficits as a <b>primary</b> in <b>autism...</b>|$|R

40|$|Autism {{results from}} a {{pervasive}} cascade of developmental failure. Prevailing {{theory is that the}} <b>primary</b> deficit in <b>autism</b> (<b>primary</b> cause of the cascade) is a biological or genetic abnormality in the brain. This paper challenges that theory. Though a primary cause should be both necessary and sufficient, none of the biological or genetic factors which are statistically linked to autism is either necessary or sufficient to cause autism. Another objection derives from the logic of cascades. A cascade’s primary cause is the same in kind as the events which comprise the cascade. Autism is a cascade of psychological failures. The associated biological and genetic factors must, I argue, increase the incidence of a primary psychological deficit. I hypothesize: (1) The acquisition of the image of the mother’s eye is a critical very early step in development. Because the image symbolizes psychological containment, it is an essential element in the self-organization of the personality. (2) Failure to acquire (or retain) that image is the <b>primary</b> deficit in <b>autism.</b> I show that these hypotheses are consistent with Holland’s paradigm of self-organization in complex adaptive systems. The paper uses clinical data to illustrate the hypotheses. It then synthesizes evidence from experiments on infant vision, from Stern’s observations of infant-mother pairs, and from observations on the incidence of autism in infants with cranial nerve palsy, or congenital blindness, or severe early deprivation. To this it links evidence from studies of evolutionary changes in the primate eye and from experiments on the visual behavior of mildly autistic adults. Theories of a biological cause have been undermined by the recent dramatic increase (273 % from 1987 to 1998) in the incidence of autism in California. This increase was recently (October 2002) confirmed by Robert Byrd and co-workers; previously it had been widely dismissed as an artifact of measurement. The increase cannot be explained by genetic factors. It is unlikely that the physical, chemical or biological environment in California deteriorated sufficiently in one decade to account for such a large increase. It is more likely that a change in social behavior (affecting a psychological factor) could be sufficiently rapid. Because of the significance to public health of the rapid increase in autism, there {{is likely to be a}} vigorous new effort to identify its cause(s). The problem should be debated across disciplinary lines. This paper is a timely contribution to that debate. If the primary deficit is psychological then, to some extent, research should be redirected towards exploring autism at the psychological level. Scientists may need to evaluate suggestions derived, for example, from psychoanalytic data. My paper attempts this difficult collaboration. It shows that the image-of-the-eye hypothesis leads to a testable prediction: that autism is statistically linked to the early use of daycare...|$|R

We focus our discussions on two <b>primary</b> issues: <b>autism</b> within cultural groups and multicultural family adaptation based on the framework of pluralistic soci-eties in which some cultural groups are a minority within the dominant culture. We found dif-ferences in prevalence rates across races for autism and little information regarding how multicultural families adapt to raising a child with autism.

40|$|Autism {{awareness}} {{has increased}} {{in recent years in}} part because it is marked by confusion and controversy. The confusion and controversy stem from {{the fact that there are}} many beliefs about autism but little agreement. In this dissertation I examined the rhetoric produced by three <b>primary</b> groups?professional <b>autism</b> experts, caregivers to children with autism and mainstream media. In particular, I studied how each group explains autism. Explanations are vehicles for persuasion; they advance particular viewpoints about an illness. I conducted a rhetorical analysis of the three discourses produced by these groups, highlighting the most cohesive themes to emerge from the discourse. To study professional autism experts? explanations, I analyzed articles in autism?s flagship research journal and research articles from other journals and key books for additional insight. A computer metaphor guided expert explanations of autism. To define autism through one of most advanced and culturally accepted technological devices lent significant credibility to the explanations. Next, I studied the caregiver explanations, first conducting interviews with 19 parents to children with autism and then I analyzed the transcripts. Caregivers described autism as a social pathology; their children with autism were different and distant, or alien-like. The pathology affected people with autism, their caregivers and their families, many other neuro-typical people, and it also determined the course of treatment for the person with autism. Finally, mainstream media often explained autism in terms of its conflicts, framing its explanations of autism with a war metaphor. The vaccine debate received a significant attention, recharacterizing the role of medical institutions and health practitioners. Caregivers became the heroes, using their personal experiences as weapons against healthcare practitioners and their science. Caregivers also dealt with the invasion of autism, struggling for ways to return their children closer to the boundary that exists between the child with autism and the neuro-typical child...|$|R

We adopted the approach of developmental psychopathology. Matched groups of typically developing, autistic and non-autistic retarded (MR) children and adolescents were tested for the ability to recognize videotaped representations of 'a person', a persons actions and a person's emotion-related attitudes and allied subjective states as manifest in moving point-light images of people. Autistic and non-autistic MR participants d d not differ in the ability to recognize that a person was represented in very brief exposures of a walking point-light display; autistic, MR and typically developing participants were equally able to recognize a person's actions. Non-autistic MR and typically developing participants were also similar in their propensity to notice a person's attitudes vis-à-vis the person's actions, and in their abilities to recognize actions and attitudes when specifically asked to do so. By comparison, however, autistic participants were specifically impaired in attending to and discriminating people's attitudes and states.

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder is {{characterized}} by sensory anomalies including impaired olfactory identification. 30 % of individuals with autism have a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) is central to olfactory identification and is an epileptogenic structure. Cytoarchitectural changes in olfactory cortex may underlie olfactory differences seen in <b>autism.</b> <b>Primary</b> olfactory cortex was sampled from 17 post-mortem autism cases with and without epilepsy, 11 epilepsy cases without autism and 11 typically developed cases. Stereological and neuropathological methods were used to quantify glial, pyramidal and non-pyramidal cell densities in layers of the piriform as well as identify pathological differences {{in this area and}} its neighbouring region, the olfactory tubercle. We found increased layer II glial cell densities in autism with and without epilepsy, which were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with levels of corpora amylacea in layer I. These changes were also associated with greater symptom severity and did not extend to the olfactory tubercle. Glial cell organisation may follow an altered trajectory of development with age in autism. The findings are consistent with other studies implicating increased glial cells in the autism brain. Altered cytoarchitecture may contribute to sensory deficits observed in affected individuals. This study provides evidence that autism is linked to alterations in the cytoarchitectural structure that underlies primary sensory processes and is not restricted to heteromodal ('higher') cognitive centres.

These cases were referred for neurological phenotypes including language impairment, developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy. Six further cases with a <b>primary</b> diagnosis of <b>autism</b> spectrum disorder (ASD) and similar secondary phenotypes were identiﬁed with ELP 4 deletions, as well as another six (out of nine) with neurodevelopmental phenotypes from DECIPHER. CNVs at ELP 4 were only present in 1 / 11, 252 controls. We found a signiﬁcant excess of CNVs in discovery cases compared with controls, P = 7. 5 × 10 − 3, as well as for autism, P = 2. 7 × 10 − 3. Our results suggest that ELP 4 deletions are highly likely to be pathogenic, predisposing to a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes from ASD to language impairment and epilepsy...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} incidence and awareness of autism spectrum disorders in recent years. Improved outcomes due to early intervention and continued assistance throughout the school years have created the need for ongoing support for adults on the autism spectrum. Recent advances in computer technology {{and understanding of the}} human brain offer the possibility that specific computer based training may provide a cost effective means to deliver this necessary support. The affinity of individuals with autism towards all things computer combined with the limited side effects and availability anywhere, anytime, are a winning combination. This case study examined to what extent, if any, training software produces improvements in the language and social skills of a bilingual, young adult who has <b>autism.</b> <b>Primary</b> focus was on working memory, sequencing, and facial recognition. This study involved pre and post testing, using real-world tasks, to measure the effects of using the Posit Science computer based training programs designed to improve language and social skills. Results suggest that computer based training was beneficial for the participant in these areas. Previous research conducted in this field has been encouraging, but limited in scope or generalized from individuals with related neurological conditions. More research is needed in this area and it is recommended that software designed specifically for individuals with autism be developed and used. Larger populations and longer time commitments are also necessary to determine if programs like this could be beneficial for other individuals on the autism spectrum...|$|R
40|$|A project {{presented}} to the Department of Physician Assistant of Wichita State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Physician Assistant. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of a 10 -month treadmill walking program (TWP) on target behaviors (TB: maladaptive behaviors and/or stereotypic mannerisms) in adolescents and young adults with autism. Five youth (3 males, 2 females; 16. 6 + 1. 7 yrs) with a <b>primary</b> diagnosis of <b>autism</b> and diagnosed by clinical psychologists as having severe multiple developmental disabilities participated in this study. Participants were involved in a 10 -month TWP (10 - 25 min sessions; speeds 3. 3 - 7. 0 km•hr- 1, grades 0 - 2. 5 %) that was incorporated into their scheduled physical education curriculum 3 - 5 times per week. Participant’s were monitored 24 hours per day for their three TB. Each behavior was recorded using a tally system. A single-subject quasi-experimental ABÁ research design was used to evaluate each of the participants. In this design, phase A represented a 2 -month baseline stage in which behavior was collected but no treadmill was walking was performed. This was followed by a 10 -month treadmill walking program (phase B), then another 2 -month baseline stage (phase Á). Four of the five participants demonstrated effective results (ie, reduction in TB during phase B). Results of this study indicate that an exercise program (similar to the one in this study), introduced into the daily curriculum of persons with severe autism could positively affect their behavioral goals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Problems with {{reward system}} {{function}} have been posited as a <b>primary</b> difficulty in <b>autism</b> spectrum disorders. The current study examined an electrophysiological marker of feedback monitoring, the feedback-related negativity (FRN), during a monetary reward task. The study advanced prior understanding by focusing exclusively on a developmental sample, applying rigorous diagnostic characterization and introducing an experimental paradigm providing more subtly different feedback valence (reward versus non-reward instead of reward versus loss). Methods Twenty-six {{children with autism}} spectrum disorder and 28 typically developing peers matched on age and full-scale IQ played a guessing game resulting in monetary gain (“win”) or neutral outcome (“draw”). ERP components marking early visual processing (N 1, P 2) and feedback appraisal (FRN) were contrasted between groups in each condition, and their relationships to behavioral measures of social function and dysfunction, social anxiety, and autism symptomatology were explored. Results FRN was observed on draw trials relative to win trials. Consistent with prior research, children with ASD exhibited a FRN to suboptimal outcomes that was comparable to typical peers. ERP parameters were unrelated to behavioral measures. Conclusions Results {{of the current study}} indicate typical patterns of feedback monitoring in the context of monetary reward in ASD. The study extends prior findings of normative feedback monitoring to a sample composed exclusively of children and demonstrates that, as in typical development, individuals with autism exhibit a FRN to suboptimal outcomes, irrespective of neutral or negative valence. Results do not support a pervasive problem with reward system function in ASD, instead suggesting any dysfunction lies in more specific domains, such as social perception, or in response to particular feedback-monitoring contexts, such as self-evaluation of one’s errors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{research}} will explore {{the experiences of}} familial caregivers caring for a young person with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and psychosis or subclinical psychotic experiences. Psychosis is a mental health disorder defined as a loss of touch with reality, characterized by {{a specific set of}} negative and positive symptoms. Subclinical psychotic symptoms, as defined by Yung and Lim (2016), generally refer to sub-threshold forms of hallucinations and delusions, viewing psychotic experiences along an extended psychosis phenotype. This distinction is defined because it can be extremely difficult to discern between psychotic symptoms, and autistic features that are seemingly psychotic. Regardless of whether an individual has a diagnosis of definite psychosis, or subclinical psychotic experiences, these symptoms have a dramatic impact on the individual’s daily occupations, and the occupations of those who care for them. Process: A literature review will examine the current knowledge base surrounding young people with a <b>primary</b> diagnosis of <b>autism,</b> and a co-occurring psychosis or psychotic disorder. The review will discuss the prevalence and presentation of psychosis in youth with autism. Additionally, it will discuss the current insight into the experience of caring for a youth with the aforementioned conditions. The findings of the literature review will be used to inform the research proposal. Method: An interpretative phenomenological analysis is proposed to gain insight into the experience of familial caregivers caring for a young person with autism and a subsequent psychosis. The study will recruit 5 participants. The impact on familial carer’s ability to participate in meaningful occupations will be explored. Additionally, carer’s perceptions of service provision will be obtained, to generate a “bigger picture” of the caregiving experience. A semi-structured interview delivered by the researcher will be used to generate data...|$|R
