40|$|A recent {{trend to}} consume healthy foods {{has led to}} greater {{preference}} for natural food and raw vegetables. At the same time, concerns have increased about the microbiological risks of fresh produce. This thesis focusses on the microbiological risk assessment of fresh produce grown in organic and conventional farms and those sold by different retail shops in Christchurch. The incidence of foodborne outbreaks for fresh produce is estimated as 22. 8 % of the total foodborne illnesses in the USA and approximately 10 % of cases in NZ. To achieve microbiological food safety of produce, {{it is important to}} identify the current microbiological status of fresh produce. Many people prefere organic produce these days but there may be some risks associated with organic produce because many organic growers use animal faeces (manure) as an alternative to chemical fertilizer. Organic farms use different types of soil enrichment such as compost, manure and crop-livestock <b>rotation</b> <b>farming.</b> Crop-livestock <b>rotation</b> <b>farms</b> rotate land for crop farming and livestock farming every three to four years and do not require chemical fertilizers. There is little data about microbiological assessment comparing these different types of soil enrichments. Recent trends and factors affecting the microbiological contamination of fresh produce are reviewed in the first chapter, focussing on: 1) microbial contamination of fresh produce; 2) frequency of fresh produce related foodborne outbreaks; and 3) factors affecting microbial status of fresh produce. The second and third chapters investigate two main objectives: microbiological risk assessment of fresh produce grown in organic and conventional farms with different soil enrichment systems in Canterbury, New Zealand and microbiological risk assessment of fresh produce from different retail shops in Christchurch. The results of farms in this study showed that over a six week sampling period, there were significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the conventional farm vegetable samples and those of the organic farms for the average APC, coliform, yeast and mould and Staph. aureus, between the compost farm vegetable samples and those of the conventional <b>farm</b> and crop-livestock <b>rotation</b> <b>farm</b> for the average E. coli, and between the conventional farm silver beet samples and those of crop-livestock <b>rotation</b> <b>farm</b> for the E. coli. The fresh produce samples collected from different farms in Canterbury, New Zealand and acceptable levels for E. coli O 157 :H 7 (not detected) but not for APC, coliform, E. coli, Staph. aureus or Salmonella spp. For APC, 88 % samples had unsatisfactory levels for the organic farms and that of the conventional farm was 33 %. For coliform, 92 % samples had unsatisfactory levels for the organic farms and that of the conventional farm was 61 %. For E. coli, 92 % samples had unsatisfactory levels for the organic farms and that of the conventional farm was 88 %. For Staph. aureus, 21 % samples had satisfactory levels for the organic farms and that of the conventional farm was 50 % based on the FSANZ (2001) or PHLS (2000) guidelines for ready-to-eat foods. The yeast and mould levels (1. 78 – 6. 10 log 10 CFU/ml) were similar to studies previously reported for samples purchased in retail shops. Most Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. positive strains from farms and retail shops showed higher resistance to β-lactams. Similarly, the results of retail shops showed that over a six week sampling period, ppercent of unsatisfactory levels as per the guidelines given by FSANZ (2001) or PHLS (2000) varied within a retail shop. For APC, 75 - 87. 5 % samples had unsatisfactory levels and for coliform, 75 - 91. 7 % samples had unsatisfactory levels. For E. coli, 80 - 100 % samples had unsatisfactory levels, and for Staph. aureus, 17. 4 - 21. 7 % samples had unsatisfactory levels. However, these results and the yeast and mould (0 - 5. 23 lpg 10 CFU/ml) were similar to studies previously for samples purchased in retail shops, except for E. coli (83. 3 - 100 % of samples had E. coli). Vegetables from supermarket were less contaminated with E. coli than samples from other retail shops. However, retail shop B had the highest unsatisfactory levels of APC (87. 5 %), coliform (91. 7 %), E. coli (100 %) and Staph. aureus (21. 7 %) based on the the FSANZ (2001) or PHLS (2000) guidelines for ready-to-eat foods. Eight percent of samples from four different retail shops were positive for Salmonella spp. but no E. coli O 157 H 7 was detected. In conclusion, the extent of microbiological safety differed between shops. In addition, there was a tendency that the potential risks of fresh produce in some retail shops were identified. Between farms, the fresh produce collected from the organic farms was more contaminated with some microbes than produce from the conventional farm...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{certification}} costs {{represent an}} important competitive disadvantage for organic farming. A {{proportion of the}} higher costs of organic products may result from the costs of certification along the entire supply chain. A reduction of such transaction costs provides a basis for a general increase in organic farms competitiveness.

BNs are probabilistic models with a graphical interface, representing a network of a set of interconnected random variables, and provide a basis for influence diagrams based on conditional probabilities computations. The model implements a BN approach using risk factors – such as crop <b>rotation,</b> <b>farm</b> size, etc. – that are expected to influence risk of infraction. The model analyses the joint effects of different factors on the farmers’ probability of non-compliance. The study exploits a dataset based on data from Istituto Mediterraneo di Certificazione (IMC) for 2007.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the microbial risk of fresh produce collected from a compost <b>farm,</b> a crop-livestock <b>rotation</b> <b>farm</b> and a traditional farm in Canterbury, New Zealand. A total of 79 vegetable {{samples were collected}} from 3 different farming systems. No Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was detected, but 95, 92 and 44 % of the samples from the organic farm had unsatisfactory aerobic plate count (APC), E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus levels respectively compared to the traditional farm, with corresponding values of 66, 88 and 27 % based on guidelines for ready-to-eat foods. Resistance profiling showed that S. aureus and Salmonella spp. from all farms showed a higher resistance to vancomycin, erythromycin, ampicillin and penicillin antibiotics. The fresh produce collected from the organic farms was more contaminated with {{a wider range of}} pathogens than those from the traditional farm. Since the consumer perception of organic produce is because of its ‘chemical free’ status with little regard to the microbial status, it is prudent to conduct further studies to determine the type(s) of microbial hazards and how they behave under different climatic conditions and also address bacterial resistance to antibiotics in farming environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{protected}} vegetable {{farming is}} {{a style of}} high frequent <b>rotation</b> <b>farming</b> which requires {{a huge amount of}} fertilizers to maintain soil fertility. A total of 125 surface soils covering from east to west of China were sampled for the analysis of 17 antibiotics in order to identify antibiotics contamination caused by long-term manures application. The results indicate that the agricultural land has accumulated a statistically significantly higher antibiotics concentration than conventional open croplands. The maximum oxytetracycline concentration was 8400 mu g kg(- 1), the highest level that has ever been reported for oxytetracycline in soils. The residual concentration is decided by both plant duration and manure type. Short-term (< 5 years) planting shows the highest residues of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones in the soils. The organic farming characteristic of applying commercial compost as a single fertilizer in planting shows the lowest antibiotics residue in the soils on the whole. Principal component analysis suggests that the various combinations of antibiotic compounds in the soil may be used to trace the manure source. The antibiotics in soil may threaten water quality through contamination by diffusion. Ciprofloxacin and sulfachinoxalin are calculated to be a higher migration risk to surface waters, hence their environmental fate requires further study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{the debate on the}} {{contribution}} of organic agriculture to the future of world agriculture is whether organic agriculture can produce sufficient food to feed the world. Comparisons of organic and conventional yields {{play a central role in}} this debate. We therefore compiled and analyzed a meta-dataset of 362 published organic–conventional comparative crop yields. Our results show that organic yields of individual crops are on average 80 % of conventional yields, but variation is substantial (standard deviation 21 %). In our dataset, the organic yield gap significantly differed between crop groups and regions. The analysis gave some support to our hypothesis that the organic–conventional yield gap increases as conventional yields increase, but this relationship was only rather weak. The rationale behind this hypothesis is that when conventional yields are high and relatively close to the potential or water-limited level, nutrient stress must, as per definition of the potential or water-limited yield levels, be low and pests and diseases well controlled, which are conditions more difficult to attain in organic agriculture. We discuss our findings in the context of the literature on this subject and address the issue of upscaling our results to higher system levels. Our analysis was at field and crop level. We hypothesize that due to challenges in the maintenance of nutrient availability in organic systems at crop <b>rotation,</b> <b>farm</b> and regional level, the average yield gap between conventional and organic systems may be larger than 20 % at higher system levels. This relates in particular to the role of legumes in the <b>rotation</b> and the <b>farming</b> system, and to the availability of (organic) manure at the farm and regional levels. Future research should therefore focus on assessing the relative performance of both types of agriculture at higher system levels, i. e. the farm, regional and global system levels, and should in that context pay particular attention to nutrient availability in both organic and conventional agricultur...|$|R

40|$|Peanut {{and corn}} {{are two major}} crops in the tri-state area of the Southeast US, an area {{encompassing}} North Florida, Southwest Georgia, and Southeast Alabama. Sharecroppers in this region apply higher amount of input in crop production than the average farmers. We analyzed the behavior of sharecroppers in this region {{with regard to their}} fertilizer application decisions. Two hypotheses were formulated and tested based on sharecroppers' fertilizer application decisions: one assuming that sharecroppers are risk averse farmers and the other assuming that sharecroppers are regret minimizers. Our results show that a sharecropper uses different fertilizer treatments when minimizing risk depending on risk perspective and desired income. Sharecroppers who apply more fertilizer to obtain a desired level of income are regret minimizers where as sharecroppers who apply relatively low fertilizer are risk minimizer. At the same desired level of income, a regret minimizer farmer would apply a higher amount of fertilizer than the risk averse farmers. Our analysis revealed that sharecroppers in the Southeast US are regret minimizers as they apply a higher amount of fertilizer than an average farmer on the major crops grown in the region. The result of this study also confirms the result of a previous study in the region which reported that sharecroppers in the region are over capitalized and apply more fertilizer than average farmers.

40|$|Organic farming aims at {{establishing}} {{stable and}} harmonic farming systems, which integrate livestock and crop production. No industrial fertilisers, pesticides or growth regulators are used. The nutrient management {{is based on}} the use of animal manure, green manure, crop residues and on nitrogen fixation by legumes. Weeds, pests and diseases are controlled through the use of versatile crop rotations, mechanical weed control and a proper choice of varieties. The multifunctional crop rotation is thus a key component in organic farming. The design of these crop rotations is a major challenge for farmers as well as for agronomic research. The different aspects of crop rotations have been investigated by a range of methods, including long-term trials, factorial experiments and on-farm monitoring. However, there has been little effort into bringing these results and experiences together into a common understanding of the functioning of crop rotations and the methods by which they are best explored. In this context, there is a great need for international co-operation. A workshop on crop <b>rotations</b> for organic <b>farming</b> was therefore organised in Denmark in June 1999.

40|$|It was {{the task}} of the pioneers to 2 ̆ 2 subdue 2 ̆ 2 the land. To them, this meant {{removing}} the brush, opening the ditches, and reducing the coarse sod to a fine mellow seedbed. They performed their task. Then for one to three generations the sons, grandsons, and the great grandsons of the pioneers made the land feed them. The idea of 2 ̆ 2 subduing 2 ̆ 2 the land was so firmly established in the West, that few realized the soil was being depleted in a manner somewhat similar to a bank account always drawn on but never replenished. Highly productive land is able to stand such a drain for some time, while less productive land is depleted sooner.
