The rest of the ships had computer terminals that allowed the operators to use a trackball based on a Canadian five-pin bowling ball and trigger to send position info over the <b>PCM</b> <b>links</b> to the DATAR. DATAR then processed the locations, translated everything into the various ship's local view, and sent the data back to them over the same <b>PCM</b> <b>links.</b> Here it was displayed on another console originally adapted from a radar unit. In contrast with the United States Air Force's Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, DATAR did not develop tracks automatically, relying on the operators to continue feeding new data into the system by hand.|$|R

DATAR was a vacuum tube-based drum memory computer that stored and collected data for display.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandThe {{bit error}} rate (BER) of the tape {{recorder}} is a primary factor in determining the overall accuracy of a space to ground <b>PCM</b> data <b>link.</b> The {{ultimate goal is to}} obtain a recorder BER signature that is dependent solely on tape quality; however, in practice, the BER may be several orders of magnitude worse than the goal. Usually this occurs when the data transfer rate is not preserved during dropout intervals - intervals where the net signal-to-noise ratio is insufficient to guarantee valid data cell boundary detection. This paper investigates tape dropout signatures and addresses the problem of maintaining time coherency between reproduced data and clock assurance throughout the dropout interval. A digital approach is presented that utilizes a dual threshold detector in conjunction with a clock recovery generator. The generator is synchronized to the tape signal by a clock, N-times the data transfer rate, coherent with the transport servo reference. Implementation of the approach is discussed for two popular PCM formats. The effectiveness of the approach as a function of cell boundary detection, system signal-to-noise ratio, and transport time base error (TBE) is considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{centrosome}} {{is composed}} of a centriole pair and pericentriolar material (PCM). By marking the site of PCM assembly, the centrioles define the number of centrosomes present in the cell. The PCM, in turn, {{is responsible for the}} microtubule (MT) nucleation activity of centrosomes. Therefore, in order to assemble a functional bipolar mitotic spindle, a cell needs to control both centriole duplication and PCM recruitment. To date, however, the molecular mechanisms that govern these two processes still remain poorly understood. Results: Here we show that SPD- 2 is a novel component of the C. elegans centrosome. SPD- 2 localizes to the centriole throughout the cell cycle and accumulates on the PCM during mitosis. We show that SPD- 2 requires SPD- 5 for its accumulation on the PCM and that in the absence of SPD- 2, centrosome assembly fails. We further show that centriole duplication is also defective in spd- 2 (RNAi) embryos, but not in spd- 5 (RNAi) embryos, where PCM recruitment is efficiently blocked. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that SPD- 2 may <b>link</b> <b>PCM</b> recruitment and centriole duplication in C. elegans. SPD- 2 shares homology with a human centrosome protein, suggesting that this key component of the C. elegans centrosome is evolutionarily conserved...|$|R
5000|$|All PowerConnect M-series ("PCM") {{switches}} are multi-layer switches thus offering both layer 2 (Ethernet) {{options as}} well as layer 3 or IP routing options.Depending on the model the switches offer internally 1Gbit/s or 10Gbit/s interfaces towards the blades in the chassis. The PowerConnect M series with [...] "-k" [...] in the model-name offer 10Gb internal connections using the 10GBASE-KR standard. The external interfaces are mainly meant {{to be used as}} uplinks or stacking-interfaces but {{can also be used to}} connect non-blade servers to the network.On the link-level <b>PCM</b> switches support <b>link</b> aggregation: bot static LAG's {{as well as}} LACP. As all PowerConnect switches the switches are running RSTP as Spanning Tree Protocol, but it is also possible to run MSTP or Multiple Spanning Tree. The internal ports towards the blades are by default set as edge or [...] "portfast" [...] ports. Another feature is to use link-dependency. You can, for example, configure the switch that all internal ports to the blades are shut down when the switch gets isolated because it loses its uplink to the rest of the network.All PCM switches can be configured as pure layer-2 switches or they can be configured to do all routing: both routing between the configured VLAN's as external routing. Besides static routes the switches also support OSPF and RIP routing. When using the switch as routing switch you need to configure vlan interfaces and assign an IP address to that vlan interface: it is not possible to assign an IP address directly to a physical interface.|$|R
40|$|Advancements in {{technology}} {{have allowed the}} miniaturization of systems used in aerospace vehicles. This technology {{is driven by the}} need for next-generation systems that provide reliable, responsive, and cost-effective range operations while providing increased capabilities such as simultaneous mission support, increased launch trajectories, improved launch, and landing opportunities, etc. Leveraging the newest technologies, the command and telemetry processor (CTP) concept provides for a compact, flexible, and integrated solution for flight command and telemetry systems and range systems. The CTP is a relatively small circuit board that serves as a processing platform for high dynamic, high vibration environments. The CTP can be reconfigured and reprogrammed, allowing it to be adapted for many different applications. The design is centered around a configurable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device that contains numerous logic cells {{that can be used to}} implement traditional integrated circuits. The FPGA contains two PowerPC processors running the Vx-Works real-time operating system and are used to execute software programs specific to each application. The CTP was designed and developed specifically to provide telemetry functions; namely, the command processing, telemetry processing, and GPS metric tracking of a flight vehicle. However, it can be used as a general-purpose processor board to perform numerous functions implemented in either hardware or software using the FPGA s processors and/or logic cells. Functionally, the CTP was designed for range safety applications where it would ultimately become part of a vehicle s flight termination system. Consequently, the major functions of the CTP are to perform the forward link command processing, GPS metric tracking, return link telemetry data processing, error detection and correction, data encryption/ decryption, and initiate flight termination action commands. Also, the CTP had to be designed to survive and operate in a launch environment. Additionally, the CTP was designed to interface with the WFF (Wallops Flight Facility) custom-designed transceiver board which is used in the Low Cost TDRSS Transceiver (LCT 2) also developed by WFF. The LCT 2 s transceiver board demodulates commands received from the ground via the forward link and sends them to the CTP, where they are processed. The CTP inputs and processes data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the GPS receiver board, generates status data, and then sends the data to the transceiver board where it is modulated and sent to the ground via the return link. Overall, the CTP has combined processing with the ability to interface to a GPS receiver, an IMU, and a pulse code modulation (<b>PCM)</b> communication <b>link,</b> while providing the capability to support common interfaces including Ethernet and serial interfaces boarding a relatively small-sized, lightweight package...|$|R

Phase change materials are a quickly growing commodity in a world which now places a premium on energy conservation, and renewable energy sources. The implementation of PCMs into several world markets can lead to reduced energy costs, and increased opportunity to take advantage of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Understanding the flammability characteristics of PCMs will increase the ability to adequately introduce these materials into these markets, which may be very sensitive to flammability concerns, such as building construction. This thesis is a discussion of a project designed to determine flammability relationships for many fat and oil derived PCMs, and to compare these to the current market's dominant PCM, paraffins. The results were similar to what was expected; the flammability of the <b>PCMs</b> is directly <b>linked</b> to the materials flash point, i. e. the material with the lower flash point will have a lower propensity to burn. To accompany this, it was also determined that the flash point of each material could be directly linked to both the materials boiling point and molecular weight; both have a positive linear relationship. Based on these results, it was concluded that PCMs derived from fats and oils have a lower propensity to burn than petroleum derived paraffins...|$|R
