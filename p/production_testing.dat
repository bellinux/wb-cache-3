25|$|In 1948, a top-secret Soviet bioweapons {{laboratory}} {{was established}} on the island, {{in the center}} of the Aral Sea which is now disputed territory between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The exact history, functions and current status of this facility are still unclear, but bio-agents tested there included Bacillus anthracis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Brucella suis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Variola major (smallpox), Yersinia pestis, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. In 1971, weaponized smallpox from the island reached a nearby ship, which then allowed the virus to spread to the city of Aral. Ten people there were infected, of whom 3 died, and a massive vaccination effort involving 50,000 inhabitants ensued (see Aral smallpox incident). The bioweapons base was abandoned in 1992 following the disintegration of the Soviet Union the previous year. Scientific expeditions proved this had been a site for <b>production,</b> <b>testing</b> and later dumping of pathogenic weapons. In 2002, through a project organized by the United States and with Uzbekistan's assistance, 10 anthrax burial sites were decontaminated. According to the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections, all burial sites of anthrax were decontaminated.|$|E
500|$|Increased {{densities of}} DRAM {{integrated}} circuits (ICs) {{have led to}} physically smaller memory cells capable of storing smaller charges, resulting in lower operational noise margins, increased rates of electromagnetic interactions between memory cells, and greater possibility of data loss. [...] As a result, disturbance errors have been observed, being caused by cells interfering with each other's operation and manifesting as random changes in the values of bits stored in affected memory cells. [...] The awareness of disturbance errors {{dates back to the}} early 1970s and Intel1103 as the first commercially available DRAM IC; since then, DRAM manufacturers have employed various mitigation techniques to counteract disturbance errors, such as improving the isolation between cells and performing <b>production</b> <b>testing.</b> [...] However, researchers proved in a 2014 analysis that commercially available DDR3 DRAM chips manufactured in 2012 and 2013 are susceptible to disturbance errors, while using the term row hammer to name the associated side effect that led to observed bit flips.|$|E

40|$|Following the world’s first {{offshore}} <b>production</b> <b>test</b> {{that was}} conducted from a gas hydrate reservoir by a depressurization technique in 2013, the second offshore <b>production</b> <b>test</b> has been planned {{in the eastern}} Nankai Trough. In 2016, the drilling survey was performed ahead of the <b>production</b> <b>test,</b> and logging data that covers the reservoir interval were newly obtained from three wells around the test site: one well for geological survey, and two wells for monitoring surveys, during the <b>production</b> <b>test.</b> The formation evaluation using the well log data suggested that our target reservoir has a more significant heterogeneity in the gas hydrate saturation distribution than we expected, although lateral continuity of sand layers is relatively good. To evaluate the spatial distribution of gas hydrate, the integration analysis using well and seismic data was performed. The seismic amplitude analysis supports the lateral reservoir heterogeneity that has a significant positive correlation with the resistivity log data at the well locations. The spatial distribution of the apparent low-resistivity interval within the reservoir observed from log data was investigated by the P-velocity volume derived from seismic inversion. The integrated results were utilized for the pre-drill prediction of the reservoir quality at the producing wells. These approaches will {{reduce the risk of}} future commercial production from the gas hydrate reservoir...|$|R

40|$|The Pleasant Bayou # 2 Geopressured-Geothermal test {{well was}} {{completed}} {{in the summer of}} 1979. The C sand of the Frio formation was selected for completion on the basis of core analysis, well logs, and drill stem tests. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize the results of the short term <b>production</b> <b>tests</b> run on the Pleasant Bayou # 2 well during 1979 and the Fall of 1980. These tests were analyzed using conventional transient pressure test analysis methods. The most significant test run during 1979 was a ten day drawdown test from December 3 to December 14 followed by a 20 day buildup period, during which reservoir pressure response was observed. After a hiatus of nine months, a second <b>production</b> <b>test</b> was conducted over a period of 45 days beginning on September 16, 1980. The well was shut in on October 31, 1980. Pressure buildup data continues to be monitered. Both <b>production</b> <b>tests</b> indicate a formation permeability of 200 millidarcies. The presence of a permeability interruption located approximately 3700 feet from the wellbore is also suggested by these tests. During the last <b>production</b> <b>test,</b> a producing gas-water ratio of 20 standard cubic feet per barrel of produced water was observed. An additional 9 - 12 standard cubic feet of gas per barrel was found in the water downstream of the separator. The total gas-water ratio of 29 - 32 SCF/bbl is in reasonable agreement with laboratory data and correlations for this produced brine. The major growth fault which forms the reservoir boundary to the northwest of the well is evident from the pressure drawdown data obtained during the last production period. The last <b>production</b> <b>test</b> also indicates an apparent rate dependent skin effect...|$|R
