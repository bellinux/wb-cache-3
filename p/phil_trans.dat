25|$|Airy's {{discovery}} of a new inequality in the motions of Venus and the Earth is in some respects his most remarkable achievement. In correcting the elements of Delambre's solar tables he had been led to suspect an inequality overlooked by their constructor. The cause of this he did not long seek in vain; thirteen times the mean motion of Venus is so nearly equal to eight times that of Earth that the difference amounts to {{only a small fraction}} of Earth's mean motion, and from the fact that the term depending on this difference, although very small in itself, receives in the integration of the differential equations a multiplier of about 2,200,000, Airy was led to infer the existence of a sensible inequality extending over 240 years (<b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.</b> cxxii. 67). The investigation was probably the most laborious that had been made up to Airy's time in planetary theory, and represented the first specific improvement in the solar tables effected in England since the establishment of the theory of gravity. In recognition of this work the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to him in 1833 (he would win it again in 1846).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{particle}} size and wettability on {{the interaction between}} micro/nanoparticles and lung lining fluid (LLF) is considered theoretically. The conditions under which particles will float, sink, or become submerged are investigated. Lung lining fluid (LLF) is a thin aqueous film which coats the surface of alveoli and is essential to lung function, contributing primarily to gaseous exchange. LLF contains {{of a variety of}} dissolved species, including proteins and phospholipids, and the film has approximate thickness 100 - 200 nm. The interaction of airborne particles with LLF will generally correspond to one of the following three categories: 1. Floating 2. Wall Supported 3. Submerged For Floating particles the possibility exists that they could be removed from the LLF, perhaps by vibrations induced via coughing. For Wall Supported and Submerged particles, their removal is less likely due to the increased force required to separate them from the liquid film. These particles will remain in the LLF unless removed by dissolution or through the action of alveolar macrophages. Particles which remain in contact with the epithelial cell wall for prolonged periods of time could become internalised within the lungs, enhancing their toxic potential [1]. This work presents a tool for predicting which of the above categories an inhaled particle interacting with LLF will correspond to. Research areas which will benefit from this work include (i) studies utilising airborne particles for drug delivery, and (ii) studies investigating respiratory illnesses caused by airborne contaminants. It is well established that particles larger than PM 10 {{are more likely to be}} captured higher up in the respiratory tract. Here we consider spherical particles of diameters in the range 1 nm to 10 µm for their ability to enter the pulmonary region of the lungs. i. e. PM 2. 5 and PM 10 are both considered. The particle mass is considered by varying the density of the particle material. The wettability of the particle surface is explored by varying the contact angle, θ, of the three phase line created between the LLF and the particle in the range 0 < θ < 180 o. A force balance which includes the particle buoyancy and capillary forces is constructed, which includes the Laplace-Young equation [2]. The force balance is solved numerically for each combination of particle diameter, mass, and contact angle. The LLF is assumed to have constant thickness, density, and surface tension for all calculations. The maximum particle diameter and mass which was predicted to float on the LLF was a function of the wettability of the particle surface. For those particle which could not float, the likelihood that they would become submerged by LLF was also strongly dependent on the wettability of the particle surface. Surface wettability is a crucial parameter for the determination of whether a particle making contact with lung lining fluid will float, sink, or become submerged. This is particularly important for particles in the PM 2. 5 regime.

2500|$|The {{next step}} was when Abraham Bennet, the {{inventor}} of the gold leaf electroscope, described a [...] "doubler of electricity" [...] (<b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.,</b> 1787), as a device similar to the electrophorus, but that could amplify a small charge by means of repeated manual operations with three insulated plates, {{in order to make it}} observable in an electroscope. Erasmus Darwin, W. Wilson, G. C. Bohnenberger, and (later, 1841) J. C. E. Péclet developed various modifications of Bennet's device. Francis Ronalds automated the generation process in 1816 by adapting a pendulum bob as one of the plates, driven by clockwork or a steam engine – he created the device to power his electric telegraph. In 1788, William Nicholson proposed his rotating doubler, which can be considered as the first rotating influence machine. His instrument was described as [...] "an instrument which by turning a winch produces the two states of electricity without friction or communication with the earth". (<b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.,</b> 1788, p.403) Nicholson later described [...] a [...] "spinning condenser" [...] apparatus, as a better instrument for measurements.|$|E
2500|$|This {{discovery}} of {{what became known}} as the aberration of light was, for all realistic purposes, conclusive evidence for the movement of the Earth, and hence for the correctness of Aristarchus' and Kepler's theories; it was announced to the Royal Society in January 1729 (<b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.</b> xxxv. 637). [...] The theory of the aberration also gave Bradley a means to improve on the accuracy of the previous estimate of the speed of light, which had previously been estimated by the work of Ole Rømer and others.|$|E

Adding the portions of the prints that are omitted here, but which will be found in the <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.,</b> the material that I have thus far published contains 389 points of comparison, of which one failed.

60|$|A {{multitude}} of smaller errors, arising from anomalies {{in the distribution}} of temperature, will be apparent on consulting my observations on the temperature at various elevations in Sikkim; practically these are unavoidable. I have also calculated all my observations according to Professor J. Forbes's formula of 1 degree difference of temperature of boiling-water, being the equivalent of 550 feet at all elevations. (See Ed. <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.,</b> vol xv. p. 405.) The formula is certainly not applicable to the Sikkim Himalaya; on the contrary, my observations show that the formula employed for Boileau's tables gives at all ordinary elevations so very close an approach to accuracy on the mean of many observations, that no material improvement in its construction is to be anticipated.|$|E
60|$|A fair {{idea of the}} way {{in which}} the {{patterns}} are distributed, is given by Plate 6. Eight persons were taken in the order in which they happened to present themselves, and Plate 6 shows the result. For greater clearness, colour has been employed to distinguish between the ridges that are supplied from the inner and outer sides of the hand respectively. The words right and left must be avoided in speaking of patterns, for the two hands are symmetrically disposed, only in a reversed sense. The right hand does not look like a left hand, but like the reflection of a left hand in a looking-glass, and vice versa. The phrases we shall employ will be the Inner and the Outer; or thumb-side and little-finger side (terms which were unfortunately misplaced in my memoir in the <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.</b> 1891).|$|E

60|$|Plate 14, Fig. 21 {{contains}} rather {{less than}} a quarter of each of eight pairs that were published in the <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.</b> memoir above alluded to. They were there enlarged photographically to twice their natural size, which was hardly enough, as it did not allow sufficient space for inserting the necessary reference numbers. Consequently they have been again considerably enlarged, so much so that it is impossible to put more than a portion of each on the page. However, what is given suffices. The omitted portions may be studied in the memoir. The cases of ~1~ and ~2~ are prints of different fingers of the same individual, first as a child 8 years old, and then as a boy of 17. They have been enlarged on the same scale but not to the same size; so the print of the child includes a larger proportion of the original impression than that of the boy. It is therefore only a part of the child's print which is comparable with that of the boy. The remaining six cases refer to four different men, belonging to three quite different families, although their surnames happen to have the same initial, H. They were adults when the first print was made, and from 26 to 31 years older on the second occasion. There is an exact agreement throughout between the two members of each of the eight several couplets.|$|E
6000|$|It will be {{observed}} {{that they are}} grouped under the three principal heads of Arches, Loops, and Whorls, and that under each of these heads some analogous patterns as ~4~, ~5~, ~7~, ~8~, etc., are introduced and underlined with the word [...] "see" [...] so and so, and thus noted as really belonging {{to one of the}} other heads. This is done to indicate the character of the transitional cases that unite respectively the Arches with the Loops, the Arches with the Whorls, and the Loops with the Whorls. More will follow in respect to these. The [...] "tented arch" [...] (~3~) is extremely rare on the thumb; I do not remember ever to have seen it there, consequently it did not appear in the plate of patterns in the <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.</b> which referred to thumbs. On the other hand, the [...] "banded duplex spiral" [...] (~30~) is common in the thumb, but rare elsewhere. There are some compound patterns, especially the [...] "spiral in loop" [...] (~21~) and the [...] "circlet in loop" [...] (~22~), which are as much loops as whorls; but are reckoned as whorls. The [...] "twinned loop" [...] (~16~) is of more frequent occurrence than would be supposed from the examination of dabbed impressions, as {{the only part of the}} outer loop then in view resembles outside arches; it is due to a double separation of the ridges (Plate 4, Fig. 8), and a consequent double interspace. The [...] "crested loop" [...] (~13~) may sometimes be regarded as an incipient form of a [...] "duplex spiral" [...] (~29~).|$|E
6000|$|The {{provisional}} list {{of standard}} patterns {{published in the}} <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.</b> was not appropriate for this purpose. It related chiefly to thumbs, and consequently omitted the tented arch; it also referred to the left hand, but in the following tabulations the right hand has been used; and its numbering is rather inconvenient. The present set of fifty-three patterns has faults, and cannot be considered in any way as final, but it was suitable for our purposes and may be convenient to others; as Mr. Collins worked wholly by it, it may be distinguished as the [...] "C. set." [...] The banded patterns, 24-31, are very rarely found on the fingers, but being common on the thumb, were retained, on the chance of our requiring the introduction of thumb patterns into the tabulations. The numerals refer to the patterns as seen in impressions of the right hand only. [They would be equally true for the patterns as seen on the fingers themselves of the left hand.] For impressions of the left hand the numerals up to 7 inclusive would be the same, but those of all the rest would be changed. These are arranged in couplets, the {{one member of the}} couplet being a reversed picture of the other, those in each couplet being distinguished by severally bearing an odd and an even number. Therefore, in impressions of the left hand, 8 would have to be changed into 9, and 9 into 8; 10 into 11, and 11 into 10; and so on, up to the end, viz. 52 and 53. The numeral 54 was used to express nondescript patterns.|$|E
60|$|A {{remarkable}} {{uniformity of}} temperature prevails {{throughout the year}} at Dorjiling, there being only 22 degrees difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest months; whilst in London, with a lower mean temperature, the equivalent difference is 27 degrees. At 11,000 feet this difference is {{equal to that of}} London. In more elevated regions, it is still greater, the climate becoming excessive at 15,000 feet, where the difference amounts to 30 degrees at least.* [This is contrary to the conclusions of all meteorologists who have studied the climate of the Alps, and is entirely due to the local disturbances which I have so often dwelt upon, and principally to the unequal distribution of moisture in the loftier rearward regions, and the aridity of Tibet. Professor James Forbes states (Ed. <b>Phil.</b> <b>Trans.,</b> v. xiv. p. 489):--1. That the decrement of temperature with altitude is most rapid in summer: this (as I shall hereafter show) is not the case in the Himalaya, chiefly because the warm south moist wind then prevails. 2. That the annual range of temperature diminishes with the elevation: this, too, is not the case in Sikkim, because of the barer surface and more cloudless skies of the rearward loftier regions. 3. That the diurnal range of temperature diminishes with the height: {{that this is not the}} cane follows from the same cause. 4. That radiation is least in winter: this is negatived by the influence of the summer rains.] The accompanying table is the result of an attempt to approximate to the mean temperatures and ranges of the thermometer at various elevations.|$|E
