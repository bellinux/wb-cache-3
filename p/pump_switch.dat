40|$|Environmental awareness, {{emission}} restrictions, {{production costs}} and operating expenses of mobile fluid power systems {{have provided a}} large incentive for the investigation of novel and more efficient fluid power technologies for decades. These factors have driven fluid power technology advancements in the earth-moving sector where displacement-controlled (DC) actuation and hydraulic hybrid architectures have emerged as highly efficient choices {{for the next generation}} hydraulic systems. Industry and academia have recognized the need for these technologies as well as the challenges for their implementation and commercialization. At the Maha fluid power research center, highly efficient DC actuation with <b>pump</b> <b>switching</b> has demonstrated that, when coupled with novel hydraulic hybrid drives and under certain applications, the prime mover’s power can be downsized by up to 50 % leading to substantial energy savings. In this dissertation, challenges related to the actuator and supervisory-level controls for DC machines with <b>pump</b> <b>switching</b> and hydraulic hybrids are studied and implementable solutions are proposed for the first time. On the actuator-level linear robust controllers and an adaptive robust controller are utilized to assess the performance of a secondary-controlled hydraulic hybrid drive, which is subjected to large and rapidly changing inertial and external load dynamics as well as varying pressure nets. Also on the actuator-level, feedforward strategies for the realization of DC actuation with <b>pump</b> <b>switching</b> are put forward, studied and tested in two different experimental platforms, leading to smooth actuator transitions. On the supervisory level, the challenge to manage multi-actuator systems with <b>pump</b> <b>switching</b> is addressed {{through the use of a}} priority-based algorithm. An instantaneous optimization algorithm is formulated and coupled with a novel electronic anti-stall control for the power management of the prime mover in hydraulic hybrid DC multi-actuator systems. Finally, a feedforward controller is developed based on the power distribution of this new class of hydraulic hybrid systems to enable prime mover downsizing for cases where the DC actuation savings and cyclical machine operation allow. Ultimately, the control algorithms derived in this dissertation bring the technology a step closer to the predicted savings while emulating traditional or superior operability at reduced cost. ...|$|R

40|$|The control {{strategy}} for sewer pumping stations currently used by Anglian Water, {{and most other}} UK water service providers, is classical on/off switching. This is based simply on the fluid level in the inlet wet well. Such local control can lead to poor performance {{across a variety of}} indicators, including energy costs, hydraulic performance and efficiency. Despite the listed issues, the Anglian Water sewerage system is operating at a satisfactory level in terms of conveying flow to treatment. In clean water systems, artificial intelligence and other techniques have been used to optimise pump scheduling and research is now needed to provide similar efficiency gains for sewerage systems. Artificial intelligence is widely used for different control and automation applications in many areas. There is a limited use of optimal control in clean water systems but little or no research has been done to apply these techniques to waste water. To the best of author's knowledge, this research {{is the first time that}} within the water sector that Fuzzy logic (FL) has been applied specifically to the control of pumping in sewer networks. This thesis presents details of a FL system developed in dry weather flow (DWF) for control of sewer pumping stations for energy and costs savings. This research was a collaborative project between Anglian Water and the University of Sheffield. The FL controller outperformed the Base case representing current practice in terms of increased energy and costs savings and a lower number of pump s'Aitches. The functionalities of the FL controller were achieved by: • A Genetic Algorithm was used to tune the FL controller by determining the base lengths of the Membership Functions and the locations of the peaks (vertices of the membership functions' two non-base edges). • The Rule Base impact on level control was investigated and representative Rule base designs were chosen for each of the electrical tariffs. • The FIS controller was extended to include pump efficiency. Pump efficiency was then taken into consideration by running close to the optimal pump operating point, not taking into account long term pump degradation. • An ANN prediction model was developed for DWF inflow prediction which was trained, tested and validated on flow data obtained from survey. The ANN model has just two inputs (population and trade flow) and thus a flow survey is no longer required in order to tune the FL controller. • The FL controller represents a general solution which can be successfully transferred to another pumping station with different characteristics: wet well dimensions, min/max levels and different pumps. Customarisation is needed in terms of physical characteristics of pump station. Simulation results were confinned by the live trial. • The FL system was tested for its robustness using a wet weather event flow profiles. It continued to demonstrate an ability to supply energy cost savings under wet weather conditions albeit not as optimally as for DWF. Wet weather flow (WWF) was out of a scope of this research. FL control system would switch to fail-safe operating mode during WWF event (on/off control timer controlled mode with the <b>pump</b> <b>switch</b> on point sets to 90 % of maximal level in the wet well). In summary, Anglian Water currently spends £ 13 million annually on energy for wastewater pumping. Around 10 % of pumping stations within Anglian Water could eventually benefit from intelligent control. Energy savings from intelligent control are expected to deliver 5 % or better, based on the results of this PhD research project. This would reduce the annual energy bill of the company by a third of a million pounds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Across North America, {{water supply}} and {{distribution}} systems (WSDs) are controlled manually by operational staff - who place a heavy reliance on their experience and judgement when rendering operational decisions. These decisions range from scheduling the operation of pumps, valves and chemical dosing in the system. However, due to the uncertainty of demand, stringent water quality regulatory constraints, external forcing (cold/drought climates, fires, bursts) from the environment, and the non-stationarity of climate change, operators have the tendency to control their systems conservatively and reactively. WSDs that are operated in such fashion {{are said to be}} 'reactive' because: (i) the operators manually react to changes in the system behaviour, as measured by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems; and (ii) are not always aware of any anomalies in the system until they are reported by consumers and authorities. The net result is that the overall operations of WSDs are suboptimal with respect to energy consumption, water losses, infrastructure damage and water quality. In this research, an intelligent platform, namely the Real-time Dynamically Dimensioned Scheduler (RT-DDS), is developed and quantitatively assessed for the proactive control and optimization of WSD operations. The RT-DDS platform was configured to solve a dynamic control problem at every timestep (hour) of the day. The control problem involved the minimization of energy costs (over the 24 -hour period) by recommending 'near-optimal' pump schedules, while satisfying hydraulic reliability constraints. These constraints were predefined by operational staff and regulatory limits and define a tolerance band for pressure and storage levels across the WSD system. The RT-DDS platform includes three essential modules. The first module produces high-resolution forecasts of water demand via ensemble machine learning techniques. A water demand profile for the next 24 -hours is predicted based on historical demand, ambient conditions (i. e. temperature, precipitation) and current calendar information. The predicted profile is then fed into the second module, which involves a simulation model of the WSD. The model is used to determine the hydraulic impacts of particular control settings. The results of the simulation model are used to guide the search strategy of the final module - a stochastic single solution optimization algorithm. The optimizer is parallelized for computational efficiency, such that the reporting frequency of the platform is within 15 minutes of execution time. The fidelity of the prediction engine of the RT-DDS platform was evaluated with an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) driven case study, whereby the short-term water consumption of the residential units in the city were predicted. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model alongside ensemble-driven learning techniques (Random forests, Bagging trees and Boosted trees) were built, trained and validated as part of this research. A three-stage validation process was adopted to assess the replicative, predictive and structural validity of the models. Further, the models were assessed in their predictive capacity at two different spatial resolutions: at a single meter and at the city-level. While the models proved to have strong generalization capability, via good performance in the cross-validation testing, the models displayed slight biases when aiming to predict extreme peak events in the single meter dataset. It was concluded that the models performed far better with a lower spatial resolution (at the city or district level) whereby peak events are far more normalized. In general, the models demonstrated the capacity of using machine learning techniques in the context of short term water demand forecasting - particularly for real-time control and optimization. In determining the optimal representation of pump schedules for real-time optimization, multiple control variable formulations were assessed. These included binary control statuses and time-controlled triggers, whereby the pump schedule was represented as a sequence of on/off binary variables and active/idle discrete time periods, respectively. While the time controlled trigger representation systematically outperformed the binary representation in terms of computational efficiency, it was found that both formulations led to conditions whereby the system would violate the predefined maximum number of pump switches per calendar day. This occurred because at each timestep the control variable formulation was unaware of the previously elapsed pump switches in the subsequent hours. Violations in the maximum <b>pump</b> <b>switch</b> limits lead to transient instabilities and thus create hydraulically undesirable conditions. As such, a novel feedback architecture was proposed, such that at every timestep, the number of switches that had elapsed in the previous hours was explicitly encoded into the formulation. In this manner, the maximum number of switches per calendar day was never violated since the optimizer was aware of the current trajectory of the system. Using this novel formulation, daily energy cost savings of up to 25 % were achievable on an average day, leading to cost savings of over 2. 3 million dollars over a ten-year period. Moreover, stable hydraulic conditions were produced in the system, thereby changing very little when compared to baseline operations in terms of quality of service and overall condition of assets...|$|E

Careful scheduling of pump operations may lead to significant energy savings and prevent wear and tear. By means of computer simulation, an optimal schedule of pumps can be found by an optimisation algorithm. The subject of this thesis {{is the study of}} pump scheduling as an optimisation problem. New representations of pump schedules are investigated for restricting the number of potential schedules. Recombination and mutation operators are proposed, in order to use the new representations in evolutionary algorithms. These new representations are empirically compared to traditional representations using different network instances, one of them being a large and complex network from UK. By means of the new representations, the evolutionary algorithm developed during this thesis finds new best-known solutions for both networks. Pump scheduling as the multi-objective problem of minimising energy and maintenance costs in terms of Pareto optimality is also investigated in this thesis. Two alternative surrogate measures of maintenance cost are considered: the minimisation of the number of <b>pump</b> <b>switches</b> and the maximisation of the shortest idle time. A single run of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm obtains pump schedules with lower electrical cost and lower number of <b>pump</b> <b>switches</b> than those found in the literature. Alternatively, schedules with very long idle times may be found with slightly higher electrical cost. Finally, ant colony optimisation is also adapted to the pump scheduling problem.

The plasma volume of the PP group had decreased initially but then returned gradually to precardiopulmonary bypass levels. In the NP group, the plasma volume remained contracted (P = . 02). No significant differences in the fluid extravasation rate were obtained. The fluid extravasation rate of the PP group tended to stay slightly higher than the fluid extravasation rate of the NP group at all measurement intervals. The total tissue water content increased significantly in a number of organs compared with that in the control animals. However, differences in the total tissue water content between pulsed and nonpulsed perfusion were absent. ConclusionsNo significant differences in the fluid extravasation rates were present between pulsed and nonpulsed cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion in the present experimental setup...|$|R
