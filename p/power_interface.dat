25|$|The Advanced Configuration and <b>Power</b> <b>Interface</b> (ACPI), an open {{industry}} standard, allows {{an operating}} system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This allows {{a system to}} automatically turn off components such as monitors and hard drives after set periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may hibernate, when most components (including the CPU and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor to an earlier Intel-Microsoft standard called Advanced Power Management, which allows a computer's BIOS to control power management functions.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} in the penetration levels of distributed generation in the modern power grid and its importance in future energy systems have accelerated the interest of developing new <b>power</b> electronic <b>interfaces</b> for the energy conversion process. The feasibility of applying the indirect matrix converter as the standard <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> for applications with power ratings from several kW to few MW is addressed in this dissertation. Special attention is given to those applications where space dominates the power electronic requirements. The main motivation for using the indirect matrix converter is that eliminates the energy storage component {{in the way of}} a dc-link capacitor for the energy conversion process. This contributes to reduce size and weight, and potentially, increase reliability of the <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface.</b> Two main new contributions are presented. First, a new <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> that allows the connection of two ac power grids through a medium- or high-voltage dc system is proposed. The new topology contemplates the use of two high-voltage dc-link converters based on the modular multilevel converter, two indirect matrix converters and two medium-frequency transformers. Second, a new sensorless control technique working in the d-q reference is developed. The controller is used to interface a distributed generation unit to the power grid when the indirect matrix converter is used as the <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface.</b> The design and performance of the proposed <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> is validated through time-domain simulations and a laboratory prototype is built to experimentally validate the sensorless controller...|$|R

30|$|Power {{electronic}} circuits are {{also expected to}} be used in order to <b>interface</b> a main <b>power</b> grid to the microgrid. This <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> is not required in AC microgrids as it is in DC microgrids. Still, <b>power</b> electronic <b>interfaces</b> may be used in AC microgrids to achieve a more flexible control of the power flow in between the main grid and the microgrid. One example of the advantages of having more flexible control is found in the microgrid in [34], where a <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> between part of the microgrid and the main grid serves to provide multiple power quality levels within the microgrid area.|$|R

40|$|A {{major goal}} for the ISO/IEC 15118 {{standard}} for controlling the charging process for electric vehicles is the simplicity and reliability of use. Severe threats for a simple use are implementations of the standard which are not interoperable to each other. A traditional approach to reduce this threat is the setup of testivals between all implementations to explicit test interoperability. However this approach is complex and expensive as it requires extensive test and the coordination between all implementers. The project eNterop takes {{a different approach to}} enable a broad acceptance of the ISO/IEC 15118 and IEC 61851 specification on the market and to facilitate a large number of implementations. It defines conformance tests which can be fully automated. This is a quite new approach for machine to machine interface specifications which not only cover communication but also <b>power</b> <b>interfaces.</b> With that implementers can independently test their protocols including the power flow control and increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations without expensive testivals.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focuses on}} the energy storage system and the <b>power</b> {{electronic}} <b>interface</b> included in microsources of the CERTS microgrid. To provide the plug-and-play feature and the power quality requirements of the CERTS microgrid, all microsources regardless of their prime mover type must have a unified dynamic performance.

The storage module is attached to the prime mover through a <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> that couples the microsource to the microgrid. Details of the energy storage module, the <b>power</b> electronic <b>interface</b> and the corresponding controls are described. Performance of an example microsource, which includes a synchronous generator, a storage module and an electronic interface, is studied.

50|$|The MIL-STD-704 power {{connections}} provide {{the store with}} access to 28 VDC, three-phase wye 400 Hz, 115/200 VAC and 270 VDC aircraft power; it is usual to route {{only one of the}} last two supplies, however, if both are made available, then they are never made active simultaneously. The MIL-STD-1760 interface provides power through the primary interface (two off 28 VDC and either one or both 115/200V VAC and 270 VDC), where it is routed to the store along with all of the other signal types. The standard also allows for an optional auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>interface</b> (1 off 28 VDC and either 115/200 VAC or 270 VDC) for stores with more demanding power requirements.
