5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} Arabic authors more than Persian ones. There {{is very little}} evidence which shows his interest in Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was {{proud to be a}} student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a <b>provincial</b> <b>town</b> where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large <b>provincial</b> <b>town,</b> with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E

5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large <b>provincial</b> <b>town,</b> with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the <b>provincial</b> <b>town</b> of Junín, and longs {{for a better life}} in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to the}} city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lhermitte {{was hired}} as a teacher. Shortly after {{beginning}} her new career, Lhermitte gave birth to her first child, Yasmine (b. August 13, 1992). Three years later, she delivered her second child, Nora (b. February 13, 1995). From June 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996, Lhermitte was granted leave from her teaching position due to postpartum depression. After the birth of Lhermitte's first child Yasmin, Schaar purchased a house for himself and the couple to live in, and he dedicated his apartment to his practice. In 1996, Schaar hired Moqadem to serve as his filing assistant part-time, then full-time in 1998. During this period, Schaar still covered most expenses, including vacations, house repairs, monthly allowances, and life insurance for each family member. Lhermitte gave birth to two more daughters, Miriam (b. April 20, 1997) and Mina (May 20, 1999), before the family's move from Brussels to the <b>provincial</b> <b>town</b> of Nivelles.

5|$|The Medieval Merchant's House {{was built}} in about 1290 on FrenchStreet, Southampton, then a major port and a large <b>provincial</b> <b>town</b> with a {{population}} of around 5,000, grown rich from the trade with England's continental possessions in Europe. The area of Southampton around FrenchStreet had been re-planned earlier in the century, reducing the numbers of farm animals kept in and around the houses, driving poorer merchants and craftsmen into the less desirable northern half of the city, and creating a quarter of large, impressive houses, often built in stone with tiled roofs. The original house was designed for use by John Fortin, a prosperous wine merchant, with a vaulted cellar for holding stock, a shop {{at the front of the}} property and accommodation for the family; much of it {{was built in}} stone, but it featured a timber front, a fashionable design for the period. At least 60 other houses similar to the Medieval Merchant's House were built in Southampton at around the same time.|$|E

40|$|Inter-urban {{competition}} between small <b>provincial</b> <b>towns</b> This study investigates the characteristics {{and significance of}} inter-urban {{competition between}} small <b>provincial</b> <b>towns</b> in Denmark through {{a case study of}} the town of Haslev. Our understanding of inter-urban competition is defined in a Danish context using David Harvey’s theory of the shift toward entrepreneurial planning in urban governance. This formes the criteria for analyzing the development in planning and planning strategies in Haslev, as relates to inter-urban competition between small <b>provincial</b> <b>towns.</b> Using specific planning initiatives from 1984 and 2011 - 2013 respectively, this is analyzed within a thematic framework in order to compare the periods and understand the interim development. Based on an outline of the current planning strategies in Haslev, we examine how the speculative elements in certain parts of entrepreneurial planning can be understood. A model of the relation between municipal influence on the context of a planning initiative and the degree of place dependency in the related activities, is set up in order to distinguish the predictability of the outcome of certain types of planning initiatives. This study concludes that the planning of Haslev has become more entrepreneurial with the increasing inter-urban competition between small <b>provincial</b> <b>towns.</b> It is further concluded that the planning of small <b>provincial</b> <b>towns</b> becomes increasingly speculative and complex, which necessitates extensive cooperation and knowledge sharing...|$|R
