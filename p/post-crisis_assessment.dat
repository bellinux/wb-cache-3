40|$|Purpose: This study explores SHRD's {{maturity}} in Greek banks {{within the}} context of the economic crisis. It aims to explore and advance our understanding of how SHRD is perceived within diverse institutions through the respective lens of different HRD stakeholders, while also portraying the factors inhibiting or facilitating its adoption, and accordingly contributing to its maturity in some organisations during lean economic times. Methodology: The study draws upon qualitative research data from two case study banking organisations in Greece, reporting on 76 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (HR staff, Bank Managers, employees). Interview questions were focused on a pre and <b>post-crisis</b> <b>assessment,</b> supplemented by the analysis of various organisational documents. A modified SHRD model was also employed so as to assess and evaluate SHRD’s maturity within organisations. Findings: Research evidence highlights the complexity attached with stakeholders' perception of SHRD, and the level of its maturity respectively. This entanglement is further explained through a variety of factors inhibiting or expediting its strategic adoption in some organisations, and further contributed to its maturity, at the time of the economic crisis. Research Limitations: The analysis is limited by non-including other key stakeholders (e. g. top management, T&D third parties, unions etc.), along with its sole focus within the Greek territory; thus, future research may consist of a comparison amongst bank institutions from different countries, along with including interviews with representatives from other potential groups of interest. Practical Implications: Familiarise organisational stakeholders with SHRD's necessity and complexity during hard economic times. Make HR executives aware of the level of maturity of their HRD practices so as to proceed to all necessary amendments in order to increase their strategic embeddedness. Originality/Value: The research’s value derives from its critical mindset, thus extending existing SHRD theory and models through its multi-constituent research perspective. Likewise, it enhances existing knowledge on SHRD maturity both within a different industrial and cultural context and {{within the context}} of an economic crisis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} SHRD's maturity {{within the}} context of the economic crisis, and through the respective lens of different key HRD stakeholders. It aims to critically address existing SHRD models' limitations (e. g. assessed within "static" business environments, lack of employees' "line of sight", performative or humanitarian focus etc.) so as to explore and advance our understanding on how SHRD is perceived and applied within diverse institutions through a multi-constituent research perspective. Additionally, it assesses and evaluates the key characteristics which constitute the criteria of a SHRD mature organisation within two Greek banks at the time of the economic crisis. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study draws upon qualitative research data from two case study banking organisations in Greece (two largest private-owned banking corporations), by reporting on 76 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (HR staff, Bank Managers, Employees). A pre and <b>post-crisis</b> <b>assessment</b> was followed, supplemented by document analysis. Lastly, SHRD's maturity, within the targeted organisations, was evaluated through the employment of a modified SHRD model, with its respective strategic characteristics. Findings: Research evidence highlights the complexity attached with stakeholders' perception of SHRD, and the level of its maturity (pre and post-crisis) respectively. Precisely, SHRD maturity is presented mixed for both time periods, with most strategic characteristics to be partially employed by both organisations either before or after the crisis. However, an interesting point was highlighted with both organisations' HRD practices to be presented agile enough in regard to the ongoing business uncertainty. Yet, having assessed all strategic characteristics, for both organisations and for both time periods, research data outlines SHRD's setback within both organisations. Originality/Value: This paper provides both theoretical and practical considerations over the maturity of SHRD during recessionary times. Its value initially derives from its critical mindset, thus extending existing SHRD theory and models through its multi-constituent research perspective, and by seeing SHRD as a discursive action (moving away from a performative and/or humanitarian focus). Alike, it enhances existing knowledge on SHRD maturity both within a different industrial and cultural context, while it also adds to SHRD theory and practice by testing a modified SHRD model under the circumstances of an economic crisis...|$|E
