40|$|The {{introduction}} of the additional supplementary <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> through the Riester pension reform led to {{a fundamental change in}} the retirement provision system in Germany. Private providers accordingly assumed tasks which had up to then been incumbent on the statutory social security system. The reform defined a system break, which redefined the role of the private providers. Up to now the effect on the <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> has thereby remained unexplained and worthy of discussion in research. The question is raised which consequences the {{introduction of}} the additional supplementary <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> with products from private providers has on tangible <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> in Germany. This survey deals with the publicly funded and consequently socially relevant methods of privately financed supplementary <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> via the Riester <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> as well as through company pension schemes. It analyses to what extent private providers meet the requirements of social security with their products. The survey design builds on quantifying providers, qualifying the application and the propagation of the supplementary <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> and evaluating the offered products. The focus of the evaluation is the reconstruction of the actuarial pension annuity calculation. Since – according to the thesis adopted here – only the reconstruction of the product calculation can explain and determine the performance level of the pension annuity...|$|R

New private pension instruments developed since 1986, notably personal pensions, have proved popular, but concern as to ‘overselling’ of personal pensions and as to the risks associated with the ‘money purchase’ form of <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> is frequently voiced by commentators. For many people, rightly or wrongly, the ‘traditional’ finalsalary- based occupational pension remains the bench-mark for private <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> in the UK.

Therefore, {{the provision of}} occupational as well as private pensions has to be enhanced.

Using survey data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and the German SAVE survey, the present paper studies econometrically the determinants of occupational <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> in Germany.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} theory of bounded {{rationality}} to study small employer <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> decision-making in Ireland. PRSA pension products were intended to provide inexpensive, flexible pension options, particularly targeted towards small enterprises and yet employees in small organisations are {{the least likely to}} be members of pension schemes. Ten years after their introduction, evidence suggests that the PRSA pension product had little impact on pension coverage in Ireland. Drawing on {{the theory of}} bounded rationality and a review of the legislative and institutional context within which small employers in Ireland make <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> decisions, this paper presents a small employer pension decision making model. A range of propositions are set out which illuminate small employer <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> practices relating to whether they have a tendency to organise rather than sponsor PRSAs for their employees.

40|$|Within {{the last}} two decades, being exposed to major social, economic, and {{demographic}} challenges, many national pension systems have undergone various transformations. Following suggestions from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, many welfare states revised existing pension policies and started encouraging supplementary pension arrangements, particularly promoting the development of private pension savings, as well as occupational pension schemes. However, {{the degree to which}} the latter developed varies significantly between countries. The purpose of this Master’s thesis is to analyze the evolution of voluntary occupational pension arrangements in two countries - Finland and Russia. The research examines how certain economic, political, and social contexts, as well as decisions and reforms in public <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> influenced the development of voluntary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>provision.</b> The research explores at what point in time, as well as under what circumstances, the role of voluntary occupational pension arrangements changed in Finland and Russia. The evolution of voluntary occupational pension arrangements is analyzed using existing studies in the sphere of pension policies, combining the theoretical frameworks of the mixed economy of welfare and historical institutionalism. The significance of these two approaches lies in their ability to expand our knowledge of how voluntary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> evolved in Finland and Russia. The former allows the broadening of our understanding of welfare provision by taking into account the plurality of welfare actors. While the latter focuses on the importance of history helping to examine factors and decisions, which led to involvement of these actors in matters of welfare provision. The analysis of evolution of voluntary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> in Finland and Russia identified three critical junctures. The first critical juncture is related to the early development of pension systems in two countries in the early 19 th. The second juncture concerns the decisions to establish basic and earnings-related pension schemes, which were observed throughout the first part of the 20 th century in both Finland and Russia. The third critical juncture is related to the economic crises of the 1990 s and the necessity to restructure systems of <b>pension</b> <b>provision.</b> The study demonstrated certain similarities in the evolution of voluntary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> between the two countries, especially in the timeframes of the first critical juncture. Thus, the initiative of employers to provide pension benefits for their employees in both countries had a significant impact on the development of <b>pension</b> <b>provision,</b> and voluntary occupational <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> in particular, creating the possibility for employers to use pension arrangements as additional motivational tool for retaining staff and getting employees to increase their performance. However, the later trajectories in the development of pension systems in Finland and Russia differed significantly, influencing the degree to which voluntary occupational pension arrangements developed in two countries, and their role in ensuring wellbeing in retirement...|$|R

This reform exogenously affected the cost of <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> for firms whose executives had accumulated pensions benefits in excess of the prescribed limit. We find a strong reaction in the form of <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> in a sample of UK executive directors. After A-day, many executives saw their defined benefit scheme replaced with supplementary cash payments. This had the unintended consequence of significantly decreasing the relationship between executive pay and firm performance for those executives affected by the reform...|$|R
