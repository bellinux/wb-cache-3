When Fred showed definitive signs of strengthening, the alerts were replaced by a hurricane warning, marking the first occasion of a hurricane-level notice in the nation's history. On the morning of August31, TACV Cabo Verde Airlines suspended its flights from the capital of Praia to Dakar; all operations at the airports of Boa Vista, Sal, and São Vicente were halted soon after squalls began to spread across the islands.

In July 1779 Haider Ali headed an army of 80,000, mostly cavalry, descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages, before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot starting the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Haider Ali had some initial successes against the British notably at Pollilur, the worst defeat the British suffered in India until Chillianwala, and Arcot, until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote, when {{the fortunes of the}} British began to change. On 1 June 1781 Sir Eyre Coote struck the first heavy blow against Haider Ali in the decisive Battle of <b>Porto</b> <b>Novo.</b> The battle was won by Sir Eyre Coote against odds of five to one, and is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest feats of the British in India. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (the scene of an earlier triumph of Haider Ali over a British force) on 27 August, in which the British won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. Haider Ali died on 7 December 1782, even as fighting continued with the British.

The relationship between the concentration of suspended sediment and discharge of water had not a very good correlation (R 2 = 0, 56) and hysteresis effect is quite clear. The justification for this behavior is given by the heterogeneity of the hydrological regime and basin occupation. There were no significant changes in annual flows which have remained the same during the study period. Already the discharge of suspended sediment showed a small gradual decline in which the end of the period (2007), the river carries less than 0. 65 Mton at the beginning (1977).

Failed to explain clearly, but the deployment of a new port, but to expand the port of Fortaleza to consolidate its integration with Industrial District PajuÃara. With the state policy of strengthening the local economy, but with bias to the external market, the need arose {{to build a new}} port complex. Thus, in 1995, appeared the idea of building another port located away from urban centers, with infrastructure capable of providing an industrial metal and petrochemicals, especially with a modern port terminal in a position to offer efficient operations at competitive rates and access roads Free. Opened in 2002, the Industrial and Port Complex PecÃm was modeled to meet the demand for general cargo and containers and be included in the international sea route large ships. Indeed, the creation of the Industrial and Port Complex PecÃm impacted the trade flow from CearÃ and modified the movement of goods from the port of Fortaleza. Thus, this study aims to determine the level of competitiveness of the port of Fortaleza in confrontation with the port of PecÃm. Search is thus to examine the hypothesis of complementarity of the activities of the two ports. The methodology consists of the interpretation of descriptive statistics about trade flows and, in analytical terms, the use of indicators of revealed competitive advantage in the tradition of Balassa (1965). The results show that relevant portion of the main products imported and exported through the port of Fortaleza was absorbed by the Port of PecÃm, but that over the study period, there was a significant recovery drive from the port of Fortaleza. Moreover, it appeared certain specialization in relation to economic blocs, whether in respect of export or import. Showed that the initial loss of competitiveness of the port of Fortaleza subsequently was recovered. We conclude that the ports are specializing and becoming complementary ports. O Plano de Governo do CearÃ (1987 - 1990) destacava como eixo econÃmico para o CearÃ a expansÃo industrial com a instalaÃÃo de novas plantas com escala de produÃÃo elevada.

Assim, em 1995, apareceu a ideia de construir outro porto com localizaÃÃo afastada dos centros urbanos, com infraestrutura capaz de viabilizar um parque industrial metalmecÃnico e petroquÃmico, especialmente com um terminal portuÃrio moderno em condiÃÃes de oferecer operaÃÃes eficientes, com tarifas competitivas e acessos rodoviÃrios livres. Inaugurado em 2002, o Complexo Industrial e PortuÃrio do PecÃm foi modelado para atender a demanda de cargas gerais e contÃineres e ser incluÃndo na rota marÃtima internacional de navios de grande porte.

AlÃm disso, constatou-se certa especializaÃÃo em relaÃÃo aos blocos econÃmicos, seja no aspecto da exportaÃÃo ou da importaÃÃo.
