50|$|<b>Portland</b> <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> {{contains}} up to 70 {{per cent}} of finely ground, granulated blast-furnace slag, a nonmetallic product consisting essentially of silicates and alumino-silicates of calcium.

Using slag cement to replace a portion of Portland cement in a concrete mixture is a useful method to make concrete better and more consistent. <b>Portland</b> <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> has a lighter colour, better concrete workability, easier finishability, higher compressive and flexural strength, lower permeability, improved resistance to aggressive chemicals and more consistent plastic and hardened consistency.|$|R

Eight compositions of concrete with different cements were tested. Four compositions contained hydration retarder added at 0. 3 wt% and 0. 5 wt% by mass of cement and four compositions were without the retarder. All compositions contained 0. 6 wt% of superplasticizer. 3 % NaCl solutions was used as a freezing agent in freeze-thaw tests. The mass loss (the weight of scaled material), ultrasonic pulse velocity and residual deformations were measured every seven freeze-thaw cycle. The test results showed that the highest freeze-thaw and deicing salt resistance is observed in concrete made of <b>blast-furnace</b> <b>cement</b> (CEM III/B 32. 5 N - LH) and the lowest freeze-thaw resistance is observed in concrete made of Portland cement (CEM I 42. 5 R) and Portland blast – furnace cement (CEM II/A-S 42. 2 N).

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{completely}} recyclable concrete (CRC) {{has been developed}} to close the loop. By adequately incorporating limestone aggregates and industrial by-products, the chemical composition should resemble the composiation of Portland clinker which {{enables the use of}} CRC as a raw material in Portland cement production.

CRC mixtures were produced with 50 % ordinary <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> or <b>blast-furnace</b> <b>cement.</b> At the age of one month laboratory clinker and cement were produced from the CRCs. The resulting cement has a low compressive strength and hydraulic reactivity caused by a high belite content, so corrections were necessary.

Two blends made of PSC and CKD, improved by SF and two blends made of PSC and CKD improved by RHA were investigated. Hardened blended cement pastes were prepared from each cement blend by using water/cement ratio (W/C) of 0. 30 by weight and hydrated for various curing ages of 1, 3, 7, 28 and 90 days at the normal curing conditions under tap water at room temperature. Each cement paste was tested for its physico-chemical and mechanical characteristics; these characteristics include: compressive strength and kinetics of hydration. The phase composition of the formed hydration products was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). It {{was found that the}} partial substitution of PSC by 10 % and 15 % of CKD is associated with an increase in the rate of hydration and a subsequent improvement of compressive strength of hardened PSC–CKD pastes.

40|$|More {{than forty}} years ago in 1957, the first {{publication}} was published in The Netherlands indicating the possibility of damage due to ASR in a concrete structure. About ten years ago however the first concrete structure in the Netherlands with alkali-silica reaction (ASR) was documented. During the years before it was generally believed {{that this type of}} damage was not present in the Netherlands. In 1999, dozens of concrete structures have been proved to suffer from ASR. These structures have ages from 15 to 60 years. The types of structures vary from road bridges, water locks, bunkers, buildings etc. All structures have been made of portland cement concrete or concrete made of portland cement with a low content of blast furnace slag, the so called <b>portland</b> <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement.</b> For the evaluation of these structures the procedure of the Institution of Structural Engi-neers (ISE) has been adopted. The procedure will be modified to Dutch circumstances such as the concrete codes. Further some improvements are made in the draft of the new proce-dure as well as a partly more strict formulation. The modified procedure has been evaluated during a project on twenty different con-crete bridges in highway A 59 that were suspected of suffering from ASR. It was found that most of the structures have an extremely low uniaxial tensile strength. This observa-tion had a big impact on the maintenance strategy, more than is necessary according to the ISE procedure on basis of the other observations. This paper covers the different aspects of analysis of the affected structures, laboratory experimental research, structural aspects, and remedial measures taken to re-strengthen some of the bridges, rehabilitation, and monitoring of these structures...|$|R

The slump didn't changed by PP fiber volume 5 kgf/m because of flexibility of fiber in despite of loose mixing. The reason why the slump decreased steadily by PP fiber volume 3 kgf/m was rising contact surface of water. The compressed strength indicated a range of 19. 49 ∼ 26. 32 MPa. The tensile strength indicated a range of 2. 10 ∼ 2. 44 MPa. The bending strength was stronger about 3 ∼ 16 % in case of mixing with PP fiber volume than normal concrete.

40|$|In {{order to}} limit the release of CO 2 {{produced}} in cement manufacturing, clinker (the major cement component) is often partially replaced by mineral admixtures like blastfurnace slag. The use of mineral admixtures presents different advantages such as the recycling of industrial waste and the improvement of different material properties (workability, sulfate resistance, compressive strength at long term 8 ̆ 5). Nevertheless, several civil engineering constructions made with <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> presented cracking at early age due to restrained shrinkage (autogeneous, thermal and drying shrinkage) that affects significantly the material transfer properties and their durability in aggressive environments (chloride, CO 2).

40|$|The {{setting of}} mortar or {{concrete}} can be {{monitored by measuring}} the velocity of ultrasonic p-waves sent through a fresh sample at regular intervals. However, the wave energy or the frequency spectrum might contain even more information. To investigate their use in the characterization of setting behaviour, ultrasonic measurements were performed on concrete and mortar mixtures with an increasing percentage blast-furnace slag or fly ash and on mixtures with several types of <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement.</b> The change of the received energy in time was compared to {{the result of the}} penetration resistance test and the frequency spectra were collected in a three-way array (sample x frequency x concrete age) and analysed with multi-way techniques (PARAFAC and PARAFAC 2) to quantify mutual differences. The change of the energy during setting was {{similar to that of the}} ultrasonic velocity. Replacement of <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> by <b>blast-furnace</b> slag or fly ash causes retardation in the increase of both quantities.

40|$|Cement-superplasticizer {{compatibility}} {{has become}} a major area of interest due to the increasing use of high performance and self-compacting concrete mixtures. The interaction between superplasticizer and cement can cause significant retardation effects on the hydration and setting properties of cement. However, not much data have been published to quantify this. In this study, mortar mixtures with three cement types and two different superplasticizers were tested by calorimetric and ultrasonic measurements to investigate the effects on both hydration and setting. Also the strength of the mortar samples was tested. The types of superplasticizers used, were polycondensates of naphtalene sulphonate (PNS) and polycarboxylic ethers (PCE). Based on the ultrasonic measurements, the addition of PCE and PNS caused an initial setting retardation of approximately 1. 2 and 3. 4 h on the portland cement, 1. 9 and 4. 8 h on the portland-fly ash cement and 0. 5 and 1. 6 h on the <b>blast-furnace</b> <b>cement</b> mixtures. This difference decreased after 16 to 20 h when the stiffness development of the samples with PNS or PCE approached the mixtures without superplasticizers. Similar to the setting, the release of the heat of hydration was more postponed by the addition of PNS than by PCE. Contrary to PNS, PCE benefited the strength of the mortar mixtures. Generally, the effect of the superplasticizers clearly differed according to the cement type in the mixture...|$|R

A low-alkali Portland cement was also tested as ASR inhibitor. The results of the mortar and concrete expansion tests were analyzed through a kinetic-based model (KAMJ model) to evaluate the expansion rate constant, k, and the Avrami exponent M. These two kinetic parameters were taken as efficacy parameters {{for each type of}} inhibitor. The results of the concrete prism expansion tests were also analyzed through an innovative methodological approach and a third efficacy parameter, such as the potential minimum alkali contribution by the inhibitor to concrete (Lim), was evaluated. It was found that the values of ln(k) mb =- 6. 0 for mortar bars and ln(k) cp = - 7. 7 for concrete prisms were appropriate efficacy criteria for discriminating between deleteriously expansive and non-deleteriously expansive mortar or concrete mixes, respectively. In the case of concrete mixes, a good relationship between the efficacy parameter Lim and the kinetic parameter Mcp was found, thus demonstrating the suitability of Mcp as a criterion for ranking not expansive concrete mixes. With respect to the kinetic parameters ln(k) cp and Mcp, the efficacy parameter Lim appears to be of greater technological interest, the last being strictly related to the composition of the concrete mix...|$|R

With increasing BFS content, the second peak in the heat production rate under isothermal conditions appears earlier and a third peak attributed to the hydration of BFS becomes clearer. This slag reaction can also be observed as a second steep increase in the ultrasonic velocity curves. Thus, BFS clearly influences the early hydration and setting of the concrete mixtures...|$|R

40|$|Blast-furnace slag, a {{by-product}} of the steel production, can partly replace Portland cement in concrete mixtures. A great advantage of these mixtures is the decreasing total heat production with increasing blast-furnace slag content so that the risk on early age crack formation is reduced. However, {{the effect of the}} slag on the hydration process is still not entirely known. In this study, existing hydration models are optimized. Therefore, isothermal hydration tests (10 °C, 20 °C and 35 °C) and semi-adiabatic hydration tests were performed on cement pastes or mortars with blast-furnace slag to cementitious material ratios ranging from O % to 85 %. The blast-furnace slag was added as a separate component to the mixture.

The other series of samples were made of cements (OPC, GGBSC and SRPC). The hardened samples were cyclically immersed in 10 m % NaCl solution (for 1 day) then kept at 100 % relative humidity (for 1 day) between the age of 28 and 38 days, respectively. Both Kuzel’s salt and Friedel’s salt were detectable in 10 / 1, 10 / 2 and 10 / 3 samples of aluminates and gypsum. Both non-steam cured and steam cured samples at 60 and 90 °C indicated decreasing tendencies for the formation of Friedel’s salt with the increased amount of gypsum. Formation of Kuzel’s salt increases the total chemically bound chloride content. We observed in steam cured samples higher amount of Friedel’s salt that those of non-steam cured samples of aluminates/gypsum. The highest amount of chemically bound chloride content in form of Friedel’s salt was found in the samples of GGBSC (ground granulated <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement)</b> steam cured at 90 ºC.

This paper reports the strength development of 16 full-scale columns containing 0 to 70 % slag as the binder with compressive strengths ranging from 40 to 100 MPa. The compressive strengths were evaluated by securing cores in the columns. Further, the influences of curing temperature and moisture availability were systematically studied by subjecting standard cylinder specimens to temperaturematched and sealed curing conditions. Altogether, 1250 specimens were tested, 800 of which were cores. The study shows that the inplace strength of the concrete with slag blends is significantly less than the standard-cured cylinders. Also, sealed curing is the most representative of the in-place curing conditions when compared with temperature-matched curing and standard curing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Widespread use {{of glass}} fibre {{reinforced}} cement (GRC) has been impeded by concerns over its durability. Three degradation mechanisms are proposed - fibre corrosion, Ca(OHh precipitation and matrix densification - although their relative importance is debated. Matrices with reduced alkalinities and Ca(OH) 2 contents are being developed; {{the aim of}} this study was to investigate their hydration and interaction with alkali-resistant fibres to determine the factors controlling their long-term durability, and assess the relevancy of accelerated ageing. The matrices studied were: OPC/calcium-sulphoaluminate cement plus metakaolin (C); OPC plus metakaolin (M); <b>blast-furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> plus a micro-silica based additive (D); and OPC (O). Accelerated ageing included hot water and cyclic regimes prior to tensile testing. Investigations included pore solution expression, XRD, DTA/TG, SEM and optical petrography. Bond strength was determined from crack spacings using microstructural parameters obtained from a unique image analysis technique. It was found that, for the new matrices - pore solution alkalinities were lower; Ca(OH) 2 was absent or quickly consumed; different hydrates were formed at higher immersion temperatures; degradation under 65 °C immersion was an order of magnitude slower, and no interfilamental Ca(OH) 2 was observed. It was concluded that: fibre weakening caused by flaw growth was the primary degradation mechanism and was successfully modelled on stress corrosion/static fatigue principles. OPC inferiority was attributed partly to its higher alkalinity but chiefly to the growth of Ca(OH) 2 aggravating the degradation; and hot water ageing although useful in model formulation and contrasting the matrices, changed the intrinsic nature of the composites rather than simply accelerating the degradation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The advisability of {{controlling}} the temperature rise and fall in concrete at early age is well recognised, and the choice of an appropriate low-heat cement with suitable heat of hydration characteristics can assist in this control. This is particularly pertinent with respect to water-retaining and massive concrete structures, where the need to prevent early-age thermal cracking is paramount. <b>Portland</b> cement/ground granulated <b>blast-furnace</b> slag (PC/ggbs) or PC/fly ash cements are often used in these structures because of their low heat of hydration properties.

Current UK guidance normally requires knowledge of the proportion of ggbs or fly ash. Such information may not be available when using the recently published European standards for low-heat cements. To provide design data for these materials, cements just meeting the limiting heats of hydration for the low-heat and very low-heat classes were simulated.

40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} is defined for commercializing slags arising as by-products of steelmaking, {{and this is}} used to develop certain products. The outcome of the present work comprised three products or groups of products: 1) slag-based binding agents, 2) a road structure improved by means of stabilization with such binding agents, and 3) a procedure for designing stabilized structures. The commercialization procedure was drawn up by examining the technical properties of the initial materials, excluding environmental acceptability and the mechanisms of their chemical reactions. The research proceeded in stages, of which {{the first was a}} reconsideration of the results presented in the author's licentiate thesis concerning factors affecting the stabilization of road construction aggregates with blast-furnace slag-based binding agents and their significance. This was followed by a series of experiments designed to test the validity of these results. At the third stage the selection of slag-based binding agents was extended to include LD steel slag products, while the final stage consisted of the implementation of a set of test structures and associated preliminary experiments and monitoring measurements. The binding properties of three blast-furnace slag products and three LD steel slag products, used separately or in various combinations, were examined {{in the course of this}} work, taking cement as a reference material. Materials were then eliminated as the research proceeded, either on account of their poor binding properties or on economic grounds. The final construction experiments were performed with three combinations: cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag, LD steel slag-activated granulated blast-furnace slag and a mixture of ground granulated <b>blast-furnace</b> slag and <b>cement.</b> The actual novel product among the slag-based binding agents to be introduced here is LD steel slag-activated granulated blast-furnace slag, which was found to be similar in its technical properties to cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag. Structural layers stabilized with these two binding agents showed very similar bearing capacities, although the former did not reach the same compression strengths at an age of 91 days. The reasons for these similarities lay in a larger amount of binding agent used when activated with LD steel slag and the greater thickness of the stabilized layer, factors which both tended to compensate for the poorer compression strength. The new information gained on the properties of cement-activated granulated blast-furnace slag and the mixture of ground granulated <b>blast-furnace</b> slag and <b>cement</b> opens up fresh opportunities for selecting binding agents and designing road structures. Formulae were developed here for predicting the uniaxial compression strength at 91 days, used as a stabilization criterion, from the value for a sample taken at 28 days, a technique which will speed up the assessment of stabilization results, especially when using slowly reacting slag-based binding agents...|$|R

This paper presents details of a study dealing with the influences of drying–wetting cycle on the dry density, pH, unconfined compressive strength (qu) and secant modulus (E 50) of GGBS–MgO-stabilised kaolin clay. For the purpose of comparison, the conventional Portland cement (PC) -stabilised kaolin clay is selected as a control sample.

The variations in dry density, mass loss, pH, qu and E 50 with drying–wetting cycle are discussed. The {{results show that the}} GGBS–MgO-stabilised kaolin clay display higher dry density (~ 1 – 7 %) and lower mass loss (~ 10 – 30 %) than the PC-stabilised kaolin clay. The pH values and qu of the GGBS–MgO-and PC-stabilised kaolin clay decrease with the increase of drying–wetting cycle. When cured for 93 – 120 days under the controlled temperature of 20 °C and relative humidity of 95 %, the GGBS–MgO-stabilised kaolin clay exhibits higher (~ 1. 5 times) qu than the PC-stabilised kaolin clay. However, when the drying–wetting cycle exceeds forth, the GGBS–MgO-stabilised kaolin clay displays lower qu or E 50 than the PC-stabilised kaolin clay. The measured soil pH has a good linear relationship with qu of the soils that experienced drying–wetting durability tests. Finally, the mechanisms underneath the gradual loss of qu or E 50 with increasing drying–wetting cycle are discussed...|$|R
