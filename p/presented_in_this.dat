25|$|Following a phenomenological {{study of}} nine {{individuals}} involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain {{as central to}} their experience, sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much {{as described in the}} descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversial}} Palmyrene inscription records Septimius Antiochus, [...] "Zenobia's son". He {{may have}} been Vaballathus' younger brother, or was <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner for political reasons; Antiochus was proclaimed emperor in 273, when Palmyra revolted against Rome for a second time. If Antiochus was a son of Zenobia, he was probably a young child not fathered by Odaenathus; Zosimus described him as insignificant, appropriate for a five-year-old boy.|$|E

The Chamber also recalls that Milošević provided assistance {{in the form of}} personnel, provisions, and arms to the Bosnian Serbs during the conflict. Based on the evidence before the Chamber regarding the diverging interests that emerged between the Bosnian Serb and Serbian leaderships during the conflict and in particular, however, Milošević’s repeated criticism and disapproval of the policies and decisions made by the Accused and the Bosnian Serb leadership, the Chamber is not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case to find that Slobodan Milošević agreed with the common plan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recombinant antithrombins with {{properties}} {{similar to}} those of normal human antithrombin have been produced using baculovirus-infected insect cells and mammalian cell lines grown in cell culture.
