Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{article on}} the Geiger-Muller tube carries a more {{detailed}} account of the techniques used to detect <b>photon</b> <b>radiation.</b> For high energy gamma it largely relies on interaction of the <b>photon</b> <b>radiation</b> with the tube wall material, usually 1–2mm of chrome steel on a [...] "thick-walled" [...] tube, to produce electrons within the wall which can enter and ionize the fill gas. This is necessary as the low-pressure gas in the tube has little interaction with high energy gamma photons. However, for low energy photons there is greater gas interaction and the direct gas ionisation effect increases. With decreasing energy the wall effect gives way {{to a combination of}} wall effect and direct ionisation, until direct gas ionisation dominates. Due to the variance in response to different photon energies, windowless tubes employ what is known as [...] "energy compensation" [...] which attempts to compensate for these variations over a large energy range.|$|E

It is shown that reabsorption and multiple scattering of spontaneous <b>photons</b> (<b>radiation</b> trapping) can substantially slow down the rate of optical pumping.

50|$|Increasing mAs causes more <b>photons</b> (<b>radiation)</b> of the {{particular}} kVp energy, to be produced. This is helpful when larger parts are imaged, because they require more photons. The more photons {{you can get to}} pass through a particular tissue type (whose kVp is interacting at the cellular level) will result in a statistically increased amount of photons reaching the image receptor. The more photons that pass through a part, and reach the image receptor with pertinent information - the more useful the density is created on the resulting image. Conversely, lower mAs creates less photons, which will decrease density, but is helpful when you image smaller parts.|$|R

Within one-dimensional input-output theory, the propagators of the photons are derived analytically and the up-conversion probability is calculated numerically.

We also find that the enhancement becomes further pronounced for some balanced system parameters such as the quantum correlation between <b>photons,</b> <b>radiation</b> decay rates and coupling between the nanostructure and molecule. The non-monotonic dependencies are reasonably explained in view of quantum interference between the coupled modes of the whole system.
