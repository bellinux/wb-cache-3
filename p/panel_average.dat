40|$|Product {{classification}} {{based on}} sensory evaluations {{can play an}} important role in quality control or typicality assessment. Unfortunately its real world applications face the difficulties related to the cost of a proper sensory approach. To partially overcome these issues we propose to build discriminant models based on the evaluation of single assessors and develop an appropriate method to combine them. We compare this new strategy with the more traditional one based on the <b>panel</b> <b>average.</b> We consider as applicative examples two datasets obtained from the sensory assessment of diverse cheese typologies from North Italy by two different panels. Also, we apply diverse, innovative and noise-resistant discriminant methods (random forest, penalized discriminant analysis and discriminant partial least squares) to show that our new strategy based on modeling each individual assessor is efficient and that this result is independent of the classifier being used. The main finding of our work is that using noise-resistant multivariate methods, product discrimination based on the combination of independent models built for each assessor is never worse than discrimination based on <b>panel</b> <b>average</b> and that the error reduction is higher in the case of low consonance between assessors. Experiments on the same datasets adding random uniform values (noise) with different intensities support these findings. We also discuss a demonstrative experiment using different sets of attributes for each assessor. Overall, our results suggest that, if the goal is product classification, the consonance among assessors or even the use of the same vocabulary seem not necessary, the key factor being the discrimination capability and repeatability of each judge...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{integration}} process within the European Union retail banking sector during the period 1991 - 2008 by analysing deposit and lending rates to households. An important contribution of the paper is the application of the recently developed Phillips and Sul (2007 a) panel convergence methodology which has not hitherto been employed in this area. This method analyses the degree as well as the speed of convergence, identifies the presence of club formation, and measures the behaviour of each country???s transition path relative to the <b>panel</b> <b>average.</b> We find evidence supporting integration in the deposit and short-term mortgage markets but not in the consumer credit market and longer term mortgages.

40|$|Abstract: In-plane density {{variations}} {{exist in}} oriented strandboards (OSB) due to random flake deposition in mat forming. The integrity of structural {{performance of the}} board in service depends {{on the degree of}} homogeneity of its horizontal density. In this paper, non-contact ultrasound (NCU – air-coupled) in through transmission was used specifically to correlate the NCU parameters to the spatial density elements for the laboratory-made southern pine OSB. Test boards consisted of two replicates at each of three resin content and three nominal density levels. The state-of-the-art scanner with high transduction NCU transducers were used to locate and map spatially the internal structure distribution of each board type. NCU variables velocity and attenuation are effective to predict density for all resin content and density levels. The predicted average density on each grid in the panel was in situ validated within ± 10 % tolerance limit from the <b>panel</b> <b>average</b> density. Control charts and spatial graphic plots produced reasonable resemblance to the measured density distributions in OSB. NCU is therefore a sensitive tool to characterize the local representation of internal properties of the wood composites and other biofiber-based particleboards as well.

Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) {{is a method}} for relating one data matrix to another data matrix, via bi-linear low-rank regression modelling. The merger of these methods proposed aims to produce an average (e. g. a sensory group <b>panel</b> <b>average),</b> which balances an "intersubjective", internal consensus between the individual assessors' data against an "objective" external correspondence between the sensory data and other types of data on the same samples (e. g. design information, chemical or physical measurements or consumer data). Several ways of merging GPA with PLSR are possible, of which one is selected and applied. The proposed "GP-PLSW" method is compared to a conventional GPA followed by an independent PLSR, using a data set about milk samples assessed by a group of sensory judges with respect to a set of sensory descriptor terms, and also characterised by experimental design information about the samples. The GP-PLSR gave a more design-relevant group average than traditional GPA. The proposed algorithm was tested under artificially increased noise levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

A three-years trial was carried out in the DOC area "Colli Orientali del Friuli", north-eastern Italy. The rootstocks mainly affected productivity and little differences were observed in the quality parameters; in fact, 161. 49, SO 4 and 420 A showed higher yields in comparison with Fercal and Kober 5 BB, while little differences in sugars were assessed.

Single, connected and concrete-filled 2. 13 m panels were tested to failure {{with the objective}} of determining their moment capacity and failure mechanism. As the uniform load test procedure utilized in this study allowed for the prevention of premature local crushing behaviour within the span, the average moment capacity obtained in this study was more than double that found in prior studies of FRP sheet pile <b>panels,</b> <b>averaging</b> 11. 15 kN. m in single panel tests and 9. 32 kN. m in connected panel tests. Single panels exhibited little difference in moment capacity whether tested in the upright or inverted orientation and there was no apparent reduction in capacity when a single panel was subjected to repeated load cycles.

40|$|Madeira wine is a {{fortified}} wine with {{impact in the}} Madeira Island’s economy. Similarly to other wines, its acidity should be well controlled {{in order to ensure}} Madeira wine quality, mostly the volatile acidity. Due to Madeira wine complex flavour, it is crucial to get a better knowledge about the volatile acidity impact in its features, namely determine the perception limit of acetic acid and ethyl acetate, as both are the main contributors for volatile acidity. Firstly, the olfactory perception threshold of volatile acidity was assessed by a trained and an untrained panel, using 5 and 10 years-old Sercial and Malvasia wines. Moreover, the current work also presents the evolution of organic acids, acetic acid and ethyl acetate during 540 days of ageing of Madeira wines (Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho and Sercial), comparing the same wines aged by both traditional ageing processes: canteiro and estufagem. Other wine samples, aged in wood casks (canteiro) for at least 5 years, were also evaluated. HS-SPME followed by GC-MS analysis was used to determine ethyl acetate concentration and IEC-HPLC-DAD was used for the organic acids determination, including acetic acid. The results indicated that acetic acid and ethyl acetate olfactory perception threshold depends essentially on wine’s age. Concerning acetic acid, the untrained <b>panel</b> was in <b>average</b> 5. 45 g/L (5 years-old) and 6. 22 g/L (10 years-old).
