40|$|To obtain {{reliable}} 3 D measurements from photogrammetric technique imaging, cameras must be calibrated {{to determine}} {{the value of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> and various lens parameters. As zoom and auto-focus are known to change, the <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> at the instant of imaging the use of laboratory-calibrated value may produce significant measurement errors. The value of other lens parameters also may change as a result of field imaging. Research was carried out to determine a reliable technique to obtain the value of the <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> and other lens parameters in the field. This research was limited to a stereo-camera configuration where two digital cameras were used to map objects. The calibration involved simultaneous computations of the <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> and other lens parameters of both cameras using a pair of stereo-images and a temporary control panel. The objective of the paper is therefore to discuss the testing of the developed technique and demonstrate its capacity for a high-accuracy field 3 D measurement.

40|$|Recovering the {{relative}} geometry of two perspective stereo images is a classical problem in photogrammetry {{and also a}} basic problem in computer vision.

The approach recasts the explicit stereo coplanarity equation into an implicit form whose coefficients, which can be put in a coplanarity matrix, are solvable via a direct solution from the image measurements. The two <b>principal</b> <b>distances</b> (focal lengths) are then fully determined by sixth-order algebraic equations whose coefficients are fourth-order polynomials of coplanarity matrix elements.

40|$|For many photogrammetric {{applications}} involving bundle adjustments, it {{is desirable}} to have a priori knowledg of the lens distortions, both radial and decentering. For close range applications involving focussing, other interior orientation parameters of <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> {{and the location of}} the principal point may not be well known. A technique has been developed to determine the parameters of radial and decentering lens distortions for the simple style (as distinct from the more complex zoom) C-mount lenses used with an array of CCD cameras for digital photogrammetry at City University, London. It has been shown previously that the parameters of decentering distortion and the offsets of the principal point are highly correlated in convergent bundle adjustments, so the only remaining unknown of the interior orientation is the <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> (Fryer and Fraser, 1986).

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of zoom lens calibration, with emphasis {{on the effects of}} lens-image-plane misalignment. Measurements have been made of the photogrammetric principal point and radial (symmetrical) and decentering (asymmetrical) distortion components {{as a function of the}} <b>principal</b> <b>distance</b> (zoom setting) of several zoom lenses. Data were also taken with the axis of symmetry (optical axis) of a zoom lens aligned and misaligned to the same solid-state video camera. An explanation is offered regarding the variation of the principal point as a function of zoom setting based on these measurements. In addition the relationship of the decentering distortion to radial distortion, <b>principal</b> <b>distance,</b> and lens-image-plane misalignment angle is discussed. A technique for determining the proper point of symmetry to be used for distortion computations (as opposed to the principal point) is also suggested. A simple technique for measuring the misalignment angle of zoom lenses when attached to video cameras is presented, along with measurements for seven solid-state cameras. A method to reduce the additional error introduced by zoom lens misalignment is presented. The implications of this study are that special measures to properly align a zoom lens to the sensor image plane are probably not necessary, but that as the accuracy obtainable in digital photogrammetry approaches the 0. 01 or less pixel level, additional calibration including the point of symmetry for distortion computation should be considered...|$|E

Firstly, the values for the maximum <b>principal</b> stress/critical <b>distance</b> for three different epoxy-based structural adhesives have been identified from the experimental data, and the values of the required maximum <b>principal</b> stress/critical <b>distance</b> have been interpreted, with the help of SEM images, in terms of the physical mechanisms responsible for fracture.

Finally, a non-dimensional theoretical study has been undertaken to ascertain the effect of the bulk properties of the adhesive and of the parameters of the failure criterion on the predicted value of the adhesive fracture energy {{as a function of the}} bondline thickness.

Camera calibration is the analytical procedure of determining the camera’s internal parameters including the <b>principal</b> <b>distance,</b> format size, principal point, and lens distortion coefficients. Commonly adopted methods for performing this work include Zhang (1999), Heikkilä and Silvén (1997), Tsai (1987), Rüther (1989), Fraser (1997), Gruen and Beyer (2001), Bouguet (2012), PhotoModeler (Eos System Inc 2012), and CameraCalibrator (Photometrix 2012). These methods adopt a combination of linear and non-linear solving strategies where a linear method (e.g., Direct Linear Transformation) is used to recover initial approximations for the parameters, followed by a non-linear algorithm (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt) in search of refined solutions of the orientation and calibration.
