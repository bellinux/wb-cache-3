5|$|DeForest Kelley, {{the actor}} who portrayed {{physician}} Leonard McCoy on Star Trek, was a <b>personal</b> <b>favorite</b> of John Belushi. Belushi had offices on the same lot as Kelley. Kelley overheard Belushi discussing the Saturday Night Live parody of Star Trek with William Shatner, and mentioned {{to both of them}} that he had not yet seen the sketch. Belushi immediately escorted Kelley to his office on the lot and had him watch it on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Lord Dunsany, {{the tale}} was a <b>personal</b> <b>favorite</b> of Lovecraft's and has {{remained}} popular since his death. Considered {{one of the}} best short stories of Lovecraft's early period, aspects of The Cats of Ulthar would be referenced again in the author's works The Other Gods and The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. It was first published in the literary journal Tryout in November 1920 and now resides in the public domain.|$|E
5|$|Long was {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 Republican National Convention, and was a <b>personal</b> <b>favorite</b> of McKinley's for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E

5|$|Constantine XI died without {{producing}} an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen {{he might have}} been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed II after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, re-christened as Has Murad, became a <b>personal</b> <b>favorite</b> of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli.

5|$|Every three months, the Trylon Cinema {{publishes a}} full {{schedule}} of screenings, approximately 10 {{percent of which}} are of first run films.

5|$|Wizards & WarriorsIII was {{developed}} by Zippo Games' founders Ste and John Pickford, who also had a few additional programmers and artists to assist them. The Pickford brothers designed the game as a homage to Ultimate Play the Game's (Rare's former incarnation) 1983 ZXSpectrum title Atic Atac; they also drew inspiration for gameplay and art from other NES titles such as Metroid, Faxanadu, and Super Mario Bros.3. The game had moderate sales, though {{not as good as}} its predecessor Ironsword. It was praised for its bold graphics, expansive gameplay, and challenge. However, it was mostly criticized for its controls, lack of fighting, and the lack of continues or passwords. While the game received mixed reviews, Ste Pickford said that this game was his <b>personal</b> <b>favorite.</b> Zippo Games, which was acquired by Rare and was known as Rare Manchester during development, shut down shortly before this game's completion, and while the game hinted at another sequel, it has never occurred.|$|E

5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his <b>personal</b> <b>favorite,</b> as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E

25|$|Davis was {{emotional}} {{during the}} making of her next film, Dark Victory (1939), and considered abandoning it until the producer Hal B.

However, Paley's <b>personal</b> <b>favorite</b> was Gunsmoke; in fact, {{he was such a}} fan of Gunsmoke that, upon its threatened cancellation in 1967, he demanded that it be reinstated, a dictum that led to the abrupt demise of Gilligan's Island, which had already been renewed for a fourth season.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas {{was a major}} box-office star, playing {{opposite}} some of {{the leading}} actresses of that era. He played a frontier peace officer in his first western Along the Great Divide (1951). He quickly became very comfortable with riding horses and playing gunslingers, and appeared in many westerns. He considers Lonely Are the Brave (1962), in which he plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, as his <b>personal</b> <b>favorite.</b> The film, written by Dalton Trumbo, was respected by critics, but did not do well {{at the box office}} due to poor marketing and distribution.|$|E
