50|$|Psilocin (also {{known as}} 4-HO-DMT, psilocine, psilocyn, or psilotsin) is a {{substituted}} tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance.</b> It {{is present in}} most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective and resemble those of LSD and DMT.|$|E
50|$|Huxley {{wrote that}} it was {{possible}} that certain human beings could, through drugs, meditation, etc. circumvent the 'reducing valve' and experience something far beyond everyday consciousness. This experience Huxley saw as the source of all mysticism, a theory termed the Perennial philosophy. He also discusses art and the legality of various drugs in the West as well as arguing for the importance for self-transcendence. Huxley's philosophical novel Island also described a Utopian society that used a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> for spiritual purposes.|$|E

5000|$|... 'A hallucinogen' and 'a psychedelic' may refer {{correctly}} to {{the same}} substance. 'Hallucinations' and 'psychedelia' may both refer {{to the same}} aspects of subjective experience in a given instance. The term psychedelia carries an added reference to <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> culture, and 'psychedelics' are {{considered by many to}} be the 'traditional' or 'classical hallucinogens' including DMT, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin, Mescaline, and LSD. 'A hallucinogen' in this sense broadly refers to any substance which causes changes in perception or hallucinations, while psychedelics carry a positive connotation of general perceptual enhancement. In contrast to Hollister's original criteria, adverse effects may predominate with some hallucinogens with this application of the term.|$|E
50|$|Psychedelic {{agents in}} {{creative}} problem-solving experiment {{was a study}} designed to evaluate whether {{the use of a}} <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> with supportive setting can lead to improvement of performance in solving professional problems. The altered performance was measured by subjective reports, questionnaires, the obtained solutions for the professional problems and psychometric data using the Purdue Creativity, the Miller Object Visualization, and the Witkins Embedded Figures tests. This experiment was a pilot that was to be followed by control studies as part of exploratory studies on uses for psychedelic drugs, that were interrupted early in 1966 when the Food and Drug Administration declared a moratorium on research with human subjects, as a strategy in combating illicit use.|$|E
50|$|A theory, {{informed}} by neuroimaging research, that investigates and utilizes the psychedelic brain state in particular, to make inferences about other states of consciousness, is the entropic brain hypothesis by Robin L. Carhart-Harris (2014). The expression “entropy” is applied {{here in the}} context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, while high entropy is synonymous with high disorder.It is proposed that a general distinction can be made between two fundamentally different modes of cognition: primary and secondary consciousness.Primary consciousness is associated with unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics that preceded the development of modern, healthy adult, normal waking consciousness. Examples include the psychedelic state, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) or the onset phase of psychosis.Secondary consciousness is associated with constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics. Examples include normal waking consciousness, the anesthetized or the depressed state.The theory further proposes that via induction of the classic <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> psilocybin, the brain is able to enter into a primary state of consciousness (the psychedelic state) from normal waking consciousness. This “phase transition” between these fundamentally different states of consciousness is facilitated by a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (MTLs), which are normally significantly coupled.The DMN is closely associated with higher-order cognitive functions such as sub-functions of the neurological basis for the self (e.g. self-reflection, subjectivity, introspection), thinking about others (e.g. theory of mind), remembering the past and thinking about the future (e.g. episodic memory). Task-positive networks are associated with the inverse of these things, e.g., focus on and scrutiny of the external world.|$|E
50|$|The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a membership-based 501(c)(3) {{organization}} {{working to}} raise awareness and understanding of <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances.</b> MAPS was founded in 1986 by Rick Doblin, and is now based in Santa Cruz, California.|$|R

50|$|Hardison is {{committed}} to the idea of cognitive liberty or freedom of thought, the right to direct one's consciousness as one sees fit.

40|$|The {{state of}} {{consciousness}} induced by N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) {{is one of the}} most extraordinary of any naturally-occurring <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance.</b> Users consistently report the complete replacement of normal subjective experience with a novel alternate universe, often densely populated with a variety of strange objects and other highly complex visual content, including what appear to be sentient beings. The phenomenology of the DMT state is of great interest to psychology and calls for rigorous academic enquiry. The extremely short duration of DMT effects—less than 20 minutes—militates against single dose administration as the ideal model for such enquiry. Using pharmacokinetic modelling and DMT blood sampling data, we demonstrate that the unique pharmacological characteristics of DMT, which also include a rapid onset and lack of acute tolerance to its subjective effects, make it amenable to administration by target-controlled intravenous infusion. This is a technology developed to maintain a stable brain concentration of anaesthetic drugs during surgery. Simulations of our model demonstrate that this approach will allow research subjects to be induced into a stable and prolonged DMT experience, making it possible to carefully observe its psychological contents, and provide more extensive accounts for subsequent analyses. This model would also be valuable in performing functional neuroimaging, where subjects are required to remain under the influence of the drug for extended periods. Finally, target-controlled intravenous infusion of DMT may aid the development of unique psychotherapeutic applications of this psychedelic agent...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that the process of insight-oriented psychotherapy can be improved by the use of drugs, which can be described as psychedelic drugs (meaning [...] "mind-manifesting"). <b>Psychedelic</b> <b>substances,</b> such as the amphetamine MDMA, can be used in psychotherapy to reinforce and enhance the relationship between the healthcare professional and his or her client (or patient).

25|$|<b>Psychedelic</b> <b>substances</b> {{which may}} have {{therapeutic}} uses include psilocybin (the main active compound found in magic mushrooms), LSD, and mescaline (the main active compound in the peyote cactus).

50|$|As {{with many}} <b>{{psychedelic}}</b> <b>substances,</b> {{the effects of}} psychedelic mushrooms are subjective and can vary considerably among individual users.

The first 3-4 hours of the trip are typically {{referred to as the}} 'peak' in which the user experiences more vivid visuals, and distortions in reality. However, the effects can seem to last much longer to the user because of psilocybin's ability to alter time perception.|$|R
