500|$|Like the humerus, the femur is bowed, but outwards. However, characteristically, {{the bottom}} half of the femur is straight. The fourth trochanter, located halfway down the femur, is {{vertically}} tall and triangular, similar to Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other iguanodonts but dissimilar to more basal ornithopods. Like the ulna and radius, the tibia and fibula have straight shafts, and they articulate with each other; a roughened <b>projection</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the fibula fits between two bulb-like condyles located just behind the cnemial crest <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> end of the tibia. The top of the tibia is rough, indicating the presence of a cap of cartilage between the femur and tibia. The foot has [...] four digits. Like the metacarpals, the second metatarsal is curved, the third is straight, and the fourth is strongly curved. The phalanges of the foot are very stout, with the terminal phalanges near the end of each digit being particularly stout. As with the second and third claws on the hand, the second, third, and fourth claws of the foot are uniformly broad, flat, and hoof-like.|$|R
40|$|The {{daily and}} {{seasonal}} {{movements of the}} walleye, (Stizostedion vitreum), were studied by use of a VHF radio-tag system for three seasons each year during 1973 and 1974 in Lake Bemidji, a large eutrophic lake in north central Minnesota. The walleye moved parallel to the shore and did not show a diel on-shore and off-shore movement pattern. Submerged <b>projections</b> <b>on</b> the lake <b>bottom</b> such as rock bars or spits tended to serve as boundaries of the ranges within which the test fish moved. Large movements of tagged fish coincided with extensive periods of heavy cloud cover and precipitation. Wind speed and direction also appeared to influence fish movement especially when the fetch was large. Marked daily changes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration did not occur, and, thus, {{had little effect on}} the movement of test fish. There were slight seasonal changes in the extent of the daily movement of test fish, but the depth ranges shown by the tagged fish did not change greatly for each season...|$|R
40|$|In the {{construction}} of dams and in protection of civil engineering works in water courses often use is made of dumped stones. The dumping process can be divided in two stages. During the first stage the resulting mound of stones <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the water course is built up vertically. In the second stage the stones are under the angle of repose and increase of height of the mound can only be accomplished together {{with an increase in}} width of the basis. In the dumping process four sub-processes can be distinguished, i. e. the positioning of the dumping vessel, the start of the falling process, the falling process itself and jumping and rolling of the stones that hit the bottom. Three different partial processes can take place during the falling process. The first one is a (semi-) diffusion process, which results in a swinging motion of a singular stone. The mathematical description of this process is called the "Single Stone Model". On average the distance of the final position of the stones, measured from the <b>projection</b> <b>on</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the point where the fall is started is zero. The spreading ofthe stones is proportional to the square root ofthe water depth. A second possible partial process is caused by the Magnus effect. A constant horizontal force is executed on the vertically falling body. The third partial process can be caused by asymmetric flow separation. This also causes a horizontal force to act on the body. Drag causes the movement to be uniform. Last two mentioned processes result in a ring- shaped mound. The diameter of the ring is proportional to the water depth. The mathematical model of this process is called the "ring model". In practice all processes will take place. The mathematical descriptions can be combined in a combination model.

Additionally, other traits are relatively rare in pliosaurids and thus their combination in Anguanax distinguishes it from other pliosaurids.

40|$|Since {{leadership}} styles {{have been}} most commonly {{defined in terms of}} interpersonal influence, one would assume that they have their main <b>projections</b> <b>on</b> the interpersonal circumplex. In this study, the relations between leadership styles from the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and Leader Behaviour Description Questionnaire and both interpersonal and HEXACO personality scales are investigated. As expected, charismatic leadership and leader's consideration have strong <b>projections</b> <b>on</b> the interpersonal circumplex, with main <b>projections</b> <b>on</b> the warm-agreeable octant. Transactional leadership, passive leadership, and task-oriented leadership have considerably weaker or no <b>projections</b> <b>on</b> the circumplex. Leader's consideration is most strongly related to interpersonal personality while both transactional and passive leadership are most strongly related to non-interpersonal personality. It is concluded that especially charismatic leadership and leader's consideration are captured almost fully by the HEXACO personality inventory. Copyright © 2008 SAGE Publications...|$|R
