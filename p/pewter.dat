5|$|There were {{advances}} in manufacturing, {{especially in the}} South and West. Despite some French attacks, the war created much coastal prosperity thanks to the huge expenditure on shipbuilding during the war, and the South-West also became a centre for English piracy against foreign vessels. Metalworking continued to grow, and in particular <b>pewter</b> working, which generated exports second only to cloth. By the 15th century <b>pewter</b> working in London was a large industry, with a hundred <b>pewter</b> workers recorded in London alone, and <b>pewter</b> working had also spread from the capital to eleven major cities across England. London goldsmithing remained significant but saw relatively little growth, with around 150 goldsmiths working in London during the period. Iron-working continued to expand and in 1509 the first cast-iron cannon was made in England. This {{was reflected in the}} rapid {{growth in the number of}} iron-working guilds, from three in 1300 to fourteen by 1422.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 {{recorded}} a chalice and a paten dating from 1823. It recorded that a <b>pewter</b> flagon, known from church records {{to have been}} owned by the church from 1739 to 1834, was lost.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{extensively}} discusses metals {{starting with}} {{gold and silver}} (Book XXXIII), and then the base metals copper, mercury, lead, tin and iron, {{as well as their}} many alloys such as electrum, bronze, <b>pewter,</b> and steel (Book XXXIV).|$|E
50|$|Older <b>pewters</b> {{with higher}} lead content are heavier, tarnish faster, and {{oxidation}} {{gives them a}} darker silver-gray color. <b>Pewters</b> containing lead are no longer used in items (such as cups, plates, or jewelry) that will {{come in contact with}} the human body due to health concerns stemming from the lead content. Modern <b>pewters</b> are available that are completely free of lead, although many <b>pewters</b> containing lead are still being produced for other purposes.|$|R

50|$|Each March, the 32 {{selected}} players {{receive their}} Ed Block Courage Award at a banquet held in Baltimore. Past recipients include Sam Hurd, Robbie Gould, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning, and Dan Marino. The award trophy {{itself is a}} <b>pewtered</b> football helmet with the recipient's team logo and engraved with the player's name, team and year.|$|R
5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases. The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter Ogata K≈çrin. He {{was the first to}} use mother of pearl and <b>pewter</b> in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.|$|E
5|$|A 1937 {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a {{rectangular}} font made of gritstone, of unknown date, and a memorial to a Sion Evan and his son Evan Jones, who died in 1790 and 1822 respectively. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a chalice and paten made of Britannia metal (a <b>pewter</b> alloy), and an electro-plated set of communion vessels. It noted that the old silver communion service had been stolen.|$|E
5|$|Assay Commission medals {{were struck}} {{from a variety}} of metals, {{including}} copper, silver, bronze, and <b>pewter.</b> The first Assay Commission medals were struck in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. The nascent custom lapsed when Snowden left office in 1861.|$|E
50|$|Colonel <b>Pewter's</b> adventures were {{published}} in Britain, beginning in the News Chronicle (1952), The Daily Mail (after a takeover in 1960), and then The Guardian (1964-1970). Horner was Australian, but as he lived at various times in England and Australia, {{the appearance of the}} strip in both countries isn't surprising. The entire run appeared in the Melbourne Age.|$|R
50|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{building}} construction, lead-acid batteries, bullets and shots, weights, as part of solders, <b>pewters,</b> fusible alloys and as a radiation shield. Lead has the highest atomic number {{of all of the}} stable elements, although the next higher element, bismuth, has a half-life that is so long (much longer than the age of the universe) that it can be considered stable. Its four stable isotopes have 82 protons, a magic number in the nuclear shell model of atomic nuclei.|$|R
50|$|Lead {{has several}} {{properties}} {{that make it}} useful: high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness to oxidation. Combined with relative abundance and low cost, these factors resulted in the extensive use of lead in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, <b>pewters,</b> fusible alloys, and radiation shielding. In the late 19th century, lead was recognized as highly toxic, and since then it has been phased out for many applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damaging the nervous system and causing brain disorders and, in mammals, blood disorders.|$|R
5|$|At the 2009 U.S. Championships, Lysacek placed {{second in}} the short program, 2.81 points behind leader Jeremy Abbott and 7.42 points ahead of third-place {{finisher}} Parker Pennington. In the free skate, Lysacek fell on his quadruple combination attempt and placed fourth in that segment of the competition. He won the bronze medal overall, placing 0.60 points behind silver medalist Brandon Mroz and 7.70 points ahead of <b>pewter</b> medalist Ryan Bradley. Due to his placement at the U.S. Championships, Lysacek {{was named to the}} teams to the 2009 Four Continents Championships and the 2009 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a <b>pewter</b> tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, <b>pewter</b> and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
6000|$|... "At New York, yes, {{where we}} are {{infected}} with the foreign singleness more than at Boston. Perhaps a still livelier illustration of our ironical temperament was given me once before when I brought some things into Boston. There were some Swiss <b>pewters,</b> which the officers joined {{me for a moment}} in trying to make out were more than two hundred years old; but failing, jocosely levied thirty per cent. ad valorem on them; and then in the same gay spirit taxed me twenty per cent. on a medallion of myself done by an American sculptor, who had forgotten to verify an invoice of it before the American consul at the port of shipment." ...|$|R
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, <b>pewters,</b> fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Jan and Dean made an {{appearance}} at the Hollywood Palladium, as part of Jim <b>Pewter's</b> [...] "Surfer's Stomp" [...] reunion, in which the duo attempted to lip sync [...] "Surf City," [...] but the backing track failed, and they were booed off stage. The duo's first live performance after Berry's accident occurred at the Palomino Nightclub in North Hollywood on June 5, 1976, {{ten years after the}} accident, as guests of Disneyland regulars Papa Doo Run Run. Their first actual multi-song concert billed as Jan and Dean took place in 1978 in New York City at the Palladium as part of the Murray the K Brooklyn Fox Reunion Show. This was followed by a handful of East Coast shows as guests of their longtime friends the Beach Boys. Four nationwide J & D headlining tours followed through 1980. Jan was still suffering the effects of his 1966 accident, with partial paralysis and aphasia. He had a noticeable limp and his right arm was useless. In addition, his speech was slowed down a bit to keep up with his still almost genius IQ.|$|R
5|$|In 1906, {{a survey}} of church plate within the Bangor diocese {{recorded}} that St Nidan's had a silver chalice and alms dish. These were donated probably in 1701 and remade in 1871‚Äì72. It also had a silver paten and two cruets with silver handles, all marked with the date 1871‚Äì72. Records from the 19th century indicated that two tankards (one silver, one <b>pewter)</b> and a silver chalice had been lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Lysacek won the U.S. {{national}} title at the Juvenile level ‚Äì the lowest qualifying {{level in the}} U.S. Figure Skating competition structure. In 1997, he moved up to Intermediate and won the <b>pewter</b> medal (fourth place) at the Junior Olympics, after winning both his regional and his sectional qualifying competitions. After failing to qualify for Nationals on the novice level in 1998, Lysacek won the U.S. Novice title at the 1999 U.S. Championships {{at the age of}} thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} prismatic obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. <b>Pewter</b> objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates.|$|E
60|$|We {{looked out}} the {{topography}} of Middleshire in a county-guide, which spoke highly, as the phrase is, of Lackley Park, and took up our abode, our journey ended, at a wayside inn where, {{in the days of}} leisure, the coach must have stopped for luncheon and burnished <b>pewters</b> of rustic ale been handed up as straight as possible to outsiders athirst with the sense of speed. We stopped here for mere gaping joy of its steep-thatched roof, its latticed windows, its hospitable porch, and allowed a couple of days to elapse in vague undirected strolls and sweet sentimental observance of the land before approaching the particular business that had drawn us on. The region I allude to is a compendium of the general physiognomy of England. The noble friendliness of the scenery, its latent old-friendliness, the way we scarcely knew whether we were looking at it for the first or the last time, made it arrest us at every step. The countryside, in the full warm rains of the last of April, had burst into sudden perfect spring. The dark walls of the hedgerows had turned into blooming screens, the sodden verdure of lawn and meadow been washed over with a lighter brush. We went forth without loss of time for a long walk on the great grassy hills, smooth arrested central billows of some primitive upheaval, from the summits of which you find half England unrolled at your feet. A dozen broad counties, within the scope of your vision, commingle their green exhalations. Closely beneath us lay the dark rich hedgy flats and the copse-chequered slopes, white with the blossom of apples. At widely opposite points of the expanse two great towers of cathedrals rose sharply out of a reddish blur of habitation, taking the mild English light.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the mean}} time {{the people in}} our pension, who were so {{intelligent}} and well informed about other things, bore witness to the real security of the State, and the tranquillity of the Swiss mind generally concerning politics, by their ignorance {{of the name of}} their existing President. They believed {{he was a man of}} the name of Schultz; but it appeared that his name was not at all Schultz, when we referred the matter to our pasteur. It was from him, indeed, that I learned nearly all I knew of Swiss politics, and it was from his teaching that I became a conservative partisan in the question, then before the voters, of a national free-school law. The radicals, who, the pasteur said, wished Switzerland to attempt the role [...] "grande nation," [...] had brought forward this measure in the Federal legislature, and it was now, according to the sensible Swiss custom, to be submitted to a popular vote. It provided for the establishment of a national bureau of education, and the conservatives protested against it as the entering wedge of centralization in government affairs. They contended that in a country shared by three races and two religions education should be left as much as possible to the several cantons, which in the Swiss constitution are equivalent to our States. I am happy to say that the proposed law was overwhelmingly defeated; I am happy because I liked the pasteur so much, though when I remember the sympathetic bric-√†-brac dealer at Vevay, who was a radical, but who sold me some old <b>pewters</b> at a very low price, I can't help feeling a little sorry too. However, the Swiss still keep their old school law, under which each canton taxes itself for education, as our States do, though all share in the advantages of the universities, which are part of the public-school system.|$|R
60|$|Miss Fowler, {{in moments}} of irritation, had called Mary deadly methodical. She put on her oldest {{waterproof}} and gardening-hat and her ever-slipping goloshes, for the weather was {{on the edge of}} more rain. She gathered fire-lighters from the kitchen, a half-scuttle of coals, and a faggot of brushwood. These she wheeled in the barrow down the mossed paths to the dank little laurel shrubbery where the destructor stood under the drip of three oaks. She climbed the wire fence into the Rector's glebe just behind, and from his tenant's rick pulled two large armfuls of good hay, which she spread neatly on the fire-bars. Next, journey by journey, passing Miss Fowler's white face at the morning-room window each time, she brought down in the towel-covered clothes-basket, on the wheel-barrow, thumbed and used Hentys, Marryats, Levers, Stevensons, Baroness Orczys, Garvices, schoolbooks, and atlases, unrelated piles of the Motor Cyclist, the Light Car, and catalogues of Olympia Exhibitions; the remnants of a fleet of sailing-ships from ninepenny cutters to a three-guinea yacht; a prep.-school dressing-gown; bats from three-and-sixpence to twenty-four shillings; cricket and tennis balls; disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their twisted rails; a grey and red tin model of a submarine; a dumb gramophone and cracked records; golf-clubs that had to be broken across the knee, like his walking-sticks, and an assegai; photographs of private and public school cricket and football elevens, and his O.T.C. on the line of march; kodaks, and film-rolls; some <b>pewters,</b> and one real silver cup, for boxing competitions and Junior Hurdles; sheaves of school photographs; Miss Fowler's photograph; her own which he had borne off in fun and (good care she took not to ask!) had never returned; a playbox with a secret drawer; a load of flannels, belts, and jerseys, and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic; a packet of all the letters that Miss Fowler and she had ever written to him, kept for some absurd reason through all these years; a five-day attempt at a diary; framed pictures of racing motors in full Brooklands career, and load upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of tool-boxes, rabbit-hutches, electric batteries, tin soldiers, fret-saw outfits, and jig-saw puzzles.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, <b>pewter</b> tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and <b>pewter</b> are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a <b>pewter</b> plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include <b>pewter</b> (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50‚Äì58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40‚Äì50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium‚Äîin the form of ferroselenium (50‚Äì58% selenium)‚Äîis used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his first}} {{appearance}} on The Simpsons, Santa's Little Helper has appeared in merchandise relating to the show. On the board art of The Simpsons Clue, a 2000 board game by USAopoly based on Clue, he is shown drinking Duff Beer that has been spilled on the floor. In another board game published by USAopoly called The Simpsons Monopoly, based on Monopoly and released in 2001, the dog is featured {{as one of the}} six <b>pewter</b> playing pieces. Santa's Little Helper has also appeared in issues of Simpsons Comics, in the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, and in video games based on The Simpsons such as Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror and The Simpsons Game. In addition, the dog has been made into action figures by McFarlane Toys, action figures by Playmates Toys in the World of Springfield series, and plush toys.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventor}} Nic√©phore Ni√©pce {{produced the}} first permanent photograph on a polished <b>pewter</b> plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of √âtienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably {{to the development}} of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eug√®ne Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'h√¥tel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Ch√©ret, Eug√®ne Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries were years of {{lawlessness}} on Lundy, {{particularly during the}} ownership of Thomas Benson (1708-1772), a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom {{he was supposed to}} be deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (1694‚Äì1754) (who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall), at a rent of ¬£60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle. He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of <b>pewter</b> and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.|$|E

25|$|The new uniforms {{provided}} {{a combination of}} either red or white jerseys with either <b>pewter</b> or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white {{has been used for}} some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized <b>pewter</b> trousers.|$|E
25|$|When {{constructed}} in 1937, {{the building had}} three storeys, with an exterior made up of reinforced concrete with brick panelling. The main entrance doors were panelled with hammered <b>pewter</b> ‚Äì a white alloy that resembles tin. The company's name was executed in hammered <b>pewter,</b> {{another example of the}} architect using tin as a motif for the company. Dadoes for the staircase and entrance vestibule were made of a new material, Marbrunite, in multiple colours. A motor car garage was incorporated into the ground floor.|$|E
