25|$|A {{comparison}} of atorvastatin, <b>pravastatin</b> and simvastatin, {{based on their}} effectiveness against placebos, found, at commonly prescribed doses, no differences among the statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and lipids.|$|E
25|$|While {{no direct}} {{comparison}} exists, all statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. There do {{appear to be}} some differences between them, with simvastatin and <b>pravastatin</b> appearing superior in terms of side-effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{rosuvastatin}} on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious {{in improving the}} lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and <b>pravastatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|These drugs include {{rosuvastatin}} (CRESTOR), lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), <b>pravastatin</b> (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, {{one of the}} fungal {{sources from}} which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin).|$|E
25|$|Lovastatin {{is derived}} from a fungus source and {{simvastatin}} and <b>pravastatin</b> are chemical modifications of lovastatin {{and as a result}} do not differ much in structure from lovastatin. All three are partially reduced napthylene ring structures. Simvastatin and lovastatin are inactive lactones which must be metabolized to their active hydroxy-acid forms in order to inhibit HMGR. Type 2 statins all exist in their active hydroxy-acid forms. Fluvastatin has indole ring structure, while atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have pyrrole and pyrimidine based ring structure respectively. The lipophilic cerivastatin has a pyridine-based ring structure.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a number}} of statins are on the market: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, <b>pravastatin,</b> {{rosuvastatin}} and simvastatin. Several combination preparations of a statin and another agent, such as ezetimibe/simvastatin, are also available. In 2005, sales were estimated at US$18.7billion in the United States. The best-selling statin is atorvastatin, which in 2003 became the best-selling pharmaceutical in history. The manufacturer Pfizer reported sales of US$12.4billion in 2008. Due to patent expirations, several statins became available in 2016 as less expensive generics.|$|E
2500|$|All statins are (metabolized) by the liver, {{which causes}} their low {{systemic}} bioavailability. Lovastatin and simvastatin are administered in their lactone forms, {{which is more}} lipophilic than their free acid forms, and therefore {{they have to be}} activated by hydrolysis to the active anionic carboxylate form. Cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of the statins, with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes being the most dominant. CYP3A4 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of Fluvastatin, but CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 isoenzymes also contribute to the metabolism of Fluvastatin. Rosuvastatin is [...] metabolized to a small degree by CYP2C9 {{and to a lesser extent}} by CYP2C19 isoenzymes. <b>Pravastatin</b> is not metabolized by CYP isoenzymes to any appreciable extent. The statins that have the ability to be metabolized by multiple CYP isoenzymes may therefore avoid drug accumulation when one of the pathways is inhibited by co-administered drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Lipophilicity of the statins is {{considered}} to be quite important since the hepatoselectivity of the statins is related to their lipophilicity. [...] The more lipophilic statins tend to achieve higher levels of exposure in non-hepatic tissues, while the hydrophilic statins tend to be more hepatoselective. The difference in selectivity is because lipophilic statins passively and non-selectively diffuse into both hepatocyte and non-heptatocyte, while the hydrophilic statins rely largely on active transport into hepatocyte to exert their effects. High hepatoselectivity is thought to translate into reduced risk of adverse effects. It has been reported that the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) is important for the hepatic uptake of hydrophilic statins such as rosuvastatin and <b>pravastatin.</b> OATP-C is expressed in liver tissue on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and {{is considered}} to be a potential contributor for the low IC50 for rosuvastatin in hepatocytes. Of the marketed statins, cerivastatin was the most lipophilic and also had the largest percentage of serious adverse effects due to its ability to inhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation and as a result was voluntarily removed from the market by the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications, {{conditions}} that warrant withholding treatment with <b>pravastatin,</b> include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking <b>pravastatin</b> while pregnant {{could lead to}} birth defects. While the amount of <b>pravastatin</b> ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take <b>pravastatin</b> due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pravastatin</b> {{acts as a}} lipoprotein-lowering drug {{through two}} pathways. In the major pathway, <b>pravastatin</b> {{inhibits}} the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, <b>pravastatin</b> sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme {{is responsible for the}} conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. <b>Pravastatin</b> also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream. Overall, the result is a reduction in circulating cholesterol and LDL. A minor reduction in triglycerides and an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are common.|$|E

50|$|The {{evidence}} {{for the use of}} <b>pravastatin</b> is generally weaker than for other statins. The antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT), failed to demonstrate a difference in all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction/fatal coronary heart disease rates between patients receiving <b>pravastatin</b> 40 mg daily (a common starting dose) and those receiving usual care.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pravastatin</b> has {{undergone}} over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40-mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate <b>pravastatin</b> is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients. [...] However, side effects may occur. A doctor should be consulted if {{symptoms such as}} heartburn or headache are severe and do not go away.|$|E

50|$|Records exist of over 250,000 people treated from 1998 to 2001 {{with the}} statin drugs atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, <b>pravastatin,</b> and simvastatin. The {{incidence}} of rhabdomyolyis was 0.44 per 10,000 patients treated with statins other than cerivastatin. However, the risk was over 10-fold greater if cerivastatin was used, {{or if the}} standard statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, <b>pravastatin,</b> or simvastatin) were combined with fibrate (fenofibrate or gemfibrozil) treatment. Cerivastatin was withdrawn by its manufacturer in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Mevastatin {{has since}} been derivatized to the {{compound}} <b>pravastatin,</b> which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pravastatin</b> is {{cleared by}} the kidney, {{giving it a}} {{distinct}} advantage over other statins when a potential for drug interactions using the hepatic pathway exists.|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} of atorvastatin, <b>pravastatin</b> and simvastatin, {{based on their}} effectiveness against placebos, found, at commonly prescribed doses, no differences among the statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and lipids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pravastatin</b> (marketed as Pravachol or Selektine) is {{a member}} of the drug class of statins, used in {{combination}} with diet, exercise, and weight loss for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease.|$|E
50|$|While {{no direct}} {{comparison}} exists, all statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. There do {{appear to be}} some differences between them, with simvastatin and <b>pravastatin</b> appearing superior in terms of side-effects.|$|E
50|$|Streptomyces flavovirens is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil. Streptomyces flavovirens produces the actinomycin complex and mureidomycin. A strain of this species {{has been used to}} produce <b>pravastatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pravastatin</b> is {{primarily}} {{used for the}} treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{rosuvastatin}} on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious {{in improving the}} lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and <b>pravastatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{commonly}} used statins show somewhat similar results, but the newer statins, characterized by longer pharmacological half-lives and more cellular specificity, {{have had a}} better ratio of efficacy to lower adverse effect rates. Some researchers have suggested hydrophilic statins, such as fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and <b>pravastatin,</b> are less toxic than lipophilic statins, such as atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, but other studies have not found a connection; the risk of myopathy was suggested to be lowest with <b>pravastatin</b> and fluvastatin, probably {{because they are more}} hydrophilic and as a result have less muscle penetration. Lovastatin induces the expression of gene atrogin-1, which is believed to be responsible in promoting muscle fiber damage. Tendon rupture does not appear to occur.|$|E
50|$|LDL-lowering potency varies between agents. Cerivastatin is {{the most}} potent, (withdrawn from the market in August, 2001 due to risk of serious rhabdomyolysis) {{followed}} by (in order of decreasing potency), rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, <b>pravastatin,</b> and fluvastatin. The relative potency of pitavastatin {{has not yet been}} fully established.|$|E
50|$|Mevacor (lovastatin) is {{the first}} and most {{influential}} statin in the American market. The 1991 launch of Pravachol (<b>pravastatin),</b> the second available in the United States, and the release of Zocor (simvastatin) made Mevacor no longer the only statin on the market.In 1998, Viagra was released as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|Endo studied 6,000 compounds, {{of which}} three extrolites from a Penicillium mold showed an effect. One of them, mevastatin, {{was the first}} member of the statin class of drugs. Soon after, lovastatin, the first {{commercial}} statin, was found in the Aspergillus mold. Although mevastatin never became an approved drug, the mevastatin derivative <b>pravastatin</b> did.|$|E
50|$|The centre led the WOSCOP study (New England Journal of Medicine 1995; 333:1301-7) {{which found}} that {{treatment}} with <b>Pravastatin</b> significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction {{and the risk of}} death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolaemia and no history of myocardial infarction.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2005, Nissen {{published}} {{the results of}} the REVERSAL trial, a headto-head comparison of the statins atorvastatin (Lipitor) and <b>pravastatin</b> (Pravachol). IVUS images showed that Lipitor had effectively halted the progression of plaque buildup, but coronary disease progressed considerably in those given Pravachol. The study suggested that treatments should aim to lower LDL, or “bad” cholesterol levels as much as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Initially {{known as}} CS-514, <b>pravastatin</b> is a {{derivative}} of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc. [...] It is being marketed outside Japan by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name {{drug in the}} United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion.|$|E
50|$|These drugs include {{rosuvastatin}} (CRESTOR), lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), <b>pravastatin</b> (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, {{one of the}} fungal {{sources from}} which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pravastatin</b> {{precursor}} mevastatin can {{be extracted}} from Penicillium. Lovastatin, {{the first commercial}} statin, was extracted from a fermentation broth of Aspergillus terreus. Industrial production is now capable of producing 70 mg lovastatin per kilogram of substrate.The red yeast rice fungus, Monascus purpureus, can synthesize lovastatin, mevastatin, and the simvastatin precursor monacolin J. Zaragozic acids were isolated from ascomycota. Nicotinamide riboside, a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, is made by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
50|$|A type of anticancer drug, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), {{has been}} proposed, but their use has been mostly limited to animal models. A Phase II {{clinical}} trial using the FTI lonafarnib began in May 2007. In {{studies on the}} cells another anti-cancer drug, rapamycin, caused removal of progerin from the nuclear membrane through autophagy. It has been proved that <b>pravastatin</b> and zoledronate are effective drugs {{when it comes to}} the blocking of farnesyl group production.|$|E
50|$|Another {{theoretical}} {{interaction is}} with drugs with affinity to the transporter protein ABCG2 (also known as BCRP), such as pitavastatin, <b>pravastatin,</b> ciprofloxacin, methotrexat, and diclofenac; a {{study with the}} latter has shown no clinical relevance. A study testing possible interactions with amidase inhibitors {{is part of the}} post-authorisation development plan. There are no relevant interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes, although one inactivation pathway of safinamide seems to be mediated by CYP3A4.|$|E
