[...] There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. [...] The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched.|$|E
50|$|Typically {{these are}} caused by poor design. Where there is mixed signal {{technology}} on a printed circuit board, e.g. analogue, digital and possibly RF, it is usually necessary for a highly skilled engineer to specify the layout of where the grounds are to be interconnected. Typically the digital section will have its own ground plane to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce which can cause severe digital malfunction. But digital ground current must not pass through the analog grounding system, where voltage drop due to the finite ground impedance would cause noise to be injected into the analogue circuits. <b>Phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop</b> circuits are particularly vulnerable because the VCO loop filter circuit is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible loss of lock.|$|E
50|$|This scheme {{does not}} allow the {{addition}} of a stuffed bit as soon as it is required because the stuffable bit is in a fixed point in the frame so it is necessary to wait until the stuffable bit time slot. This wait results in “waiting time jitter” which can be arbitrarily low in frequency (i.e. down to zero) so cannot be entirely eliminated by the filtering effects of the <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop.</b> The worst possible stuffing ratio would be 1 frame in 2 as this gives a theoretical 0.5 bit of jitter so the stuffing ratio is carefully chosen to give theoretical minimum jitter. In a practical system however, the actual decision to stuff or not may be made by comparing the read address and write address of the input buffer store so the position in the frame when the decision is made varies and adds a second variable dependent on the length of the store.|$|E

40|$|This Master Thesis {{concerns}} {{theoretical and}} numerical investigations of optical clock recovery based on <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loops</b> at a bit rate of 160 Gb/s. A detailed mathematical {{model of a}} balanced optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> is described and a general time domain non-linear differential equation is derived. Based on the non-linear differential equation, numerical simulations are used to investigate {{the performance of a}} clock recovery circuit. Three loop filter types are considered: a proportional integrator, a low pass filter and an active lag filter. Furthermore, by performing a small signal analysis, simple expressions governing the stability properties and synchronization time constants are derived. In particular, these expressions point out the important effect of a time delay in the loop on the dynamic behavior. Long time delays degrade the performance of the loop and it is analyzed how the limitations due to the time delay can be minimized. Some of the conclusions of the investigations presented here are not anticipated by the classic theory of <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loops</b> and allow therefore {{a better understanding of the}} detailed characteristics of optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loops.</b> The optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> with an active lag filter results in a minimized synchronization time when there is no time delay in the loop. However, in the presence of time delay, the optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> with a proportional integrator results in a maximized allowed value of the time delay in the loop. Based on the results obtained, guidelines for the implementation of an optimized clock recovery circuit based on the balanced optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> are given...|$|R
