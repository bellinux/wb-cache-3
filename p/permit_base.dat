5000|$|Directionality, in {{molecular}} biology and biochemistry, is the end-to-end chemical orientation {{of a single}} strand of nucleic acid. In a single strand of DNA or RNA, the chemical convention of naming carbon atoms in the nucleotide sugar-ring means {{that there will be}} a 5&prime;-end, which frequently contains a phosphate group attached to the 5&prime; carbon of the ribose ring, and a 3&prime;-end (usually pronounced [...] "five prime end" [...] and [...] "three prime end"), which typically is unmodified from the ribose -OH substituent. In a DNA double helix, the strands run in opposite directions to <b>permit</b> <b>base</b> pairing between them, which is essential for replication or transcription of the encoded information.|$|E
40|$|There exist {{a number}} of {{qualitative}} constraint calculi {{that are used to}} represent and reason about temporal or spatial configurations. However, there are only very few approaches aiming to create a spatio-temporal constraint calculus. Similar to Bennett et al., we start with the spatial calculus RCC- 8 and Allen's interval calculus in order to construct a qualitative spatio-temporal calculus. As we will show, the basic calculus is NP-complete, even if we only <b>permit</b> <b>base</b> relations. When adding the restriction that the size of the spatial regions persists over time, or that changes are continuous, the calculus becomes more useful, but the satisfiability problem appears to be much harder. Nevertheless, we are able to show that satisfiability is still in NP...|$|E
40|$|The {{faithful}} and complete replication of DNA {{is necessary for}} the maintenance of genome stability. It is known, however, that replication forks stall at lesions in the DNA template and need to be processed so that replication restart can occur. In fission yeast, the Mus 81 -Eme 1 endonuclease complex (Mus 81 -Mms 4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been implicated in the processing of aberrant replication intermediates. In this report, we identify the human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe EME 1 gene and have purified the human Mus 81 -Eme 1 heterodimer. We show that Mus 81 -Eme 1 is an endonuclease that exhibits a high specificity for synthetic replication fork structures and 3 '-flaps in vitro. The nuclease cleaves Holliday junctions inefficiently (approximately 75 -fold less than flap or fork structures), although cleavage can be increased 6 -fold by the presence of homologous sequences previously shown to <b>permit</b> <b>base</b> pair "breathing. " We conclude that human Mus 81 -Eme 1 is a flap/fork endonuclease that is likely {{to play a role in}} the processing of stalled replication fork intermediates...|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} role of {{initiation}} codon context in chloroplast protein synthesis, we mutated the three nucleotides immediately upstream of the initiation codon (the − 1 triplet) of two chloroplast genes in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In prokaryotes, the − 1 triplet has been proposed to base pair with either the 530 loop of 16 S rRNA or the extended anticodon of fMet-tRNA. We found that in vivo, none of the chloroplast mutations affected mRNA stability. However, certain mutations did cause a temperature-sensitive decrease in translation and a more dramatic decrease at room temperature when combined with an AUU initiation codon. These mutations disrupt the proposed extended base pairing interaction with the fMet-tRNA anticodon loop, suggesting that this interaction may be important in vivo. Mutations that would still <b>permit</b> <b>base</b> pairing with the 530 loop of the 16 S rRNA also had {{a negative effect on}} translation, suggesting that this interaction does not occur in vivo. Extended base pairing surrounding the initiation codon may be part of a mechanism to compensate for the lack of a classic Shine-Dalgarno rRNA interaction in the translation of some chloroplast mRNAs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{innovative}} effluent point-source permitting approaches from {{an integrated}} urban wastewater system (UWWS) perspective, and demonstrates that three proposed <b>permitting</b> approaches <b>based</b> on optimal operational or control {{strategies of the}} wastewater system are effective in delivering multiple and balanced environmental benefits (water quality, GHG emissions) in a cost-efficient manner. Traditional permitting policy and current flexible permitting practices are first reviewed, and opportunities for permitting from an integrated UWWS perspective are identified. An operational strategy-based permitting approach is first developed by a four-step <b>permitting</b> framework. <b>Based</b> on integrated UWWS modelling, operational strategies are optimised with objectives including minimisation of operational cost, variability of treatment efficiency and environmental risk, subject to compliance of environmental water quality standards. As trade-offs exist between the three objectives, the optimal solutions are screened according to the decision-makers’ preference and <b>permits</b> are derived <b>based</b> on the selected solutions. The advantages of this permitting approach over the traditional regulatory method are: a) cost-effectiveness is considered in decision-making, and b) <b>permitting</b> <b>based</b> on operational strategies is more reliable in delivering desirable environmental outcomes. In the studied case, the selected operational strategies achieve over 78...|$|R
