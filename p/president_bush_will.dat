5000|$|In {{light of}} the September 11th attacks, Romero {{launched}} a national campaign called [...] "Keep America Safe and Free," [...] to protect American civil liberties and basic freedoms {{during a time of}} crisis in the US. The campaign successfully targeted the Patriot Act, achieving a number of court victories, and uncovered hundreds of thousands of documents detailing the illegal torture and abuse of detainees in US custody in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo. As a result of their successful court challenge to elements of the Patriot Act, the ACLU also forced the FBI to open files it had on antiwar groups, including the ACLU itself. Further, under Romero's leadership, the ACLU became the first organization to successfully file a legal challenge to the Bush administration's illegal NSA spying program. Shortly thereafter, Romero helped to establish the John Adams Project, in collaboration with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, to assist the under-resourced military defense lawyers in the Guantanamo military commissions. Referring to the August 17, 2006, federal court declaration that the Terrorist Surveillance Program was unconstitutional, Romero called the court's opinion [...] "another nail in the coffin in the Bush administration's legal strategy in the War on Terror". Romero, when discussing the Bush Administration once said, [...] "The eight years of <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> {{go down in history as}} one of the darkest moments in America's commitment to human rights." ...|$|E

Early results suggest that market participants strongly believe that Osama bin Ladens capture would have a substantial effect on President Bushs electoral fortunes, and interestingly that the chance of his capture peaks just before the election. More generally, these markets suggest that issues outside the campaign - like {{the state of the}} economy, and progress on the war on terror - are the key factors in the forthcoming election. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{world leaders}} {{converge}} on Rome for the Papal funeral on Friday, {{the question of}} Vatican security will be high on the Holy See’s agenda. This will be especially so given the presence of <b>President</b> George <b>Bush</b> – the first US president to attend a papal funeral – at Friday’s ceremonies. Bush’s visit has been flagged well in advance and will involve his attendance at a highly visible and choreographed set of ceremonies to which {{hundreds of thousands of}} mourners will have access. This combination of factors places the US president within a predictable itinerary in proximity to large ‘un-vetted’ crowds of civilians within a confined space. In short, <b>President</b> <b>Bush’s</b> visit <b>will</b> pose a considerable security challenge for the US intelligence community and especially for his close protection detail. In light of the international terrorist threat posed by groups such as Al Qaeda, who have a penchant for striking during sensitive religious ceremonies – such as during the Shia Ashura celebrations in Iraq and Pakistan {{over the last two years}} – the US presidential party will have to rely on close co-operation with the Vatican’s security services in order to guarantee the president’s safety. In terms of internal security the Vatican - an autonomous independent state - has its own army in the form of the Swiss Guard. Consisting of approximately 100 men, the Swiss Guard is normally associated with its striking Medici-designed uniform, renaissance helmet and mediaeval halberd – a large axe-like weapon carried during ceremonial duties. Trained in the Swiss armed forces these troops will assume a high profile role during the funeral ceremonies in the coming days...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact of {{religious}} variables on the vote in the 2004 presidential election. First we review and evaluate two theories that underlie many interpretations of religion’s role in American electoral politics, namely, the ethnoreligious and the religious restructuring perspectives. After demonstrating the strong association of both ethnoreligious and restructuring variables with vote choice and partisanship in 2004, we deploy a comprehensive classification incorporating religious affiliations, beliefs and practices that is even more successful in capturing the electoral impact of religion. We also demonstrate that religious variables were far more powerful in determining the vote in 2004 than social class, gender and other demographic traits of voters. Finally, we note some of the substantive implications of the findings for understanding public policies and policymaking. The 2004 presidential election provides an excellent laboratory for assessing religion’s role in contemporary electoral politics. Indeed, religion was involved in almost every aspect of the campaign. As one early analysis put it, <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> “showed himself <b>willing</b> to use religion forcefully to sharpen partisan divisions and highlight his own qualities as a leader,...|$|R
