5|$|After {{hearing the}} news that the United States had {{informed}} Britain it would be ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 and looking for a division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back its agenda. One piece of legislation passed was a <b>pilotage</b> law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the speaker and leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo-reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. To avoid alerting the Germans as to the location of the invasion, this work had to be undertaken over the entire European coastline. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations <b>Pilotage</b> Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He {{then moved}} to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he {{intermittently}} held {{for the next six}} years. He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord Torrington. He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and <b>pilotage,</b> and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron, Torrington. He did not however testify during Torrington's court-martial in December that year.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by {{the success}} of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion {{refurbishment}} a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the <b>pilotage</b> building and a salvage shed nearby. Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at Harrods'.|$|E

At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with bobbins to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E

25|$|On 4 October Nelson wrote Shaw {{a second}} letter. Nelson had {{received}} a letter from Mr. Langdon alleging that Shaw had issued him certificates for pilot services (payment instructions), and demanded back half the <b>pilotage</b> charge. Nelson asked for an accounting of all such certificates in order to decide whether to open a public inquiry into Shaw's conduct. He also instructed Shaw not to pay for any more <b>pilotage</b> services except in extraordinary circumstances as in Nelson's opinion, Shaw was familiar with all the ports he might visit.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, Tovey {{attended}} {{courses in}} gunnery, torpedo, navigation and <b>pilotage.</b> In November, {{he was appointed}} to the flagship, HMS Exmouth, at the request of Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson, the Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet. Tovey's length of service on Exmouth is unclear, but he was promoted to lieutenant on 15 July 1906.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was not {{especially}} {{active in the}} House of Lords, although he did initiate a debate on unemployment in May 1984.

25|$|Pilots in the Bristol Channel were self-employed,and {{indeed the}} current Bristol pilots still are self-employed. They were based at ports and {{harbours}} {{all along the}} Welsh and English coastlines. Bristol's pilots were actually based at Pill, Somerset, which consequently became a local boat building centre. The relationship between Pill and Bristol was always strained due to {{the distribution of the}} locally collected taxes, which was not solved until the passing of the 1807 Bristol Channel <b>Pilotage</b> Act.|$|E
25|$|Even {{today there}} are no road or rail {{crossings}} of the Bristol Channel, so direct crossings are necessarily made by sea or air, or less directly by the road and rail crossings via the River Severn estuary. The Channel can be a hazardous area of water because of its strong tides and the rarity of havens on the north Devon and Somerset coasts that can be entered in all states of the tide. Because of the treacherous waters, even today <b>pilotage</b> is an essential service for shipping.|$|E
25|$|Eppleton Hall {{was built}} in 1914 by Hepple and Company of South Shields, for the Lambton and Hetton Collieries Ltd, and named after the house near Penshaw owned by the Hetton Coal Company. She was {{designed}} to tow seagoing colliers from sea to wharf side and back, primarily in the River Wear and {{to and from the}} River Tyne. For sailing ships this saved time, while for larger steam and motor vessels it saved navigation and <b>pilotage</b> costs. She was also used to tow newly built ships out to the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Eve 1943, a Combined Operations <b>Pilotage</b> Party (COPP), left Gosport for the Gold Beach area at Luc-sur-Mer. Two {{soldiers}} of the Royal Engineers, Major Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Ogden-Smith, were landed {{on the beach at}} night in Operation Postage Able and took samples of the sand. These were crucial in determining whether the armoured vehicles would be able to operate on the beach or become bogged down. The final survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of January 30/31, but limited information was gathered due to fog and German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-18th {{century the}} Scillonian economy {{has relied on}} trade with the {{mainland}} and beyond {{as a means of}} sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen {{the rise and fall of}} industries such as kelp harvesting, <b>pilotage,</b> smuggling, fishing, shipbuilding and, latterly, flower farming. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.|$|E

The UH-60A RASCAL performed a fully autonomous flight on 5 November 2012. U.S. Army personnel were on board, but the flying was done by the helicopter. During a two-hour flight, the Black Hawk featured terrain sensing, trajectory generation, threat avoidance, and autonomous flight control. It was fitted with a 3D-LZ laser detection and ranging (LADAR) system. The autonomous flight was performed between 200 and 400 feet. Upon landing, the onboard technology was able to pinpoint a safe landing zone, hover, and safely bring itself down.|$|E
25|$|Spanish sailing masters {{belonged to}} a {{navigation}} corps, Cuerpo de Pilotos. They were, unlike their British counterparts, theoretically trained at the famous navigation schools, Real Colegios Seminarios de San Telmo, in Seville and Málaga. In order to be accepted at these schools, the applicant {{had to be a}} Spaniard between eight and 14 years of age. Colored persons, Romani people, heretics, Jews, those punished by the Inquisition, and those whose parents pursued disreputable professions, were not eligible for enrollment. The master's apprentices were called meritorios de <b>pilotage</b> and were at sea rated as common seamen. In order to become a master's assistant, pilotín, during the 18th century, three voyages in Europe and one back and forth to America was required, as well as having passed a special examination. Promotion to second master could only take place if a berth was available.|$|E

500|$|For centuries, the Doom Bar was {{regarded}} as a significant danger to ships—to be approached with caution to avoid running aground. When sails were the main source of power, ships coming round Stepper Point would lose the wind, causing loss of steerage, leaving them to drift away from the channel. Sometimes, gusts of wind known colloquially as [...] "flaws" [...] blew over Stepper Point and pushed vessels towards the sandbank. Dropping anchor would not help, as it could not gain a firm hold on the sand. Richard Hellyer, the Sub-Commissioner of <b>Pilotage</b> at Padstow, gave evidence in 1859 that the Doom Bar {{was regarded}} as so dangerous that in a storm, vessels would risk being wrecked on the coast rather than negotiate the channel to Padstow harbour.|$|E
500|$|In April 1942, Worsley was {{appointed}} to the staff at a training establishment for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, HMS King Alfred in Sussex, giving lectures on charts and <b>pilotage.</b> After two months he was transferred to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. While in Sussex, his health began to deteriorate and he cut down on his pipe smoking. After a few months at Greenwich, he took ill and was hospitalised. Diagnosed with lung cancer, naval doctors found that they could do little for Worsley, and he was discharged. He opted to spend the last days of his life with his wife and the Bamford family, good friends who lived in Claygate, Surrey. He died in the Bamford house on 1 February 1943. [...] He was cremated after a well attended service held on 3 February at the chapel of the Royal Navy College. His casket was adorned with the New Zealand ensign and Worsley's personal standard that he had flown aboard the Quest in the 1921–22 expedition. His ashes were scattered {{at the mouth of the}} Thames River, near the Nore lightship.|$|E
500|$|Before {{reaching}} its mouth it {{is joined by}} the River Trym at Sea Mills which {{was the site of}} Portus Abonae a Roman port. Shortly after it passes the village of Pill on the south bank where the Pill Hobblers were based in order to tow ships up the river to Bristol and where yachts and other boats still have moorings in Chapel Pill and Crockern Pill.

The main span is [...] long, and the bridge is [...] long, with an air draught above mean high water level of [...] The river then serves two major dock areas. The Royal Portbury Dock is located on the southern side of the mouth of the river. The deepwater dock was constructed between 1972 and 1977, and is now a major port for the import of motor vehicles. The Royal Portbury Dock has the largest entrance lock into any UK port, accommodating vessels up to [...] beam, [...] length and [...] draft. The Avonmouth Docks are {{on the north side of}} the river and are one of the UK's major ports for chilled foods, especially fruit and vegetables. The first dock at Avonmouth, Avonmouth Old Dock, was opened in 1877 and acquired by Bristol Corporation in 1884. In 1907, a much larger dock, the Royal Edward Dock, was opened. The docks form part of the Port of Bristol and were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority, part of Bristol City Council, until 1991 when the council granted a 150-year lease to the Bristol Port Company. Currently, <b>pilotage</b> is provided by Bristol Pilots LLP who supply authorised pilots for the River Avon and Bristol City docks, as well as the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel. They are based at Avonmouth docks in Bristol.|$|E

2500|$|Beatty left HMS Alexandra in March 1889 {{and joined}} the cruiser HMS Warspite in July 1889 for {{manoeuvres}} before joining the sailing corvette HMS Ruby in September 1889, {{in which he was}} promoted to sub-lieutenant on 14 May 1890. Next he attended courses at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich during which he was somewhat distracted from his naval career by the delights of London. Beatty scored a first-class examination pass in Torpedoes, but only seconds in Seamanship, Gunnery and <b>Pilotage,</b> and a third in Navigation. A biography states that [...] "his cabin at Greenwich was full of photographs of actresses, some of which were signed in the most endearing terms".

[...] Currie was present at the ceremony and [...] later the same day took up his duties, at a salary of 100 pounds, as the first Harbour Master of [...] Fremantle, responsible for <b>pilotage</b> and services at the port. [...] A tent was erected 'for the despatch of business' on the site chosen for the town. [...] This was to provide offices for the Colonial Secretary, the Surveyor General, the Harbour Master, the Civil Engineer and the Commissioners of the Board of Counsel and Audit. [...] However, later that year, Currie decided it would be more convenient to make his office as Harbour Master and Postmaster on board the wreck of the Marquis of Anglesea, which had been swept ashore in a gale on 23 August 1829. [...] The wreck is visible in Jane Currie's Panorama of the Swan River Settlement.|$|E
