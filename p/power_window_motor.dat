40|$|The power {{generated}} by solar panels is mainly {{influenced by the}} intensity of solar irradiance. This project utilized dual-axis solar tracking based on light intensity comparison with a fuzzy logic intelligent method. The hardware system consists of an Arduino UNO microcontroller as the main controller and four Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors for sensing the maximum incident intensity of solar irradiance.

40|$|AbstractA {{human hand}} {{is a very}} complex {{grasping}} architecture which can handle objects of different sizes and shapes. When such important feature is lost, the replacement artificial hand should capable to imitate the real hand capability, hence ensuring user comfort. This paper proposes a system to control multi finger grippers with emphasis on the finger tips and finger joints. It consists of two modules namely smart glove in master module and hand gripper in slave module. The former responsible to infer user control command while the latter controlling the robot arm movement according to the user instruction. In master module, the system comprises combination of flex sensors and force sensor mounted under the glove to determine fingers bending angle and the force value. Such information is useful to control the artificial gripper for grasping objects in various shapes with right amount of force. In the slave module, the robot arm consist combination of <b>power</b> <b>window</b> <b>motor</b> and servos to initiate the arm and finger movement. Experimental results have shown the feasibility of the proposed system for controlling the artificial gripper and arm precisely according to the user command...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{renewable}} energy such as solar power has become important for electricity generation, and {{solar power systems}} have been installed in homes. Furthermore, solar tracking systems are being continuously improved by researchers around the world, who focus on achieving the best design and thus maximizing {{the efficiency of the}} solar power system. In this project, a fuzzy logic controller has been integrated and implemented in a medium-scale solar tracking system to achieve the best real-time orientation of a solar PV panel toward the sun. This project utilized dual-axis solar tracking with a fuzzy logic intelligent method. The hardware system consists of an Arduino UNO microcontroller as the main controller and Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors for sensing the maximum incident intensity of solar irradiance. Initially, two <b>power</b> <b>window</b> <b>motors</b> (one for the horizontal axis and the other for the vertical axis) coordinate and alternately rotate to scan the position of the sun. Since the sun changes its position all the time, the LDR sensors detect its position at five-minute intervals through the level of incident solar irradiance intensity measured by them. The fuzzy logic controller helps the microcontroller to give the best inference concerning the direction to which the solar PV panel should rotate and the position in which it should stay. In conclusion, the solar tracking system delivers high efficiency of output power with a low power intake while it operates...|$|R
40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>windows</b> {{system or}} {{electric}} windows is divided in two types. They are cable type <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system and scissor type <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system. The main {{function of the}} <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> is to raise and lower automobile windows by depressing a button or switch, as opposed to using a hand-turned crank handle. The system have five components which are the window, the frame and guide rails, the electric motors and the door frame. In the cable type, the electric motors that are provided consist of the motor and a cable driven track that raises and lowers the <b>window.</b> The <b>motor</b> assembly {{will need to be}} fastened to the door frame. These components were reviewed for differences in shape and construction prior to being assembled to the vehicles. There are difference specifications for different manufacturers. For this project, <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system of Proton Gen- 2 car was chosen to be benchmarking. Then the parts that always failed will be defined. The parts will be redesign and the material will be changed. The current and new parts were design by using SOLIDWORK software in dimensional of Proton Gen- 2 car <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system.

40|$|The work {{consists}} of {{the design of the}} chain drive system and the fabrication of the two axis parabolic solar dish. It is a model study of the two axis parabolic dish which worked by the automatic circuit that was developed. Ready made parabolic solar dish is taken and fabricated. The circular iron ring provides the two axis motion of the dish. A compound chain drive system was developed for the smooth movement of the dish. An electromechanical system which tracks the sun on both axes and which is controlled via a programmable logic control (PLC) was designed and implemented. In this a theoretical study was done. A C program was made which gave the required result for the graphical representation of the recorded radiation. Programmable Logic Controls (PLC) was used instead of photo sensors, which are widely used for tracking the sun. The azimuthal angle of the sun from sunrise to sunset times was calculated for each day of the year at 23. 59 Lat & 72. 38 Longitude in the Northern hemisphere, the location of the city Mehsana. According to this azimuth angle, the required analog signal was taken from the PLC analog module and sent to the <b>power</b> <b>window</b> <b>motor,</b> which controlled the position of the panel to ensure that the rays fall vertically on the panel. After the mechanical control of the system was started, the performance measurements of the solar panel were carried out.

For a car, the tool set-up for each vehicle is a T-nut wrench and car jacker which is hard to use for a women or teen to open their car’s nut. In 2006, a tire nut removal with 114 pitch circle diameter has been developed to replace T-nut wrench that can reduce the force and torque needed to open the nuts and open all four nuts simultaneously. This tool used mild steel as the main material to fabricate a gearing system and the gear ratio is 21. 125 gear ratio force reduction. The total weight of the product was 5. 5 kg. For this final year project, this tire nut removal has been improved about the weight, cost of production and the gear ratio.
