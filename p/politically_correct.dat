5|$|The {{return of}} Bond in 1981 saw media {{reports on the}} more <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> Bond and his choice of car—a Saab 900 Turbo; Gardner later {{put him in a}} Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. Gardner also updated Bond's firearm: under Gardner, Bond is {{initially}} issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch VP70 and then a Heckler & Koch P7. Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War. Gardner updated Fleming's characters and used contemporary political leaders in his novels; he also used the high-tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films, although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities. Gardner's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories.|$|E
5|$|The Party for Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E

40|$|This article {{intends to}} focus on the {{importance}} of two kinds of inequality that increasingly characterise contemporary society, where in addition to the widening of the traditional economic gap there is also an unequal distribution of ecological risks. Our thinking on these issues sprang from the consideration of a twofold aspect: a. the analysis of the mechanisms that have created such inequalities and that continue to determine our current model of growth; b. a comparison between the outcomes of the dominant model of development and the expectations that have emerged since the Enlightenment about the capitalist economy’s ability to lead to a society based on the general improvement of material well-being and on a gradual process of achieving a “perfectionnement de l’espèce humaine”. As far as the first aspect is concerned, {{it has been shown that}} unless the automatic market mechanisms are <b>politically</b> <b>corrected</b> in the direction of a fairer sharing out of resources and social wealth, they tend to accentuate economic inequalities (both within advanced societies and between advanced and backward societies) and to offload the environmental risks onto the poorer areas of the planet. As for the second aspect, the recovery of certain important analytical approaches from the Enlightenment period has revealed major differences between the category of economic and social development, studied by theoreticians like Rousseau, Chastellux, A. Smith, Condorcet etc., and the concept of growth typical of mainstream economics. The rediscovery of the analytical orientations of the Enlightenment (apart from some of their typical limitations) today seems undoubtedly useful in order to bring out a critical attitude to the dominant model of development, to enable the intellectual and political constraints of the “single way of thinking” to be overcome and to establish possible paths towards a “realistic utopia” that can stand up to the challenges of the present...|$|R

This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for behaviors that are culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those who consider them to be biological than by those who consider them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial).

The formulation in which the family courts constructed the applicants was almost unilaterally positive. The personality descriptions were one-sided and described the applicants as ideal prospective parents.
