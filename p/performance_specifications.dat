5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the <b>performance</b> <b>specifications.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1963 Menzies {{announced}} an A£200million increase in defence spending {{over the next}} five years, and proposed to send a team led by Hancock overseas to evaluate Canberra replacements. Early candidates were the French Dassault Mirage IV, the TSR-2, and the U.S. North American A-5 Vigilante, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the TFX. From June to August, Hancock's team visited France, Britain and the United States to evaluate the competitors, and determined that the TFX would be the aircraft best suited for the role. The Mirage IV had insufficient range and the A£108 million price was too expensive. The F-4 and the A-5 were immediately available, but the less expensive F-4 would need air-to-air refueling to reach Indonesia from Australia. The TSR-2 was behind schedule and over budget, was the most expensive at A£122 million for 24 aircraft, and British government support for the program was uncertain. While the TFX was also controversial in the United States, its promised <b>performance</b> <b>specifications</b> and per-aircraft cost were superior to that of the TSR-2. As he did not expect TFX to be available before 1970, however, Hancock recommended buying 36 A-5 aircraft for A£88 million to counteract the perceived imminent threat from Indonesia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This {{correspondence}} proposes {{two methods}} for designing partially adaptive beamformers that satisfy a <b>performance</b> <b>specification</b> over {{a set of}} likely interference scenarios. Both methods choose the adaptation space in a sequential fashion; the dimension is increased one by one until the <b>performance</b> <b>specification</b> is attained. In the multilevel point design method, each dimension of the adaptation space is chosen to give optimum performance at a single interference scenario. The constrained minimization design method chooses each dimension of the adaptation space to exactly satisfy the <b>performance</b> <b>specification</b> at a single interfer-ence scenario while approximately minimizing the average interference output power over neighboring scenarios. Simulations indicate that both methods result in better performance than existing methods while using fewer degrees of freedom. I...|$|R

25|$|Initially, the India-China airlift {{was flown}} with the Douglas DC-3 and its {{military}} versions, the C-47, C-53 and C-39. However, the DC-3 design's fuselage {{was so high}} off the ground that loading from most truck beds was difficult, and its narrow door and weak floor could not sustain heavy cargo. Although C-47s had reinforced flooring and a wider door, they still required specialized loading equipment {{for much of the}} cargo needed in China and had a limited payload capacity. Also, <b>performance</b> <b>specifications</b> of the Douglas transports were not suited to high-altitude operation with heavy payloads, and could not normally reach an altitude sufficient to clear the mountainous terrain, forcing the planes to attempt a highly dangerous route through the maze-like Himalayan passes.|$|E
500|$|Production of the Mirage IIIS {{developed}} into a scandal. Although the Air Force staff wanted to acquire the best available aircraft on the market, neither it nor the Federal Council had issued <b>performance</b> <b>specifications.</b> The concept of mobile defense had replaced static defense, such as the Réduit strategy of World War II, as {{the doctrine of the}} Swiss Armed Forces. The new doctrine required greater numbers of long-range aircraft and tanks in order to combat Soviet troops before they arrived near the Swiss border. The committee on aircraft procurement, which consisted of two military officers and an engineer who was employed by the army, originally proposed [...] "at least 100Mirages" [...] to be employed in a multi-role capacity.|$|E

500|$|Frost {{considered}} {{the new design}} as an interim aircraft between the CF-100 and the more advanced C-104 project. The salient changes to the basic wing planform were in decreasing its chord and thickness, and adding a 42° sweep to the leading edge, creating a near-delta wing configuration. The tail surfaces were also swept back. [...] One version that was considered featured two streamlined fuel tanks blended into {{the leading edge of}} the wings near the three/quarter position. [...] Despite the use of more powerful engines, the redesign had very modest <b>performance</b> <b>specifications,</b> with a planned maximum diving speed of Mach 0.95, scarcely better than the placarded Mach 0.85 speed limit of the production CF-100 Mk 2 and Mk 3. Avro executives, recognizing that the company had already suffered due to the protracted development of the CF-100, determined that Frost's revised design would provide a [...] "hedge" [...] against the CF-100's failure to secure long-term contracts.|$|E
500|$|Linn {{brochures}} dwell {{little on}} <b>performance</b> <b>specifications,</b> mentioning somewhat vaguely that the frequency response [...] "varies {{by only a}} few db from 20Hz to 20KHz with the isobaric loading extending usable bass response to below 10Hz". Linn also claimed [...] "very low distortion" [...] and [...] "high sound pressure levels", without quantification. Recommended amplifier power rating is {{in the range of}} 50500watts. Hi-Fi for Pleasure noted that the speakers' impedance, although quoted at 3 ohms nominal, dipped considerably at some parts of the audio spectrum. This made the DMS Isobarik very hard for amplifiers to drive, potentially causing many amplifiers' output protection to trip. Equally, the two heavy woofers in each Isobarik made them twice as power-hungry. Such demands happened to make Naim amplification the perfect match because of its high current delivery capabilities and its toleration of near short circuits. The Isobarik was famously used as the acid test for the budget-priced NAD 3020 amplifier at its UK launch. In the 1970s, the DMS Isobarik, available in a number of veneers, sold for £1,000.|$|E

2500|$|Congress and {{industry}} both {{agreed that the}} Navy had deviated significantly from the normal process for developing a new aircraft. [...] For nearly three years, companies developed their candidates with company funds based on assumptions about the Navy’s requirements without any guidance from the service. [...] The Navy did not issue any aircraft <b>performance</b> <b>specifications</b> or draft requirements until the spring of 2013, so competitors tried to refit their aircraft for the preliminary design review phase. [...] The lack of feedback was compounded by the shift of mission statements, from a long-range penetrating strike platform to long-duration orbits over permissive airspace. [...] Endurance requirements of over 12 hours were especially hard to meet, as there are limitations of an aircraft's wingspan for holding fuel on the confined space of an aircraft carrier; the UCLASS had to maintain two [...] orbits around the ship, or one orbit at a range of , {{with the ability to}} attack lightly-defended targets out to [...] After pressure from Congress, industry, and the Government Accountability Office, the Navy took another look at the draft requirements for the UCLASS. [...] They were scheduled to be released in October 2013 but were delayed. [...] The main reason behind the internal strife was indecision over the future of the aircraft carrier fleet and their air wings, between better UAV-based ISR coverage integrated on board carriers in the near-future and integrating a new unmanned aircraft into the carrier air wing to make the carrier a more effective strike platform.|$|E
