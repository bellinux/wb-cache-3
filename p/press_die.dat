50|$|After being {{published}} in 1927 by the International Psychoanalytic <b>Press,</b> <b>Die</b> Funktion des Orgasmus was never republished or translated until a revised, second edition {{was published in}} English in 1980 by Farrar Straus and Giroux. The editors of the second edition changed the title to Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis, to avoid confusion with Reich's 1942 The Function of the Orgasm.

50|$|The stamper {{was next}} trimmed to size, {{and the back}} sanded smooth, to ensure a smooth finish to the mouldings, and improve contact between the stamper and the <b>press</b> <b>die.</b> The edge was then pressed {{hydraulically}} to form another lip to clamp the edge down on the press. The stampers would be used in hydraulic presses to mould the LP discs. The advantages of this system over the earlier more-direct system included ability to make {{a large number of}} records quickly by using multiple stampers. Also, more records could be produced from each master since stampers would eventually get damaged, but rarely wear out.|$|E

5000|$|Chef's father, Vladimir Scheffer, was a photojournalist in Moscow (cover photograph, Izvestija, no. 234, 1 Sept. 1937). In {{the late}} 1930s he was banished to Kazakhstan on {{political}} grounds, {{and it was}} there that his son Evgeny was born. In 1961, five years after Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin's crimes in his Secret Speech at the Twentieth Party Congress, Vladimir Scheffer was granted permission for the family to return to Moscow. Who is Who in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland notes that Chef then studied 1967-71 at the Art School for Children in Moscow. He was later a student 1972-77 at Moscow's Polygraphic Institute, where he received first prize for his M.A. diploma for his illustrations to Edgar Allan Poe. In 1985 Chef moved to West Germany, where his etchings based on Marquis de Sade earned him attention from the <b>press</b> (<b>Die</b> Rheinpfalz, Huldigung an de Sade, 27 Feb. 1986; Mannheimer Morgen Nr. 43, Ausstellung in Edigheim - Hommage à de Sade, 21 Feb.1986; Bietigheimer Zeitung, Geschmack der Freiheit, 5 Dec. 1986). In 1988 Chef was accepted to the Master Class of Arik Brauer at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, Austria. In 1993 the Academy awarded Chef its Master of Fine Arts degree, together with its Fueger Gold Prize (Vienna: Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Catalogue of Diploma Works, 1993). Metropolis Magazine (May 1993) noted that during this period Chef shuttled regularly [...] "between Vienna, Berlin, New York, and the Spanish coastal village of Cadaques," [...] describing Chef as [...] "a new type of Russian artist with a peripatetic lifestyle, evoking a newly found freedom of global mobility." ...|$|E
50|$|Microprocessors {{were added}} to cycle each press based on {{temperature}} rather than the more inaccurate cycling by time, enabling greater operator control over heat and other variables that can create inconsistencies from record to record. Operators inspect each record as it comes off the press.Other technology employed helps mitigate variations in other factors that can compromise a record’s quality, such as pressure and vibration.Uneven contact between {{the surface of the}} <b>press</b> <b>die,</b> to which is attached the stamper (the mold that creates a vinyl record), results in temperature variations. These variations introduce variations in the width and depth of individual grooves on the record. Quality Record Pressings uses a vacuum system to ensure uniform die and stamper contact. As a result, the listener’s turntable needle tracks more smoothly and provides the listener with a more faithful reproduction of the music.QRP also uses an innovative double steam valve system that reduces die temperature cycle time as well as a more finely tuned level of temperature control of the heating and cooling process. Both reduce inconsistencies from record to record in the manufacturing process.And just as ambient temperature, humidity and variations in steam and water pressure affect the quality of a vinyl record, so do the minute environmental vibrations from nearby equipment. Unwanted harmonic vibration transmitted to the die during the pressing process causes distortion of the record’s grooves and other noise as well as other unwelcome changes in the physical structure of the grooves on a record. QRP uses custom-designed press isolation pads to mitigate the effect of these vibrations.As part of its record pressing operation, QRP also operates a plating department, setting it apart from other record pressing plants that don’t have that capability. The plating department headed by Gary Salstrom is where Lacquer master discs are given metal coatings to make the metal stamper that molds the records from heated vinyl.In 2010 the acquisition of Classic Records, of Los Angeles, California, by Acoustic Sounds, was announced by Kassem and Classic Records Mike Hobson. Acoustic Sounds acquisition of Classic Records included the “Quiex SV-P” vinyl formulation/process, “Clarity Vinyl”, the unique 200-gram “flat profile” tooling and all other aspects of Classic’s proprietary vinyl pressing technology.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays in Hot <b>press</b> <b>die,</b> the die {{itself has}} a strong {{contribution}} to overall investment and maintenance costs and above all, the influence on produced component cost is unusually high. Incompatible usage of machining parameters {{may lead to the}} greater cost investment due to the frequent changing of tool. The optimum machining parameter can help in manufacturing operation by improved and adjusted the manufacturing process {{and at the same time}} increase their profit. In order to be a competent player in the market, a better material with higher thermal conductivity can contribute in short cycle time of hot stamping process besides improve the process and product performance. HTCS- 150 is highly demand materials for making die with high thermal conductivity properties. It was predicted that this HTCS 150 will be common material in future, so that it is important to improve hot press cycle time. This study basically shows a detailed study to investigate the influence of machining parameters to tool wear rate and surface roughness and provides the optimum machining parameters of HTCS 150 both during annealed and hardened condition. In this study, the recorded data was analysed using Signal/Noise (S/N) ratio to find the significant of control factors level to the response. The optimum level of machining parameter was obtained at lowest mean of control factors as low value of tool flank wear rate and low surface roughness was desired. Further analysis was done to predict the flank tool wear rate and surface roughness through first linear model regression. Generally, the data show the spindle speed was the most dominant control factor contributing to the flank tool wear rate and surface roughness. This proved by the S/N ratio showed at the surface roughness response for annealed HTCS- 150 and both tool flank wear rate and surface roughness for hardened HTCS- 150. However, depth of cut was the most contributing factor for tool flank wear rate during machining of annealed HTCS- 150...|$|E
40|$|The {{escalating}} {{issues on}} sustainable environment {{such as the}} necessity to reduce CO 2 emission and fuel consumption including new regulations to improve the safety of passengers car had brought up the application of new innovative materials and manufacturing process in the automotive industry called hot press forming operation. By using this new technique, the manufacturers can produce more lightweight and high strength car parts such as the B-pillars with tensile strength ranging from 1200 MPa to 1600 MPa. Hot press forming is done by rapidly heating up Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) made of boron steel material in a furnace to austenization temperature of about 950 °C for 5 minutes, then transferred it quickly to the hot <b>press</b> <b>die</b> where rapid quenching occurred during the die closed {{with the aid of}} cooling channel. This experiment investigates the effects of varying combination of hot press forming parameters to final tensile strength of boron steel and had been carried out without use of cooling channel. The studied parameters are the air cooling time, cooling rate, cooling time in die and stamping pressure. The type of boron steel material with trade name of Usibor® 1500 was used as the test specimens while for punch and die material, High Thermal Conductivity Tool Steel (HTCS- 150) made by Rovalma was used. Both are common materials used in the automotive industry for hot press forming operation. A preliminary experiment had been conducted where ten flat tensile strength specimens of Usibor 1500 were heated to the austenization temperature of 950 °C and immediately quenched in a tank of water to confirm the material ability to achieve the minimum tensile strength of 1500 Mpa. All specimens achieved average tensile strength of 1550 Mpa in this most ideal cooling rate condition. In the experimental hot press forming operation, result shows that the flat blank specimens of Usibor 1500 able to obtain ultimate tensile strength of 1400 Mpa after quenching in die without use of cooling channels when suitable process parameters were used during. Overall,faster air cooling time, higher stamping pressure applied to the blank, and longer cooling time in die improve the cooling rate. Highest tensile strength of 1400 Mpa was achieved in the experiment when cooling rate was 95 °C/s, air cooling time of 3. 83 s, stamping pressure of 50 bar and cooling time in die of 30 s...|$|E
