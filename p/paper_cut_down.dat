40|$|Nowadays, {{smartphones}} and {{tablet computers}} are everywhere, and these mobile devices offer {{a lot of}} applications, such as the location-based services (LBS). The location-based services not only can provide the users’ locations, but also extend a lot of services, like navigation services and traffic information services, etc. Currently, the main stream of positioning technology is the global positioning system (GPS), {{but it is not}} suitable for indoor applications and services. The more suitable indoor positioning technology is the RF signal pattern matching method; whereas it will {{take a lot of time}} and man powers to build the RF map. In order to reduce the costs of time and man powers, this study proposes a system to build the indoor RF map through sensory detectors (ex. Xtion or Kinect) on the off-line stage. Through the capture of the depth information and the object image, we can build RF prediction propagation models from the environment information with less time and manpower cost. With built-in sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) of smart phones, we can estimate the users ’ moving directions and distances in the environment with better positioning accuracy in online stage. Eventually, the <b>paper</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> running time about 78 % and obtains the double samples simultaneously. The positioning error is 2. 73 meters indicated in the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} extend {{the life span of}} {{battery-powered}} wireless sensor network nodes, this article proceed from the power module, data processing module, wireless module and MAC protocols to design an ultra-low-power wireless sensor network nodes. The nodes improve the power module efficiency maximally, {{at the same time it}} utilizes the ultra-low-power data processing module and the asynchronous MAC protocol adopting a sleep wake-up mechanism. Thus it reduces the integrated energy consumption of wireless module significantly. The life span of the nodes has been increased more than three times. In a word, the design in proposed in this <b>paper</b> greatly <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> the energy consumption of wireless sensor network, which has practical significance of expanding the application space and improving the application effects of wireless sensor network...|$|R
50|$|Some historians, {{including}} Bill Groneman, {{found it}} suspicious that Garza's compilation {{was published in}} 1955, {{at the height of}} interest in Crockett and the Alamo caused by Walt Disney's television series about Crockett's life. Groneman also points out that the journals are made up of several different types of paper from several different <b>paper</b> manufacturers, all <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> to fit. Historian Joseph Musso also questions the validity, also basing his suspicions on the timing of the diaries' release. However, James Crisp, a history professor from North Carolina State University, has studied the papers and is convinced they are genuine. In October 2001, in a Southwestern Historical Quarterly article, Dr. David B. Gracy II, and his science team, attested to the authenticity of De la Pena's work. The original manuscript, consisting of 200 loose pages, was auctioned in 1998 for $387,500. It now resides at the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 NewsBank had one-hundred {{employees}} in-house. Another one-hundred employees {{worked from}} home and would travel to the company's headquarters, bring back newspapers to their residence from there, {{and then come back}} to the company with indexed information on these publications. The company's headquarters in 1986 was located in New Canaan, Connecticut. Chris Andrews was brought on in 1986 as Product Manager for CD-ROM. His job was to help the company transition from a paper format of delivery to libraries, to instead provide its indexes and full-text articles on CD-ROM format. The subscription price for this service initially was US$5,000 per library. Visitors to libraries with the new CD-ROM services found that their research time searching through the CD-ROM index instead of <b>paper</b> indexes was <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> from 30 minutes to five minutes. NewsBank used an arbitrary selection process for determining which news articles the company considered worthy for archiving; it based this on those that were not simply stories of regional interest and that were more widely appealing to a larger potential audience of future researchers.|$|R
