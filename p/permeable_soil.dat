He notes that if permeability decreases with depth, a perched water table may develop in soils at intense precipitation. When pore water pressures are sufficient to reduce effective normal stress to a critical level, failure occurs.|$|R

40|$|The two {{failures}} of the London Avenue Canal floodwalls contributed largely to the flooding of central New Orleans due to hurricane Katrina. In this paper, both failures are analyzed and compared to each other since the flood defenses are both located on <b>permeable</b> <b>soils.</b> Photo’s observation and calculations are used for the analysis. Both failures are caused by the permeable sand layer below the floodwall that allowed high pore water pressures to develop below the floodwall. However, the south breach seems {{to be caused by}} the piping failure mechanism and the north breach by loss of stability. At the South breach, the impermeable top layer was thicker than at the North breach, increasing the stability. The North beach was less vulnerable for piping and the lack of stability caused a large breach. The London Avenue Canal failures are a clear yet tragic example of the failure of flood defenses on <b>permeable</b> <b>soils.</b> The failures show that multiple failure mechanism may occur and since there are many flood defenses on <b>permeable</b> <b>soils</b> world wide, the lessons from Katrina can be used to prevent future catastrophes...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{issues for}} small arms {{training}} with lead projectiles are {{examined in this}} report for Camp Edwards located at the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR), in order to evaluate whether past or future use of lead in small arms has or will result in lead mobilization to groundwater. A review of relevant literature and case studies demonstrates lead is toxic to humans and wildlife and, therefore, exposure must be minimized. The literature also demonstrates lead mobilization occurs chiefly by wind and surface water erosion, generally not by dissolution and leaching through soil. Environmental conditions at Camp Edwards dictate that wind and surface water are not primary avenues of transport, due to extensive vegetative cover and highly <b>permeable</b> <b>soils.</b> Highly <b>permeable</b> <b>soils</b> limit corrosion of metallic lead but also can facilitate transport for dissolved forms of lead. Because highly <b>permeable</b> <b>soils</b> favor transport, a careful analysis of the geochemical conditions with respect to lead vertical transport to groundwater was a focus for this study. It is the conclusion of this study that, lead has not contaminated the groundwater in any significant way based on the absence of lead plumes and only one groundwater monitoring well associated with the small arms ranges had a single lo...|$|R

50|$|A major {{limitation}} of electrokinetics {{is the introduction}} of an external fluid into the soil. If the contaminant cannot be dissolved {{it is not possible}} to extract the contaminant of interest. Electrolysis near the electrodes can alter the pH of the soil especially if the current is induced for an extended period of time. Extended use of electrokinetics system can also cause acidic conditions around the electrodes sometimes reacting with contaminants. If increased acidification of the soil is not environmentally acceptable the use of electrokinetics should be reevaluated. Large metal objects that are buried underground also pose as a limitation to electrodes because they offer a path to short circuit the system. Buried metal objects can also change the voltage gradient and decrease or stop the flow. The removal of volatile organic compounds from the soils can increase the soil vapor concentration. Counterintuitively, highly permeable soils lower the efficiency of electrokinetics. Where a low <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> like clay can receive up to 90% initial contaminant removal a low <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> like peat achieves about 65% removal of initial contaminants.|$|E

The area of the source, which is 100,000 m2 is a protected environment to maintain the purity of the water. The water of the source is purified by passing through various geological layers, starting with the melted snow that seeps through the <b>permeable</b> <b>soil,</b> then reaches a deep and impermeable layer where it is stored before spurting up to the surface through natural fissures.|$|E

Wilford comments: [...] "The small-flowered forms of Tulipa polychroma can be disappointing, their tiny blooms looking a little insipid alongside more colourfull spring bulbs.".The plants need a fertile, highly <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> (lightly acid to alkaline) and a sheltered sunny spot, otherwise their stems will become spindly and etiolated and the flowers can fall over. They should be planted 10-12 cm deep and the same distance apart. They naturalise easily and tend to form clumps. The flowers only open in sunshine and emit a fairly strong fruity smell.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} {{is run by}} the Kyushu Electric Power Company.The power plant started operation in July 2007 and all four units were commissioned by July 2011.Like most pumped-storage facilities, the power station uses two reservoirs, releasing and pumping as the demand rises and falls. Oseuchi Dam and Kanasumi Dam form the upper artificial reservoir, while Ishikawauchi Dam on the Omaru river (Omarugawa) forms the lower reservoir. Ishikawauchi Dam is a 47.5 m concrete gravity dam, while Oseuchi and Kanasumi dams are rock-fill dams, 65.5 m and 42.5 m high, respectively. The natural influx on water on the upper reservoir is limited, therefore the plant can be considered almost pure pumped-storage. The entire upper pond was made waterproof with asphalt to avoid leakage in the surrounding <b>permeable</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
40|$|Electrokinetic {{remediation}} {{coupled with}} Fenton oxidation, widely called as Electrokinetic Fenton {{process is a}} potential soil remediation technique used for low <b>permeable</b> <b>soil.</b> The applicability of {{the process has been}} proved with soil contaminated {{with a wide range of}} organic compounds from phenol to the most recalcitrant ones such as PAHs and POPs. This thesis summarizes the major findings observed during an Electrokinetic Fenton Process study conducted for the remediation of low <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> contaminated with HCB, a typical hydrophobic organic contaminant. Model low <b>permeable</b> <b>soil,</b> kaolin, was artificially contaminated with HCB and subjected to Electrokinetic Fenton treatments in a series of laboratory scale batch experiments. The use of cyclodextrins as an enhancement agent to mobilize the sorbed contaminant through the system was investigated. Major process hindrances such as the oxidant availability and treatment duration were also addressed. The HCB degradation along with other parameters like soil pH, redox and cumulative catholyte flow were analyzed and monitored. The results of the experiments strengthen the existing knowledge on electrokinetic Fenton process as a promising technology for the treatment of soil contaminated with hydrophobic organic compounds. It has been demonstrated that HCB sorbed to kaolin can be degraded by the use of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide during such processes. The overall system performances were observed to be influenced by the point and mode of oxidant delivery. Furthermore, the study contributes to new knowledge in shortening the treatment duration by adopting an electrode polarity reversal during the process...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that rainfall {{could play a}} significant role in instability of slopes. The main objective of the presented study is to quantify the influence of varying characteristics of water flow, its associated changes of pore-water pressures and shear strength on the stability of simplified, but inhomogeneous, slope geometries. The commonly used van Genuchten model was used to describe the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) mathematically. In the context of this study, the influence of different hydraulic behaviour of soil layers, i. e. different SWCC, on the factor of safety (FoS) is evaluated by means of fully coupled flow-deformation analyses employing the finite element method. To quantify the slopes’ factor of safety during rainfall events after specified times of infiltration or evaporation, the strength reduction method was applied. In addition to various combinations of soil layers, the influence of a water bearing high <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> layer between two less <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> layers, a situation which is often encountered in practice, on the factor of safety has been investigated...|$|E

Rather than using damping ratio, this author advocates using viscosity as the specific soil property, especially for saturated <b>permeable</b> <b>soils.</b> Thus represented, the imaginary part of the complex shear modulus will vary directly with frequency.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the mechanisms involved {{in the development of}} saturation profiles in soil. A series of numerical simulations and laboratory tests were conducted to monitor the saturation profiles in four types of soil under various rainfall conditions. In addition, two sloping sites were monitored for a period of one year to provide field verification for the findings. The understanding in saturation profile is essential to predict the shear strength of soil, particularly for slope stability problem. The study showed that the saturation profile in soil is greatly affected by the soil permeability and rainfall pattern. The effect of rainfall pattern on the saturation profile of high <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> is relatively insignificant. Conversely, the saturation profile in less <b>permeable</b> <b>soil</b> could be significantly altered when the soil is subjected to a prolonged rainfall. A chart is developed in the present study to determine the critical rainfall duration and intensity, as well as the resultant minimum suction value. The analysis result from the developed chart show good agreement with the field monitoring data. It is believed that the findings from the present study could lead {{to a better understanding of}} saturation profile in soil, and subsequently contribute efforts in mitigating rainfall-induced slope failure...|$|E

40|$|A direct {{analytical}} approach is proposed {{to study the}} turbulent surface water flow on a slope.

The soil and vegetation layers are regarded as porous media, and Biot’s poroelastic theory is applied. The effect of vegetationon flow velocity is also analyzed. As the Reynolds stresses become larger, the turbulent strength increases, and the velocity distributionsbecome more uniform. The average velocity is compared with that calculated by Manning’s formula and the kinematic-wave equation.
