According to [...] The Telegraph's culture critic Lucy Jones, the image depicted violence against women. In her article, which has been since removed from the Telegraph’s website, Jones applauded the censorship of Musilek’s photograph, arguing that “aking down a <b>poster</b> that could <b>plant</b> a seed in one person’s head that violence is acceptable is commendable.” ...|$|R

The first features a print with a quote attributed to Dante: "The hottest places in hell {{are reserved for}} those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality". The second poster features a cubist-like image of a man above a quote from Vladimir Lenin reading: "Capitalists are no more capable of self-sacrifice than a man is capable of lifting himself by his own bootstraps. " The third <b>poster</b> discusses <b>plant</b> closures in the US and urges readers to contact the Plant Closures Project. The final print {{is divided into three}} cells. The first cell features an image of a man in a suit offering a slice of pie. The next cell shows a line of union demonstrators, and the cell below them features the text: "We don't want a bigger piece - we want the whole thing. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Poster</b> session: <b>Plant</b> Pathogen InteractionsTo {{understand}} the key processes governing defense mechanisms in Sorghum bicolor upon infection by fungus Colletotrichum sublineolum, the causal agent of sorghum anthracnose, a cDNA library was constructed using the {{suppression subtractive hybridization}} (SSH) method. SSH was performed between cDNAs prepared from a resistant sorghum cultivar (DK 18) inoculated with C. sublineolum and uninoculated control samples. A total of 41 unique cDNA clones were found differentially expressed in inoculated seedlings. They can be classified into 7 categories according to characterized or putative functions of their homologous sequences. These genes are potentially involved in plant defense, signal transduction, abiotic stress, secondary metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation. Gene expression patterns were compared in sorghum cultivars that are resistant or susceptible to the anthracnose pathogen following inoculation. In addition, expression of the pathogen-inducible genes was investigated in sorghum seedlings after challenges by non-host pathogens including Cochliobolus heterotrophus and Magnaporthe grisea. Selected sorghum genes were over-expressed in transgenic tobacco plants which were demonstrated to show enhanced resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. Elevated expression levels of PR genes were recorded in the transgenic plants. Further characterization and functional analysis of these genes may allow us to identify sorghum genes that can be utilized for board-spectrum disease resistance in different plant species...|$|R
40|$|Conference <b>poster</b> presentationBroadleaf <b>planting</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} important in Ireland over the recent years and light is recognised {{as one of the}} main environmental factors affecting stand development, but to date there has been little research on broadleaf responses to light intensity, particularly in Ireland. Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is increasing as an alternative to clear-cutting and uses the control of light to produce plantation benefits. The physiological responses of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus robur) seedlings to four different shade environments (100 %, 62 %, 51 % and 28 % of incident photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) were studied in a shadehouse experiment during the summer of 2013. Light-response curves (only measured in the extreme treatments) differed between beech seedlings of the Control treatment (PAR= 100 %) and those of the heavy shade treatment (PAR= 28 %) when PAR > 100 μmol m- 2 s- 1, while there was little difference for oak between both treatments. Light-response curves generally showed maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax) at 1500 μmol m- 2 s- 1 in both treatments, and this PAR value was used while measuring stomatal conductance (gs) and water use efficiency (WUE). Significantly higher values of Amax and gs were found in oak than in beech in the 62 %, 51 % and 28 % treatments. There {{were no significant differences between}} oak and beech for Amax and gs in the Control treatment or for WUE in the four treatments...|$|R

40|$|<b>Póster</b> presentado en <b>Plant</b> & Animal Genomes XIX Conference, celebrada en San Diego (California-USA) los días 15 - 19 {{de enero}} de 2011 The {{study of the}} {{proteome}} provides a large-scale dynamic view on the temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the genome and {{may result in a}} successful strategy to link genes to phenotype as an alternative to DNA approaches. The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the grain legume most widely consumed {{in the world and the}} most important source of proteins for many countries. It was suggested to be a diploid model species within the legume family, since it displays particular characteristics regarding breeding (extreme selfing species), its symbioses with Rhizobium bacteria, synteny with other legumes and its specific model of evolution, where multiple domestications took place in America from wild populations (Mesoamerica and Andes) (McClean et al, 2008). In proteomic studies, protein extraction is a critical step that determines the level of quality of downstream protein separation, analysis and identification. A recent study of our team has suggested that the phenol-based extraction protocol should be the first choice to draw a more reliable and complete profile of the bean seed proteome (De La Fuente et al, 2010). Under this basis, we are performing a diversity analysis between individuals of the Mesoamerican and Andean pools applying proteomic tools (2 -DE and mass spectrometry) to bean seed proteins extracted by phenol method. The results will be discussed in the light of the 2 -DE gel patterns achieved for each pool, as well as we will try to assess the qualitative and quantitative differences between both analysed varieties of bean.

40|$|<b>Póster</b> presentado en <b>Plant</b> and Animal Genome XXI, celebrada en San Diego del 12 al 16 {{de enero}} de 2013. Wheat is an {{allopolyploid}} which has {{two or more}} sets of related chromosomes {{as the result of}} doubling chromosomes following sexual hybridization between closely related species. Hexaploid (bread) wheat contains A, B and D genomes and tetraploid (pasta) wheat contains A and B genomes. Despite their genome complexity, wheat behave as iploids during meiosis (each chromosome only pairs with its identical, homologue, and not with related or homoelogous chromosomes). Chromosome pairing is controlled in wheat by the Ph 1 locus, which suppresses homoeologous chromosome pairing. Therefore the hybridization be tween polyploid wheat and related species caused inter-specific hybrids without chromosome pairing between wheat and related species. However, {{in the absence of the}} Ph 1 locus (ph 1 mutant) the chance of pairing between related chromosomes is increased. In this work, we exploit the ph 1 mutant to development new wheat germplas m carrying introgressions from Hordeum chilense, a wild barley with high potential for wheat breed ing due to its agronomical traits such as resistance to some diseases or high antioxidant content. In the absence of the Ph 1 locus chromosome specificity has been suppressed in this project, allowing inter-specific chromosome associations between wheat and H. chilense for the first time. Chromosome pairing and recombination between H. chilense and wheat chromosomes were detected by genomic in situ hybridization. A summary of the breeding program carried out to transfer desirable agronomic traits from H. chilense into wheat is reviewed in this work. This research was supported by ERC-Starting Grant- 243118 from the FP 7 and The European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) from the European Union. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
