The film runs a little long, but part of that is due to the film’s patience. The film isn’t just trying to shock people. It builds atmosphere and constructs horrific situations that are meant to genuinely disturb. It isn’t just about ghosts popping out of nowhere. It’s more about the creeping realization that there are some things in this world that aren’t quite right, and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt because of it.

Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC {{announced that it}} would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs, led the UK trade union UNIFI to warn Green that the [...] "gloves were off". He defended the decision, telling The Guardian’s Jill Treanor: “If you are a responsible company like us we do need to think about this on a global basis. We have to approach this in a responsible and human way. I also have to bear in mind that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> jobs in India (and elsewhere). It's wrong to pretend you can protect the existing jobs and wrong to pretend there isn't going to be change. It can't be the right response to say that emerging markets have no right to jobs." [...] He added: “Cost minimisation cannot be the only driver of this. There is no way we want to jeopardise the quality of customer service”. Green also oversaw HSBC’s acquisition of Household International, a US subprime lender, as well as its integration into the parent company. He later came to regret the deal, which was the largest acquisition in a series conducted by HSBC in the five years leading up to his {{appointment as}} its chief executive.|$|E

A show source told Hill that it was a [...] "huge stunt" [...] and that [...] "a lot of money has been spent making it look as realistic as possible. A team of stuntmen and women were brought in and bosses hired some of the best special effects people in the business. The bus crash will be a disaster no one will ever forget". Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy announced that an upcoming storyline would feature [...] "another tragic storyline twist" [...] as [...] "wedding day joy turns to horror for a number of the soap's characters". He added that the event would [...] "change life in the village forever". Executive producer of Hollyoaks Bryan Kirkwood revealed that he worked alongside series producer Emma Smithwick to create the storyline. He explained that together they [...] "decided {{that it was time for}} a big, show-stopping, blockbuster sequence to grab the audience's attention and hopefully bring them back to Hollyoaks. We realised we needed to engage some of the older audience again and this was how to do it". Richardson said that the crash and the following explosion are [...] "one of the biggest stunts in soap history", while Moss told What's on TV that it is [...] "the biggest stunt that I think Hollyoaks have ever done and we've all pulled together to make it the best". Brennan explained that the storyline is [...] "really dramatic storyline" [...] which is a [...] "good reflection of the direction that we're going in at Hollyoaks. We're going back to the show's soap roots and doing some big, bombastic storylines". Brennan felt that the scenes included the [...] "hardest day" [...] he has had at Hollyoaks while filming the storyline due to the filming demanding [...] "so much in terms of the depths of emotions". He added that audiences could expect [...] "big emotions" [...] due to the large number of characters at risk. The scenes become [...] "very, very dramatic for many characters in the village". Roberts said that after the crash [...] "no one will be the same, everyone is going to be affected by it in some way.

5000|$|Since 1991, {{whenever}} the controversy involved lip-sync by some performers arose, Houston's Super Bowl performance {{to her own}} pre-recorded voice has been often mentioned. At {{the beginning of the}} controversy about Houston's performance, there were some people giving negative views of it, such as Melone of St. Petersburg Times who expressed disappointment about it, commenting [...] "Granted, there were technical difficulties {{in the way of a}} live performance, but at least a few other singers have pulled off the national anthem live at a Super Bowl. This was the nation's most precious piece of music sung by one of its best performers at a most precarious time. If we were going to make such a deal of the moment, for the troops in Saudi Arabia, we should have heard the real thing. Or at least we should have been told we weren't." [...] Liz Smith of Newsday commented in support of Houston's performance: [...] "A controversy reared its head was it performance live or was it Memorex. It was much ado about nothing. I thought it was clearly Houston's own voice." [...] Jimmy Jam, a songwriter and producer, in an interview with The Associated Press, expressed his thoughts for Houston's version of the song by saying that [...] "Whitney, when she did the national anthem, which was the greatest national anthem that we ever heard, what we heard over the air was prerecorded. The reason it was prerecorded was, that was a moment that no one wanted any mistakes. They didn't want any feedback, they didn't want any technical difficulties ... and it was great." [...] When Jennifer Hudson delivered a lip-syncing of [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] at Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009, it caused a little controversy once again. But most critics and many in the music industry didn't make a criticism of it. David Hinckley of New York Daily News made a remark on lip-syncing the national anthem that it was of secondary importance, writing [...] "The national anthem is different. Yes, it's a musical performance and yes, we're interested in how a Jennifer Hudson will interpret the song. That's why we remember the Whitney Houston and Marvin Gaye versions so well. Because the Super Bowl is primarily a television spectacle with a thousand moving parts, the producers years ago started asking to hear the anthem tracks a week before airtime, just so they would have one less potential variable. That's why Hudson was lip-syncing." [...] Rickey Minor, the pregame show producer of the 2009 Super Bowl, told The Associated Press that [...] "There's too many variables to go live. I would never recommend any artist go live because the slightest glitch would devastate the performance." [...] Similarly, Billboard magazines Robert Levine didn't see anything wrong with lip-syncing the national anthem, saying [...] "If Bruce Springsteen flubs a line on 'Born to Run' only his fans will notice. If Jennifer Hudson flubs on the national anthem, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> upset. People want it to be technically perfect as well as emotionally inspiring. Can you guarantee that live? Maybe. But it's good to have insurance." [...] Patrick Hruby of ESPN.com, on his recent article titled 'Star-Spangled Banner isn't easy to sing,' gave a positive comment on Houston's choice that lip-synced [...] "The Star Spangled Banner," [...] saying [...] "Small wonder, then, that when Whitney Houston performed her memorable anthem rendition at Super Bowl XXV in January 1991, she did the sensible thing." ...|$|E
