5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism was {{due in part to}} the ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and disparity between the sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to <b>play</b> <b>outside</b> the Southern Conference in 1952.|$|E

Both teams had a mixture of home and away games on their route to the final, but Arsenal {{were not required to}} <b>play</b> <b>outside</b> London after the initial fourth round match.

5|$|On 31 March 1731, The Author's Farce was {{paired with}} the Tom Thumb remake, The Tragedy of Tragedies, as a {{replacement}} for The Letter Writers, the original companion piece. Although both Tragedy of Tragedies and The Author's Farce were main shows, they alternated on the billing until the 18 June 1731 performance, the final showing of any Fielding play in the Little Theatre except for a 12 May 1732 benefit show of The Author's Farce. The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. The Pleasures of the Town act was performed as a one-act <b>play</b> <b>outside</b> London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751–52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763.

25|$|These {{units have}} a role to <b>play</b> <b>outside</b> the country, as much of the FARC's arms {{smuggling}} work is handled by them. Allegedly, the CIA is aware about the work of the FARC's military intelligence units and also that of its diplomatic corps, and thus has used its intelligence networks throughout Latin America and the United States to attempt to capture operatives that travel outside Colombia. According to the FARC, the capture of Rodrigo Granda in Venezuela in late and the capture of other operatives, such as Simon Trinidad, in Ecuador would allegedly include CIA participation.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} wrist action {{can be seen}} by a skilled batsman and the change of spin allowed for when playing a shot at the ball. Less skilled batsmen, or ones who have lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one {{direction}} off the pitch, only for it to move the other direction. If the batsman is expecting a leg break, he will <b>play</b> <b>outside</b> the line of the ball after it spins. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential lbw appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit the wicket, or catch the edge of the bat.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{the team}} {{changed its name}} to Club Unión, though the club {{returned}} to the name América the following year.

Aside from broadening their horizons, Club América along with Atlante petitioned {{to reduce the number of}} foreign players in the league. Shortly after the Mexican Football Federation was formed in 1928, Rafael Garza Gutiérrez was designated as the head coach of the Mexico national team. Most of the national team squad that participated in the 1928 Summer Olympics and 1930 World Cup consisted of players from Club América.|$|E

25|$|This {{stand-off}} {{lasted until}} 1993, {{by which time}} a new challenger had qualified through the Candidates cycle for Kasparov's next World Championship defense: Nigel Short, a British grandmaster who had defeated Anatoly Karpov in a qualifying match, and then Jan Timman in the finals held in early 1993. After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected, the world champion and his challenger decided to <b>play</b> <b>outside</b> FIDE's jurisdiction, under another organization created by Kasparov called the Professional Chess Association (PCA). This is where a great fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE version of the World Champions tradition. In an interview in 2007, Kasparov called the break with FIDE the worst mistake of his career, as it hurt {{the game in the}} long run.|$|E
