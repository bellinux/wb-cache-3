50|$|The pre-mRNA {{processing}} at the 3' {{end of the}} RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end {{and then}} the addition of about 250 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. The cleavage and adenylation reactions occur if a polyadenylation signal sequence (5'- AAUAAA-3') is located near the 3' end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which is followed by another sequence, which is usually (5'-CA-3') and {{is the site of}} cleavage. A GU-rich sequence is also usually present further downstream on the pre-mRNA molecule. After the synthesis of the sequence elements, two multisubunit proteins called cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CStF) are transferred from RNA Polymerase II to the RNA molecule. The two factors bind to the sequence elements. A protein complex forms and contains additional cleavage factors and the enzyme Polyadenylate Polymerase (PAP). This complex cleaves the RNA between the <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence</b> and the GU-rich sequence at the cleavage site marked by the (5'-CA-3') sequences. Poly(A) polymerase then adds about 200 adenine units to the new 3' end of the RNA molecule using ATP as a precursor. As the poly(A) tail is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.|$|E

In the proposita (female, age 20 (Hb 7. 4 mmol/ 1; MCV 72 fl; MCH 1. 45 fmol; HbA 2 3. 5 %; HbF 2. 4 %)). an A/G mutation in the RNA cleavage and <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence</b> was detected (AATAAA/AATAGA). Her sister (Hb 8. 2 mmol/ 1; MCV 77 fl; MCH 1. 60 fmol; HbA 2 /HbE 32. 4 %), carried a different mutation in the ß-globin gene (codon 25; G 129 /A), and consequently had HbE-trait. Their mother had a haemoglobin concentration of 6. 4 mmol/ 1 (MCV 56 fl; MCH 1. 20 fmol; HbA 2 /HbE 55. 8 %). She was compound heterozygous for the mutation in the poly-signal and HbE-trait. Using restriction enzyme analysis and linkage studies, we subsequently identified six family members with HbE-ß-thalassaemia, five with ß-thalassaemia and six with HbE-trait. Two individuals were unaffected. The mutation in the <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence</b> causes a mild form of ß+-thalassaemia.

40|$|Plasminogen {{activator}} inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) is {{the primary}} physiologic inhibitor of the naturally occurring plasminogen activators. In higher primates two forms of mature PAI- 1 mRNA (3. 2 kb and 2. 2 kb) arise by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation of PAI- 1 hnRNA which is regulated in a tissue-specific fashion in humans. In other mammals only the 3. 2 kb mRNA has been detected. The putative downstream polyadenylation site in humans that {{gives rise to the}} 3. 2 kb PAI- 1 mRNA consists of three overlapping copies of the consensus <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence</b> while no consensus <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence</b> is found upstream at a position that could generate the shorter mRNA species. To determine whether differential cleavage and polyadenylation of PAI- 1 mRNA is due to species-specific differences in trans-acting factors that process PAI- 1 mRNA or to the presence of a nonconsensus polyadenylation site acquired recently during primate evolution we prepared plasmids in which the 3 ' nontranslated region of the human PAI- 1 gene or the mouse PAI- 1 cDNA was inserted downstream of the neomycin gene in the plasmid pSV 2 neo. We show that the 3 '-nontranslated region of the human PAI- 1 gene but not the mouse PAI- 1 cDNA conferred alternative cleavage and polyadenylation to the neomycin gene in transfected human Hep G 2 cells as well as mouse NIH 3 T 3 and rat L 6 cells...|$|E

40|$|Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is a {{splicing}} regulator {{that also}} plays a positive role in pre-mRNA 3 ′ end processing when bound upstream of the polyadenylation signal (pA signal).

We identify PTB as the protein factor whose binding to the human β-globin (HBB) 3 ′ UTR is abrogated by a 3 ′ end processing-inactivating mutation. We show that PTB promotes both in vitro 3 ′ end cleavage and polyadenylation and recruits directly the splicing factor hnRNP H to G-rich sequences associated with several pA signals. Increased binding of hnRNP H results in stimulation of polyadenylation through a direct interaction with poly(A) polymerase.

Unfortunately, such vectors are only effective for genes expressed in ES cells and this has prompted the development of expression-independent vectors. These polyadenylation (poly A) trap vectors employ a splice donor to capture an endogenous gene’s <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence</b> and provide transcript stability. However, the spectrum of mutations generated by these vectors appears largely restricted to the last intron of target loci due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) making them unsuitable for gene targeting applications.

The set of random insertions generated with these vectors show a significantly reduced insertional bias and the vectors can be targeted directly to a 5 ’ intron. We also show that this relative positional independence is linked to the human b-actin promoter and is most likely a result of its transcriptional activity in ES cells.

These results indicate that DNA containing human papillomavirus type 16 open reading frames E 6 and E 7 isolated from the genome of a human tumor has transforming potential, that this potential is realized when the viral DNA is joined to cellular sequences, and that the cellular sequences function in a more complex way than by simply providing polyadenylation signals...|$|R

This pri-miR- 21 gene sequence is flanked 5 ′ by a promoter element able to transcribe heterologous mRNAs and 3 ′ by a consensus <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequence.</b> Nuclear processing of pri-miRNAs was found to be efficient, thus largely preventing the nuclear export of full-length pri-miRNAs. Nevertheless, an intact miRNA stem–loop precursor located in the 3 ′ UTR of a protein coding gene only moderately inhibited expression of the linked open reading frame, probably because the 3 ′ truncated mRNA could still be exported and expressed. Together, these data show that human pri-miRNAs are not only structurally similar to mRNAs but can, in fact, function both as pri-miRNAs and mRNAs...|$|E

To quantify {{the factors that}} determine both the expression and relative brightness of FPs in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and in mice, we generated eight different FP-expressing ROSA 26 alleles using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). These alleles enabled us to analyze the effects on FP expression of a translational enhancer and different 3 ′-intronic and/or <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequences,</b> {{as well as the}} relative brightness of five different FPs, without the confounding position and copy number effects that are typically associated with randomly inserted transgenes. We found that the expression of a given FP can vary threefold or more depending on the genetic features present in the allele. The optimal FP expression cassette contained both a translational enhancer sequence in the 5 ′-untranslated region (UTR) and an intron-containing rabbit β-globin sequence within the 3 ′-UTR. The relative expressed brightness of individual FPs varied up to tenfold. Of the five different monomeric FPs tested, Citrine (YFP) was the brightest, followed by Apple, eGFP, Cerulean (CFP) and Cherry. Generation of a line of Cherry-expressing mice showed that there was a 30 -fold variation of Cherry expression among different tissues and that there was a punctate expression pattern within cells of all tissues examined. This study should help investigators make better-informed design choices when expressing FPs in mESCs and mice...|$|R
40|$|Cytoplasmic {{intermediate}} filament (IF) proteins of Caenorhabditis elegans are encoded by a dispersed {{multigene family}} comprising {{at least eight}} genes which map to three linkage groups. Exon sequences and intron patterns define three distinct subfamilies. While all eight IF genes display the long coil 1 b subdomain of nuclear lamins, only six genes (a 1 -a 4, b 1 and b 2) retain a lamin-like tail domain. Two genes (c 1 and c 2) have acquired entirely novel tail domains. The overall sequence identity of the rod domains is only 29 %. The gene structures show a strong drift in number and positions of introns, none of which are common to all genes. Individual genes share only one to four intron locations with the Helix aspersa IF gene, but all eight nematode genes together account for nine of the 10 introns of the gastropod gene. All C. elegans IF genes are transcribed and all except gene c 2 produce trans-spliced mRNAs. Alternatively spliced mRNAs arise from genes a 1, b 2 and c 2 through several mechanisms acting at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. These involve the alternative use of distinct promoters, <b>polyadenylation</b> <b>sequences</b> and both cis and trans RNA splice sites. The resulting sequence variations are restricted to the non-helical end domains. Minimally 12 distinct IF proteins are encoded by the various mRNAs. Different abundances in mixed-stage nematode populations suggest cell type- and/or stage-specific expression of individual mRNAs...|$|R
