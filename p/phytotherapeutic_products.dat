40|$|The {{plants with}} medical {{purposes}} represent approximately 25 % {{of the total}} of the medical prescriptions in industrialized countries, and close to 80 % in developing countries. Few patients {{are aware of the}} potential interactions among the <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products,</b> as well as the presence of toxic chemical elements. Health organizations are warning consumers not to use certain <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products</b> because they could contain high levels of heavy metals. Studies carried out in United States of America, United Kingdom, India, Malaysian and Pakistan show the presence of cadmium, lead and mercury in this type of products. For this reason, in the present research, the presence of Hg and Pb in <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products</b> marketed in Venezuela is investigated. The samples were analyzed by means of acid digestion (HNO 3) in a microwave oven and then analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The results demonstrated that the found values were within the tolerable levels for medical herbs suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, the mercury and lead provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) was evaluated and the results also demonstrated that they were lower than the human-reference values (300 µg/kg and 1500 µg/kg, respectively). In summary, the analyzed <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products</b> marketed in Venezuela do not represent a public health problem. Nevertheless, the authors recommend to enhance this type of study to other herbal products marketed in Venezuela...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} type of nonskin malignancy among women worldwide. In general, conventional cancer treatment options (i. e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, and hormone therapy) are not completely effective. Recurrence and other pathologic situations are still an issue in breast cancer patients due to side effects, toxicity of drugs in normal cells, and aggressive behaviour of the tumours. From this point of view, breast cancer therapy and adjuvant methods represent a promising and challenging field for researchers. In the last few years, the use of some types of complementary medicines by women {{with a history of}} breast cancer has significantly increased such as <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products</b> and nutritional supplements. Despite this, the use of such approaches in oncologic processes may be problematic and patient’s health risks can arise such as interference with the efficacy of standard cancer treatment. The present review gives an overview of the most usual <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products</b> and nutritional supplements with application in breast cancer patients as adjuvant approach. Regardless of the contradictory results of scientific evidence, we demonstrated the need to perform additional investigation, mainly well-designed clinical trials in order to establish correlations and allow for further validated outcomes concerning the efficacy, safety, and clinical evidence-based recommendation of these products...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the large distribution and use of medicinal plants, the industries are producing products based on plant species in various pharmaceutical forms, which have been commercialized in pharmacies and natural products homes.

40|$|Two 54 -year-old women {{developed}} abdominal cramps and vaginal hemorrhage as {{a result}} of endometrial hyperplasia during treatment with a hop-containing <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>product</b> (MenoCool®) for post-menopausal complaints. The women used the hop-containing <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>product</b> (418 mg of hop per tablet) twice daily (1 and 0. 5 tablets by both patient A and B). Patient A developed abdominal cramps and vaginal hemorrhage after 2 months of use. After gynecological examination, she was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia. The patient was treated with a curettage. The hop-containing <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>product</b> was discontinued, and the patient recovered. Patient B developed abdominal pain/cramps and vaginal hemorrhage after 5 months of use. A cervix smear, internal examination, and ultrasound were performed. Due to the thickness of the endometrium, a pipelle endometrial biopsy was performed. Results showed no indication for cervix cancer. The use of MenoCool®was ceased; follow-up information received from the patient shortly thereafter indicated that she had almost entirely recovered from the abdominal pain/cramps and vaginal hemorrhage. Hop (Humulus lupulus) has phytoestrogenic properties that may be the cause of endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent vaginal hemorrhage.

With the potentials inherent in medicinal plants, it is imperative to explore phytotherapy for spinal cord injury since conventional methods of treatments have failed to provide any satisfactory clinical intervention. The current reasoning is to evaluate several therapeutic agents in a multimodal therapeutic strategy for the treatment of spinal cord injury. However, determining the therapeutic agents for this strategy that would provide satisfactory clinical intervention to achieve meaningful functional sensorimotor improvement remains critical. The interventions that would be safe and efficacious for a multimodal treatment strategy for spinal cord injury are not known yet.

40|$|Background: The EC Regulation for Organic Farming {{states that}} organic {{livestock}} {{should be treated}} preferably with <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products.</b> In spite of the high importance of organic livestock in Europe, primarily ruminants, today almost no phytotherapeutic product is registered for livestock. Also, scientific information regarding veterinary phytotherapy is rare. The aim {{of this paper is}} to find approaches to cope with health problems of organic ruminants in Europe on the basis of findings from the European ethnoveterinary medicine (EuEVM). Methods: A systematic review of ethno-biomedicinal papers was conducted with the aid of the Scopus database, and 75 papers, from European countries were analyzed regarding ethnoveterinary information. Results: A total of 590 plant species referring to 102 different plant families are reported to be used for animal treatment, with Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Lamiaceae being the most important families. The traditional use of some plant species (e. g. mallow, chamomile, wormwood) corresponds with findings from recent scientific literature. The large number of less studied plant species, such as white lupin as an antiparasitic herb, and Helleborus spp. as potential immunostimulatory agent, opens an interesting field for future research. Conclusions: In general, EuEVM provides interesting treatment approaches for gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders as well as parasitosis. Findings regarding disorders of female genital or respiratory tract are less consistent. Nevertheless, EuEVM offers a solid basis for stimulating research in veterinary phytotherapy in Europe with a perspective to solve animal health problems in organic or even nonorganic ruminant production...|$|E

The herbal products may {{be a source of}} toxic metals, either by natural contamination or by the same human activities, including adulteration. Toxic metals exposure, such as lead and mercury, causes serious adverse health effects, therefore it must be controlled. Wet digestion with oxidizing acids is the most common sample preparation for metallic elements determination. Nonetheless, today is known that the use of microwave ovens improves greatly the efficiency of both dissolution and digestion. In this paper, we evaluate a microwave-assisted acid digestion by using an acid/oxidant mixture solution and a domestic microwave-equipment as method preparation for determining lead in a phytotherapeutic product (Taraxacum officinale). Digestion was carried out in three sequential steps: firstly, acid/oxidant treatment (HNO 3) for 30 seconds by using the microwave-assisted acid digestion method; after, an intermediate cool treatment procedure for 5 minutes; and finally, oxidant treatment with H 2 O 2 for 30 seconds. The quantitative analysis was performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry with electrothermal atomization. The analyzed sample did not exceed the Pb concentration of 10 mg kg- 1 for herbal products suggested by the WHO. Nevertheless, the method could be applied in the determination of Pb at levels very close to the limit set by WHO, and even above it, with a variation coefficient better than 10 % (including the digestion system and analytical system).

In veterinary education neither veterinary alternative medicine nor characteristics of organic livestock husbandry are taught sufficiently. The access of information and search for literature about specific topics is difficult, because the information is spread in a variety of sources. The objective of this project was to develop an internet based information system, to supply {{the increasing}} demand for information about alternative therapies in organic productive livestock farming. For this purpose an innovative concept for the compilation of a literature review was developed and implemented. After seven month the information system was already available online ([URL] It comprises a daily growing data base with 231 commented articles as of today. In addition it contains news about alternative medicine, the basics of alternative therapy, descriptions of the legal regulations of organic farming and a database for continuing education.

40|$|Background Pharyngitis is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} pharynx and associated structures commonly caused by the Group A streptococci (GAS). There is a growing interest in discovering plant-based anti-inflammatory compounds as potential alternatives to conventional drugs. This study evaluated anti-inflammatory activity of phytochemical-rich extracts prepared from 12 herbal plants using human tonsil epithelial cells (HTonEpiC) in vitro. Methods The HTonEpiC were induced by a mixture of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) (10 µg/mL; bacterial antigens) for 4 h and then exposed to ethanol extracts (EE) or aqueous extracts (AE) for 20 h. The secretion of four pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of the extracts were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Results The herbal plant extracts (≤ 5 µg/mL) were not cytotoxic to HTonEpiC. The extracts exhibited {{a broad range of}} reduction (1. 2 %– 92. 6 %) of secretion of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), human beta defensin- 2 (hBD- 2), epithelial-derived neutrophil activating protein- 78 (ENA- 78), and granulocyte chemotactic protein- 2 (GCP- 2). Both EE and AE of clove, ginger, and echinacea flower and EE from danshen root significantly inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokine production as induced by LTA and PGN in HTonEpiCs at the concentrations of 1 and 5 µg/mL. Discussion Our observations indicate that danshen root, clove, ginger, and echinacea flower extracts exhibit an anti-inflammatory effect in HTonEpiCs. The most efficacious extracts from danshen root, clove, ginger and echinacea flowers have potential to be used as natural sources for developing <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products</b> in the management of painful inflammation due to streptococcal pharyngitis...|$|E

In the control group (healthy) and in the groups with induced diabetes, treated {{for a period of}} two months with ERIDIAROM ® and with DIAVIT (original <b>phytotherapeutic</b> <b>products)</b> the changes were of little intensity and without morphopathological relevance. MATERIAL AND METHODS The researches were made on Wistar male rats, with the average body weight of 150 g, in which the diabetes was induced by i. p. administration of 4 mg/ 100 g body weight Streptozotocin. After 3 days, there were formed 5 groups of 6 animals / each and another group of 6 healthy animals (healthy control group). All the animals were kept and fed in standardized conditions. The groups were divided as follow: Group 1 - healthy control group; Group 2 – it was not treated after the induction of the diabetes – diabetic control group; Group 3 [...] treated with 2. 7 g ERIDIAROM ® per day (9 tablets); Group 4 – treated with 3 g of DIAVIT per day (3 tablets); Group 5 – treated with 0. 850 g of SIOFOR (1 tablet) together with 2 g of lactose; Group 6 – treated with 2 g of MEGUAN (4 tablets of 500 mg) together with 2 g of lactose. The observation and the treatment were for a period of 60 days, after there were prelevated organs samples for the histopathological exams). The pieces were fixed, sectioned and stained by Hematoxylin and Trichromic methods...|$|E
40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{significant}} disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle and is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare concern. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. This study examined the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment in the prevention of mastitis and quantified the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had on the number of clinical cases of mastitis on somatic cell counts within herds. Context and background Organic dairy farming is a significant industry with milk being the largest single organic product in the UK. Organic milk is produced to defined standards which meet the Advisory Committee on Organic Standards (ACOS) criteria. These standards ‘emphasise animal welfare and, by avoiding artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other non-natural chemicals, and prohibiting the routine use of antibiotics and other conventional drugs, also ensure care for the environment, and promote the highest standards of food quality and safety’ (Omsco 2005). As part of the management of organic dairy cattle with reduced use of conventional pharmaceutical treatments, many organic farmers use homeopathic and other complementary therapies on their animals. Mastitis is recognised as the main animal health problem in organic milk production systems (Bennedsgaard et al 2003). Whilst mastitis levels appear to be similar to those found in conventional production (Hovi and Roderick, 2000) specific problem areas in mastitis control under organic management standards have been identified. One of the overall goals of organic animal husbandry is to avoid disease through management, husbandry, breeding and feeding. According to the EC-Regulation No. 1804 / 1999 governing organic livestock production, animal health management should be based on disease prevention. However, the preventive use of chemically synthesised allopathic medicinal products like dry cow antibiotics is not permitted. In organic units, <b>phytotherapeutic</b> and homeopathic <b>products</b> and trace elements are to be used in preference to antibiotic and prolonged withdrawal periods need to be observed after conventional medicine use. As a consequence of these requirements, organic dairy farmers look for alternatives to conventional therapy and prophylaxis (Hektoen 2004). Homeopathy is widely used for the treatment of mastitis within UK organic dairy herds and prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes, either continuously or just during housing, is practised on many organic dairy farms and is thought to offer general protection against mastitis and to reduce somatic cell counts (SCC). Research into the effectiveness of homeopathic treatments {{was one of the most}} important research requirements identified in a recent MAFF review of animal health within organic herds (Hovi & Roderick 1999). The range of homeopathic treatments used on farm today is wide, with treatment practices either focussing on the needs of the individual animal, which is known as constitutional treatment and which employs individual remedies, or aimed at groups of animals using specific remedies, or ‘nosodes’, which are considered to be a very specific form of homeopathy - isopathy (iso - all the same, pathy – treatment/exposure). Unlike specific remedies, nosodes do not account for the individual needs of each animal, but create the potential for protective treatment for a herd or group, they are generally applied in drinking water, and may be used on individual animals, usually by vulval spray. Benefit for the sector and for Defra Mastitis {{is the most}} significant disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle, and management and control of mastitis is an important facet of practical dairy herd management. Mastitis is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare problem in dairy cattle. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. The Study Ninety-six farms participated in a double-blind trial to compare a homeopathic nosode and an inactive control treatment (carrier alone). Treatments were at the farm level and took place over a period of 12 months or 24 months (some farms were swapped to the opposite treatment during a second year). The treatments were randomised to each farm by a third party. During the trial, where available, records were collected of farm monthly bulk tank somatic cell count (BMSSC), a monthly cell count based on National Milk Recording data (NMR) and the annual number of cases of mastitis as recorded by the farmer. Additional farm level data were collected and their relationship to the level of mastitis on the farms investigated. Objectives of the Study The study described in this report explores the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment, a nosode, in the prevention of mastitis and quantifies the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had in reducing the number of clinical cases of mastitis and also quantifying any effect that the use of a nosode has on somatic cell counts within herds. •	To quantify the effectiveness of the prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes for the treatment of mastitis in reducing the incidence of clinical mastitis and the concentration of somatic cells in milk. •	To survey management practices on organically managed farms. •	To investigate associations between the homeopathic treatment, farm management practice and the incidence of different types of mastitis and to provide guidance for mastitis control in organic dairy herds. Materials and methods In testing the efficacy of a homeopathic nosode it was determined that the study should: •	Look at a nosode already being commonly used and commercially available. •	Not ask for new recording systems to be used for data collection but to use the existing systems which are in place. •	Not interfere in the ‘normal’ practises carried out by the farms, by, for example, repeated prompting of farmers to carry out treatments, or ask them to adopt prescribed ways for describing, recording or treating mastitis. There are three commonly used measures of the udder health of milking cows: a) 	The bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC, commonly referred to as SCC) gives a count (in 000 ’s cells / ml) of white cells and desquamated cells shed by the udder. The BMSCC is not an accurate indicator for the presence of clinical mastitis, but may give information on sub-clinical (undetected) mastitis. b) 	Somatic cell counts for individual cows from farms which subscribe to commercial milk recording services (ICSCC). c) 	The number of cases of mastitis. The incidence rate for clinical mastitis (IRCM) is the number of distinct cases of mastitis in 100 cows in a year. The response variables that were measured were: •	Farmers’ own record of mastitis cases. •	Bulk milk SCC. •	Individual cow somatic cell records (ICSCC) if the farms were on a milk recording service. •	Farmer’s opinion of his/her success in controlling mastitis. •	A large number of variables, recorded using a questionnaire at the farm visits, which could influence mastitis and the effectiveness of the treatment. After visiting a number of homeopathic pharmacies, an agreement was made with Crossgates homeopathic pharmacy 1, and Freemans Homeopathic Pharmacy 2 (Appendix D) to make the individual herd specific nosode remedies for the farms. The trial was double-blinded, with blinding carried out by the creation of a randomly generated list of A and B’s. As each new farm was recruited, it was allocated to the next A or B in the sequence, the farms being allocated to either nosode treatment or control, one by one, in chronological order. Articles were written in the organic press, Organic Farming, and The Turning Worm, inviting farms to take part in the study. It was clear that farms should only join the study voluntarily and would not be ‘cold called’ or pressurised to join. One hundred and four farms responded to the call, and 96 of these farms went on to take part in the study. The 8 farms which declined to take part either went out of milk production before the study started, or changed their minds about inclusion in the trial before the start of the study. The 96 farms were visited and the study introduced. Farmers were issued with a kit to collect milk from high cell count cows for preparation as a nosode. An 80 part questionnaire (Appendix A) was used to gather the information needed to understand the possible factors that may influence mastitis. During visits the farmers were also asked whether they were willing to fill in a self assessment of their personality type. Number of farms recruited 			= 96 Total farms completing the study period	= 88 Number of farm years followed		= 206 Average herd size			= 101 cows Number of cows followed in the study 	= 9, 680 Number of cows receiving remedy (R) 	= 4, 734 Number of cows receiving control (P) 	= 4, 946 Total cow years followed			= 21, 580 cow years (Some farms two years, some 3 years) Farms lost during study			= 8 (due to sale of the herd, or going out of milk production and into, for example, heifer rearing) Results The data collected were subject to a number of different analyses:- 1. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the cell count in milk. 2. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the annual cases of mastitis. 3. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with increased cell count in milk. 4. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with higher levels of mastitis. No effect of nosode in reducing either the incidence of cases of mastitis or the somatic cell counts in the milk were detected. The following risk factors were found to be associated with composite cell counts:- •	A decrease in cell count with increased culling of high cell count cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use complementary therapies on dry cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use dry cow therapy, including teat sealants, on dry cows •	An increased cell count for farms which did not pre-wipe before milking or pre-wiped the teats with a cloth before milking •	An increase in cell count for farms which pre-wipe only the udders of cows which are visibly dirty before milking The following risk factors were found to be associated with the number of cases of mastitis:- •	Increasing herd yield is associated with increased mastitis case numbers •	Increased calving of cows indoors in a calving box was associated with increased numbers of mastitis cases •	Use of an in line clot filer was associated with reduced numbers of mastitis cases •	Having an abreast parlour (as opposed to a herringbone or rotary parlour) was associated with a reduced numbers of mastitis cases The extent to which the objectives set have been achieved The effectiveness of homeopathic nosodes in treating mastitis and lowering cell count is quantified and described (Objective 1) and the survey results of management practices on organically managed dairy farms are described (Objective 2). Additionally, the associations between homeopathic treatment, farm management practices, mastitis incidence and cell count are quantified (Objective 4) and management controls which show a reduction in mastitis cases or cell counts are identified as risk factors and described in the report (Objective 5). Conclusions •	There was no significant effect of the herd specific nosode on either the cell count of milk or the number of cases of mastitis. •	That there were strong ‘within farm’ correlations of cell count and cases i. e. between farms, farms tend to stay at the same level of cases and average cell count from year to year. •	That there was a characteristic pattern of seasonal change in cell counts (this is already widely recognised). •	The study provides useful and interesting statistics on organic dairy farm production. •	The study identified an association between decreased cell count and culling for high cell count, the use of complementary dry cow therapy and the use of traditional dry cow therapy. •	The study identified an association between increased cell count and not pre-wiping the udder, pre-wiping using a cloth and only pre-wiping dirty cows. •	The study identified an association between higher numbers of mastitis cases and higher average yield and also with higher percentage of cows calving in a calving box. •	An association was identified between decreased numbers of mastitis cases and the use of an in-line clot filter and also with farms with an abreast parlour (rather than a herring-bone parlour). •	Eighty five per cent of farmers in the survey responded that they did believe in non-conventional remedies, and 62 per cent of farmers responded that they used non-conventional remedies on their own family. ...|$|R
