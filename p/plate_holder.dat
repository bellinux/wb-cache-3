5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence <b>plate</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front door handles, recessed rear door handles, and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence <b>plate</b> <b>holder.</b> The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear door handles and prominent front door handles to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|E
50|$|In {{order that}} {{the corners of the}} plate would not tear the buffing {{material}} when the plate was polished, the edges of the plate were bent back using patented devices that could also serve as <b>plate</b> <b>holders</b> to avoid touching the surface of the plate during processing.|$|R

50|$|Sheet film {{or glass}} <b>plate</b> <b>holders</b> for medium format {{rollfilm}} cameras can be found, but are of mainly historical interest. Some rollfilm cameras have interchangeable backs to accommodate different film types. Some 35mm cameras have motorised backs that hold longer than normal film lengths, with a mechanism that automatically advances the film after each exposure.|$|R
25|$|For 1974, a new {{rear bumper}} system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The anti-theft alarm key activator was moved from the rear panel to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of custom plate options in Victoria, issued by V Plates on behalf of VicRoads. Custom or personalised plates come with the {{optional}} purchase of a contract. This contract allows the <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> to retain the plates whether on a vehicle or not. Holding a contract on certain plates, means that when the plates are no longer registered they cannot be resold/issued to another person unless the contract holder sells the contract. VicRoads (who own V Plates) do not know the cumulative figure {{of the total number of}} custom registration plates sold since they were first launched in 1986. This is because many personalised plates are not on vehicles, or they are held on self-retention, or have been handed back to VicRoads. However, VicRoads do know that around 30,000 sets of custom registration plates are made every year, and they estimate 10 percent of registered vehicles have custom registration plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, {{the sensitivity of the}} photographic plate, and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on a sunny day. Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E
50|$|Military Service Company, {{the oldest}} {{division}} of EBSCO Industries Inc, was founded during World War II and provides {{an array of}} goods and services that serve the U.S. military. The Birmingham, AL-based company’s popular military commemoratives inventory includes challenge coins for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Veterans, National Guard as well as military-themed license <b>plate</b> <b>holders,</b> pens and more.|$|R
50|$|The wet {{collodion}} {{process had}} a major disadvantage. The entire process, from coating to developing, {{had to be done}} before the plate dried. This gave the photographer no more than 10 minutes to complete everything. This made it inconvenient for field use, as it required a portable darkroom. The plate dripped silver nitrate solution, causing stains and troublesome build-ups in the camera and <b>plate</b> <b>holders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Glass {{plates were}} later {{replaced}} by sheet film {{in a dark}} slide for sheet film; adaptor sleeves were made to allow sheet film {{to be used in}} <b>plate</b> <b>holders.</b> In addition to the ground glass, a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted. Cameras which take single exposures on sheet film and are functionally identical to plate cameras were used for static, high-image-quality work; much longer in 20th century, see Large-format camera, below.|$|R
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license <b>plate</b> <b>holder.</b> The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the bulky size of the view camera, Weston boasted he could [...] "set up the tripod, fasten the camera {{securely}} to it, attach the lens to the camera, open the shutter, study {{the image on the}} ground glass, focus it, close the shutter, insert the <b>plate</b> <b>holder,</b> cock the shutter, set it to the appropriate aperture and speed, remove the slide from the <b>plate</b> <b>holder,</b> make the exposure, replace the slide, and remove the <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> in two minutes and twenty seconds." ...|$|E
2500|$|...*Until the 1980 {{season the}} #1 <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> was {{considered}} #1 overall amateur or professional. The NBL {{did have a}} pro class in 1977, 1978 & 1979 but the title of National Number One Professional was not created until the 1980 season when the pros and the 16 Experts were separated and the pros earning separate points (in the form of purse money won) from the amateurs. Prior to 1980 the pros, due to the comparatively small number of them, competed with the 16 Experts {{and were able to}} earn amateur titles.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{sheet film}} and glass <b>plate</b> <b>holders</b> {{have been made}} out of wood. Wooden holders, {{properly}} treated, can last a very long time, and apart from possible warpage, many very old specimens are still in service. Some companies continue to make wood models today, particularly for more uncommon film sizes, and as many are mostly handmade, they can be quite expensive. The majority of new sheet film holders are now made out of plastic.|$|R
50|$|The big {{surprise}} of the 1999 Benson & Hedges Cup was {{the failure of the}} defending <b>Plate</b> <b>holders,</b> Guildford Flames, to get past {{the first round of the}} Cup. Unfortunately for Stan Marple's team, they were drawn into the difficult Group C which produced the eventual Plate finalists, Basingstoke Bison and Slough Jets. That said, Flames were the only BNL team to beat the Bison, 5-1, on the first weekend of the season, a contest best remembered for Bison turning up without their strip and a mass brawl in the final minute.|$|R

2500|$|He was {{not able}} to develop the plate until he arrived in Paris nearly a week later. He {{reported}} he went to the Eastman Kodak Company in Paris to use their darkroom but was referred to a local photographer instead. He went to the photographer's home and developed the plate there. The name of the photographer who lent his facility is unknown. Stieglitz offered to pay the photographer for the use of his darkroom and materials but he photographer told him, [...] "I know who you are and it's an honor to have you in my darkroom." [...] Stieglitz kept the developed image in its original <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> to protect it until he returned to New York several weeks later.|$|E
2500|$|A 55 degree raked {{windshield}} {{was made}} of safety glass, while the license <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window. Underneath the new body material were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six-cylinder engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and drum brakes. The engine's output, , was increased however from a Carter triple-carburetor system exclusive to the Corvette, but performance of the car was decidedly [...] "lackluster". Compared to the British and Italian sports cars of the day, the Corvette lacked a manual transmission and required more effort to bring to a stop, but like their British competition, such as Morgan, was not fitted with roll-up windows; this {{would have to wait}} until sometime in the 1956 model year. A Paxton centrifugal supercharger became available in 1954 as a dealer-installed option, greatly improving the Corvette's straight-line performance, but sales continued to decline.|$|E
5000|$|Forestville's {{unofficial}} {{motto is}} [...] "Forestville, The Good Life." [...] This phrase appears on license <b>plate</b> <b>holders</b> {{sold at the}} local hardware store.

The [...] "downtown" [...] blocks were first developed during the 1870s and 1880s. A fire destroyed many of the older structures, and existing buildings date mostly to the early 20th century. According to Sonoma State University professor Jonah Raskin, Forestville [...] "was a gathering place for bohemians and writers and artists, circa 1900." ...|$|R

2500|$|With the {{widespread}} experimentation with x‑rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time. In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and Dr. William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dr. Dudley was X-rayed. A {{child who had}} been shot in the head was brought to the Vanderbilt laboratory in 1896. Before trying to find the bullet an experiment was attempted, for which Dudley [...] "with his characteristic devotion to science" [...] volunteered. Daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of Dudley's skull (with an exposure time of one hour), he noticed a bald spot [...] in diameter on the part of his head nearest the X-ray tube: [...] "A <b>plate</b> <b>holder</b> with the plates towards the side of the skull was fastened and a coin placed between the skull and the head.

50|$|During 1973, Lo Tak Shing, as the Chairman of the Transport Advisory Committee Chairman to Governor Sir Murray MacLehose, {{recommended}} {{the implementation of}} a special license plate auction system. The system provided for the auction of a license plate upon the license <b>plate</b> <b>holder's</b> death, with the proceeds to be returned to the government and allocated for charitable purposes. The government accepted the proposals and then in the same year in May, Hong Kong held its first license plate auctions. Since 1908, the British government in Hong Kong had been issuing license plates to senior officials. Lo Tak Shing had a license plate with number 18 which was bought at an auction in February 2008 for a record amount by businessman Zhang Chengguang.|$|R
50|$|In Australia {{the rules}} vary {{from state to}} state. A new driver holds a Learner licence/permit which has a minimum age of 16 or 15 and 9 months in some areas. This must then be held for {{a certain amount of time}} before a driving {{examination}} can be undertaken usually 12 months later. After passing the driver must display 'P' <b>plates.</b> <b>Holders</b> of a provisional/probationary licence may be restricted compared to fully licensed drivers in speed, blood alcohol limits, limits on the type and power of their car's engine (i.e., no more than 6 cylinders, no forced induction), and number of demerit points that can be deducted. VicRoads, the Victorian road authority, publish information for learner drivers on the L-Site.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the {{focusing}} screen is {{almost as long as}} the {{history of the}} camera.

And then like a vision of purpose came Mr. Gambell, the greengrocer, running out of Clayford's Alley and buttoning on his jacket as he ran. His great brass fireman's helmet was on his head, hiding it all but the sharp nose, the firm mouth, the intrepid chin.

50|$|The {{manufacture}} of licence plates is strictly {{controlled by the}} authorities. Plates are provided when a registration application is accepted. If plates are stolen, new ones will not be issued until a police enquiry is complete. Plates of all types, except some F-type plates, were previously produced in aluminium. Between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011, plates were made of plastic, which made them slightly thicker than the older aluminium ones (requiring thicker <b>plate</b> <b>holders).</b> These <b>plates</b> were much less expensive. They had a transparent plastic layer {{on top of the}} layer with the writing, which was especially prone to breaking on impact during cold weather (such as being hit by another car's trailer hitch). This, in addition to the higher recycling costs of plastic compared to aluminum led to the cessation of plastic plates in favour of aluminum ones as of 1 January 2012, although with the same price as the plastic plates.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the development, construction and sea testing of an underwater holographic camera (HoloCam) for in situ recording of marine organisms and particles in {{large volumes of}} sea water. HoloCam comprises a laser, power supply, holographic recording optics and <b>plate</b> <b>holders,</b> a water-tight housing and a support frame. Added to this are control electronics such that the entire camera is remotely operable and controllable from ship or dock-side. Uniquely the camera can simultaneously record both in-line and off-axis holograms using a pulsed frequency doubled Nd-YAG laser. In-line holography is capable of producing images of organisms with a resolution of better than 10 Pm (at concentrations up to a few thousand per cubic centimetre at the smallest sizes). Off-axis holograms of aquatic systems of up to 50, 000 cm 3 volume, have been recorded. Following initial laboratory testing, the holo-camera was evaluated in an observation tank and ultimately was tested in Loch Etive, Scotland. In-line and off-axis holograms were recorded {{to a depth of}} 100 m. We will present results on the test dives and evaluation of the camera performance...|$|R
