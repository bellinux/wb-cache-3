40|$|Background: Agonists of glucagon-like peptide- 1 {{receptor}} (GLP- 1 R) and glucokinase activators (GKA) act as antidiabetic agents {{by their}} ability protect beta cells, and stimulate insulin secretion. Oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses aggravate {{type 2 diabetes}} by causing beta cell loss. It was shown that GLP- 1 R agonists protect beta cells from oxidative and ER stresses. On the other hand, little is known regarding how GKAs protect beta cells. We hypothesized that GKAs protect beta cells by mechanisms distinct from those underlying GLP- 1 R agonist and tested our hypothesis by comparing the molecular effects of exenatide, a GLP- 1 R agonist, and <b>piragliatin,</b> a GKA, on INS- 1 cells under oxidative and ER-induced stresses. Methods: Beta cells were treated with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce oxidative stress and with palmitate or thapsigargin (Tg) to induce ER stress respectively, {{and the effects of}} exenatide and <b>piragliatin</b> on these cells were investigated by: a) characterizing the kinases involved employing specific kinase inhibitors, and b) by identifying the differentially regulated proteins in response to stresses with proteomic analysis. Results: Exenatide protected INS- 1 cells from both ER and STZ-induced death. In contrast, <b>piragliatin</b> rescued the cells only from STZ-induced stress. Akt activation by exenatide appeared to contribute to its protective effects of beta cells while enhanced glucose utilization was the contributing factor in the case of <b>piragliatin.</b> Also, exenatide, not <b>piragliatin,</b> blocke...|$|E
40|$|Glucokinase {{activators}} (GKAs) {{are being}} developed {{for the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes. The toxicity of 4 GKAs (PF- 04279405, PF- 04651887, <b>piragliatin,</b> and PF- 04937319) was assessed in mice, rats, dogs, and/or monkeys. GKAs were administered for 2 to 8 weeks. Standard endpoints, glucose, and insulin were assessed. All compounds produced varying degrees of hypoglycemia in all species. Brain neuronal necrosis and/or per-ipheral neuropathy were observed with most compounds. These findings are consistent with literature reports linking hypoglycemia with nervous system effects. Arteriopathy, mainly of cardiac vessels, was observed at a low frequency in monkey and/or dog. Arteriopathy occurred only at doses that produced severe and prolonged periods of repeated hypoglycemia. Since this lesion occurred in multiple studies with structurally distinct GKAs, these results suggested arteriopathy was related to GKA pharmacology. The morphological characteristics of the arteriopathy were consistent with that produced by experimental catecholamine administration. We hypothesize that the prolonged periods of hypoglycemia resulted in increased local and/or systemic concentrations of catecholamines via a counterregulatory and/or stress-related mechanism. Alternatively, prolonged hypoglycemia may have resulted in endothelial dysfunction leading to arteriopathy. This risk can be managed in human patients in clinical studies by careful glu-cose monitoring and intervention to avoid prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia...|$|E
