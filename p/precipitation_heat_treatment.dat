40|$|Designing {{microstructure}} {{of components}} made from Inconel 718 nickel based superalloy (IN 718) with tailored mechanical properties for high temperature applications, require sequential thermo-mechanical processing. This often includes straining and annealing at solution annealing temperature (i. e. ≈ 980 ℃) followed by water quenching and subsequent aging <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> at lower temperatures. In {{addition to the}} microstructure development (i. e. <b>precipitation)</b> the aging <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> partially relieve the residual stresses generated at previous stages of forging and water quenching, however the stress field will not be completely relaxed. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted on round tensile specimens made from IN 718 bar to investigate tensile stress relaxation behaviours at elevated temperatures used for aging <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> The stress relaxation curves obtained can be described by a hyperbolic function with a non-zero asymptotic stress (σ∞), {{which seems to be}} proportional to the initially applied stress (σ 0) for a fixed temperature. This behaviour is investigated at temperatures between 620 ℃ and 770 ℃ that is a temperature range used in industry to perform the aging <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> to obtain microstructures with tailored mechanical properties. It has been shown that the σ∞/ σ 0 ratio has decreased rapidly with increasing temperature at this range. The relaxation behaviour has been assessed numerically and an empirical relationship has been defined for each temperature {{that can be used for}} modelling purposes...|$|R
40|$|Increases in life {{expectancy}} {{and improvements in}} necessary healthcare attach great importance {{to the development of}} biomaterials. Ti alloys containing beta stabilizing elements are often used as biomaterials due to their high specific strength, high corrosion resistance, unusual biocompatibility and low elastic moduli, which benefit bone tissues close to an implant. This study deals with phase stability in beta Ti-Mo-Sn alloys processed under different conditions and was performed according to the following steps: a study of the effect of Sn content (a) on phase stability in Ti-Mo alloys, (b) on the suppression of alpha" and omega phase precipitation; (c) on alpha-phase <b>precipitation</b> during aging <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> and (d) on mechanical properties, including the elastic modulus, as measured using tensile tests and acoustic techniques. The alloys were prepared by arc melting under a controlled atmosphere followed by homogenization <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> and hot rolling. Optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry were employed for characterization purposes. Samples were also submitted to solution treatment above the beta transus temperature and aging <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> under a controlled atmosphere. The results suggest that Sn suppresses the formation of the to and alpha" phases in Ti-Mo system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Antibacterial {{materials}} play {{an important}} role in clinical application, and silver has been known to exhibit strong cytotoxicity towards a broad range of micro-organisms. In this work, the amorphous calcium phosphate with silver substitution (Ag-ACP) was synthesized by chemical precipitation method, and the valence of silver in ACP was adjusted by temperature. The processed Ag-ACP was combined with slightly acidic compounds to form new calcium phosphate cement (CPC). Our results indicate that the valence of silver in CPC was adjusted successfully by chemical <b>precipitation</b> method and <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results demonstrated that silver ion in CPC- 1 and CPC- 2 existed in Ag 3 PO 4; after <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> of 460 °C, silver became more stable in CPC- 3 and CPC- 4. Silver in CPC- 1 and CPC- 2 exhibited better releasing property. After <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 460 °C, the amount of silver ion released from CPC decreased significantly. Besides, the antibacterial ability of Ag-CPC was adjusted by changing the valence of silver in Ag-CPC. Depending on the low valence of silver and good silver release, CPC- 1 and CPC- 2 exhibited better antibacterial activity. We believe that this study will motivate the development and applications of antibacterial CPC in bone tissue regeneration. Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|R
