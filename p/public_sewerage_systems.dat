40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{deals with}} issue of costs for individual building owners in relation with {{connection to the}} public sewerage system, i. e. construction of individual sewerage connection. On the basis of selected project examples of <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> in smaller villages, first part of thesis is dedicated to different kinds of sewerage connections, where {{the most important aspect}} is length of the sewerage connection. Hereinafter individual (house) connections are evaluated according to selected length groups on the basis of inventory works and pre-measurements. First part of the thesis concludes with comparison of comprehensive cost value of building of public sewerage network with regards of costs of such network for municipality on one hand and costs for owners of individual buildings on the other. Second part of the thesis deals with the issue of increasing costs of individual (house) sewerage connections for individual building owners, depending on terrain endowments (type of soil, the size of the depth of excavation). The last part of thesis addresses reducing of costs for citizens in cases where due to terrain endowments costs for building of individual (home) sewerage connection is too high. In conclusion I try to display possible solutions and good practices of some municipalities, which try to ensure most even distribution of costs between different building owners, who are interested in connecting their buildings to public sewerage system in one municipality...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to support the policy on {{preventive}} soil protection with information concerning potential sources of local soil pollution. This study was an extension to earlier inventories on (potential) sources of soil pollution (e. g. industrial areas, landfills, oil-storage tanks). The emissions to soil were determined for eight potential sources and, following, potential soil concentrations in the top layer of the soil were estimated. Where possible these calculated concentrations were compared with measurements. The following sources were selected: <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems,</b> pipelines (for oil products), roads and motorways, railways, tramways, galvanised power pylons, surface treatments and building activities. The study focused on heavy metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and oil products. Conclusions have been made on (1) the contribution of the sources to the total emissions to the soil and (2) to the expected exceedance of the target values of pollutants in soil near sources mentioned. The contribution of the eight sources to the total emissions to soil is between 1 and 15 % for heavy metals, about 41 % for PAHs and maximally 15 % for mineral oil. From the point of view of soil protection, the following sources and substances warrant further attention: emissions of chlorinated hydrocarbons from public sewerage systems; emission and dispersion of lead, zinc, PAHs and oil along motorways; emission of copper along railways and tramways; potential leaching of PAH's and oil from railways; emission of dichloromethane to the soil during the cleaning of buildings or removal of paint; and copper, chromium and PAHs leaching from impregnated wood to the soil...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to support the policy on {{preventive}} soil protection with information on the diffuse (non-local) emissions to soil and the influence on future soil quality. This study is related to inventories on (potential) sources of local soil pollution (e. g. industrial areas, landfills, oil-storage tanks, <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems,</b> pipelines, roads and motorways, railways etc.). The diffuse sources included in this study are: atmospheric deposition, manure, fertilizer, pesticides, purifying sludge, compost, dredging sludge, corrosion of metals, leaching of preserved wood and hunting. The study focused on heavy metals, some pesticides, chlorinated hydrocarbons, chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and oil(products). A survey was made on present and future soil quality. Four types of land use were distinguished: nature conservation areas/forest, agricultural land, infrastructural and urban areas. Conclusions have been made on (1) the contribution of the different sources to the total emissions to the soil and on (2) the expected exceedance of pollutant target values in soil affected by emissions. Important sources of non-local emissions to soil are atmospheric deposition, manure, fertilizer, dredging sludge, corrosion and leaching of impregnated wood. To guard the soil quality in the future, the emissions of cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, chromium, pesticides, trichloroethylene, chlorinated phenols and PAHs will have to decrease. The present emissions of arsenic, endosulfan, HCB, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane and benzene to soil are probably acceptable. For many other substances little is known about the influence of the present load on future soil quality. Therefore more calculations to estimate the development of soil quality are recommended. Also actualization and differentiation of the emission data needs more attention...|$|E

40|$|An {{artificial}} {{tidal flat}} {{was prepared for}} the mitigation tool on coastal environment. However, it is considered {{that most of the}} flat was not restored to the sufficient amenities for aquatic living things, migratory birds, etc. because none of the ecological mechanisms were understood or planned for. It is therefore investigated in this paper that historical transition factors in ecosystem structure are selected and traced with the diffusion of a <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system,</b> and with environmental factors such as water quality, sediment condition, and aquatic producers in the Yatsu Tidal Flat. As a result, it can be defined that the tidal flat, just like a lagoon, was formed artificially with reclamation and development of its circumference at the first step of transition; the water quality and sediment condition gradually became brackish water and muddy sediment conditions, interactively. The ecosystem pyramid forming orderly layers according to trophic level appeared as a high-bio-production potential in its tidal flat. In the second step, i. e., in recent years, the characteristics of water quality and sediment conditions evolved into a foreshore tidal flat, namely, conditions in the flat observed were that the progression of water included a high concentration of chloride ion as seawater and sediment conditions became sandy. Because of that, the inflowing fresh water and organic mater from the land area decreased with the improvement of the <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> The ecosystem pyramid was distorted into a chaos pyramid, with inversion of Ulva spp...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sewerage</b> <b>system</b> (cloaca), {{which implies}} any cavity through which waste water flows, has in Roman law a special legal {{protection}} {{due to its}} importance for public health preservation and safety of citizens. In Praetorian Edict, two interdicts are envisaged; one prohibitory, by which private <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> is protected and one restitutory, by which <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> is protected. It is possible that a restitutory interdict about private <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> existed. By the <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> interdict, a person who blocks or damages <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> is ordered to restore everything to previous state. By the private sewerage interdict, anyone is forbidden to obstruct a person who wants to repair sewerage that leads from his building through neighboring buildings. By lawyers' interpretations, the application of this interdict is expanded to all realty, {{as well as a}} situation of building a new <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, it is envisaged by Praetorian edict that against a person who builds or repairs sewerage neither interdict uti possidetis can be filed.

40|$|A {{treatability}} {{study of}} industrial wastewater containing chlorinated nitroaromatic compounds (CNACs) by a catalytic ozonation process (COP) with a modified Mn/Co ceramic catalyst and an aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was investigated. A preliminary attempt {{to treat the}} diluted wastewater with a single SBR resulted in ineffective removal of the color, ammonia, total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Next, COP was applied as a pretreatment {{in order to obtain}} a bio-compatible wastewater for SBR treatment in a second step. The effectiveness of the COP pretreatment was assessed by evaluating wastewater biodegradability enhancement (the ratio of biology oxygen demand after 5 d (BOD 5) to COD), as well as monitoring the evolution of TOC, carbon oxidation state (COS), average oxidation state (AOS), color, and major pollutant concentrations with reaction time. In the COP, the catalyst preserved its catalytic properties even after 70 reuse cycles, exhibiting good durability and stability. The performance of SBR to treat COP effluent was also examined. At an organic loading rate of 2. 0 kg COD/(m 3 ·d), with hydraulic retention time (HRT) = 10 h and temperature (30 ± 2) °C, the average removal efficiencies of NH 3 -N, COD, BOD 5, TOC, and color in a coupled COP/SBR process were about 80 %, 95. 8 %, 93. 8 %, 97. 6 % and 99. 3 %, respectively, with average effluent concentrations of 10 mg/L, 128 mg/L, 27. 5 mg/L, 25. 0 mg/L, and 20 multiples, respectively, which were all consistent with the national standards for secondary discharge of industrial wastewater into a <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> (GB 8978 - 1996).

40|$|Tešanj municipality, {{situated}} {{in the north of}} the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has an estimated 47, 000 inhabitants, with some 5, 000 to 6, 000 people living in the town of Tešanj. It is a historic town which developed around the river Tešanjka, a tributary of the Usora River. The water distribution system is in technically good condition. Over the past years the primary water networks have been reconstructed and Non Revenue Water is said to be less than 25 %. The main problem is in the water source. The principle source is shallow groundwater along the Usora River. There are several well fields. Because of “poor management ” of the river, such as extensive sand mining and the uncontrolled discharge of pollutants, the aquifers are endangered. The sand pits cause a lowering of the groundwater table and affects the water production quantitatively. The contaminated river water is a threat {{to the quality of the}} groundwater source. A search for deep groundwater as source for municipal water supply has not yielded results. The main reason for the municipality to construct and operate a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is the protection of the water quality of the Usora River. The riverbanks are the major source of water supply for municipalities in the area. The Municipality Tesanj has set as one of the priorities that all the households in the settlements within the Municipality have a possibility to get connected to the public water supply <b>system</b> and <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> (Strategic Objective No 2).

40|$|Environmental hazard by leaking sewers {{depends on}} {{potential}} {{of risk and}} of frequency of every individual sewer damage. We know about {{the different kinds of}} sewer damages and about their frequency in the <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system,</b> but nothing about the total quantity of sewer exfiltration, because exfiltration measurement have not yet been practised. Investigations about consequences of infiltration of groundwater to leaking sewers have been carried out really seldom. We know, that sewer infiltration water can cause hydraulic overloading of the <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> and some troubles of the biological treatment process of the sewage treatment plant. Main targets of this research project were to measure sewer exfiltration and sewer infiltration directly on the spot, to find out the important side-parameters for the quantity of this, to evaluate the environmental hazard and to cooperate in a workgroup for to acquire an evaluation system for the most profitable sequence of the activities of sewer rehabilitation. Quantity of sewer exfiltration was measured by means of a special measuring appliance, which was developed and constructed at the institute. Investigations have been carried out by short-term measurement on broken sewers directly on the spot as well as by long-term measurement on two pilot-plants. Water pollution caused by sewer infiltration was investigated by computer simulation. As a result of the measurements it is possible to give a figure for the sewer exfiltration and to predict the long-term behaviour of a leaking sewer. The migration of exfiltration water and harmful wastewater components is not all constant, even if there are no changes in the rate and in the depth of flow in the defective sewer damage and surrounding soil. Another result was to find out a selfsealing of a sewer damage in consequence of sewer film and particulate wastewater matter. But this selfsealing is only a temporary effect, it can be undone by a high depth of flow or pressure head in the pipe. The long-term investgations by means of pilot plants showed a clear decrease of the concentration of some wastewater components. Sewer infiltration was found to cause a higher effluent load because of the receding efficiency of wastewater treatment plants. Another pathway for a higher water pollution is more frequent spilling with a longer duration of combined sewer overflows. (orig.)

40|$|Global and {{continental}} scale modelling {{has been}} confined to water quantity (e. g. WaterGAP - Water Global Assessment and Prognosis (Alcamo et al. 2003), GWAVA - Global Water AVailability Assessment (Meigh et al, 1999)). Here we describe an approach to include water quality at these scales within the WaterGAP model. The application is to the pan-European area and is being carried out within the EU-funded SCENES Project which has the principal goal of developing new scenarios {{of the future of}} freshwater resources in Europe. The model operates on 5 x 5 arc-minute grid squares. Water flows in and between grid cells are provided by WaterGAP. The water quality loadings into the river system comprise point sources (domestic effluent, manufacturing discharges and urban runoff) and diffuse sources (runoff from land and scattered settlements not connected to the <b>public</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system).</b> Point source loadings are calculated for each country using easily available datasets. For example, the domestic load is a per capita emission factor times by country population multiplied by the percentage of the population connected to the sewage system, which is then reduced by the amount removed in each of three types of sewage treatment (primary, secondary and tertiary). Data on the amount treated in different types of sewage works is set for each country, while the amount removed by treatment types will vary with the water quality variable being modelled. Country level data is converted to grid square data required by the model, according to the population in each grid square. Diffuse sources from land are calculated by regression models based on runoff and land use (e. g. numbers of livestock) for each model grid square. The modelling system has currently been set up to simulate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total dissolved solids. The model was tested against measured longitudinal profiles and time series data for BOD on contrasting rivers e. g. the River Thames (UK) driven by domestic loading and the River Ebro (Spain) with a high share of discharges from livestock farming. Further developments will see the inclusion of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved oxygen. Within the SCENES project a set of future scenarios reflecting different outlooks on Europe has been developed, called “Economy First”, “Fortress Europe”, “Sustainability Eventually” and “Policy Rules”. An Expert Panel was used to suggest what these futures would mean for drivers of water quantity and water quality across pan-Europe. We have projected how changes in percentage population connected to sewers, the level of sewage treatment and population would change loadings from domestic effluent for TN, TP and BOD. In time, these will be used to predict future water quality in European rivers. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze an {{influence}} of an inflow penetrating into two selected small <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> during a rainy weather on pollutant concentration and load in raw sewage. Studies were conducted in 2010 – 2015 on two small <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> in Małopolska province. The studies confirmed that the inflow penetrating into the <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> resulted in a decrease of pollutant concentrations in sewage. However, they also showed that this dilution was not constant for all types of pollutants. The most important outcome {{of the study was}} demonstrating that despite its diluting effect on pollutants, the intense inflow into a <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> resulted in an increase of a sewage pollutant load. This increase was not regular, but it was rising dramatically when the inflow share in sewage exceeded 50 %. The study indicated that the inflow penetrating into the <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> should not be disregarded, as it actually presented a significant threat to the wastewater treatment process and in consequence to the quality of recipient waters...|$|R
