5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The <b>plan</b> <b>does</b> not have any additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples {{are the same as}} found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E

The Plan was established by the Government of Canada on schedule on June 28, 2012 with a budget of $25 million, $500,000 of {{which was to be}} used for supporting victims. The NAP-CHT's recommendations are divided into four categories called the [...] "4 Ps": partnership, prevention, prosecution, and protection.

500|$|Between Smith's and Glossop's sidings, {{the track}} was crossed by a tramway {{owned by the}} British Moss Litter Company and used for {{conveying}} peat. The tramway had been built in 1896, and a ground frame was installed to control conflicting train movements. The NER proposed that the tramway should be cut in two, with each half extended westwards, to run alongside Smith's siding and a new siding opposite it {{on the other side}} of the main line, but this was rejected. In 1905 they proposed a tunnel under their line, with gradients on the tramway not exceeding 1 in 20 on both sides. Although agreements were drawn up, the <b>plan</b> <b>does</b> not appear to have been implemented. The tramway was of [...] narrow gauge, was about [...] long, and used a steam locomotive. It served Old Goole Mill, although further details of either the mill or the locomotive have not been found. Although the mill closed soon after 1902, it was used for storing peat until 1914, and the tracks were not lifted until many years later. In 1903, some twelve trains per day crossed over the Axholme Joint Railway on the tramway.|$|E

It states: [...] "Leon is a waiter in a cheap table d'hote restaurant and makes desperate love to the fat French cashier, Rosa. Off on his vacation, Leon decides to pose as a foreign nobleman. At a seaside hotel where he stops, he becomes all the rage. One of the guests at the same hotel is a beautiful young heiress, a Violet Hope, whose designing mother at once conceives the idea of marrying her off to the supposed count. The <b>plan</b> <b>does</b> not meet with Violet's approval, she is already {{in love with a}} native born. One day while bathing in the surf, Violet, who is an expert swimmer, comes to the assistance of the bogus count, who has been knocked over by a breaker, and delivers him safely {{into the hands of the}} lifeguard. The count at once lays his life and fortune at Violet's feet, greatly to that young lady's disgust and her mother's delight. In the meantime Rosa becomes acquainted with the doings of her absent lover and traces him to the beach. Finding him in the water, and beyond her reach, Rosa also dons a bathing suit and after a chase through the waves, captures Leon and forces him to confess that he has been sailing under false colors. He was led back to the restaurant by the triumphant Rosa, while Violet obtains her mother's consent to wed the man of her choice." ...|$|E

Some provinces cover all drug prescriptions over a certain portion of a family's income. [...] Drug prices are also regulated, so brand-name prescription drugs are often significantly cheaper than in the U.S. Optometry is only covered in some provinces and is sometimes only covered for children under a certain age. Visits to non-physician specialists may require an additional fee. Also, some procedures are only covered under certain circumstances.

60|$|Best {{place for}} a Cache.--The best {{position}} to choose for a cache is in a sandy or gravelly soil, on account of its dryness and the facility of digging. Old burrows, or the gigantic but abandoned hills of white ants, may be thought of, if the stores are enclosed in cases of painted tin: also clefts in rocks: some things can be conveniently buried under water. The place must be chosen under circumstances that admit of your effacing all signs of the ground having been disturbed. A good plan {{is to set up}} your tent and to dig a deep hole in the floor, depositing what you have to bury wrapped in an oil-cloth, in an earthen jar, or in a wooden vessel, according to what you are able to get. It must be secure against the attacks of the insects of the place: avoid the use of skins, for animals will smell and dig them out. Continue to inhabit the tent for at least a day, well stamping and smoothing down the soil at leisure. After this, change the position of the tent, shifting the tethering-place or kraal of your cattle to where it stood. They will speedily efface any marks that may be left. Travellers often make their fires over the holes where their stores are buried; but natives are so accustomed to suspect fireplaces, that this <b>plan</b> <b>does</b> not prove to be safe. During summer travel, in countries pestered with gnats, a smoke fire for the horses (that is, a fire for keeping off flies), made near the place, will attract the horses and cause them to trample all about. This is an excellent way of obliterating marks left about the cache.|$|E
