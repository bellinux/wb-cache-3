40|$|Cerebellar <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of mormyrid fish {{differ in}} some {{morphological}} {{as well as}} physiological parameters from their counterparts in mammals. Morphologically, <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of mormyrids have larger dendrites that are characterized by a lower degree of branching in the molecular layer. Physiologically, {{there are differences in}} electrophysiological response patterns that are related to sodium channel activity: first, sodium spikes in mormyrid <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> have low amplitudes, typically not exceeding 30 mV. Second, the response to climbing fiber stimulation in mormyrid <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> does not consist of a complex spike (with an initial fast sodium spike) as in mammals, but instead it consists of an all-or-none excitatory postsynaptic potential, the so-called climbing fiber response. Because of these unique properties, we have begun to characterize mormyrid <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> electrophysiologically. In this study, we provide a description of voltage-gated Na+ channels and conductances in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of the mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii. Various types of Na+ channel α-subunits, i. e., Na v 1. 1, Nav 1. 2, and Nav 1. 6, have been described in rodent <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells.</b> Using immunohistochemical techniques, we found that these subunits are present in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of mormyrids.

5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E
25|$|Bergmann glia, {{a type of}} glia {{also known}} as radial {{epithelial}} cells (as named by Camillo Golgi) or Golgi epithelial cells (GCEs; not to be mixed up with Golgi cells), are astrocytes in the cerebellum that have their cell bodies in the <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> layer and processes that extend into the molecular layer, terminating with bulbous endfeet at the pial surface. Bergmann glia express high densities of glutamate transporters that limit diffusion of the neurotransmitter glutamate during its release from synaptic terminals. Besides their role in early development of the cerebellum, Bergmann glia are also required for the pruning or addition of synapses.|$|E
25|$|Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is {{characterized}} by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder {{is also known as}} episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary paroxysmal ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. KV1.1 is expressed heavily in basket cells and interneurons that form GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. The channels aid in the repolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thereby, all motor output from the cerebellum. EA1 {{is an example of a}} synaptopathy. There are currently 17 KV1.1 mutations associated with EA1, Table 1 and Figure 1. 15 of these mutations have been at least partly characterized in cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein 14 of these 15 mutations have demonstrated drastic alterations in channel function. As described in Table 1, most of the known EA1 associated mutations result in a drastic decrease in the amount of current through KV1.1 channels. Furthermore, these channels tend to activate at more positive potentials and slower rates, demonstrated by positive shifts in their V½ values and slower τ activation time constants, respectively. Some of these mutations, moreover, produce channels that deactivate at faster rates (deactivation τ), which would also result in decreased current through these channels. While these biophysical changes in channel properties likely underlie some of the decrease in current observed in experiments, many mutations also seem to result in misfolded or otherwise mistrafficked channels, which is likely to be the major cause of dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. It is assumed, though not yet proven, that decrease in KV1.1 mediated current leads to prolonged action potentials in interneurons and basket cells. As these cells are important in the regulation of <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> activity, it is likely that this results increased and aberrant inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thus, disrupted <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> firing and cerebellum output.|$|E

40|$|Among {{principal}} neurons, adult <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> {{have long}} been considered unusual in lacking functional NMDA receptors.

To address this discrepancy, the properties of InsP 3 - and caffeine-evoked calcium release in cultured <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> were directly examined. Photorelease of InsP 3 (up to 100 μM) from its photolabile caged analogue produced no change in calcium levels in 70 % of cultured <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells.</b> In the few cells where a calcium increase was detected, the response was very small and slow to peak.

500|$|Purkinje cells {{also receive}} {{input from the}} {{inferior}} olivary nucleus on the contralateral side of the brainstem via climbing fibers. Although the inferior olive lies in the medulla oblongata and receives input from the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell.</b> In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell,</b> winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes.

The most basic difference between the Marr and Albus theories is that Marr assumed that climbing fiber activity would cause parallel fiber synapses to be strengthened, whereas Albus proposed {{that they would be}} weakened.

40|$|Among {{integrative}} neurons displaying long-term synaptic plasticity, adult <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> {{seemed to}} be an exception by lacking functional NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs). Although numerous anatomical studies have shown both NR 1 and NR 2 NMDA-R subunits in adult <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells,</b> patch-clamp studies failed to detect any NMDA currents. Using more recent pharmacological and immunodetection tools, we demonstrate here that <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> from adult mice respond to exogenous NMDA application and that postsynaptic NMDA-Rs carry part of the climbing fiber-mediated EPSC (CF-EPSC), with undetectable contribution from presynaptic or polysynaptic NMDA currents.

500|$|In {{addition}} to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is necessary for several types of motor learning, most notably learning to adjust to changes in sensorimotor relationships. Several theoretical models {{have been developed to}} explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum. These models derive from those formulated by David Marr and James Albus, based on the observation that each cerebellar <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> receives two dramatically different types of input: one comprises thousands of weak inputs from the parallel fibers of the granule cells; the other is an extremely strong input from a single climbing fiber. The basic concept of the Marr–Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a [...] "teaching signal", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of parallel fiber inputs. Observations of long-term depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial.|$|E
500|$|Climbing fibers fire at low rates, but {{a single}} {{climbing}} fiber action potential induces a burst of several action potentials in a target <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cell</b> (a complex spike). The contrast between parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells (over 100,000 of one type versus exactly {{one of the other}} type) is perhaps the most provocative feature of cerebellar anatomy, and has motivated much of the theorizing. In fact, the function of climbing fibers is the most controversial topic concerning the cerebellum. There are two schools of thought, one following Marr and Albus in holding that climbing fiber input serves primarily as a teaching signal, the other holding that its function is to shape cerebellar output directly. Both views have been defended in great length in numerous publications. In the words of one review, [...] "In trying to synthesize the various hypotheses on the function of the climbing fibers, one has the sense of looking at a drawing by Escher. Each point of view seems to account for a certain collection of findings, but when one attempts to put the different views together, a coherent picture of what the climbing fibers are doing does not appear. For the majority of researchers, the climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance, either in the usual manner of discharge frequency modulation or as a single announcement of an 'unexpected event'. For other investigators, the message lies in the degree of ensemble synchrony and rhythmicity among a population of climbing fibers." ...|$|E

They were first described by Ernesto Lugaro in the early 20th century. Lugaro cells are found just beneath the layer of <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> between the molecular layer and the granular layer. They have thick principal dendrites coming from opposite poles of their bodies. These dendrites are very long and travel along {{the boundary between the}} Purkinje layer and the granular layer. They seem to contact from 5 to 15 <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> in a horizontal direction. They can also sense stimuli close to the <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> and their dendrites form a large receptive area that monitors the environment near to the <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells.</b> Whilst their dendrites make contact with the <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> they also receive inputs from branches of the Purkinje axons by which they seem to have a sampling and integration role.|$|R
40|$|Calcium ion (Ca 2 +) {{homeostasis}} is {{a critical}} component normal neuronal development. Abnormal Ca 2 + concentrations can disrupt neuron development and nervous system function and lead to various neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Leaner and tottering mice, which are spontaneous animal models of human absence epilepsy, exhibit reduced Ca 2 + current density in neurons known as <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> within their cerebellum. This {{is a result of}} unique mutations that each type of mutant mouse carry in the P/Q-type calcium channel ? 1 A subunit gene, and highly expressed in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells.</b> Consequently, both mutant mice exhibit severe juvenile onset of ataxia, paroxysmal dyskinesia, and absence seizures. Previous studies have revealed significant loss of <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> in leaner mice. However, the specific structural effects of these mutations on existing cerebellar neurons remain unclear. We examined the neuronal morphology of <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> in adult (6 - 8 months) male and female mice of both mutant genotypes. We found significant reduction in dendritic growth and arborization in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of leaner mice and a trend towards reduction in dendritic growth and arborization in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of tottering mice when compared to wild type mice. No difference in somatic area was observed between any two of the genotypes. Hence, we conclude that there are significant morphological deficits present in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of leaner mice compared to wild type mice that could, in part, explain the symptoms seen in the mice, but the lack of structural differences in <b>Purkinje</b> <b>cells</b> of tottering mice indicate that there are likely to be underlying functional impairments present that require study beyond the structural level...|$|R
