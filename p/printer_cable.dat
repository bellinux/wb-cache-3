50|$|<b>Printer</b> <b>cable</b> {{refers to}} the cable that carries data between a {{computer}} and a printer.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An IEEE 1284 {{compliant}} <b>printer</b> <b>cable,</b> {{with both}} DB-25 and 36 pin Centronics connectors ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An IEEE 1284 36-pin male Centronics <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> connection. The {{computer}} side normally uses a DB-25 port {{instead of}} this [...] "Micro ribbon" [...] connector.|$|E
5000|$|In the interim, the Garrard {{brand name}} was {{licensed}} to other {{companies in the}} USA, which imported many electronic items built by many different and unrelated Far Eastern manufacturers. Thus, one can find [...] "Garrard" [...] cassette decks, CD players, stereo receivers, boom-box radio/cassette machines, portable [...] "Walkman" [...] type cassette players, serial-port <b>printer</b> <b>cables,</b> universal TV/audio remote controls, and other miscellany, including turntables {{that had nothing to}} do with any original Garrard design.|$|R
50|$|Common mode {{filtering}} {{may also}} be used to prevent egress of noise for electromagnetic compatibility purposes. High frequency common mode signals, for example, RF noise from a computing circuit, may be blocked using a ferrite bead clamped to the outside of a cable. These are often observable on laptop computer power supplies near the jack socket, and good quality mouse or <b>printer</b> USB <b>cables</b> and HDMI cables.|$|R
40|$|A lab-made {{interface}} for {{acquisition of}} instrumental analog signals between 0 and 5 V at a frequency up to 670 kHz at the parallel port of a microcomputer is described. Since it uses few and small components, {{it was built}} into the connector of a <b>printer</b> parallel <b>cable.</b> Its performance was evaluated by monitoring the signals of four different instruments and similar analytical curves were obtained with the interface and from readings from the instrument' displays. Because the components are cheap (~U$ 35, 00) and easy to get, the proposed interface is a simple and economical alternative for data acquisition in small laboratories for routine work, research and teaching...|$|R
50|$|The early Tandy 1000's used a {{non-standard}} card-edge parallel {{printer port}} rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port. It required a Tandy-1000 compatible <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> {{to connect to}} a standard printer parallel port.|$|E
50|$|HC200 Dot Matrix Printer.This unit {{can be used}} {{to produce}} {{waveform}} plots as well as capturing setup information. It can be attached directly to the scope with a <b>printer</b> <b>cable,</b> so a GPIB is not required.|$|E
50|$|Radio Shack {{sold the}} Tandy DMP-130A dot matrix {{printers}} {{to go along}} with their Tandy 1000 line, along with compatible card-edged <b>printer</b> <b>cable.</b> This printer was sold at home budget prices. Radio Shack often offered a package bundle with a Tandy 1000 computer, CM-5 budget monitor and DMP-130A printer.|$|E
50|$|The device can link up by {{cable to}} a {{computer}} (FA-122 and FA-123 (serial) and FA-124 (USB) interface unit and cables) or to another calculator (SB-62 cable) to transfer data, such as programs, equations, graphs etc. It can also connect to a Casio label <b>printer</b> (SB-62 <b>cable).</b> Transmission speed is stated as 9600 byte/s. The calculator can {{be connected to the}} EA-100 data logger which is used to read data such as temperature, light intensity, force, voltage, loudness, pH and other such data in the same fashion as the Texas Instruments Computer Based Laboratory and various data loggers for use with the Hewlett-Packard calculators; Sharp also makes such a tool.|$|R
5|$|Perfect Dark {{includes}} a built-in rumble functionality {{into the game}} cartridge and supports the Game Boy <b>Printer,</b> Game Link <b>Cable,</b> and Transfer Pak accessories. The Transfer Pak allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked. Perfect Dark received generally a mixed reaction from video game critics, who criticized its superficial stealth mechanics and unoriginal mini-games, but praised its graphics and audio.|$|R
50|$|The right-side of {{the device}} offers a port which allows a user to connect to another Game Boy system via a link cable, {{provided}} both users are playing the same game. The port {{can also be used}} to connect a Game Boy <b>Printer.</b> The link <b>cable</b> was originally designed for players to play head-to-head two-player games such as in Tetris. However, game developer Satoshi Tajiri would later use the link cable technology as a method of communication and networking in the popular Pok√©mon video game series.|$|R
50|$|When {{attached}} to a printer via a <b>printer</b> <b>cable,</b> it can print the weight on paper. Usually Weight Indicator come with a basic printing feature. It can be program in the firmware to print in few basic format. Usually there is a print button on the Digital Weight Indicator for user to press to print.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to request}} from retailers, printer {{manufacturers}} have gradually stopped including the necessary <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> {{to connect the}} printer to a computer. Retailers usually make a huge profit on selling cables, sometimes as much as 3000% (a cable costs about $1 to produce and package, and is sold at retail stores {{for as much as}} $30).|$|E
50|$|In Japan, the Net Link {{required}} {{the use of}} smartcards with prepaid credits. The Saturn had a floppy drive and <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> converter (both Japan only) {{which could be used}} with the Net Link. A web browser from Planetweb was included, and a mouse and keyboard adapter were available to simplify navigation. Sega also released a dedicated Saturn mouse and Saturn keyboard. In addition, to allow users to browse with just the Saturn joypad, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses.|$|E
50|$|Before XCON, when {{ordering}} a VAX from DEC, every cable, connection, and bit of software {{had to be}} ordered separately. (Computers and peripherals were not sold complete in boxes as they are today). The sales people were not always very technically expert, so customers would find that they had hardware without the correct <b>cables,</b> <b>printers</b> without the correct drivers, a processor without the correct language chip, and so on. This meant delays and {{caused a lot of}} customer dissatisfaction and resultant legal action. XCON interacted with the sales person, asking critical questions before printing out a coherent and workable system specification/order slip.|$|R
50|$|Computer {{equipment}} includes desktop {{personal computers}} (PCs), laptops, monitors and peripherals: i.e., <b>cables,</b> <b>printers,</b> scanners, keyboards and speakers. In 1998, nearly 50% of households in Canada had computers {{and that number}} is steadily increasing. Due to technological innovations and market expansion of computer equipment and software, PCs are now becoming obsolete at increasing rates and are globally {{one of the fastest}} growing components of municipal waste streams. The average first life, the amount of time the PC is useful to its original owner, is now 2 - 4 years. In the year 2005, a PC's first life was decreased by another year. Considering reuse and storage options, the total lifespan, the period from manufacture to disposal, of a PC is estimated at 3 - 6 years.|$|R
5000|$|Early SCSI {{interfaces}} {{commonly used}} a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. This connector {{is similar to}} the 36-pin connector used by Centronics for the parallel interface on their printers, thus the connector became popularly known as [...] "Centronics SCSI" [...] or [...] "CN-50". It is also referred to as a [...] "SCSI-1 connector"; since many connectors have been used for SCSI-1, this can be confusing.Apple used DB-25 connectors, which, having only 25 pins rather than 50, were less expensive to make, but compromised functionality. Further, DB-25s were commonly used for RS-232 serial cables and also to connect parallel printers, meaning that users might accidentally try to use completely inappropriate <b>cables,</b> since the <b>printer</b> and serial <b>cables</b> would fit the connector properly and be hard to visually distinguish. The DB-25's only advantage was that it was smaller than a CN50.|$|R
50|$|Polling {{is often}} intimately {{involved}} with very low-level hardware. For example, polling a parallel printer port to check {{whether it is}} ready for another character involves examining as little as one bit of a byte. That bit represents, {{at the time of}} reading, whether a single wire in the <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> is at low or high voltage. The I/O instruction that reads this byte directly transfers the voltage state of eight real world wires to the eight circuits (flip flops) that make up one byte of a CPU register.|$|E
50|$|The {{floppy disk}} drives were {{interfaced}} through a Fujitsu 8877 disk controller integrated circuit, a second-source of the Western Digital 1793. The parallel port was connected through a memory-mapped Motorola MC6821 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) which allowed the port {{to be fully}} bidirectional; the Osborne manuals also claimed the port implemented the IEEE-488 interface bus but this was rarely used. The parallel port used a card-edge connector etched on the main board, exposed {{through a hole in}} the case; any IEEE-488 or <b>printer</b> <b>cable</b> had to be specially manufactured for the Osborne.|$|E
5000|$|InfoWorld {{compared}} the cable spaghetti connecting the TRS-80's various components to the snakes in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Radio Shack offered a [...] "TRS-80 System Desk" [...] that concealed {{nearly all the}} cabling. It could accommodate the complete computer system plus up to four floppy drives plus the Quick <b>Printer.</b> Since the <b>cable</b> connecting the expansion interface carried the system bus, it was kept short (about 6 inches). This meant that the user {{had no choice but}} to place it directly behind the computer with the monitor on top of it. This caused problems if one owned a monitor whose case did not fit the mounting holes. Also, the loose friction fit of the edge connector on the already short interconnect cable created the precarious possibility of disconnecting the system bus from the CPU if either unit happened to be moved during operation.|$|R
