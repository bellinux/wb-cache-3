2500|$|In operation, {{a current}} {{flows through the}} {{filament}} (heater)—a high resistance wire made of nichrome—and heats the cathode red hot (800–1000°C). This causes the cathode to release electrons into the vacuum, a process called thermionic emission. (Some valves use direct heating, in which a tungsten filament acts as both heater and cathode.) [...] The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric <b>plate</b> <b>electrode.</b> [...] When the plate has a positive voltage {{with respect to the}} cathode, it electrostatically attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. [...] However, when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a negative voltage, no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it. [...] The plate, being unheated, does not emit any electrons. So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from the cathode to the anode plate.|$|E

Moreover, the passive electrode of row-array <b>electrode</b> <b>plates</b> is designed in three ways: general row array, window array, and rhombus array.

50|$|In 1918 Albert Hull at GE {{discovered}} that vacuum tubes could have negative resistance {{in parts of}} their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called secondary emission. In a vacuum tube when electrons strike the <b>plate</b> <b>electrode</b> they can knock additional electrons out of the surface into the tube. This represents a current away from the plate, reducing the plate current. Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a decrease in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the dynatron oscillator. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the magnetron invented by Hull in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|PCM in {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s used a {{cathode-ray}} [...] with a <b>plate</b> <b>electrode</b> having encoding perforations. As in an oscilloscope, the beam was swept horizontally at the sample rate while the vertical deflection was controlled by the input analog signal, causing the beam to pass through higher or lower portions of the perforated plate. The plate collected or passed the beam, producing current variations in binary code, one bit at a time. Rather than natural binary, the grid of Goodall's later tube was perforated to produce a glitch-free Gray code, and produced all bits simultaneously by using a fan beam instead of a scanning beam.|$|E

These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum, about 10−9 atm. Since the filament eventually burns out, the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit; the electrodes are attached to terminal pins which plug into a socket. The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes.|$|E

50|$|High-power triodes {{generally}} use a filament {{which serves}} as the cathode (a directly heated cathode) because the emission coating on indirectly heated cathodes is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes. A thoriated tungsten filament is most often used, in which thorium in the tungsten forms a monolayer on the surface which increases electron emission. These generally run at higher temperatures than indirectly heated cathodes. The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass, and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced. Tubes with plate power dissipation over several hundred watts are usually actively cooled; the <b>plate</b> <b>electrode,</b> made of heavy copper, projects through {{the wall of the}} tube and is attached to a large external finned metal heat sink which is cooled by forced air or water.|$|E

Under the optimal conditions, the voltammetric results show that the gold porous <b>plate</b> <b>electrode</b> oers the detection limit of 2. 18 x 10 − 5 M and reproducibility of 7. 8 % (n = 4).

40|$|Air damping {{significantly}} {{influences the}} dynamical characteristics of MEMS accelerometers. Its effects at micro-scale level sharply {{depend on the}} structure layouts and size of MEMS devices. The damping phenomenon of comb microaccelerometers is investigated. The air between fixed <b>plate</b> <b>electrodes</b> and movable <b>plate</b> <b>electrodes</b> cannot flow freely and is compressed. The air damping, therefore, exhibits both viscous effects and stiffness effects. The former generates a drag force like that in macromechanical systems, and the damping force {{is proportional to the}} velocity of movable electrodes. The latter stiffens the rigidity of structure, and the stiffening level is related to the gap value of capacitors, internal pressure, and temperature. This paper focuses on the dependence of the squeeze film air damping on capacitor gaps. The simulation and experiments indicate that the squeeze film effect is sharply affected by the gap value when the structural dimensions decrease. And the influence of fabrication errors is considered in damping design in comb microaccelerometers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{applying}} methods of electric field on a sooting diffusion flame. Essentially, two types of electric fields were tested in this experiment. One is a uniform electric field formed between parallel plate electrodes. The other is a non-uniform field formed between needle and plate electrodes. In the uniform field, the flame shape was changed by positive ions moving in the fields. Soot emission was suppressed with increasing the applied voltage, because an increase of the flame surface temperature promoted the soot oxidation. In the non-uniform field, on the contrary, ionic wind was formed by corona discharge. The ionic wind blew from a needle electrode toward a <b>plate</b> <b>electrode,</b> irrespectively of the polarity of the needle. The flame was inclined toward the <b>plate</b> <b>electrode</b> by this ionic wind.
