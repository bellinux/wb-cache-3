40|$|AbstractThe {{separation}} {{capability of}} carbon dioxide from high temperature syngas was evaluated using zeolite 13 X, calcium chabazite and hydrotalcite materials by means of measuring isotherms and breakthrough curves under the different operating temperatures at 7 bar and assessing the performance in <b>pressure</b> vacuum <b>swing</b> <b>adsorption</b> (PVSA) cycles. Four different PVSA processes were designed for a dual-bed apparatus and operated at 120  °C and 200  °C. Zeolite 13 X was selected for the PVSA processes due to its acceptable adsorption capacity for CO 2 at elevated temperatures and fast kinetics. CO 2 product purities ranging from 80 to 98 % were obtained from a feed gas of 12 % CO 2. From the PVSA experiments, {{it was found that}} a pressure equalisation step and product purge step improved the carbon capture performance in terms of CO 2 concentration. Contamination of the adsorbents was observed after 24 hours of operation and the contaminants originating from the syngas were identified as heavy hydrocarbons...|$|R

This paper presents a portable concentrator prototype design using the pressure/vacuum <b>swing</b> <b>adsorption</b> (PVSA) cycle with a deep evacuation step (− 0. 82 barg) instead of desorption with purge flow to simplify the oxygen production process. The output of the oxygen concentrator is a ~ 90 vol % enriched oxygen stream in a continuous adsorption and desorption cycle (cycle time ~ 90 s). The size of the adsorption column is 3 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length. A Li+ exchanged 13 X nanosize zeolite is used as the adsorbent to selectively adsorb nitrogen from air. A dynamic model of the <b>pressure</b> and vacuum <b>swing</b> <b>adsorption</b> units was developed to study the pressurization and depressurization process inside the microporous area of nanosized zeolites.

Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing , have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired.

A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF.

40|$|The huge {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} from fossil-fuelled power plants is emphasizing the need for efficient carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. With reference to operating plants, the post-combustion CO 2 capture option is attractive as it implies minimal intervention on the existing plants. The most typical options are: amine-based absorption, <b>pressure</b> or thermal <b>swing</b> <b>adsorption,</b> membrane separation. These processes {{may turn out to be}} fairly expensive and result in major efficiency penalties. On the other hand, there has been growing attention on the possibility to sequester CO 2 by water absorption and conversion into stable bi/carbonates. One drawback of this process is represented by the slow apparent kinetics. It appears that the rate enhancement may be pursued by enzymatic catalysis of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a broad group of ubiquitous metalloenzymes. The fixation of gaseous CO 2 into carbonate ions is controlled by the hydration reaction. The captured carbon can be safely sequestered by precipitation of carbonates. Providing that a proper metal ion source is available to the biomimetic capture system, a mild mineral sequestration may occur. Sea water and/or brines are typical Ca++ sources available at industrial scale. A theoretical model has been proposed to analyse the performances of an innovative CA-based CCS process. The enzymatic absorption unit (EAU) is a three-phase system: the solid phase is the carrier with immobilised CA; the liquid phase, the aqueous stream bearing Ca++; the gas phase, the exhausted flue gas. The liquid phase is further processed in a Carbonate Recovery unit (CRU). The aims of the study are: i) the general assessment of the process mass and energy balances; ii) the analysis of the role of the immobilised CA specific activity and stability on process performance; iii) the optimization of operating conditions for both the EAU and the CRU.
