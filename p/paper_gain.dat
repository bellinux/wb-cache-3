40|$|A novel {{dual band}} antenna for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) {{applications}} is presented. The dual band characteristic {{is achieved by}} feeding two different length resonant paths with a 50 Ω microstrip line. The compact antenna only occupies 5. 3 × 16 mm 2 and promotes wideband characteristic. The bandwidth for lower resonance spans from 2. 03 GHz to 2. 80 GHz (30. 3 %) and 4. 86 GHz to 6. 44 GHz (31. 6 %) at higher band, effectively fulfilling the bandwidth requirement of IEEE 802. 11 b/g and IEEE 802. 11 a.

30|$|In this <b>paper,</b> <b>gain</b> {{enhancement}} for wideband end-fire antenna {{by using}} split-ring resonator (SRR) structures {{is designed for}} target recognition system. The broad bandwidth of the proposed antenna is obtained by using the balun of microstrip-to-slotline transitions. Gain enhancement is achieved by loading two rows of split-ring resonator structures (SRRs) symmetrically along the end-fire direction while maintaining the wideband performance of the proposed antenna. The proposed end-fire antenna that loaded SRRs can obtain 5 – 8  dB gain in the whole operating band (5 – 11  GHz), which is around 2  dB more than unloaded one. The proposed antenna is simulated by using the high frequency structure simulator (HFSSv 15) software based on the finite element method. The measured results of the fabricated antenna show good agreement with the simulated results. The proposed broadband SRRs-loaded antenna with end-fire patterns has more valuable in target recognition systems.|$|E

40|$|A design {{methodology}} for transformers including integrated and center-tapped structures for LLC resonant converters is proposed. In the LLC resonant converter, the resonant inductor {{in the primary}} side can be merged in the transformer as a leakage inductance. And, {{the absence of the}} secondary filter inductor creates low voltage stress on the secondary rectifiers and is cost-effective. A center-tapped structure of the transformer secondary side is widely used in commercial applications because of its higher efficiency and lower cost than full-bridge structures in the rectifying stages. However, this transformer structure has problems of resonance unbalance and transformer inefficiency caused by leakage inductance imbalance in the secondary side and the position of the air-gap in the transformer, respectively. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>gain</b> curves and soft-switching conditions are derived by first harmonic approximation (FRA) and operating circuit simulation. In addition, the effects of the transformer including integrated and center-tapped structures are analyzed by new FHA models and simulations to obtain an optimal design.

40|$|The role of {{chemical}} components of cork in the sorption of several pesticides has been investigated. For this purpose raw cork and three cork extracted fractions (i. e. cork free of aliphatic extractives, cork free of all extractives and cork free of all extractives and suberin) {{were used as}} sorbent of three ionic pesticides (propazine, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D) and alachlor) and five non-ionic pesticides (chlor-pyrifos, isoproturon, metamitron, methomyl and oxamyl) with a logK(ow) within the range - 0. 47 to 4. 92. The effect of cations on the ionic pesticides, propazine and 2, 4 -D sorption was also analyzed. Results indicated that the highest yields were obtained for chlorpyrifos and alachlor sorption onto raw cork (> 55 %). After removal of aliphatic extractives sorption of all pesticides increased that ranged from 3 % for propazine to 31 % for alachlor. In contrast, removal of phenolic extractives caused a sorption decrease. Low sorption yields were obtained for hydrophobic pesticides such as metamitron, oxamyl and methomyl (< 11 %) by using all cork fractions and extremely low when using raw cork (< 1 %). FTIR analysis was useful to indicate that lignin moieties were the main components involved on the sorption process.

40|$|The {{disposition}} effect {{describes the}} tendency to sell winners (stocks with a <b>paper</b> <b>gain)</b> and hold losers (stocks with a paper loss). The disposition effect has been documented in many empirical studies. Given the amount of evidence for the disposition effect, it is natural to ask why investors tend to behave this way. This question is addressed in Chapter 1. I review existing explanations and argue {{that none of them}} is satisfactory because they either fail to capture the disposition effect or because they are not supported by empirical evidence. I point out that there is a large psychological literature on entrapment, escalation of commitment, and sunk cost, that studies phenomena that are very similar to the disposition effect. This literature suggests an explanation of the disposition effect based on cognitive dissonance theory. Chapter 2 deals with the question how market prices are affected by the disposition effect. I study the time series of equilibrium returns in a model with a representative investor. The main result is that the disposition effect implies trend continuation: Prior gains are on average followed by high returns, prior losses are on average followed by low returns. This general conclusion stems from the negative feedback nature of the disposition effect. If investors like to hold losers and do not like to hold winners, then - in equilibrium - {{there has to be a}} reward (a higher expected return) for holding winners and selling losers In Chapter 3 I study trading volume under the assumption of the disposition effect. By linking current asset demand to prior gains or losses the disposition effect motivates trade and brings about patterns in equilibrium returns. I argue that the patterns in trade and returns generated by the disposition effect are broadly consistent with the evidence on momentum and trading volume.

40|$|Under the Korean {{equivalents}} of International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS), {{which was}} adopted in 2011, companies {{are allowed to}} recognize gains/losses on disposal of discontinued operations (GDDO) when they spin off part of their operations. GDDO reflects {{the gap between the}} fair value and the book value of the spun-off operations. However, the fair value is not based on the fair value of the assets classified as held for sale but based on the valuation of the operation by using the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) method. Since the FCFF method estimates the value of the operation by discounting all future free cash flows from the operation, it is not accurate but varies remarkably with a small change in the discount factor. Furthermore, only spun-off operations are evaluated, but sustained operations are not. Lastly, shareholders of the parent company receive equivalent shares in the new company in order to compensate for the loss of equity in the original stocks. This implies {{that there should be no}} gains/losses from the division of the company unless there is a huge quantifiable impact from spinning off. For these reasons, it is improper to see GDDO as a real gain; rather, it is proper to see it as a <b>paper</b> <b>gain.</b> According to the extended functional fixation view, unsophisticated investors improperly implement a wrong analysis of such complicated accounting information into their investment decision making. Herein I attempt to test whether unsophisticated investors are affected by GDDO with an assumption that there are some unsophisticated marginal investors who see GDDO as a real gain and they impound this information in price. My hypothesis is tested by examining the stock price reaction to quarterly earnings announcements of firms which have undergone spin-offs since K-IFRS was adopted. On the financial performance announcement date, the firm's stock price is theoretically affected by the difference between the real earnings and the expected earnings (earnings surprise: ES). In a case in which the firm announced earnings including GDDO, only the real earnings, excluding GDDO, less the expected earnings should be reflected in the stock price movement-if all investors are sophisticated enough not to regard GDDO as real earnings. However, I test whether GDDO also affects the stock price movement in this situation separately from the impact from the earnings surprise, which implies that there are unsophisticated investors and the extended functional fixation hypothesis holds in the GDDO case. Eleven Korean companies that are traded on the Korean stock market and listed on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) were subjected to the test. These companies meet the following constraints: (1) They have undergone spin-offs, and (2) They recognized GDDO on their income statement but do not directly add or deduct the amount from equity items on the balance sheet. I run a regression test on the excess stock return which is calculated by using historical two-day return, historical beta, the impact from earning surprise (ES), and the impact from GDDO. The result shows higher R² and lower p-value for the case when both the ES and GDDO are chosen as x-variables than the case when the earnings surprise is solely chosen as an x-variable. The p-values for x-variables in both cases were smaller than 0. 01. The test result implies that the extended functional fixation hypothesis might hold in this case. I conclude that including GDDO as an item on the income statement can affect some investors' decision making and demand for the stock. by Chunsoo Park. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{research}} project WWWforEurope undertakes to lie the {{theoretical and empirical}} foundations for the embarkment on a new socio-ecological growth path in Europe. The new path underlines the need to guarantee Welfare as a broad universal principle for its population, assuring economic and social prosperity. The new path stresses the value of achieving 2 ̆ 013 what we call 2 ̆ 013 Wealth, a value in which material and immaterial resources are combined with the goal to enrich people 2 ̆ 018 s lives and to preserve natural resources, nature and bio-diversity. Both cannot be achieved without Work: Europe needs to enable its population to achieve their life satisfaction {{at the highest level}} possible and Work {{is one of the most}} 2 ̆ 013 if not, the most 2 ̆ 013 fundamental precondition for this. In short, the overarching question the WWWforEurope project attempts to answer is what kind of new European growth and development strategy is necessary and feasible, enabling a socio-ecological transition to high levels of employment, well-being of its citizens, social inclusion, resilience of ecological systems and a significant contribution to the global common goods like climate stability. Thus the project 2 ̆ 019 s central goals are to identify the forces and challenges necessitating deliberations on a new growth path, to define socio-ecological transition, key actors and main obstacles, and to find out how the process of a socio-ecological transition can be initiated, monitored, and accelerated on an institutional level (EU, national and regional level). A central prerequisite to successfully accomplish these central goals is to establish a common understanding of the central questions raised by this undertaking and to create awareness for the project 2 ̆ 019 s systemic and interdisciplinary approach. To this behalf, this paper presents fundamental concepts, terms and definitions relevant for socio-ecological transition. Hereby the paper focuses on the concepts of sustainability, growth, innovation, welfare and well-being, wealth and work. We also look at the various dimensions and definitions of transition/transformation which can be found in the literature, trying to concretise the concept of a socio-ecological transition forming the context and starting point of the WWWforEurope project. The necessity to accomplish a socio-ecological transition represents the starting point and the background against which the concepts and terms addressed in this <b>paper</b> <b>gain</b> their relevance. Economic, environmental and social sustainability and sustainable growth and development, respectively, are the central and final aim of the envisaged socio-ecological transition. Sustainability is an indispensable precondition for societal and individual welfare/well-being. Socio-ecological transition to achieve sustainability requires putting into question the prevailing view on economic growth. While economic growth may help to reduce poverty or unemployment and may thus be positively related with social sustainability, this often implies negative external effects for the environment. Alternative growth concepts are to be explored therefore, which do not consider the economic dimension of sustainability only, but explicitly try to incorporate social and environmental aspects in addition. Several more sustainability-oriented growth concepts have been brought into the discussion more recently. All of them are departing from the empirical fact that with increasing levels of GDP per capita the relation between economic growth and societal as well as individual well-being is weakening and that economic growth on the contrary may even endanger environmental and social sustainability (e. g. due to too little time for family and friends) and thus negatively affect quality of life and well-being. A more sustainable perspective on growth requires a more sustainable view on innovation, as a central driver for growth. Within the context of a socio-ecological transition based on sustainable growth, ecological and social innovation gain in importance vis- 0 -vis purely profit-oriented innovation. Long-term growth is based on wealth as the productive base of an economy. Sustainable growth and development needs to rest on a comprehensive/inclusive wealth concept taking into account, besides the conventional material assets, also natural capital. Finally, socio-ecological transition will also affect the organisation of work/labour. This paper tries to define and concretise these fundamental concepts and terms. Thus it should provide some kind of lexicon, which serves as starting point and background for the work on the central questions guiding the WWWforEurope project. Wherever possible, the paper should facilitate the agreement on common definitions. It is not the aim of the paper to elaborate tradeoffs in depth and to offer solutions and answers already. It rather strives to motivate all research groups involved in the WWWforEurope project to use and discuss the existing concepts, may they be consistent or just offer a variety of thought. It also attempts at drawing attention to the existence of trade-offs and open questions relevant for the various research areas. Moreover, the paper wants to inspire the search for best (or the identification of not working) practices, and it wants to increase the awareness for existing barriers to change. While the paper is not able to elaborate in depth distributional and gender aspects as crucial cross-cutting issues, it aims at directing attention at them and at inspiring research undertaken in the WWWforEurope project to consider these cross-cutting issues. Finally, the paper does not focus too much on policy issues. It is the aim of the overall project to identify (potential) interlinkages, trade-offs and synergies and to discuss policy options and instruments in details to support a more dynamic, inclusive and ecological growth and development path for Europe...|$|E
