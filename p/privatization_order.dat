Using data from three national surveys of American museums, the analysis documents the mix of types of governing authority and demonstrates how this mix varies across location, over time, and by museum type. The paper then estimates the extent of hybridization using several different indicators and speculates about its implications. The United States offers a particularly informative case because the general view is that American museums are (1) either public or private and (2) predominately private. While the second part of this view may still be a useful characterization of American museums, the first is no longer a particularly helpful way of understanding American museums, or, by extension, other cultural institutions, American or not.

Due to historical reasons the debate is typically charged with {{an enormous amount of}} ideological and political content. When the privatization decision was made in 1995, under President Zedillo, all these issues were brought into the discussion. The labor union of FNM was an important support of the official party, PRI, and had a good deal of political weight in the public sphere. However, the financial condition of the company, as well as its productivity indicators, were clearly an objective factor in favor of <b>privatization.</b> In <b>order</b> to carry out the privatization process successfully, the labor issue was the main hurdle to jump. Making the company attractive to investors, while respecting all the labor rights of the people and reducing labor redundancy, was the main challenge for the privatization team. When the privatization process started in 1996, FNM had around 43, 000 active workers (more detail on this below). In 1998, 7 % of that labor force (3, 000) had opted for retirement, 54 % (23, 300) had been re-hired by the new companies, and 39 % (16, 700) ended their relation with the company.

40|$|Privatization {{of large}} {{state-owned}} enterprises {{has been one}} of the most radical new policies of the last quarter century. While many countries had engaged in large nationalization programs during the decades following World War II, Margaret Thatcher initiated a policy swing in the other direction in the 1980 s by pushing for aggressive privatization of many of the large state-owned British firms. In the following two decades, privatization policies were implemented throughout the planet, as both left and right leaning governments alike undertook a policy of privatization. Right wing governments engaged in privatization in an effort to keep down the size of government, while Left wing governments implemented <b>privatization</b> policies in <b>order</b> to generate revenues, and also because they were persuaded of the virtues of markets and competition after being disappointed with the inefficiencies of large state-owned firms. In this way, privatization spread from Europe to Latin America, Asia and Africa, reaching a high point with the transition from socialism to capitalism following the fall of the Berlin wall. Transition economies were then faced with the task of privatizing their whole economies. In theses cases, quite diverse policies were put in place, ranging from a gradual sale of state property to foreign and domestic investors (as was the case in Hungary and Poland) to more radical programs called "mass privatization programs" which resulted in the rapid giveaway of state owned assets...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Dev. Studies) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. Privatization, and {{particularly}} privatization of services, is a worldwide trend {{that has grown}} tremendously over the past 25 years. This growth has been particularly pronounced in developing countries in recent years. Prison services {{is one of many}} sectors that has contracted with the private sector, however, until South Africa outsourced the design, construction, finance, and operation of two maximum security prisons to the private sector for a period of 25 years, private prison companies were only involved in some developed countries. Many argue that the sector's involvement in South Africa signals its intention to expand throughout the developing world, and undoubtedly, South Africa's experience will be influential in the future growth of this sector in such countries. This paper aims to explore the experience of South Africa's public-private partnership (PPP) prisons thus far, within a context of international and domestic service <b>privatization,</b> in <b>order</b> to identify key trends and issues which may be relevant to future private sector involvement in prisons and other service sectors. Research was conducted qualitatively, with a total of 12 interviews carried out telephonically and in person. Respondents included members of the government, PPP prison administrations, and members of civil society in order to gain as wide a perspective as possible. An extensive review of the literature, as well as relevant government sources, was also undertaken. While these prisons have certainly brought benefits to South Africa's correctional service, a number of key concerns about private sector involvement in service provision were identified through this research. Firstly, the whole experience, starting with the initial decision, has lacked transparency and debate. Although contracting with the private sector was supposed to lead to increased efficiency and reduced cost, the prisons have, in fact, led to unexpected high costs and risks for the DCS. Furthermore, private sector involvement has led to a tiering of prison services, with PPP prison services generally much better than the public sector. Finally, the research indicates that there are serious questions to be raised about the effectiveness of the regulation of this sector and whether PPP prison companies are truly being held accountable by government...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the technical efficiency, cost-revenue efficiency and productivity of a chain of small scale hotels in Portugal in order to study the impact of partial privatization. Following a comprehensive review of the studies that have used the non-parametric technique known as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate the impact of privatization on productive efficiency of enterprises, we conclude that privatization, per se, does not appear to be sufficient to guarantee performance improvement. Whilst a number of studies have provided evidence of a positive impact in several sectors, a similar number of studies have concluded that there is no clear evidence of a positive impact derived from <b>privatization.</b> In <b>order</b> to contribute to this body of literature, we analyze data from a Portuguese chain of hotels during a period of 10 years (two years prior to privatization, privatization year and seven years after privatization). Firstly, we used DEA to estimate hotel-specific scores of relative technical efficiency and cost-revenue efficiency for each of the ten years analyzed. Secondly, we use the Kruskal and Wallis rank test to analyze whether or not a significant frontier shift occurred between the pre-privatization period and the post-privatization period. Lastly, we estimate Malmquist Productivity Indices and their components for the periods for which a significant frontier shift was identified. The results from our study provide interesting insights regarding efficiency and productivity evolution in the hotel sector revealing that technical efficiency and cost-revenue efficiency do not always go hand in hand. When we compare the performance in the pre-privatization period with that of the post-privatization period, we found evidence of improvements in productivity from a technical point of view, derived from a statistically significant frontier shift four years after privatization. However, this improvement was not accompanied by an improvement in productivity from a cost-revenue point of view. On the contrary, we found evidence that this chain of hotels significantly deteriorated its productivity in terms of cost-revenue after its privatization. Our results emphasize the importance of studying the impact of privatization from multiple perspectives. Future studies should focus on different contexts in order to provide further evidence regarding the impact of privatization on different dimensions of performance, as well as study the conditions under which privatization may be associated with certain effects...|$|R
40|$|Though Gandhi did {{not produce}} a formal and {{systematic}} theology of liberation, {{he worked for the}} cause of liberation and laid down his life in that process, and wrote and spoke about liberation from a religious and theological perspective, namely of faith. This dissertation attempts a systematic presentation of Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s concept and theology of liberation in the context of its development in the historic experience of India 2 ̆ 7 s liberation. While that which is known as the theology of liberation is recent and Latin American in origin, the experience from which such theology arises is generic and hence universal to such social situations as are marked by alienation, enslavement, oppression, dependency and underdevelopment on the one hand, and a religio-political faith in, and commitment to, liberation on the other. In this respect, liberation theologies conform in breadth to the paradigm or ideal type of the Passover or Exodus experience of the Biblical Jews. The problem of a Christian theology of liberation is one of conformity in breadth and in depth to the paradigm or ideal type of the paschal experience of Jesus Christ. Conformity to paradigms or ideal types takes place at two related but distinct levels [...] primarily in the praxis or experience of imitation, and secondarily or as aiding the praxis, at the level of theory, as critical hermeneutic mediation. The critical mediation of conformity to the paradigm of the paschal experience of Jesus Christ has been rendered problematic to liberation theologies by a depoliticized privatization of Christian attitudes in and through a sacramental spiritualism, even though such privatization is alien to sacramental theology and spirituality. While the Latin American theology of liberation has had to fight this <b>privatization</b> in <b>order</b> to free itself of its shackles, in the interests of a practical and political conformity to the Christian paradigm of all liberation, the openness and spiritual catholicity of Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s Hinduism and its relative freedom from institutional teaching authority freed Gandhi from the requirement of any apology for his political mediation of a conformity to Christ interpreted as an ideal type not only for spiritual salvation, but for political liberation as well. Gandhi performed this task of the critical hermeneutic mediation of Christ in the way or method he adopted for the liberation of India from English domination and other socio-religious evils. Since Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s concept of liberation was born of his commitment to the struggle for it, a chapter is devoted to the history of the freedom struggle. Chapter two exposes Swaraj as Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s evergrowing and dynamic concept of liberation. Chapter three exposes and makes explicit the theological roots of Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s concept of Swaraj. The Christological dimension and function of Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s praxis of liberation and the theology of it are exposed in chapter four. Chapter five depicts Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s vision of a liberated society. Chapter six is an evaluation of Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s theology and Christology {{in the context of the}} praxis of liberation. This is not a criticism of other theologies of liberation. No comparison or contrast with any of them is even attempted in this work. Rather, this is a study, of a great religious figure in history, whose faith led him to politics. It attempts to demonstrate the possibility and workability of a spiritual transformation of politics from within, and of how a political application of the cross of Christ can mediate political salvation. Gandhi showed on the stage of world history how the process of liberation demands the values symbolized by the Cross. His example and his teaching ought to influence all political and liberation theologies...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 93 - 95). This is a {{study on}} one of the liberalization policies, namely privatization, followed almost all over the world. It specifically focuses on the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as a case study, in examining the privatization policies that were implemented during the last ten years. In the first chapter, I study the phenomenon of privatization as a whole, and its incentives. In chapter two, I concentrate on the process of privatization in the Middle East. Previously, the state in this region played a major role as a business administrator. With time, the state discovered its incompetence in handling economic activities, and turned to the private sector for cooperation. It was then, that privatization was introduced as means for the state to transfer its efforts and resources to core government issues. A privatization strategy had to be developed, first by setting the objectives, realizing the obstacles, and then deciding on the approach that best suits the country characteristics. In chapters three and four, I presented my case study: Jordan. I started with basic information about the country since its formation. I carefully studied a" the phases the country passed through, until it reached its current privatization program. In addition, I examined the external support that Jordan received, a" the legal reforms that occurred, and the labor issue. I included in a separate chapter, namely chapter five, all the privatization transactions that have already taken place in Jordan. Also, a few examples of some unfinished transactions that are expected to be completed in the coming two years. After studying the privatization plans that Jordan is proceeding with, I tried to analyze them. I attempted to discover why Jordan needs to privatize, what was behind the successful completed transactions, and what other ingredients Jordan needs to include in its <b>privatization</b> plans, in <b>order</b> to get positive results on the long run. I searched for the results that are already available, since usually the results of privatization need time to materialize and become noticeable. In light of these findings, my conclusion addressed first, the future prospects for Jordan, if it proceeded on the right track. Second, the issues that Jordan needs to put more effort in, especially promoting peace in the region, due to its vulnerability to external and regional influences. A small country such as Jordan, has to establish itself we" on the international scene, in order to gain and prosper. 1 bound copy: viii, 95 leaves; ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
