40|$|Abstract — An {{innovative}} overlapped-subcarrier multiplexing (O-SCM) {{technique is}} proposed for wavelengthdivision multiplexed (WDM) <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks</b> (PONs). Allowing {{a certain amount}} of spectral overlap between the uplink and the downlink maximizes the spectrum usage of bandwidth-limited reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) -based <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> units (ONUs), while reducing the effect of Rayleigh backscattering. In this paper, we report successful experimental demonstrations up to 2. 5 Gb/s symmetrical bit rates over a 20 km bidirectional PON, using a 2 GHz bandwidth RSOA. In future we are going to develop hybrid TDM-WDM <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks</b> with dynamic wavelength allocation. These new scheme enable different ONUs to efficiently share (both in time and wavelength) the access network bandwidth to achieve better utilization.

The main goal of the theoretical part of this work is the analysis of the various standards of <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks.</b> These specifications are described in the second and fourth chapter, where are discussed their different technical parameters. Particular attention is given to the technology of wavelength division multiplexing. The conclusion of the theoretical part is devoted to the description of the measuring instruments which are suitable for measuring C/DWDM systems. The practical part of this thesis is divided into two sections. The task of the first section is about creating two animations where the first of them shows the principle of <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks</b> based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM - PON). The second animation is focused on the practical demonstration of a combination of wavelength and time division multiplexing (WDM/TDM - PON).

40|$|Abstract—Optical access {{networks}} {{are the ultimate}} {{solution to the problem}} of the last mile bottleneck between high-capacity metro networks and customer premises, capable of delivering future integrated broadband services. Nowadays, <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks</b> are the most promising and cost-effective class of fiber access systems. This rapid evolvement of fiber in {{access networks}} motivates the study of their performance. In this paper we develop teletraffic loss models for calculating connection failure probabilities (due to unavailability of a wavelength) and call blocking probabilities (due to the restricted bandwidth capacity of a wavelength) in hybrid TDM-WDM <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>networks</b> with dynamic wavelength allocation. The springboard of our analysis is well-established recursive teletraffic models. The proposed models are derived from one-dimensional Markov chains which describe the wavelengths occupancy in the <b>optical</b> access <b>network.</b> The <b>optical</b> access <b>network</b> accommodates multiple service-classes with infinite or finite number of traffic sources. The accuracy of the proposed models is validated by simulation and was found to be absolutely satisfactory.
