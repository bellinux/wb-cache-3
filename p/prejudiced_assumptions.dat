40|$|The intercultural {{approach}} {{carries the}} same values as the democratic concept, which is the fundamental platform of the curriculum, Läroplanen. Keywords such as empathy, openness, democracy, education, critical thinking, human rights, identity, equality and understanding {{are some of the}} values that the democratic and the intercultural approach carry. The question is how these values are replicated in the education and the materials that are used in school? This is what this research is going to be focusing on. To answer this question, the research is going to analyze three national tests in English in grade nine. These three tests are the primary source of this study and they are from the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. The main focus of this research is to see how the intercultural approach is replicated in the three tests. The range of the national tests is to see if there has been a development in the intercultural approach in the last decade. The conclusion of this research shows that there is a Western norm that permeates throughout the production of the national tests, which contradicts the goals of an intercultural and democratic education. Even though there is an effort to try to correspond the values of the curriculum, there is still a lack of knowledge from the producer’s counterpart. The producers of the National tests have {{to be aware of the}} powerful position they posses when making the tests. They have the power to share their ideas about another culture. The stories should promote values that are independent from <b>prejudiced</b> <b>assumptions.</b> Some may argue that the bias that is shared in the national test is hard to see, since we share the same frame of reference as the producers. This makes it harder to reveal <b>prejudiced</b> <b>assumptions</b> about another culture since there are no binary opposites or contrasts to make bias noticeable. But this fact could be avoided if you have the curriculum as your point of departure when producing the tests. The intercultural approach is to acknowledge cultural differences, without generalizing people and cultures. The intercultural approach is based on promoting knowledge about cultural differences, to avoid alienation that develops into prejudice assumptions about different cultural phenomena. The intercultural approach should contribute to establishing and encourage respect for each person´s integrity and belief. The result of this research shows that the National Agency of Education has not managed to fulfil these values, even after more than 3 decades of experience...|$|E
40|$|The first {{paper is}} a {{systematic}} review of 12 qualitative studies {{to determine what}} factors are important in facilitating multicultural clinical supervision. Key themes included self-disclosure, knowledge and learning, acknowledging cultural issues and making them explicit, non-endorsement of stereotypic and/or <b>prejudiced</b> <b>assumptions</b> and behaviours, creating a safe space, developing personal awareness of identity and views, and listening to and respecting different perspectives. The qualitative literature exploring supervisors' and supervisees' experiences improves {{our understanding of how}} to promote effective multicultural supervision. A supervisory relationship in which supervisees feel safe to be open and honest about issues of culture, diversity and difference is a key factor in facilitating multicultural clinical supervision. The second paper focussed on the area of openness and honesty, and aimed specifically to gain an understanding of UK trainee clinical psychologists' experiences of (non) disclosure within the supervisory relationship. Twelve participants were recruited from five clinical psychology training courses in England. Semi-structured interviews were audiotaped and transcribed by the researcher. Data were analysed systematically using modified grounded theory, and a model of(non) disclosure developed. The supervisory relationship {{played a crucial role in}} either facilitating or hindering trainees' sense that it was safe to disclose. Developing a trusting relationship was particularly important when disclosure was perceived as difficult. Trainees who felt that disclosure could not be utilised safely, experienced a negative impact on learning and often sought support from other sources. Trainees' experiences of supervisors' response to disclosure had a significant impact on disclosure values and therefore their willingness to disclose in future supervisory relationships.

40|$|Whilst {{common sense}} {{knowledge}} {{has been well}} researched in terms of intelligence and (in particular) artificial intelligence, specific, factual knowledge also plays a critical part in practice. When it comes to testing for intelligence, testing for factual knowledge is, in every-day life, frequently used as a front line tool. This paper presents new results which were {{the outcome of a}} series of practical Turing tests held on 23 rd June 2012 at Bletchley Park, England. The focus of this paper is on the employment of specific knowledge testing by interrogators. Of interest are <b>prejudiced</b> <b>assumptions</b> made by interrogators as to what they believe should be widely known and subsequently the conclusions drawn if an entity does or does not appear to know a particular fact known to the interrogator. The paper is not at all about the performance of machines or hidden humans but rather the strategies based on assumptions of Turing test interrogators. Full, unedited transcripts from the tests are shown for the reader as working examples. As a result, {{it might be possible to}} draw critical conclusions with regard to the nature of human concepts of intelligence, in terms of the role played by specific, factual knowledge in our understanding of intelligence, whether this is exhibited by a human or a machine. This is specifically intended as a position paper, firstly by claiming that practicalising Turing's test is a useful exercise throwing light on how we humans think, and secondly, by taking a potentially controversial stance, because some interrogators adopt a solipsist questioning style of hidden entities with a view that it is a thinking intelligent human if it thinks like them and knows what they know.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{literature}} review of conceptions of stereotype, <b>prejudice,</b> underlying <b>assumptions</b> and images of self and other as relevant to history textbooks and related research.

I address questions like, what are the underlying assumptions of history texts that lead to picturing ourselves and others? Could {{an understanding of the}} other be seen as a liability, given the moral responsibility it introduces? In seeking answers, instead of a sociological approach analysing the social systems of power and oppression, the perpetuating of stereotypes is viewed from an individual, psychological perspective. Hence, I ask how the psychology of hatred could be understood and what this implies for viewing the self in relation to the other through history education. I conclude by stressing that moral responsibility starts with the self and not with the other; and that the bigger enemy of history teaching is not prejudice and stereotype contained in pedagogic texts, but indifference or bystander behaviour that such texts could encourage...|$|R

40|$|The frame {{story in}} Parsifal is {{situated}} in a dystopian Europe, devastated, war-weary and {{in a state of}} shock and decay. Main protagonists are a retired general, Piscator (cf. Fisher King) and a middle aged unemployed female journalist, Perle Vaus (cf. Perlesvaus/Perceval/Parsifal). With her questions Perle is trying to help the general to write his memoirs in a truthful way. The game with time and memory is part of Sigrid Combüchen's narrative strategy. The Grail Legend is employed as subtext and palimpsest. The novel contains four historical levels, combined with segments of 'dirty' Realism, Fantasy and Science Fiction. However, this Paper will focus upon the concluding dialogue between Perle and the General. The General needs assistance to tell about the most shameful incident in his career, the hunting and killing of a group of school girls. However, in his memoir writing he is still focused on describing a successful and honorary military career. Perle's maieutic questions leads the General to an evading narrative strategy, where fiction and different kinds of cultivated digressions become substitutes for the naked truth. This also leads to a Double bind representation of reality. The General's shaded reality comprehension is also based on his life long <b>prejudiced</b> gender <b>assumptions.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|There {{continues}} to be a remarkable revival in academic interest in Carl Schmitt's thought within politics and social theory {{but this is the first}} book to address his thought from an explicitly legal theoretical perspective. Transcending the prevailing one-sided and purely historical focus on Schmitt’s significance for debates that took place in the Weimar Republic 1919 - 1933, this book addresses the actual and potential significance of Schmitt's thought for controversies within contemporary Anglo-American legal theory that have emerged during the past three decades. These include: the critique of liberal forms of legal positivism; the relative ‘indeterminacy’ of legal doctrine and the need for an explicitly interpretative approach to its range of meanings, their scope and policy rationale; the centrality of discretion and judicial law-making within the legal process; the important role played by ideological <b>prejudices</b> and <b>assumptions</b> in legal reasoning; the reinterpretation of law as a form of strategically disguised politics; the legal theoretical critique of universalistic approaches to "human" rights and associated liberal-cosmopolitan 'ideologies of humanity,' including the rhetoric of 'humanitarian intervention'; and the limitations of liberal constitutionalism and liberalism more generally as an approach to law.

For this purpose, a group of nine participants were selected, {{who were part of}} a peer mentoring program in a Mid-Atlantic public university. The experiences they shared were interpreted through the methodological lens of hermeneutic phenomenology. The {{purpose of this study is}} to begin filling in one of the voids in the mentoring practice, which is the experience of peer mentees, and what this study reveals is that the peer mentee experience is the result of loneliness and prejudice that Latina/o students are able to overcome when they have a good peer mentoring experience. This interpretation is done following Clark Moustakas' philosophy of being. Peer mentees receive guidance and help alleviating their solitude, which in this study is interpreted as being-with. Consequently, peer mentees find purpose and are reminded of the reason why they stay in college, which herein is interpreted through the existential concept of being-for. Finally, this study also reveals that being a peer mentee can help finding or making sense of being in college and recovering a sense of belonging, which is interpreted through the phenomenological concept of being-with. The recommendations of this study to improve this practice involve fostering community, creating a sense of belonging, and advocating for a pedagogical experience that is liberated of <b>prejudices</b> and <b>assumptions</b> about Latinas/os, in addition to continuing the support of peer mentoring...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} analysis of Irish pamphleteering on {{political and economic}} subjects in the period between 1727 and 1749. Pamphleteering is analysed as an activity in itself. The study determines who wrote pamphlets, investigates how widely the tmcts were read and by whom, and explores the overlap between pamphleteering and membership of the wider public sphere. The various rhetorical strategies employed by authors {{to appeal to the}} prejudices and anxieties of their assumed audiences are discussed. The main themes and issues preoccupying Irish pamphleteers are identified. The study seeks to illuminate the most significant developments in pamphleteering in this period, including authors' attempts to encourage economic improvement and the pragmatic approach they adopted towards the British connection. This thesis also looks beyond the ideas articulated by pamphleteers to uncover their underlying assumptions, frames of reference and intellectual influences. Assumptions about parliament and public opinion, trade, the workings of the economy and the social structure are examined in detail. The ideas advanced in pamphlets are considered in the context of other contemporary sources, including private correspondence and parliamentary journals. Historians have debated whether pamphlets provide a valuable source for historical research. This thesis, which examines the links between pamphlet rhetoric, wider contemporary assumptions and practical political action, sheds important new light on this issue. It reveals how far the work. of pamphleteers reflected the <b>prejudices</b> and <b>assumptions</b> of the wider political classes and asks if the content and tone of the pamphlet literature changed in response to political and economic developments.

Yet some researchers argue that racial discrimination issues are still prevalent in the United States. They contend that modern racial discrimination is more covert and takes the form of racial microaggressions, which are subtle conscious or unconscious insults and derogatory attitudes directed towards minorities. Researchers have not fully addressed the prevalence of racial microaggressions in U. S. workplaces, however. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore the lived experiences of naturalized African-Americans regarding racial microaggressions in U. S. federal agencies. The research problem was examined through the lens of critical race theory. Ten participants from the Social Security Administration were selected using snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi structured phone interviews and then examined using thematic content analysis to identity key concepts and develop a coding structure, from which 9 themes emerged. Findings revealed that participants experienced racial microaggressions in the form of bias, <b>prejudice,</b> false <b>assumptions,</b> nepotism, favoritism, and unfair denial of opportunities for promotion and professional development while at work, which affected their morale and productivity.

With examples drawn from both the technological artefacts of early cinema (the Maltese Cross intermittent mechanism, the Lumière Cinématographe) and from emerging cinematic practices (travelling exhibitors, optical projection systems), the alternative methodology described here is shown to be helpful in re-evaluating and restructuring the archaic inherited master narrative of the invention of moving pictures. The essay {{suggests that}} by looking at the material technology and practices of early cinema without <b>prejudice</b> or prior <b>assumption,</b> there is still much to be learned from surviving resources too long ignored; which in turn reveals a distinct need to restructure the habitual story of invention, which was formed in the 1920 s and remains largely untested by modern scholarship...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of 2015, Germany was confronted with ever {{increasing}} immigration flows {{which resulted in the}} so-called “refugee crisis”. This sudden political and societal challenge brought about feelings of fear, anxiety and insecurity in many people. As a result, the right-wing Populist Party AFD and the populist movement PEGIDA steadily gained more support. Furthermore, the number of right-wing motivated crimes reached a total of 13 846 by the end of December 2015, of which 4183 were declared as motivated by “anti-migrant” or xenophobic sentiments. However, it appears as if the German government has difficulties reacting appropriately to those developments. This paper argues that the asymmetry between the moral and political evaluation of transnational religiously motivated terrorist violence and domestic right-wing extremist violence is untenable. Consequently, the emphasis on safeguarding national security against the risk of this kind of terrorist violence denies the importance of dealing with the right-wing risk “from within”. It is argued, that the increasing right-wing motivated violence shares certain dynamics with religiously motivated terrorism, even though both phenomena differ in fatality. The choice to call one form of violence terrorism and another form, in this case right-wing extremist violence, is not considered as terrorism, is not as neutral as is often presumed and is certainly not exclusively attributable to the differing character or fatality of the violence. It will be shown that instead, it reveals a lot about certain <b>prejudices,</b> a priori <b>assumptions</b> about the nature of terrorism, prevailing resentment and political interest...|$|R

Its purpose is to appraise Northern Territory initiatives in the wider context of all Australian jurisdictions during the period of approximately 1985 to 1995. While the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody provide the main frame of reference for the study, the emphasis is not on deaths in custody, but on crime, its incidence among indigenous and non-indigenous people and, in particular, the anomalously high rate of imprisonment among indigenous people. Existing research projects, literature, investigations and records of parliamentary debates have been examined for this study, in order to shed more light on the policy debate. Historical, criminological and sociological factors were also examined as they are essential in comprehending the complexity of the issues involved. The study endeavours to show that any effective reduction in indigenous imprisonment rates needs to be globally addressed. Policy responses must aim to redress the inequalities found in all social indicators at the same time. They must also provide developmental opportunities that enable a rapid increase in indigenous self-management. The study concludes that there are ample opportunities {{in the criminal justice system}} for greater Aboriginal involvement in determining more appropriate measures to deal effectively with offending behaviour. In order to achieve equity in the legal system, a shift is needed in the <b>prejudiced</b> and discriminatory <b>assumptions</b> upon which the structures and processes of the criminal justice system are based...|$|R

The opposition parties – the Social Democratic Party, the Left Party, and the Green Party – were profoundly critical to this approach, arguing that the possibility to reunite with one’s close family must be seen as an indispensable precondition for people to successfully integrate, not as a reward. The support requirement was also criticized for representing a <b>prejudiced</b> and faulty <b>assumption</b> that newcomers would not make an effort to find a job or a place to live unless there was an explicit requirement to do so (Parliamentary Committee on Social Insurance, 2009 / 10 : 16 (2009)).

The Conservative Party was the driving force in favor of a requirement, whereas the Christian Democrats were profoundly critical to any limitations on the possibilities to reunite with the close family. The Liberals and the Centre Party took something of a middle position, supporting the general idea of requiring new arrivals to get a job before bringing in the family, but simultaneously anxious to secure exemptions, for example, for unaccompanied minors and refugees. These disagreements resulted in a government proposal that was significantly watered down (as compared to the proposals of the government-appointed inquiry in 2008, see Government bill, 2009 / 10 : 77 (2009)), including an extensive list of exemptions that in practice meant that extremely few people were submitted to the new support requirement. The policy was approved by the parliament in March 2010. Of all family reunification cases handled by the Migration Board in the years after the introduction of the support requirement, less than 1 % were actually subject to it.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to advocate for Black Nationalism's full inclusion in the academic field of political philosophy. By bringing the thinkers in the Black Nationalist tradition into this discourse, the field of philosophy stands to gain important insight into the <b>prejudices</b> and unexamined <b>assumptions</b> that plague academia. I will flesh out {{the nature of these}} assumptions using the works of Black Nationalists like Angela Davis, George Jackson and Joy James. This will show that reading Black Nationalists as social theorists enables philosophers to unveil sources of knowledge about political economies by looking at the history of imperialism in a comprehensive manner. The second section is devoted to an examination of how the Black Panther Party's relationship to the state reveals the role of white violence in maintaining racial hierarchies. That the Black Panthers were targeted so systematically by the state indicates that they were perceived to be a threat to the white power structure, which gives us insight into how challenging state terror is a revolutionary act in intellectual and concrete ways. I show that the mainstream academic discourse on racism in American society assigns higher credibility to white philosophers even when Black thinkers have been producing relevant scholarship for centuries on the subject in question. The third section examines the philosophy of the Enlightenment in terms of how it relates to the domestic colonization of African Americans and to the abuse of people of color around the globe by European and American imperialists. The purpose of this section is to show how scholars' confidence in white canonized philosophers predisposes them to overlook Enlightenment philosophy's structurally racist approach to political societies. The fourth section provides a detailed overview of the key principles in Anti-Colonial and Critical Race Theory as they intersect with Black Nationalism. Important issues addressed in this section include the role of prisons in keeping African Americans in a state of neo-slavery. In order to situate Black Nationalist thought within a broader intellectual history, I will discuss how Black Nationalism represents the culmination of radical American and Anti-Colonial political theory...|$|R
40|$|The state {{education}} {{system of the}} inter-war years was characterised by the three crucial divisions of social class, ability and gender. It was the non-academic working class girl who was most disadvantaged by those divisions and who has been most ignored by educational policymakers and, indeed, by historians. That disadvantage was most apparent in the debate about vocational training for paid employment which marked these years. The controversy between the proponents of liberal and vocational education was of special significance for girls because of the frequently expressed argument that a girl had a single vocation - homemaking and domesticity. As the economy was restructured and women were drawn into the new consumer industries, the crucial dilemma of whether education should enable girls to enlarge their opportunities in paid employment or whether it should continue to orientate girls towards the domestic role had to be addressed. It is the educational policy and practices resulting from that tension between domesticity and productivity which this thesis will examine. Its focus will be the elementary and technical schools of London. The London County Council adopted a consciously progressive technical education programme during the inter-war years. This local study will therefore elucidate trends in the policy, practice and experience of girls' vocational schooling. It will be suggested that policy reflected the coexistence of patriarchy and capitalism. Class intersected with gender {{to result in a}} situation where schools trained girls to be cheap, unskilled workers in certain women's trades. Educational policy was constrained by the desire to preserve conventional domestic roles intact and a belief that working class girls could be defined by their gender as a homogeneous group undistinguished by aptitude or ability. The assumption was made that girls would engage only temporarily in paid employment before returning to their true vocations as wives and mothers. Thus vocational schooling provides a concrete expression of inter-war gender ideology. The Introduction sets out the theoretical framework upon which this thesis is based. Chapter Two will provide an examination of the political, economic and social context in which educational policy was made. The third chapter analyses domestic studies' courses, the most explicit formulation of how schools prepared girls for their adult role. Chapters Four and Five focus on the Junior Technical and Central Schools, illustrating how schooling within them epitomised <b>assumptions,</b> <b>prejudices</b> and ideologies about girls' education during the inter-war years...|$|R
40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) Despite {{more than}} a century of development, {{there can be little doubt}} that many psychologists today still adhere to a worldview that characterised the {{earliest}} developments in the discipline. A worldview which holds that there is an external reality, that objectivity is attainable, and that, given enough time and effort, we shall be able to discover the 'truth'. These psychologists have chosen to ignore the occurrence of what may well be regarded as a paradigm shift, in the sense that Kuhnian philosophers of science use this phrase. They tend to believe that if anything exists, it must exist in some measurable quantity. In sharp contradistinction, adherents of the constructivist orientation, who have admittedly been influenced by developments in what is often referred to as the 'new physics', adopt a stance in which they emphasise the essentially subjective nature of what we know- or, at least, believe we know. Constuctivism, in spite of not representing a unitary body of theory, accepts that all so-called knowledge - especially knowledge about other human beings - is dramatically influenced by our <b>assumptions,</b> <b>prejudices,</b> perceptions and constructions about the people, events, and stories that we all tell to ourselves, and to others, about the events that represent our lives. Given the body of constructivist thinking, a question that arises is whether, and to what extent, it is possible to apply this highly abstract worldview to the interpretation of the events that occur in, for example, a single psychotherapy session. In this dissertation an attempt has been made to analyze the events of a single (and singular!) therapy session. The analysis has been conducted at several levels of abstraction. The events are viewed from the perspective of a transcript of the session, from the angle of the therapist's interpretation of what occurred during the session and what he attempted to achieve, from a viewpoint adopted by the author of the dissertation (who also happens to be the therapist in question), and from the position of yet a fourth 'participant' who is referred to as the rapporteur. The latter dwells on the conceptual implications of other discussions in the dissertation. The recursive nature of the interactions between the four 'viewers' of, or 'commentators' on, the process, and the complexities which derive from adopting a constructivist stance in which the alleged certainties of a positivist position are eschewed, are illustrated in the conceptual analysis and description offered. Ultimately, it would appear, a constructivist stance has numerous benefits, although they may not readily be admitted to by those with a low tolerance of ambiguity...|$|R
5000|$|Alongside of {{specific}} {{praise for the}} movement, Khiabany also discuss about dangers of the campaign: Yet, the campaign is not free from contradictions and limits. Let us briefly examine some {{of the limitations of}} these forms of digital activism. The first point worth highlighting is the mismatch between local context and concerns (internal) and the framing and reception of these concerns outside the geographical boundaries of the local (external). In contrast to the virtual and real attacks and threats against the Stealthy Freedom campaign by Iranian state officials, media, and supporters, the overwhelming feeling outside Iran has been one of support, solidarity and encouragement. Yet, the positive international coverage and support should not obscure number of contradictions and dilemmas. There is always a danger, as Zishad Lak reminds us, that the local struggle might be assimilated into something completely different. For her, the Stealthy Freedom campaign is one of those instances in which [...] "local resistance risks being thrust into obscurity to be protected from colonial interpretations. What we should be wary of is the audience or the interlocutor that is implicit in the messages around which the actor organizes her actions. In every story published in mainstream British or American media, one comes across supporting statements encouraging Iranian women with phrases such as [...] "Go Girls!", or simple describing participants in this campaign as [...] "Beautiful, smart, confident, and happy" [...] and welcoming them [...] "to the 21st century".The problem with such expressions of solidarity is not that the information provided about the lack of freedom in Iran is inaccurate but rather, as Haleh Anvari suggested in the New York Times, the Western fetish of and obsession with gazing at Iranian women has turned them into [...] "Iran's Eiffel Tower or Big Ben). Such constructions of Muslim women as [...] "cultural icons", as Leila Abu-Lughod has demonstrated, not only has been used to simplify the complex realities of the Middle Eastern societies but also have been used as an excuse for military interventions that are partly justified to [...] "save" [...] Muslim women. Since the 9/11 terrorist attack, these [...] "cultural icons" [...] have come to represent the dividing line between [...] "us" [...] and [...] "them", modern and traditional, civilized and barbaric.There are two additional points that need to be highlighted. First of all, as the international success of the Stealthy Freedom campaign shows us, new technologies do, indeed, break geographical boundaries and precipitate international sympathy and solidarity. However, these technologies are also born in specific historical societies and social relations. Time and space compression does not makes space irrelevant, and new technologies by themselves cannot bypass <b>assumptions,</b> <b>prejudices,</b> and stereotypes. The Stealthy Freedom Facebook campaign is not immune from such prejudices and stereotypes but also (whether by accident or design) reinforces them. Gh. Khiabany Khiabany further points out that since 1979 revolution Iranian women have used every opportunity to challenge those very 'moral' conceptions, including dress-code. Therefore, Masih Alinejad was wrong to suggest that the Stealthy Freedom website could not exist if she were in Iran, or to suggest that Iranian women can only express themselves [...] "from far away", or {{that this is the first}} time in 30 years that Iranian women have done so. It is not for the first time, since the coming to power of the Islamic Republic, Iranian women have defied the state and have expressed themselves. As two additional major issues Khiabany sees lack of diversity inside the movement, with only recognized individual is Masih Alinejad herself, and another major problem is campaign's narrow focus on hijab rather than many other important issues. On the contrary, some analysts state Alinejad did address different important issues and My Stealthy Freedom served as unofficial news about the events related to women issues, however, her Facebook page did not meet the appropriate news standards, such as neutrality and recency, and always reflect negative perspectives about women’s right sphere in Iran.|$|R
40|$|The Writer: Sigrid Combüchen {{was born}} in Solingen in the German Ruhr {{territory}} 1942. Shortly after the War her family moved to Sweden. She is a Swedish writer and literary critic and has so far published seven novels, {{a collection of essays}} and a biography (on the Norwegian novelist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature 1920, Knut Hamsun). She received the 2004 Selma Lagerlöf Prize and 2007 she received an Honorary Doctor in Literature at Lund University, Sweden, for her literary merits. Combüchen made her debut at the age of seventeen with the novel Ett rumsrent sällskap, 1960. Her best-known novel so far is Byron, 1988. It was translated into English the same year and to German in 1991, and was also translated to five more languages. Related to the Swedish tradition, where space, "hembygd", often is central, she describes herself as homeless, without roots – more of a European than a provincial writer. Time lines in different constellations constitutes much of her writing: History, fantasy and Myth, outsidedness, she is multilingual and open for a rich variety of narrative form- and time experiments. Bibliography: • Ett rumsrent sällskap, 1960 • I norra Europa, 1977 • Värme, 1980 • Byron, 1988 • Korta och långa kapitel, 1992 • Om en dag man vaknar. Essayer., 1995 • Parsifal, 1998 • En simtur i sundet, 2003 • Livsklättraren. En bok om Knut Hamsun, 2006 (from www. wikipedia, in a short article written by myself). Brief Summary: The frame story in Parsifal is situated in a dystopian Europe, possibly a kind of European Union around 2050, devastated, war-weary after many minor wars and conflicts, and in a state of brutalisation and decay. Main protagonists are a retired general, Piscator (cf. the Fisher King in the palimpsests) and a middle aged homeless and unemployed female journalist, Perle Vaus (cf. Perlesvaus/Perceval/Parsifal). At the beginning of the story Perle is homeless, living with others under the Saxon Bridge in her city. Through the new home laws Perle as a female has lost the right to be the owner of a house after she has lost her husband. Piscator is trying to write his memoirs and has hired Perle. As a reader of the daily newspaper Standart he knew about Perle's earlier work writing editorials as the assistant to the chief editor, Johnny Gawain –so called "Phoenix-plans" - she used her constructive intellect to recommend "short cuts" between destroyed expressways and other city renewals in the devastated landscape. But a new management has lead to populistic directorial guidelines. The newspaper has no use of her services any longer, and she {{has been replaced by a}} fortune teller reading in the cards and the star constellations. Gawain left the newspaper at the same time. He emigrated with his family to a small village deep into the djungle. In the course of action Perle is undertaking an adventurous journey in Piscator's dreams - on a river boat into the djungle, a story with mythical implications - and parallel to that she is assisting Piscator to remember his life and military career with maieutic questions. Abstract body: The game with time and memory is part of Sigrid Combüchen's narrative strategy. The Grail Legend is employed as subtext and palimpsest. The novel contains different historical layers, combined with segments of 'dirty' Realism, Fantasy and Science Fiction. However, this Paper will focus upon the concluding dialogue between Perle and Piscator. The General needs assistance to tell about the most shameful incident in his career, the hunting and killing of a group of school girls. However, he is still focused on describing a successful military career. Perle's maieutic questions lead to an evading narrative strategy from the General, where fiction and different kinds of cultivated digressions become substitutes for the truth. It also leads to a Double bind representation of reality. The General's shaded reality comprehension is also based on his life long <b>prejudiced</b> gender <b>assumptions.</b> The Paper's disposition: The first part develops some basic assumptions regarding the construction of the novel and how it can be read in a meaningful way, using concepts as open-endedness and homelessness, as consequences of the novel's intertextuality, or rather intermediality. This exploration is based primarily on Bakhtin’s concept of open ended speech genres with a few supplements by his contemporaries Ernst Bloch and Georg Lukács, constituents of the utopian artistic movement by the time of "Der Blaue Reiter" and the "Bauhaus" group in Germany around 1910 and thereafter. In the second part these concepts are used in the reading of a key passage in Combüchen’s novel, the dialogue concerning a well hidden cave incident, the second last chapter of the novel. The final meeting is described, mainly through dialogue, between ‘the Fisher king’, general Piscator, and ‘the Grail Quester’, Perle. The general needs ‘the right questions’ to be able to record this most disgracing incident in his military career, the killing of a group of innocent schoolgirls, interrogated by soldiers under his command, then ‘playfully’ hunted through the forest and left to die in a cave, mined and exploded by the soldiers. Piscator claims over and over again that he was asleep himself during that time. Still he can tell in detail about the proceedings. Perle is trying to find out the true nature of the episode, with maieutic questions, comes close but fails in the end. In the third part the concepts presented in the first part are used as means for a transhistorical and ethnographic reading of the novel. It is assumed that the intermediality of this story of fiction, based on a palimpsest with a mythical layer, also opens up for intermedial dialogues with nonfictional texts of literary, historical, ethnographic and contemporary significance to the main topic, i. e. the war crimes in military actions due to institutionalised male violence against women. The fourth part briefly considers the opening up of thematic possibilities of the theme, Grail Quest, and its treatment by Combüchen, in accordance with the open-endedness of the last chapter of the novel. It conjuctures with the basic Question, die Grundfrage, in Ernst Bloch’s philosophy of ‘the Principle of Hope’, Das Prinzip Hoffnung (Frankfurt/M. 1959, written in the USA 1938 - 47). </p...|$|R
