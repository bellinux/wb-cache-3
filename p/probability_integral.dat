The authors explained {{that due to}} the <b>probability</b> <b>integral</b> transform at the true parameter, the “spacing” between each observation should be uniformly distributed. This would imply {{that the difference between}} the values of the cumulative distribution function at consecutive observations should be equal. This is the case that maximizes the geometric mean of such spacings, so solving for the parameters that maximize the geometric mean would achieve the “best” fit as defined this way.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>probability</b> <b>integrals,</b> such as first statistical moments (mean and covariance matrix) or probability of failure, {{can be assessed}} {{by a variety of}} methods. The problem of evaluating first statistical moments of multivariate probability density functions (PDFs) often arises in Bayesian updating problems, such as in structural model updating using dynamic data, while the calculation of probability of failure is needed in reliability analysis. Despite of the extensive research on this topic, severe efficiency and robustness problems still render the computation of such integrals often unreliable or unfeasible, especially as higher dimensional parameter spaces are considered. This thesis contributes on expanding the universe of applications for both Bayesian updating and reliability analysis in structural engineering to enable handling more complex and larger problems. This work more specifically suggests the use adaptive importance sampling procedures and other techniques for the {{evaluation of}} <b>probability</b> <b>integrals</b> when considering first statistical moments evaluation and reliability estimation.
