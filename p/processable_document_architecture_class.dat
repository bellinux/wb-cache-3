40|$|The EXPRES (Experimental Research in Electronic Submission) project {{promotes}} the electronic interchange of multi-media documents among the scientific research community. For this project we {{concentrate on the}} problem of effective interchange of <b>processable</b> multi-media <b>documents.</b> In particular, we are ignoring the transfer method. Instead we concern ourselves with the question of how a multi-media document created on one system can be viewed and edited on another system. The obvious technique of performing translations between each pair of systems is impractical. In order to attack the problems efficiently, we make use of a standard representation. "We have settled on the international standard Office <b>Document</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ODA) [ISO 88 a] as the intermediate format. This paper discusses how we implemented ODA for interchange...|$|R

40|$|The Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused {{primarily}} on digitalization of structured documents. It describes the process of digitalization {{and all of its}} phases. It answers the question why imaging and scanning, {{what is the best way}} of doing it and what resources are necessary. Types of scanned documents and the extent of their structuring is also being defined. Most attention is paid to structured documents and their attributes, functions, frequent deficiencies, their optimization and development. Individual parts of such a document as well as their options and recommended settings are described. In the second part of this thesis there is a specific example of a contract with the aim to develop an easily <b>processable</b> <b>document</b> and then perform a data capture.

40|$|The {{text that}} {{follows is a}} {{slightly}} revised extract from my doctoral thesis (Francke, 2008). 1 It draws on the notions of information <b>architecture</b> and <b>document</b> <b>architecture</b> to identify a set of concepts for analysing documents as sociotechnical artefacts. The analytical tool was developed {{for the purpose of}} analysing scholarly journals, which has tinged it to some extent, but it is likely applicable also for analysis of other document types and genres. As part of identifying concepts, I refer to several of the more established ways of conceptualising information <b>architecture</b> and <b>document</b> <b>architecture.</b> As such, the text may provide an introduction to these two areas, as they looked {{a few years ago when}} the thesis was prepared. The article may thus be of interest both as a first introduction to the two perspectives and from a theoretical and methodological point of view. Information <b>architecture</b> (IA) and <b>document</b> <b>architecture</b> (DA) provide two, partly overlapping, perspectives on the creation of document structures. This article suggests how the <b>architecture</b> of a <b>document</b> can be analysed from these two perspectives. Literature on IA and DA has been examined in orde...|$|R
