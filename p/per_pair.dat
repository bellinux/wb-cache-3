5|$|In a British survey, a {{hatching}} rate of 82% and a fledging rate of 78% gave an overall 58% nesting success, {{with an average}} 2.5 surviving young <b>per</b> <b>pair.</b> In contrast, a study in northwestern France found juvenile mortality was nearly 70%. The average lifespan is not recorded, although the maximum recorded age is 10.9 years.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young <b>per</b> <b>pair</b> per year.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg <b>per</b> <b>pair</b> per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.|$|E

The significance of slot harmonics {{and the benefits}} of stators with odd number of slots <b>per</b> pole <b>pair</b> are highlighted. Based on these valuable analytical insights, this paper proposes coordination of the selection of stators with odd number of slots <b>per</b> pole <b>pair</b> and IPM rotors with multiple layers of flux barriers in order to reduce torque ripple. The effectiveness of using stators with odd number of slots <b>per</b> pole <b>pair</b> in reducing torque ripple is validated by applying a finite-element-based Monte Carlo optimization method to four IPM machine topologies, which are combinations of two stator topologies (even or odd number of slots <b>per</b> pole <b>pair)</b> and two IPM rotor topologies (one- or two-layer). It is demonstrated that the torque ripple can be reduced to less than 5 % by selecting a stator with an odd number of slots <b>per</b> pole <b>pair</b> and the IPM rotor with optimized barrier configurations, without using stator/rotor skewing or rotor pole shaping.
