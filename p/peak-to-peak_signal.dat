40|$|Silicon modulators, {{which use}} the free-carrier-plasma effect, were studied, both {{analytically}} and experimentally. It was {{demonstrated that the}} loss-efficiency product, a-VpL, was a suitable figure of merit for silicon modulators that enabled their intrinsic properties to be compared. Subsequently, the dependence of VpL on frequency was expressed by using the electrical parameters of a phase shifter when the modulator was operated by assuming a simple driving configuration. A diode-based modulator operated in forward biased mode was expected from analyses to provide more efficient operation than that in reversed mode at high frequencies due to its large capacitance. We obtained an a-VpL of 9. 5 dB-V at 12. 5 GHz in experiments by using the fabricated phase shifter with pin diodes operated in forward biased mode.

In 1964 Mr. Cloward led {{a group of}} 10 Explorer Scouts from Post 156 (Clearfield, Utah) {{to the top of}} Mt. Timpanogos; from there they flashed signals (reflected sunlight) down to the inhabitants of Utah Valley [...] (see photos) using pieces of old mirrors from which Mr. Cloward had created signal mirrors patterned after those carried in military aircraft survival kits. Several dozen local residents, seeing bright flashes from the peak, improvised return signals using household mirrors from locations around the valley approximately 5 to 25 miles away. The following year a <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>signaling</b> event was attempted between five peaks in northern Utah, but due to bad weather and inadequate planning communication was successful only between two of the five peaks. Mr. Cloward organized similar activities involving one to three scout units multiple times from 1965 to 1979 from various mountain peaks in central and northern Utah. In 1980 Mr. Douglas G. Brewer, Varsity Scout commissioner for the Great Salt Lake Council, and several other Scout Leaders built upon Mr. Cloward's experience to create Operation On-Target as a well coordinated, multi-council, multi-state activity in the nascent Varsity Scouting program.|$|R

L-band pilot tones aboard geosynchronous satellites at 15 and 40 deg. elevations were used to examine diurnal signal variations measured by using a hemispherical antenna.

The results suggest that the diurnal variations were due to multipath effects caused by the motion of the satellite with respect to the receiver antenna. Noting that the orbit inclinations of the satellites used in the experiment were only on the order of 2 to 3 deg., the results also suggest a potentially serious signal variation problem for low-gain antenna-based communications systems using low earth orbit satellites, since the satellite elevation angles relative to earth change far more rapidly...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is 3 -fold: firstly, to provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the use of differential circuits for analogue signal processing in wireless transceivers; secondly, to describe, in detail, single-ended signal to differential conversion, and the corresponding theory of such devices, their characterisation, various methods of implementation, and comparative analyses of their performance; lastly, to propose a new transistor-based solution for wideband baluns. This novel solution is based on the current conveyor and has been modelled using the transistor parameters of a 0. 35 µm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The salient features of the new implementation are: (a) stable 50 -Ω input port impedance and easily controllable output impedance (50 Ω/ 75 Ω/ 100 Ω); (b) stable matching between the differential output ports, within 1 dB (3 dB) amplitude and 10 ◦ (20 ◦) phase balance up to 2 GHz (3 GHz); (c) good signal quality with output signal harmonic distortion lower than 1 % for <b>peak-to-peak</b> input <b>signals</b> up to 50 mV; (d) excellent S-parameter performance (0 - 3 GHz) with return losses lower than – 10 dB, reverse signal rejection better than 20 dB, more than 25 dB isolation between the output ports, and 42 dB common-mode rejection; and (d) stable performance over a 100 ◦ C operating temperature range.

Samples of ancient air trapped within ice cores provide the means to do this. Here we analyze the ultrahigh-resolution CH 4 record of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core 67. 2 – 9. 8 [*]ka and find novel, atmospheric CH 4 variability at centennial time scales throughout the record. This signal is characterized by recurrence intervals within a broad 80 – 500 [*]year range, but we find that age-scale uncertainties complicate the possible isolation of any periodic frequency. Lower signal amplitudes in the Last Glacial relative to the Holocene may be related to incongruent effects of firn-based signal smoothing processes. Within interstadial and stadial periods, the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>signal</b> amplitudes vary in proportion to the underlying millennial-scale oscillations in CH 4 concentration—the relative amplitude change is constant.

40|$|Abstract – A mode {{conversion}} rotary ultrasonic motor (USM) has potential applications in miniature robotics. However, its electrical drive circuit presents some unique challenges, particularly in producing a high frequency (~ 40 kHz), high voltage (~ 200 V <b>peak-to-peak)</b> <b>signal</b> into {{a low impedance}} (~ 100 Ω) capacitive motor, while achieving high efficiency.

While the peak efficiency of this circuit is 45 %, in practice the equivalent impedance of the USM changes with mechanical load and temperature, resulting in an average efficiency of 16 %. The admittance vs. frequency characteristic and the equivalent electrical model for a USM prototype are also presented in this paper.

A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate {{the use of}} lossy signal compression {{as a means to}} decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering one dimensional biosignals such as ECG, RESP and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4 % of the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude.

Graphene has also been shown to be an attractive building block for nanoscale electronic devices, although little is known about its interfaces with cells and tissue. Here we report the first studies of graphene field effect transistors (Gra-FETs) as well as combined Gra- and NW-FETs interfaced to electrogenic cells. Gra-FET conductance signals recorded from spontaneously beating embryonic chicken cardiomyocytes yield well-defined extracellular signals with signal-to-noise ratio routinely 3 ̆e 4. The conductance signal amplitude was tuned by varying the Gra-FET working region through changes in water gate potential, V(wg). Signals recorded from cardiomyocytes for different V(wg) result in constant calibrated extracellular voltage, indicating a robust graphene/cell interface. Significantly, variations in V(wg) across the Dirac point demonstrate the expected signal polarity flip, thus allowing, for the first time, both n- and p-type recording to be achieved from the same Gra-FET simply by offsetting V(wg). In addition, comparisons of <b>peak-to-peak</b> recorded <b>signal</b> widths made as a function of Gra-FET device sizes and versus NW-FETs allowed an assessment of relative resolution in extracellular recording. Specifically, peak-to-peak widths increased with the area of Gra-FET devices, indicating an averaged signal from different points across the outer membrane of the beating cells. One-dimensional silicon NW- FETs incorporated side by side with the two-dimensional Gra-FET devices further highlighted limits in both temporal resolution and multiplexed measurements from the same cell for the different types of devices.

Methods: 177 Two-channel EEG recordings 3 – 6 h long were collected from 26 infants born before 29 weeks of gestation. The raw EEG was converted into four different continuous measures of ppA: amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), range-EEG (rEEG), Gotman and Gloor’s half-wave decomposition (HWD), and root of mean squares (RMS). For each ppA-measure EEG indices including mean, median, and 5 % margins; indices of spread (width, standard deviation, coefficient of variation), and asymmetry were calculated for each 1 min epoch. The medians of each index for the entire recording were tested for association with PMA using linear mixed models. Results: The log-transformed values of aEEG and rEEG indices of spread were highly associated with PMA. Conclusions: Indices of spread by aEEG or rEEG {{can be used as}} indicators of neonatal brain maturation.

We measured the intracellular voltage response to a small (9 %), brief (30 ms) decrease in light intensity from a background, and found that its amplitude was decreased by 1 ΜM TTX. The response amplitude was maximal when the background intensity depolarized the cell to − 38 mV. With intensities depolarizing the cell membrane to − 45 to − 33 mV the average response amplitude was decreased by TTX from 1. 2 mV to 0. 5 mV. TTX is also known to decrease the voltage noise during steady illumination (Ferraro et al. 1983) but, despite this, the ratio of <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>signal</b> to noise was, on average, decreased by TTX.

40|$|Abstract—Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is increasingly employed to treat this disease, yet selection of persistent AF patients who will benefit from this treatment remains a challenging task. Several parameters of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) have been analyzed in previous works to predict AF termination by CA, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude. However, they are usually manually computed and only a subset of electrodes is inspected. In the present study, a novel perspective of the role of f-wave amplitude as a potential non-invasive predictor of CA outcome is adopted by exploring ECG inter-lead spatial variability. An automatic procedure for atrial amplitude computation based on cubic Hermite interpolation is first proposed. To describe the global f-wave <b>peak-to-peak</b> amplitude distribution, <b>signal</b> contributions from multiple leads are then combined by condensing the most representative features of the atrial signal in a reduced-rank approximation based on principal component analysis (PCA).

40|$|The {{internet}} {{revolution has}} led to the demand for high speed, low cost solutions for providing high bandwidth to the consumers. Cable and DSL systems address these requirements through sophisticated analog and digital signal processing schemes. A key element of the analog front end of such systems is the line driver which interfaces with the transmission medium such as co-axial cable or twisted pair. The line driver is an amplifier that provides the necessary output current to drive the low impedance of the line. The main requirements for design are high output swing, high linearity, matched impedance to the line and power efficiency. These requirements are addressed by a class AB amplifier whose output impedance can be controlled through feedback. The property of this topology is that when the gain is unity, the output resistance of the driver is matched to the line resistance. Unity gain is achieved for varying line conditions through a tuning loop consisting of peak-to-peak detectors and differential difference amplifier. The design is fabricated in 0. 5 micron AMI CMOS process technology. For line variations from 65 to 170 ohms, the gain is unity with an error of 3 % and the impedance matching error is 20 % at the worst-case.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 42 - 44). The image compression system aims at reducing the graphics. number of bits transmitted as well as keeping the fidelity of the image, such that at the receiver, the reconstructed image will have little distortion. The design of an image compression system involves three aspects: compression ratio, image distortion, and processing speed. In this thesis, we design and implement a new compression/decompression system to compress a gray-scale image. The system consists of three-layer feed forward neural networks. The compression part includes the input layer and the intermediate layer, while the decompression part consists of the intermediate layer and the output layer. To gain high quality of the reconstructed image, a set of natural networks instead of one network have been used in the system. Each neural network was trained with some image blocks which have similar characteristics. In order to decrease the time for the learning process of the neural networks to converge, an adaptive back-propagation learning algorithm was adopted. In order to keep the generalization capability of the compression system and decrease the number of neurons in the intermediate layer, a preprocessing element is designed which performs the necessary' processing of the image before the image is encoded. The preprocessor includes a predictor which predicts the current input block and a subtracting element which generates residual vectors based on the predictive values and the input vectors. The final results shows that the reconstructed image which was processed by our proposed scheme had a very good <b>Peak-to-peak</b> <b>Signal</b> to Noise Ratio and high compression ratio.

Assessment of nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold (NWR-T), pain threshold (PT), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to graded electrocutaneous stimuli were performed before and after exercise. Perceptual magnitude ratings and SEPs were compared at 30 %PT, 60 %PT, 100 %PT before (Pre), 5 min after (Post 1), and 15 min after (Post 2) aerobic exercise.

The probability that the observed occurrence rates for strong variability inside and outside the L/T transition originate from the same underlying true occurrence rate is excluded at> 99. 7 % confidence. Based on a careful assessment of our sensitivity to astrophysical signals, we infer that 39 + 16 − 14 % of L 9 -T 3. 5 dwarfs are strong variables on rotational timescales. If we consider only L 9 -T 3. 5 dwarfs with 0. 8 < J −Ks < 1. 5, and assume an isotropic distribution of spin axes for our targets, we find that 80 + 18 − 19 % would be strong variables if viewed edge-on; azimuthal symmetry and/or binarity may account for non-variable objects in this group. These observations suggest that the settling of condensate clouds below the photosphere in brown dwarf atmospheres does not occur in a spatially uniform manner. Rather, the formatio...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how the triceps surae are controlled at the spinal level during the naturally occurring postural sway of quiet standing. Methods: Subjects {{stood on a}} force platform as electrical stimuli were applied to the posterior tibial nerve when the center of pressure (COP) was either 1. 6 standard deviations anterior (COPant) or posterior (COPpost) to the mean baseline COP <b>signal.</b> <b>Peak-to-peak</b> amplitudes of the H-reflex and M-wave from the soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles were recorded to assess {{the efficacy of the}} la pathway. Results: A significant increase in the H-max : M-max ratio for both the SOL (12 +/- 6 %) and MG (23 6 %) was observed during the COPant as compared to the COPant condition. The source of the modulation between COP conditions cannot be determined from this study. However, the observed changes in the synaptic efficacy of the Ia pathway are unlikely to be simply a result of an altered level of background electromyographic activity in the triceps surae. This was indicated by the lack of differences observed in the H-max : M-max ratio when subjects stood without postural sway (via the use of a tilt table) at two levels of background activity. Conclusions: It is suggested that the phase-dependent modulation of the triceps surae H-reflexes during the postural sway of quiet standing functions to maintain upright stance and may explain the results from previous studies, which, until now, had not taken the influence of postural sway on the H-reflex into consideration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first experimental {{evidence that the}} polarimetric brightness temperatures of sea surfaces are sensitive to ocean wind direction in the incidence angle range of 30 to 50 degrees. Our experimental data were collected by a K-band (19. 35 GHz) polarimetric wind radiometer (WINDRAD) mounted on the NASA DC- 8 aircraft. A set of aircraft radiometer flights was successfully completed in November 1993. We performed circle flights over National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) moored buoys deployed off the northern California coast, which provided ocean wind measurements. The first WINDRAD flight was made on November 4, 1993. There was clear weather with a wind speed of 12 m/s at 330 degrees around the Pt. Arena buoy. We circled the buoy at three incidence angles, and all data when plotted as functions of azimuth angles show clear modulations of several Kelvin. At 40 degrees incidence angle, there is a 5 Kelvin <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>signal</b> in the second Stokes parameter Q and the third Stokes parameter U. The Q data maximum is in the upwind direction and U has a 45 degrees phase shift in azimuth as predicted by theory. There is also an up/downwind asymmetry of 2 Kelvin in the Q data, and 1 Kelvin in the U data. At 50 degrees incidence angle, the collected data show very similar wind direction signatures to the SSM/I model function. Additional flights were made on other days under cloudy conditions. Data taken at a wind speed of 8 m/s show that at 40 degrees incidence Q and U have a smaller azimuthal modulation of 3 Kelvin, {{probably due to the}} lower wind speed. Additionally, the simultaneously recorded video images of sea surfaces suggested that Q and U data were less sensitive to unpolarized geophysical variations, such as clouds and whitecaps, while the T(v) and T(h) increased by a few Kelvin when the radiometer beam crossed over clouds, or there was a sudden increase of whitecaps in the radiometer footprint. The results of our aircraft flights indicate that passive polarimetric radiometry has a strong potential for global ocean wind speed and direction measurements from space...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} atmospheric methane (CH$_{ 4 }$) biogeochemistry {{now and in the}} future, we must apprehend its natural variability, without anthropogenic influence. Samples of ancient air trapped within ice cores provide the means to do this. Here we analyze the ultrahigh-resolution CH$_{ 4 }$ record of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core 67. 2 – 9. 8 ka and find novel, atmospheric CH$_{ 4 }$ variability at centennial time scales throughout the record. This signal is characterized by recurrence intervals within a broad 80 – 500 year range, but we find that age-scale uncertainties complicate the possible isolation of any periodic frequency. Lower signal amplitudes in the Last Glacial relative to the Holocene may be related to incongruent effects of firn-based signal smoothing processes. Within interstadial and stadial periods, the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>signal</b> amplitudes vary in proportion to the underlying millennial-scale oscillations in CH$_{ 4 }$ concentration—the relative amplitude change is constant. We propose that the centennial CH$_{ 4 }$ signal is related to tropical climate variability that influences predominantly low-latitude wetland CH$_{ 4 }$ emissions. This study was funded by the U. S.

40|$|Continued {{improvements}} of transceiver systems-on-a-chip play a {{key role}} in the advancement of mobile telecommunication products as well as wireless systems in biomedical and remote sensing applications. This dissertation addresses the problems of escalating CMOS process variability and system complexity that diminish the reliability and testability of integrated systems, especially relating to the analog and mixed-signal blocks. The proposed design techniques and circuit-level attributes are aligned with current built-in testing and self-calibration trends for integrated transceivers. In this work, the main focus is on enhancing the performances of analog and mixed-signal blocks with digitally adjustable elements as well as with automatic analog tuning circuits, which are experimentally applied to conventional blocks in the receiver path in order to demonstrate the concepts. The use of digitally controllable elements to compensate for variations is exemplified with two circuits. First, a distortion cancellation method for baseband operational transconductance amplifiers is proposed that enables a third-order intermodulation (IM 3) improvement of up to 22 dB. Fabricated in a 0. 13 ?m CMOS process with 1. 2 V supply, a transconductance-capacitor lowpass filter with the linearized amplifiers has a measured IM 3 below - 70 dB (with 0. 2 V <b>peak-to-peak</b> input <b>signal)</b> and 54. 5 dB dynamic range over its 195 MHz bandwidth. The second circuit is a 3 -bit two-step quantizer with adjustable reference levels, which was designed and fabricated in 0. 18 ?m CMOS technology as part of a continuous-time SigmaDelta analog-to-digital converter system. With 5 mV resolution at a 400 MHz sampling frequency, the quantizer's static power dissipation is 24 mW and its die area is 0. 4 mm^ 2. An alternative to electrical power detectors is introduced by outlining a strategy for built-in testing of analog circuits with on-chip temperature sensors. Comparisons of an amplifier's measurement results at 1 GHz with the measured DC voltage output of an on-chip temperature sensor show that the amplifier's power dissipation can be monitored and its 1 -dB compression point can be estimated with less than 1 dB error. The sensor has a tunable sensitivity up to 200 mV/mW, a power detection range measured up to 16 mW, and it occupies a die area of 0. 012 mm^ 2 in standard 0. 18 ?m CMOS technology. Finally, an analog calibration technique is discussed to lessen the mismatch between transistors in the differential high-frequency signal path of analog CMOS circuits. The proposed methodology involves auxiliary transistors that sense the existing mismatch as part of a feedback loop for error minimization. It was assessed by performing statistical Monte Carlo simulations of a differential amplifier and a double-balanced mixer designed in CMOS technologies...|$|R
40|$|Creating and {{controlling}} well-defined single-photon states {{is important for}} many quantum enhanced technologies. Information can be encoded in any degree of freedom associated with a single-photon field excitation, for example in the polarization or transverse spatial mode structure. The ability to encode multiple qubits in these states is desirable for high data transmission rates and increased information processing capacity. The spectral-temporal domain offers a large Hilbert space for encoding information, well suited to integrated optical architectures owing to the low cross-talk between channels. Indeed, time-frequency encoding is an integral component of existing information technologies infrastructure. Thus, complete, coherent control of the spectral-temporal mode structure of light is essential to advancing optical quantum technologies. Arbitrary control of single-photon states has been demonstrated in the polarization and spatial-momentum degrees of freedom however, {{is yet to be}} established in the spectral-temporal domain. Recently it was shown that spectral-temporal pulse shaping is experimentally feasible using nonlinear optical methods. However, such techniques can introduce noise photons, are challenging to implement deterministically and require specially prepared auxiliary pump pulses. Furthermore, they are typically only possible at relatively low repetition rates to avoid damage of nonlinear optical materials. Here, we demonstrate deterministic pulse shaping of single-photon wave packets by introducing a time-varying phase. Applying linear or quadratic phase to the wave packet introduces a spectral shift or spectral broadening, respectively. Achieving significant spectral manipulation requires temporal-phase modulation on the order of π. The phase must also vary on the same time scale as the optical pulses, approximately 1 ps in duration here. This relatively rapid phase variation is achieved using a fast electro-optic phase modulator. The modulator is driven by a time-varying voltage that is synchronized with a pulse train of single-photon wave packets for accurate temporal phase control. In this thesis, we experimentally demonstrate control of the spectral-temporal state of single-photon wave packets using this method. Heralded single-photon wave packets are generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion pumped by a frequency-doubled Titanium-Sapphire laser oscillator with 80 MHz repetition rate. To achieve significant modulation of single-photon pulses a 10 V <b>peak-to-peak</b> radio-frequency <b>signal</b> of 40 GHz drives the phase modulator, which requires approximately 3. 6 V to achieve a π phase shift. The signal is synchronized with the oscillator pulse train using custom designed electronics. Details of these electronics are presented, resulting in a robust phase and amplitude controllable 40 GHz voltage source, phase locked to the single-photon pulse train. To demonstrate the utility of this pulse-shaping method we experimentally show spectral shearing of almost 1 nm for single-photon wave packets with 830 nm central wavelength and 1 nm bandwidth. Measurement of the second-order intensity correlation before and after the wave-packet manipulation remains constant within uncertainty of the measurement, showing that the quantum nature of the single-photon source is not deteriorated by the modulator. Preservation of the wave-packet coherence is verified by two-photon interference between spectrally sheared and non-modulated single-photons. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABRIDGED] We {{report the}} results of a $J$ band search for cloud-related {{variability}} in the atmospheres of 62 L 4 -T 9 dwarfs using the Du Pont 2. 5 -m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. We find 9 of 57 objects included in our final analysis to be significantly variable with > 99 % confidence, 5 of which are new discoveries. In our study, strong sinusoidal <b>signals</b> (<b>peak-to-peak</b> amplitudes > 2 %) are confined to the L/T transition (4 / 16 objects with L 9 -T 3. 5 spectral types and 0 / 41 objects for all other spectral types). The probability that the observed occurrence rates for strong variability inside and outside the L/T transition originate from the same underlying true occurrence rate is excluded with > 99. 7 % confidence. These observations suggest that the settling of condensate clouds below the photosphere in brown dwarf atmospheres does not occur in a spatially uniform manner. Rather, the formation and sedimentation of dust grains at the L/T transition is coupled to atmospheric dynamics, resulting in highly contrasting regions of thick and thin clouds and/or clearings. Outside the L/T transition we identify 5 weak variables (peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0. 6 %- 1. 6 %). Excluding L 9 -T 3. 5 spectral types, we infer that $ 60 ^{+ 22 }_{- 18 }$% of targets vary with amplitudes of 0. 5 %$-$ 1. 6 %, suggesting that surface heterogeneities are common among L and T dwarfs. Our survey establishes a significant link between strong variability and L/T transition spectral types, providing evidence in support of the hypothesis that cloud holes contribute to the abrupt decline in condensate opacity and 1 micron brightening observed in this regime. More generally, fractional cloud coverage is an important model parameter for brown dwarfs and giant planets, especially those with L/T transition spectral types and colors.

40|$|Laser-beam-induced-current (LBIC) {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a combined electro-optical (EO) alternative to individual electrical and optical based measurements of p-n junction photodiodes. The technique is non-destructive and employs a focused low-power laser beam that is scanned across the semiconductor surface, between two shorted ohmic contacts located at remote positions {{on either side of}} the scanned area. The LBIC image is then a two-dimensional map of the steady-state current-flow as a function of laser position. However, despite its simplicity, its application has thus far been limited to either examining photodiodes in a qualitative manner, or as mathematical analogy. This problem is largely due to the complexity of the physical process, and the difficulty in isolating the multitude of semiconductor material and device parameters that influence the LBIC profile. This work significantly develops the physical theory, and quantitative application of LBIC for the characterization of photodiodes. Numerical modeling of the LBIC problem using the full drift-diffusion and φ,ψ treatment of an n-on-p photodiode together with supporting experimental measurements have revealed a wealth of hidden physical mechanisms, quantifiable relationships, and conditions with which to characterize the p-n junction. A further revision to Nui 2 ̆ 7 s theoretical model for the lateral photovoltaic effect (LPE) has also been developed such that bulk recombination, surface recombination and junction leakage are taken into consideration. A study of the forward problem has revealed that the LBIC of a diode is the product of two simultaneous physical current-flow mechanisms that are dependent upon the generation profile interaction with the p-n junction. Under ideal conditions, the net current signal is solely due to localized changes in the junction dipole. However, under non-ideal conditions, the presence of surface recombination, localized defects and/or junction leakage can either disrupt this ideal junction potential, or introduce additional parasitic current-flows. This work has shown that the LBIC of a diode can be directly related to properties such as junction geometry, uniformity, minority- and majority carrier diffusion length, and the junction dynamic resistance. With the aid of developed theory, the diode zero-bias resistance area product, R 0, and other related quantities can be obtained by analysing the majority photocarrier spreading length, Ls, from the LBIC profile. However, this correlation is limited to higher temperatures and large diodes sizes, which avoid photocarrier spreading saturation of the LBIC profile. Temperature dependent studies of LBIC were carried out, which reflect the changing behaviour of junction resistance, R 0. At low-temperatures, below some threshold temperature, Tth, the <b>peak-to-peak</b> LBIC <b>signal</b> was found to reach a saturation state that is effectively independent of bulk material parameters. This low-temperature current saturation is particularly useful as it allows for the examination of junction properties in greater detail. The application of LBIC for the quantitative extraction of p-n junction material and device parameters in the inverse problem has also been demonstrated. Reconstruction of the semiconductor junction doping profile, N, from temperature dependent measurements of the peak-to-peak LBIC is performed when a sufficient number of material, junction and measurement parameters are known or can be determined. Measurement of the minority-carrier diffusion length, Lp, from part of the LBIC profile has revealed a complex relationship between surface recombination velocity, junction geometry, and the generation profile. A variation in device geometry has shown that the fitted decay length, despite the influence of surface recombination, closely resembles the bulk diffusion length. Alternatively, use of a variable depth generation profile has shown that depending on its relationship with junction depth, the extracted length can be either an effective diffusion length, and sensitive to a range of surface recombination velocities, or, representative of the bulk parameter. By applying the full drift-diffusion model, it has been determined that the peak-to-peak LBIC dependence with junction depth is largely determined by two factors. First, the absence of current-constriction on the illuminated vertical junction, the extent of lateral current spreading over the device region, and lastly, the contact-to-contact series resistance. Diode geometries containing shallow junction depths, and small device lengths compared to minority-carrier diffusion and photocarrier spreading lengths respectively, encourage a strong current coupling, and hence sensitivity to junction depth. However, for a fixed device geometry containing an unknown p-n junction depth, the application of multiple wavelength LBIC can be implemented to adjust the generation profile to maximize the carrier collection probability over the p-n junction depth...|$|R
