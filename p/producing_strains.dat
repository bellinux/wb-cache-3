2500|$|Millennia of {{selective}} breeding {{have resulted in}} varieties that look quite different.

Hemp grown for fiber is planted closely, resulting in tall, slender plants with long fibers. [...] "Until the early 1900s industrial hemp was a valuable crop used {{all over the world}} for its strong fibers and oil seeds. Today, however, the common perception of the industrial hemp plant is generally negative and associated with the drug marijuana.

Ideally, according to Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering. This early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality. In these strains of industrial hemp the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content would have been very low.|$|E
2500|$|Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated {{version of}} daunorubicin, the {{immediate}} precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. [...] Daunorubicin is more abundantly found {{as a natural}} product because it is produced {{by a number of}} different wild type strains of streptomyces. In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of streptomyces can produce doxorubicin. His group has also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into DXR. By 1999, they produced recombinant Dox A, a Cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to daunorubicin. This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin <b>producing</b> <b>strains</b> have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing Dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over-expressed Dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225kg per annum. More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the non-liposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from daunorubicin, the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps and the yield is poor. Since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Microcystis aeruginosa is {{a species}} of {{cyanobacteria}} commonly found {{in a number of}} countries and frequently related to animal poisoning episodes due to its capacity to produce the cyanotoxin known as microcystin. Despite vast literature on microcystin structures and their deleterious effects, little is known about its synthesis by cyanobacteria. Therefore, this study used proteomic tools to compare two M. aeruginosa strains, contrasting them for microcystin production. Results 2 -DE gels were performed and 30 differential protein spots were chosen. Among them, 11 protein spots were unique in the toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain</b> and 8 in the non-toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain,</b> and 14 protein spots were shown on both 2 -DE gels but expressed differently in intensity. Around 57 % of the tandem mass spectrometry identified proteins were related to energy metabolism, with these proteins being up-regulated in the toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain.</b> Conclusions These data suggest that the presence of higher quantities of metabolic enzymes could be related to microcystin metabolism in comparison to the non-toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain.</b> Moreover, it was suggested that the production of microcystin could also be related to other proteins than those directly involved in its production, such as the enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle and glycolysis. </p...|$|R
