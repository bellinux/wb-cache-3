This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of microwave technologies, processing methods and industrial applications. The characteristics of microwave interactions with materials are outlined together with the challenges that difficult to process materials present. To fully realise the potential benefits of microwave and hybrid processes, it is essential to scale-up process and system designs to large batch or continuous processes. This necessitates computational modelling and simulation, system design and integration and a critical assessment of the costs and benefit analysis. Impediments to industrial applications are identified and development opportunities that take advantage of unique performance characteristics of microwaves are discussed. Clearly, advantages in utilising microwave technologies for <b>processing</b> <b>materials</b> include penetrating radiation, controlled electric field distribution and selective and volumetric heating. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to help guide those interested in using microwaves to improve current <b>materials</b> <b>processing.</b> Microwave fundamentals are described to provide a brief awareness of the advantages and limitations of microwaves in the <b>processing</b> of <b>materials.</b> Furthermore, the limitations in current understanding are included as a guide for potential users and for future research and development activities.
