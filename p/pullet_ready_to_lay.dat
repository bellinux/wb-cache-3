6000|$|... "Hear ye that?" [...] exclaimed Ludlow, {{a little}} above a whisper. [...] "'Tis the brigantine, gybing his main-boom! Give way, men--see all <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> him aboard!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know this}} seems a hard doctrine. People are always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> their misfortunes on God, on the world, on any and every one, {{rather than on}} themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever I felt, {{it could}} not alter my belief--my {{assurance}} that a country whose sons are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down their lives in her defence will win a new vision because of their sacrifice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{swear to}} that much," [...] {{returned}} Bob, resuming his seat like {{one who had}} settled the whole affair to his entire satisfaction; [...] "and now, friend Harris, if you are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> bare your mind, I'm just as <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> look at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I never died exactly," [...] said Mary, [...] "but I come blamed near it once. They thought I {{was dead}} and they were getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> me out when I up and come to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{with me to}} Barton's point," [...] I said, {{now grown}} eager through {{understanding}} that Hiram was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> plans for the rescue, and determined that no loitering of mine should put any obstacle in the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{what every}} yapping cur is, when you hold a stick up at him," [...] said the farrier. [...] "But I'm afraid o' neither man nor ghost, and I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> a fair bet. I aren't a turn-tail cur." ...|$|R
5000|$|Very {{little is}} known of this frogmouth’s {{breeding}} or feeding habits. A female specimen taken on 19 November was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> eggs. [...] The stomach of a specimen taken in the Kelabit Highlands was full of locusts or grasshoppers.|$|R
60|$|When {{these people}} saw {{our men and}} their three boats, they were at a full stop, and once or twice they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down all their loads, and run for it; but ours made signs of peace, and held up a white flag to them.|$|R
60|$|Oh! {{she would}} be humbled again by then, {{she and her father}} too, the proud aristocrats, doomed once more to penury and exile, unless he--de Marmont--came forth like the fairy prince to the beggarmaid with hands laden with riches, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> these {{at the feet of the}} woman he loved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Blakeney," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "God {{knows you}} have perplexed me, so that I do not know which way my duty lies. Tell me what you wish me to do. There are {{nineteen}} of us <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down our lives for the Scarlet Pimpernel if he is in danger." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hanks {{was ordained}} a Patriarch in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and {{was known for}} his {{obedience}} to church leaders. President Brigham Young said that Hanks ... was a man always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down his life for the authorities of the Church {{as well as for the}} cause of Zion and her people. (Richard K. Hanks, pp. 2627.) ...|$|R
6000|$|MARCHBANKS (with lyric rapture.) Because {{she will}} {{understand}} me, {{and know that}} I understand her. If you keep back one word of it from her--if you are not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> the truth at her feet as I am--then you will know {{to the end of}} your days that she really belongs to me and not to you. Good-bye. (Going.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I detest rebels. These subversive minds! These {{intellectual}} debauches! My existence {{has been}} built on fidelity. It's a feeling. To defend it I am <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down my life--and even my honour--if that were needed. But pray tell me what honour can there be as against rebels--against people that deny God Himself--perfect unbelievers! Brutes. It is horrible to think of." ...|$|R
50|$|They differ too, {{in their}} life cycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host will bite painlessly and {{generally}} unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> their eggs.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no longer}} a reason why the world should know of such a weakness, though it did exist." [...] And, as the faint glow passed away, leaving her face pale nearly as the hue of death, her eyes kindled with unusual fire, and she added: [...] "They can but take my life, John; and that I am <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down in your service!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See," [...] said Meg, {{coming up}} with a white, half-opened rose, [...] "I thought this would hardly be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> in Beth's hand {{tomorrow}} if she--went away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are young, my son, {{and full}} of enthusiasm; {{but it is hard}} to stir men, whose lives have {{traveled}} in one groove, from their ordinary course. In all our history, although we have been <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> assemble and meet the foe, we have ever been <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> by the sword, when the danger is past, and to return to our homes and families. We have been a nation of fighting men, but never a nation with an army." ...|$|R
40|$|This picture shows President William Howard Taft and First Lady Helen Herron Taft <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> the {{cornerstone}} of Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial on South Bass Island in August 1912. The monument was built between 1912 and 1915 to commemorate Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's victory on Lake Erie over the British fleet in September 1813. It also represented the lasting peace between the U. S., Canada, and England...|$|R
50|$|In 2016, it {{was finally}} {{confirmed}} by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue was medullary bone tissue, like that in modern birds when they are <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> eggs. This also confirmed {{the identity of the}} Tyrannosaurus MOR 1125 as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations.|$|R
50|$|The {{only time}} a flying lizard ventures {{to the ground}} is when a female is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> her eggs. She descends the tree she is on and makes a nest hole by forcing her head into the soil. She then lays 2-5 eggs before filling the hole. She guards the eggs for {{approximately}} 24 hours, but then leaves and has nothing {{more to do with}} her offspring.|$|R
5000|$|The two {{brothers}} Stefan and Zbigniew and their servant Maciej are {{returning home from}} war. While enjoying a parting drink with their comrades, the brothers swear to remain single and {{to live in a}} household free of women, in order <b>to</b> be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down their lives for their country when needed. [...] "For if I married a lovely woman, how could I leave her to go to war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{your husband}} is awk'ard, you know, Bessy," [...] said Mrs. <b>Pullet,</b> good-naturedly <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> use her deep {{depression}} on her sister's account {{as well as her}} own. [...] "He's never behaved quite so pretty to our family as he should do, and the children take after him,--the boy's very mischievous, and runs away from his aunts and uncles, and the gell's rude and brown. It's your bad luck, and I'm sorry for you, Bessy; for you was allays my favorite sister, and we allays liked the same patterns." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{a female}} is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> eggs, she enters the nest and turns {{upside-down}} <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> several hundred <b>to</b> a thousand oval {{eggs in a}} close-packed, single layer attached to the nest’s ‘ceiling’. The male then fertilises the eggs. The female leaves the eggs {{in the care of}} the male, which guards them until they hatch two to four weeks later. Females may <b>lay</b> eggs up <b>to</b> eight times over the spawning season, and one male may defend the eggs of more than one female.|$|R
25|$|The state's {{principal}} {{argument was}} that the plaintiffs raised no substantial federal question because Gobitis settled the constitutional questions raised by the flag-salute expulsions. The state's brief quoted extensively from Justice Frankfurter's Gobitis opinion. Given the clear indications that at least five justices were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> aside the Gobitis precedent, there was little else the state's lawyers could do. The American Legion's amicus curiae brief filed {{in support of the}} state's appeal did little more than duplicate the West Virginia argument.|$|R
50|$|They {{are said}} to {{hibernate}} in the months of June through September, or when their natural environment is not normal, or when in captivity. Little is known about their reproductive behavior. When the female is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> eggs, she digs {{a hole in the}} ground and covers it with grass or other vegetation. The Geometric tortoise tends to feed during cooler parts of the morning and afternoon. They tend to be shy and seek shelter when they notice observers.|$|R
6000|$|Doge. [...] Providence [...] Prolongs my days {{to prove}} and chasten me; [...] 50 [...] But ye {{have no right}} to reproach my length [...] Of days, since every hour has been the Country's. [...] I am <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down my life for her, [...] As I have laid down dearer things than life: [...] But for my dignity--I hold it of [...] The whole Republic: when the general will [...] Is manifest, then you shall all be answered.|$|R
60|$|He was {{of course}} ignorant whether the {{abductor}} would try to carry the princess off by water, or would hide her {{in one of the}} convents of the town; but he was inclined to think that the former would be the course adopted; for the king in his wrath would be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> the town in flames, and to search every convent from top to bottom for the princess. Besides, there would be too many aware of the secret.|$|R
6000|$|Several of {{the most}} eminent ministers, who had been {{expelled}} from their charges, were present on this occasion. Besides John Welsh of Irongray, there were Arnot of Tongland, Blackadder of Troqueer, and Dickson of Rutherglen--godly men who had for many years suffered persecution and imprisonment, and were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down their lives in defence of religious liberty. The price set upon the head of that [...] "notour traitor, Mr. John Welsh," [...] dead or alive, was 9000 merks. Mr. Arnot was valued at 3000! ...|$|R
50|$|A gryph is a {{bird with}} {{four or more}} legs, {{approximately}} {{the size of an}} eagle and has a razor-sharp beak with powerful jaws. It attacks with its bite at high speed from high up in the shadows of an underground cavern. A female <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> its eggs will grapple a victim with its legs and will try to inject its small eggs into the bloodstream, through a thin tube which projects from the bird's abdomen. The eggs hatch within a few days, killing the victim and releasing the baby gryphs.|$|R
50|$|Koreans {{and their}} Ming Chinese allies began pushing south in 1598, {{reclaiming}} territory {{lost to the}} Japanese in the battles of the preceding years. By September, an army of 34,000 Chinese warriors {{under the command of}} Dong Yiyuan 董一元, along with 2000 Korean warriors, was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> siege <b>to</b> the newer, larger Sacheon castle. Murakami Tadazane, commander of the smaller garrison, brought his 300 men to the larger castle, joining up with Shimazu Yoshihiro's force of 8,000, before the Chinese/Korean force began their assault on October 1.|$|R
50|$|Seonbi were {{expected}} to possess the Confucian virtues of filial piety and loyalty to the king, disdain power, wealth and private interest, and be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down one's life to remain faithful to one's principles and to maintain one's integrity. They venerated scholars such as Jeong Mong-ju (who died for his fidelity to Goryeo), the six martyred ministers (who refused to accept Sejo's usurpation of the throne), and Jo Gwang-jo (a reformer who died trying to transform Joseon into an ideal Confucian society) as embodiments of the seonbi spirit and as examples to follow.|$|R
5000|$|In New Guinea the bittern {{is found}} {{seasonally}} in the reed beds of the Waigani Swamp near Port Moresby from November to April, only being reliably recorded {{elsewhere on the}} island from the lowlands of the Trans-Fly region. [...] No firm breeding records are from New Guinea, though a specimen taken in the middle Fly River lagoons was of a bird <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay,</b> indicating breeding in the Fly River marshes in September. [...] The lack of good breeding records suggests {{that at least some}} birds in New Guinea are seasonal migrants from Australia.|$|R
6000|$|... "You would ..." [...] he stammered, then checked himself, turning {{abruptly}} away. He {{had some}} difficulty in hiding the scorn wherewith he regarded the other's coolness. Bourgeois blood {{was not to}} be gainsaid. The tradesman--or banker, whatever he was--who hankered after an alliance with Mademoiselle de Kernogan, and was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> down a couple of millions for the privilege--{{was not to be}} deterred from his purpose by any considerations of pride or of honour. M. le duc was satisfied and re-assured, but he despised the man for his leniency for all that.|$|R
60|$|He {{received}} the deposit in bank-notes {{of the following}} amounts: one fifty-pound note, three twenty-pound notes, six ten-pound notes, and six five-pound notes. His object in drawing the money in this form was <b>to</b> have it <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> out immediately in trifling loans, on good security, among the small tradespeople of his district, {{some of whom are}} sorely pressed for the very means of existence at the present time. Investments of this kind seemed to Mr. Yatman to be the most safe and the most profitable on which he could now venture.|$|R
