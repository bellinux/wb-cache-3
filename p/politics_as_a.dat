5|$|As {{a general}} rule, since that time, {{the armed forces}} have not intervened in <b>politics</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country. In reality, the larger problem has been the misuse and {{sometimes}} abuse {{of the military and}} police by political and ethnic leaders.|$|E
5|$|Other historians regard <b>politics</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{stronger}} factor {{within the}} conclave than pure simony, with the personal rivalvry between Giuliano della Rovere and Ascanio Sforza (who had met {{to discuss the}} upcoming conclave in Castel Gandolfo even before Innocent VII had died) substituting for the ancient struggle between Naples and Milan, with the intractability {{between the two parties}} making Borja a viable candidate.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} {{circles of}} the time were based on divisions in North Korean <b>politics</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. Cho associated himself with the other ethnic Koreans who {{had come from the}} Soviet Union. This literary group was close to the political Soviet Koreans faction.|$|E

5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from <b>politics.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
