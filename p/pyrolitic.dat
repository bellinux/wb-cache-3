30|$|The {{yield of}} organic phase {{is higher in}} pyrolytic oil of Na-soap of RSO (30  %) than that of RSO (21  %).

40|$|The {{presented}} report {{examines the}} origin of the uranium-concentration in <b>pyrolitic</b> carbon, which is deposited on spherical UO_ 2 -fuel kernels. Uranium-concentration-profiles were measured in the outer <b>pyrolitic</b> carbon layer (HDI) by successive mechanical removing and fluorimetrical uranium determination. According to the distribution of the uranium-concentration in the layer and according to annealing tests it was possible to exclude a contamination of the layer by Fick's diffusion of uranium through the coating of the oxide nuclear fuel.

40|$|Analysis of 35 PAH (parental and {{alkylated}} homologues) {{was carried}} out in 11 marine surface sediment samples collected along a central transect in the biggest Galician ría. The samples were collected using a box-core dredge and, after freeze-drying, were kept frozen until analysis. The sediments were then extracted by ASE (Acceleretad Solvent Extraction) and the quantification of PAHs was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with the aid of deuterated PAH internal standards. The total concentration (Σ 35 PAH) measured in all sediment samples ranged from 44. 8 to 7901 ng/g dw, the highest value was found in sediments collected near the harbour and the cleanest positions were found in the outer zone of the ría. To investigate the origin of PAHs, three diferent diagnostic ratios based on isomeric relations were used: Ant/(Ant+Phe), IP/(IP+BghiPer) and BaA/(BaA+Chry) ratios were plotted against Fla/(Fla+Pyr) and a <b>pyrolitic</b> origin was pointed out as the main source. In addition, the relative abundance of alkylated PAHs is useful for source distinction as the presence of higher concentration of alkyl homologues than parent compounds indicates a petroleum source. In this study Phe, Pyr, Chry and PAH alkylated series were considered. Values smaller than 0. 4, 0. 5, 1 and 0. 8 respectively are associated with exclusively <b>pyrolitic</b> sources and values bigger than 2. 5, 0. 9, 2. 5 and 2. 5 are indicative of petrogenic sources. As concluded before, most samples showed a mixed or <b>pyrolitic</b> source and only some ratios (i. e. MChry/Chry) can identify petrogenic evidences in some locations. PAHs can also be formed during diagenetic processes for what perylene {{has been described as a}} good indicator. The ratio Per/penta-aromatic isomer also indicates a pirolityc origen of this compound for most of the locations. Other variables than PAHs, such as grain size distribution and COT were also determined. Values vary from 2. 3 to 86. 5 % of particles < 63 um and from 0. 5 to 3. 5 % for COT. No clear relationship between these variables and the PAH concentrations was found. Two main conclusions can be drawn, first that a gradient can be observed as sediments get cleaner from the river Ulla mouth to the outer zone of the ría and second that most samples showed a mixed or <b>pyrolitic</b> source and only some locations show a less <b>pyrolitic</b> origin, with some diagenetic contributions...|$|E

With this aim in mind, waste engine oil is collected in a tank, and it is purified from contaminants such as dust, heavy carbon soot, metal particles, gum-type materials and other impurities by filtering in the process prepared earlier. To investigate effects of additives known as sodium carbonate (NaCO 3), zeolite and lime (CaO) on density, viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperature, the purified oil samples are blended separately with additives having mass basis of 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 %. The mixed samples are exposed to <b>pyrolitic</b> distillation process to produce fuels to be used in engines. Thermal and physical properties of the produced fuels such as density, flash point, viscosity, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperatures are examined.
