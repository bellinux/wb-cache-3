The BET <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of pure TiO 2 was 18.95 m 2 /g, and the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of pure fullerene was 85.05 m 2 /g. Tungsten oxide particles were introduced into the pores of fullerene, which decreased the BET <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of fullerene-TiO 2 was 64.62 m 2 /g.

The BET <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> decreased from 85.05 m 2 /g for pure fullerene to 57.74 m 2 /g for WO 3 -fullerene/TiO 2.

The lenses or lens groups are coupled with piezoelectric or electro-restrictive, linear drives to provide a position change, whereby an active material <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> undergoing micro-deformation, faces a passive material <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> and whereby a movement of both material sur face areas is triggered with respect to each other.

Therefore, the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the intestinal tract of CD- 1 TM IGS mice was assessed in the present study. The intestinal tracts of 12 mice were collected after euthanasia. From six animals, histological sections from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon–rectum were made according to common stereological principles. Using these sections, the volumes and <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of each intestinal segment were estimated applying stereological counting procedures.

50|$|Accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> is {{a measure}} of the solvent {{exposure}} of individual atoms or residues (measured in square Angstroms). It corresponds to the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of an atom (or residue) that a water molecule can access or touch. In VADAR, the accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> (ASA) for each residue is presented under two different column headers: RES ASA (residue ASA) and FRAC ASA (fractional ASA). The data listed under the RES ASA column refers to the “residue accessible surface areas” as measured in square Angstroms. The data listed under the FRAC ASA column refers to the fractional residue accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> (a value ranging from 0 to 1.0). Exposed, exterior, random coil or hydrophilic residues typically have a large fractional accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> (>0.5), while hydrophobic, beta sheet or interior residues have a small fractional accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> (<0.2). The fractional accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> is calculated by dividing a given residue’s observed accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> by the calculated accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> for that residue in an extended Gly-Xaa-Gly tripeptide (where Xaa is the residue of interest). VADAR reports accessible surface are values both for the entire amino acid residue and for the amino acid side chains. The accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> is also calculated for charged atoms (N, O), polar (N, O, S) atoms and for non-polar atoms (C). This information can be used to calculate charged, polar and non-polar <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> Accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> measurements/estimates are particularly useful in protein structure assessment, protein structure validation and thermodynamic calculations. The values calculated for accessible <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> (ASA) depend critically on the selection or choice of atomic or Van der Waals radii. Different methods and different authors have advocated the use of different atomic radii. As a result, VADAR provides several choices for atomic or Van der Waals radii.|$|R

Spatial heterogeneity in the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> can lead to complications in modelling reactive transport processes, but quantitative characterisation of this property has been limited. In this paper 3 D images obtained using X-ray micro-tomography were used to characterise heterogeneity in <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> in one sandstone and five carbonate rocks. Measurements of average <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> from X-ray imagery were 1 – 2 orders of magnitude lower than measurements from nitrogen BET. A roughness factor, defined as the ratio of BET <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> to X-ray based <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> was correlated {{to the presence of}} clay or microporosity. Co-registered images of Berea sandstone from X-ray and energy dispersive spectroscopy imagery were used to guide the identification of quartz, K-feldspar, dolomite, calcite and clays in X-ray images. In Berea sandstone, clay and K-feldspar had higher average <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> fractions than their volumetric fractions in the rock. In the Edwards carbonate, however, modal mineral composition correlated with <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> By sub-sampling digital images, statistical distributions of the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> were generated at various length scales of subsampling. Comparing these to distributions used in published modelling studies showed that the common practice of leaving <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and pore volume uncorrelated in a pore has lead to unrealistic combinations of <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and pore volume in the models. We suggest these models adopt a moderate correlation based on observations.
