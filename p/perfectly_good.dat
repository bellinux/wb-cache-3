50|$|Less than <b>perfectly</b> {{tradable}} <b>goods</b> {{subject to}} distortions {{such as the}} Penn effect, for example, a lowering of prices in less wealthy place. <b>Perfectly</b> non-tradable <b>goods</b> {{are not subject to}} any leveling of price, thus the disparity between similar parcels of real estate in different locations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perfectly</b> {{tradable}} <b>goods,</b> like {{shares of}} stock, {{are subject to}} the law of one price: they should cost the same amount wherever they are bought. This law requires an efficient market. Any discrepancy that may exist in pricing <b>perfectly</b> tradable <b>goods</b> because of foreign exchange market movements, for instance, is called an arbitrage opportunity. Goods that cannot be costlessly traded are not subject to this law.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} to this {{exchange rate adjustment}} would be an adjustment in prices, with Canadian McDonalds stores compelled to lower prices to remain competitive. Either way, the valuation difference should be reduced assuming perfect competition and a <b>perfectly</b> tradable <b>good.</b> In practice, of course, the Big Mac is not a <b>perfectly</b> tradable <b>good</b> and {{there may also be}} capital flows that sustain relative demand for the Canadian dollar. The difference in price may have its origins in a variety of factors besides direct input costs such as government regulations and product differentiation.|$|R

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be <b>perfectly</b> <b>good.</b> He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E
25|$|In monotheistic thought, God is {{conceived}} of as the Supreme Being and the principal object of faith. The concept of God, as described by theologians, commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (all-knowing), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (<b>perfectly</b> <b>good)</b> and all loving.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how automated traders strategically select marketplaces and submit offers across multiple double auction marketplaces. We model {{the problem as}} a Bayesian game with traders that have continuous private values, and use fictitious play to analyse the traders’ Nash equilibrium market selection and bidding strategies. We do this for different trading environments (isolated, single-home, multi-home and hybrid) and different types of goods (independent, substitutable and complementary). We find that, in an isolated marketplace, the fictitious play algorithm converges to a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. In the single-home setting, all traders eventually converge to the same marketplace and the setting reduces to that of an isolated marketplace. In the multi-home setting with <b>perfectly</b> substitutable <b>goods,</b> buyers with high values only bid in one marketplace, whereas buyers with low values bid in multiple marketplaces. Then, for <b>perfectly</b> complementary <b>goods,</b> only buyers with high values bid in multiple marketplaces and buyers with low values enter no marketplaces. Finally, in the hybrid setting with <b>perfectly</b> complementary <b>goods,</b> traders choose no marketplaces...|$|R

25|$|Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' {{is not a}} bull. It is <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> English to use {{the same}} word in two {{different}} senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for it expresses meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as {{in the case of the}} Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the edges}} of south eastern towns, <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> {{agricultural}} land often remains uncultivated {{as a result of}} price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the housing crisis (see below). It is hard to see when such plots could come back into production.|$|E

Greenfield said, “The stats are enormous—$165 billion worth of food thrown out each year, or about half of all the food we produce—but it’s hard for people to wrap their head around numbers. Seeing a beautiful display of a couple thousand dollars’ worth of <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> food pulled from dumpsters near them does the trick, though".|$|E

30|$|Secondly, <b>perfectly</b> substitutable <b>goods</b> are assumed, {{although}} {{in real life}} supplier offerings may differ in their quality and therefore products may not be perfectly substitutable.

25|$|One {{special case}} {{of this is the}} {{inconsistent}} theory defined by the axiom ∃x ¬x = x. It is a <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem is that it has no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models. It {{is not the same as}} the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.|$|E
25|$|The 1938 {{effort to}} remove the {{building}} {{was the last one}} for 30 years. Various reasons have been suggested for why the Old Post Office Building survived. A common claim is that the federal government, fighting the Great Depression, simply did not have the money. Press reports at the time, however, noted that voters would have punished congressmen who tore down a <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> building. Architectural historians have also argued that President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who took office in March 1933, five years into the Federal Triangle's construction) was not interested in completing the expensive complex of white marble office buildings or making the Federal Triangle architecturally harmonious.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the First Test at Brisbane by 70 runs to go 1–0 {{up in the}} series, but {{the real}} winners were England and Australian cricket. Before the match the press and public had been contemplating a one-sided contest in which a weak England team would be {{overwhelmed}} by Australia, now they had a fighting series on their hands. Few Australians fail to credit a gutsy performance and the stock of the tourists rocketed. It was also apparent that Australia had a chink in their armour as their batting collapsed on a <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> wicket {{on the first day}} and had been badly shown up on the rain-affected wicket on the third, but their bowling remained strong and Jack Iverson (4/43) had justified the selector's confidence in him.|$|E

25|$|Satan {{is deeply}} arrogant, albeit {{powerful}} and charismatic. Satan's persuasive powers are evident throughout the book; {{not only is}} he cunning and deceptive, but he is also able to rally the fallen angels to continue in the rebellion after their agonizing defeat in the Angelic War. He argues that God rules as a tyrant and that all the angels ought to rule as gods. Though commonly understood to be the antagonizing force in Paradise Lost, Satan may be best defined as a tragic or Hellenic hero. According to William McCollom, one quality of the classical tragic hero is that he is not <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> and that his defeat is caused by a tragic flaw, as Satan causes both the downfall of man and the eternal damnation of his fellow fallen angels despite his dedication to his comrades. In addition, Satan's Hellenic qualities, such as his immense courage and, perhaps, lack of completely defined morals compound his tragic nature.|$|E

A journalist for The Huffington Post wrote, [...] "Rihanna is <b>perfectly</b> <b>good</b> at being bad– and this video proves it", while a reviewer for OK! called the video [...] "red-hot, kinky and totally tongue-in-cheek". Willa Paskin of New York similarly {{described it as}} a [...] "goofy" [...] take on the S music videos typical of Madonna and Lady Gaga, while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone described the video as a [...] "visual onslaught of candy-colored kinkiness" [...] that viewers would enjoy despite its bright colors and sexually suggestive activities. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stated that Rihanna delivered the risque video he was expecting based on the song's lyrical content, and Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised the video's [...] "exquisite set pieces that offer a twisted take on hardcore sexuality".|$|E
