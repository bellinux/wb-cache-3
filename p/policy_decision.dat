The DCNR made the <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E

For example, a <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation. Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E

25|$|Multimodality {{also can}} be used to {{associate}} a text with a specific argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a <b>policy</b> <b>decision.</b> Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or bad. If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Following Laker's {{departure}} from BUA, Max Stuart-Shaw was appointed as BUA's new MD. Stuart-Shaw {{was a former}} senior manager at Central African Airways. His brief was to oversee the successful implementation of the board's original <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> taken in the early 1960s to transform BUA into a scheduled airline. Although Laker had largely succeeded in welding the various constituent airlines that made up BUA into a single, integrated enterprise {{towards the end of}} his tenure while ensuring the business remained profitable, it lacked the quality of a frontline scheduled carrier. Despite the growth in scheduled activities during that period, the airline was still perceived as mainly a charter and freight operator. When Stuart-Shaw took over from Laker, he strengthened BUA's management organisation by developing the personnel department, expanding the planning unit, as well as reorganising operations and engineering. He also improved the quality of the airline's marketing. As a result, BUA witnessed a major improvement in the quality of its promotional material and in the number of flights departing on time, making its punctuality record one of the UK airline industry's best.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to try to}} explain if risk {{assessments}} are important at political leaders´ foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> Different qualitative methods are used, and texts and documents are analysed. Prospect theory focuses on decision making under uncertainty, and its applicability is tested on Prime Ministers Göran Persson´s and Fredrik Reinfeldt´s foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> on the peace-generating operations in Afghanistan and Libya. Judging from the empirical material risk assessments were important during all phases of Persson´s foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions,</b> but only during some phases of Reinfeldt´s foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> A plausible explanation of this difference is the Prime Ministers´ different assessments of political gains and losses. Persson assessed that he could achieve political gains in the international arena by his foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions,</b> while Reinfeldt assessed that he could incur political losses in the national arena by his foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> Being in the gains domain Persson´s risk assessments were important during the whole decision process, being in the losses domain Reinfeldt´s risk assessments were only important during some phases of the decision process. The findings of this thesis indicate that the importance of risk assessments at political leaders´ foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> depends on their assessments of political gains and losses. The findings also indicate that prospect theory´s applicability can be successfully tested on small states not directly affected by a conflict...|$|R
40|$|The legal methods {{through which}} one adopts and {{implements}} <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> profoundly affect the compatibility of policy implementation with democratic legitimacy and legal certainty {{of the rule}} of law. Indeed, the choice of legal methods can be as important as the formulation of the policy itself. While a good choice of methods will not heal a bad policy, it can help assure that a less-than-perfect choice of policy can be more forcefully realized than otherwise, it can also help improve the policy choices made and help protect democratic legitimacy and the rule of law. While deficiencies in legislation or in the political system may require resort sometimes to <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> in the course of law application, legislatures should minimize mixing <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> with law application. One of the simplest ways of promoting policy while safeguarding the rule of law is to restrict the effect of <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> to the future.

25|$|However, Howard was {{defeated}} in 2007 and the Labor Party's Kevin Rudd defeated him and Rudd held the office until June 2010, when he was replaced {{as the leader of}} the party. Rudd used his term in office to symbolically ratify the Kyoto Protocol and led an historic parliamentary apology to the Stolen Generation (those Indigenous Australians who had been removed from their parents by the state during the early 20th century to the 1960s). The mandarin Chinese speaking former diplomat also pursued energetic foreign policy and initially sought to instigate a price on carbon, in the Australian economy to combat global warming but which he later reneged on. His prime ministership coincided with the initial phases of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, to which his government responded quickly through a large package of economic stimulus—the management of which later proved to be controversial but effective in somewhat shielding Australia from the Great Recession but this was owed to a number of factors including the Mining Boom and Asia. The Rudd Government also finalised withdrawing troops from Iraq and focused much more on its relationship with Asia, the Government also tried to formalise an agreement to be made at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, but failed. The Government also embarked on a huge infrastructure project, which was to be fraught with trouble, the National Broadband Network (NBN), this project aims to lift average Australian internet speeds to be on par with the rest of the world, however the most major <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> was the cancellation of the Howard Government's Pacific Solution, but as Kevin Rudd cancelled the arrangement, the number of boat arrivals swelled and the death toll rose, so in response to this, the Gillard Government created multiple different solutions, including proposing Malaysian resettlement, but eventually settling on Nauru, Manus Island and East Timor as refugee resettlement options.|$|E

[...] Of the principle that [...] "where there is a wrong {{there must be a}} remedy", he said that the <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> to protect witnesses from litigation had been taken some time ago, without anything being said to cast doubt on the policy choice. [...] He also asked how the rule could be altered to allow negligence claims but not defamation claims, since if there was a well-founded defamation claim barred by witness immunity then a wrong would have been done without remedy in that instance. He said that advocates and experts performed different functions and so it could not be assumed that the fact that advocates' immunity had been removed without difficulty would mean that immunity could be removed from experts without any problems. [...] He was more impressed with the difficulties about where to draw the line if the claim was allowed to proceed than the argument {{that there would be a}} [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the availability of witnesses, wondering what the impact would be for experts involved in criminal proceedings or family cases involving children. He wondered whether a company director, owing a duty of care to the company, would face removal of the immunity if making an [...] "inexcusable error" [...] when giving evidence on the company's behalf. [...] Overall, he considered that the matter was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission. He furthermore noted that the decision in Watson remained binding in Scots law, in preference to the decision in Jones (since Jones only concerned the law of England and Wales), adding that the issue ought also to be considered by the Scottish Law Commission.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of how presidents make foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> Rather than explaining foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> by focusing on individuals or institutions, I stress the role of political pressures and context faced by presidents. It shows that foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> are not merely a reaction to stimulus from the international or domestic arenas but involve political considerations that affect policy choice. The dynamic elements in the argument are political resources and risk. The relationship between the risk propensity {{of the president and}} presidential political resources provides an important link to understanding foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> Within the realm of good public policy, a politically rational president can choose to act or respond to foreign policy disputes in various ways, including diplomacy, political coercion, economic coercion, covert action, or military intervention, based on his assessment of the political context and his willingness to accept the associated risks. The level of presidential political resources determines the risk propensity of the president. Presidential foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions</b> will vary depending on the quantity of available political resources. Thus, understanding the risk propensity of the president increases our ability to explain foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> The contribution of this research is the identification of a mechanism for understanding how the interaction between the domestic and international political environments, and individual decision-makers influence foreign <b>policy</b> <b>decisions.</b> My research bridges the gap between structural theories, ??????theories that make predictions about foreign policy outcomes without reference to the cognition and actions of the actors themselves,?????? and decision-making theories that stress the role of the actors (Ikenberry 2002, 5). Although the component parts of the foreign policy decisionmaking system are widely known, we lack theories that tie the pieces together...|$|R
