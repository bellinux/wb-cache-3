5000|$|The penname [...] "Alberto Savinio" [...] was an [...] "Italianization" [...] of Albert Savine, a minor French {{writer and}} {{translator}} of Oscar Wilde and Thomas De Quincey. Savinio chose this name partly because Savine was a relative {{unknown in the}} literary world. Savinio believed that {{the selection of a}} penname allowed him a moment of self-determination; something in which he could choose his own destiny. For Savinio, being an ethnic and cultural Italian was much like a cultural <b>penname</b> <b>for</b> him.

40|$|Born {{and raised}} in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the Victorian visionary and {{prolific}} writer, George MacDonald, achieved enormous popularity in his own day both as an imaginative storyteller and as an authentic prophetic voice. ―Between 1851 and 1897, ‖ notes Frederick Buechner in the forward to Rolland Hein‘s biography, ―he wrote over fifty books—novels, plays, essays, sermons, poems, fairy tales, not to mention two fantasies for adults (Phantastes, 1858, and Lilith, 1895) that elude the usual categories. ‖ 1 His friendship with Lewis Carroll (the <b>penname</b> <b>for</b> Charles Dodgson) was very close, and he also made friends with such luminaries as Henry Longfellow, Walt Whitman, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Mark Twain, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. At {{the height of his}} popularity in 1872, Macdonald traveled to the United States for a remarkably successful lecture tour in which he addressed huge audiences and ―people flocked to him as prophet, seer, saint, all in one. ‖ 2 But in no way did MacDonald seek popular acclaim or tailor a message in an effort to achieve popularity; to the contrary, he always remained true to a stunning religious vision that, one way or another, expressed itself in virtually all of his writings, lectures, and delivered sermons. It was a stunning and utterly consistent vision of God‘s all-inclusive, allpervasive, and inexorable love. As it happened, MacDonald‘s popularity faded rapidly after his death in 1905.
