50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} and media {{exposure of the}} term nanotechnology, the words <b>picotechnology</b> and femtotechnology have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.|$|E
50|$|Femtotechnology is a {{hypothetical}} term used {{in reference to}} structuring of matter {{on the scale of}} a femtometer, which is 10−15 m. This is a smaller scale in comparison with nanotechnology and <b>picotechnology</b> which refer to 10−9 m and 10−12 m respectively.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{hypothetical}} future level of technological manipulation of matter, {{on the scale}} of trillionths of a meter or picoscale (10&minus;12). This is three orders of magnitude smaller than a nanometer (and thus most nanotechnology) and two orders of magnitude smaller than most chemistry transformations and measurements. <b>Picotechnology</b> would involve the manipulation of matter at the atomic level. A further hypothetical development, femtotechnology, would involve working with matter at the subatomic level.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, <b>picotechnology</b> {{is used by}} some {{researchers}} in nanotechnology {{to refer to the}} fabrication of structures where atoms and devices are positioned with sub-nanometer accuracy. This is important where interaction with a single atom or molecule is desired, because of the strength of the interaction between two atoms which are very close. For example, the force between an atom in an atomic force microscope probe tip and an atom in a sample being studied varies exponentially with separation distance, and is sensitive to changes in position on the order of 50 to 100 picometers (due to Pauli exclusion at short ranges and van der Waals forces at long ranges).|$|E
50|$|Picoscience is a {{term used}} by some futurists to refer to {{structuring}} of matter on a true picometer scale. <b>Picotechnology</b> was described as involving the alteration of the structure and chemical properties of individual atoms, typically through the manipulation of energy states of electrons within an atom to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties, producing some form of exotic atom. Analogous transformations known {{to exist in the}} real world are redox chemistry, which can manipulate the oxidation states of atoms; excitation of electrons to metastable excited states as with lasers and some forms of saturable absorption; and the manipulation of the states of excited electrons in Rydberg atoms to encode information. However, none of these processes produces the types of exotic atoms described by futurists.|$|E
40|$|Inspired from {{biological}} systems, nanotechnology (and more recently, <b>picotechnology)</b> {{is beginning}} to revolutionize medicine including the improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of numerous diseases. This discussion will summarize efforts {{over the past decade}} that ave synthesized novel nanoparticles, nanotubes, and other nanomaterials to improve medicine. Efforts focused on the use of nanomaterials to minimize immune cell interactions, inhibit infection, and increase tissue growth will be especially emphasized. Tissue systems covered will include the nervous system, orthopedics, bladder, cardiovascular, vascular, and the bladder. Materials to be covered will include ceramics, metals, polymers, and composites thereof. Self-assembled nanochemistries will also be emphasized. Lastly, efforts to examine nanoparticle toxicity as well as nanosensors for the real-time monitoring of biological responses in the body will be presented. Thus, this discussion will: • summarize recent advances in novel nanomaterials for medical devices; • emphasize novel properties of nano- and pico-technology derived materials for biosensor applications; and • identify how such materials can be used to decrease inflammation, infection and improve tissue growth...|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{metal oxide}} {{particles}} display their existence {{at the level}} of picomolecules in solution state and bioactive states in the body. We present evidence of picomolar behavior of molecules different than nanomolar behavior of particles. These particles can be encapsulated in polymers and can be functionalized with protein, nucleotides, and drugs to develop as smart intracellular targeting pico-devices. The preparation technique and physiological conditions decide the size and functionality of these pico-carrier devices. Their usable success rate, feasibility and potentials are yet to be proven or we do not know. The major difference between nanodevices and pico-devices is their intermolecular and intramolecular thermodynamics in medium and their molecular conformational interaction with molecular assembly in cytoarchitecture of the neurofilament, actin-myosin, microtubule proteins. Pico-carrier devices can be presumed as potential spears without interacting with host signal transduction and immunoprotection. In conclusion, the ultrafine size of newer <b>picotechnology</b> products may be better suited and easier to functionalize for design of particle based picodrugs, picochemicals, and pico-targeting molecules...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Communication {{bandwidth}} {{has become}} limited to 40 GHz due to electronic switching speed limitation. Available devices operate at 40 GHz and beyond are just prototype models. Even the 40 - 50 GHz switching devices are under constant investigation. Nanotechnology {{has failed to}} cope with ever increasing electronic switching speed demands. Probably we require <b>picotechnology</b> now and femtotechnology in next few years to accelerate the switching speed limits to THz regime through novel photonic or light switches yet to be explored. Optical fibres offer greater than 25 THz bandwidth {{that can not be}} utilized due to obvious reasons. Data communication rate was increased to a few THz level through OTDM/DWDM techniques but EDFA noise, bandwidth-distance product and Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) limitations do not allow to further increase multiple laser wavelengths carriers multiplexing without proportional increase in electronic switching speeds. This paper reviews basics of the electronic and optical communication limitations and proposes thin film integrated optics based photonic strategies to overcome the impounding bottlenecks.

40|$|Ion {{beams of}} {{sufficient}} energy to erode a surface {{can lead to}} surface modulations that depend on the ion beam, the material surface it impinges, and extrinsic parameters such as temperature and geometric boundary conditions. Focused Ion Beam technology both enables site-specific placement of these modulations and expedites research through fast, high dose and small efficient use of material. The DualBeam (FIB/SEM) enables in situ metrology, with movies observing ripple formation, wave motion, {{and the influence of}} line defects. Nanostructures (ripples of > 400 nm wavelength to dots spaced < 40 nm) naturally grow from atomically flat surfaces during erosion, however, a steady state size {{may or may not be}} achieved as a consequence of numerous controlled parameters: temperature, angle, energy, crystallography. Geometric factors, which can be easily invoked using a FIB, enable a controlled component of deposition (and/or redeposition) to occur during erosion, and conversely allow a component of etching to be incurred during (ion-beam assisted) deposition. High angles of ion beam inclination commonly lead to 'rougher' surfaces, however, the extreme case of 90. 0 {sup o} etching enables deposition of organized structures 1000 times smaller than the aforementioned, video-recorded nanostructures. Orientation and position of these picostructures (naturally quantized by their atomic spacings) may be controlled by the same parameters as for nanostructures (e. g. ion inclination and imposed boundary conditions, which are flexibly regulated by FIB). Judicious control of angles during FIB-CVD growth stimulates erosion with directionality that produces surface modulations akin to those observed for sputtering. Just as a diamond surface roughens from 1 -D ripples to 2 -D steps with increasing angle of ion sputtering, so do ripples and steps appear on carbon-grown surfaces with increase in angle of FIB-CVD. Ion beam processing has been a stalwart of the microelectronics industry, is now a vital tool for research of self-organizing nanostructures, and promises to be a focus for future <b>picotechnology...</b>|$|E
