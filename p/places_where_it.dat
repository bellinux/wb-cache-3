5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is native to}} the Americas, and its range {{stretches}} from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas to the central Amazon and southeastern Peru, {{and some of the}} continental islands near Venezuela (such as Trinidad and Tobago). This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100m (109yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The previews of {{the film}} were held at various <b>places,</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was well {{received}} by critics and audiences. Noted writer M. Govindan wrote a cover story in his magazine Sameeksha, and organised a seminar on the film in Chennai, then known as Madras. Various intellectuals and writers took part in it, including noted film experts like P. Bhaskaran and director Balu Mahendra. Noted critic and film director Vijayakrishnan mentioned that Devadas's sound mixing work {{was one of the}} major attractions {{of the film}}. Considerable use of natural sound, apart from background music, was new for Malayalam cinema. Cast performances were also praised by critics. Bharath Gopi received considerable attention even for his minimal screen appearance. Though Madhu had acted previously in several films, including Ramu Kariat's National Award-winning film, Chemmeen (1965), Swayamvaram marked a turning point in his career.|$|E

5|$|Perennial and {{seasonal}} streams often {{are lined with}} live oak and sycamore, which transition into the riparian zones of the main stem Santa Ana River. The inland riparian marshes upstream of the Riverside/Orange County line, although degraded by pollution, have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state. Although much of the riparian system along the river has been degraded, {{one of the largest}} <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> occurs is the enormous marsh behind Prado Dam, an area closed to development because it functions as a flood control basin, similar to the Sepulveda Dam. The Santa Ana sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, once was found throughout riparian zones, but now is rarely seen in the Santa Ana River drainage. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched for miles {{on either side of the}} river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.|$|E

Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations.

25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that true writing of language (not only numbers) was independently conceived and developed {{in at least two}} ancient civilizations and possibly more.

Several Mesoamerican scripts are known, the oldest being from the Olmec or Zapotec of Mexico.|$|E

Large sections on the Church have been translated wholesale from the Collectio Canonum Hibernensis into a section of the Law tract Bretha Nemed. Other overlaps have been suggested, in many cases where biblical references seem to appear in the Brehon law. Where both texts cite the same rule, it is not always clear which came up with the rule first. In addition to substantive law, other legal aspects appear in both, such as the propensity towards use of analogy.|$|E
25|$|Plautus would {{sometimes}} incorporate passages in other languages {{as well in}} <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would suit his characters. A noteworthy example {{is the use of}} two prayers in Punic in Poenulus, spoken by the Carthaginian elder Hanno, which are significant to Semitic linguistics because they preserve the Carthaginian pronunciation of the vowels. Unlike Greek, Plautus most probably did not speak Punic himself, nor was the audience likely to understand it. The text of the prayers themselves was probably provided by a Carthaginian informant, and Plautus incorporated it to emphasize the authenticity and foreignness of Hanno's character.|$|E

25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as {{we have seen in the}} colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E
