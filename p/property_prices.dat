In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership of Ramadan Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the construction market and the overall economy has attracted much attention, but few studies have investigated {{the influence of the}} property market on the construction market in terms of <b>property</b> <b>price.</b> The disaggregated data of Hong Kong’s housing and retail construction sectors are collected to investigate the impact of <b>property</b> <b>price</b> on construction output. The newly developed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the error correction (EC) -based Granger causality test are employed. The bounds testing results suggest that there exist stable long-run relationships between construction output and <b>property</b> <b>price</b> for both housing and retail construction sectors. Specifically, a 1. 00 % increase in the housing price and retail price lead to a 0. 55 % and 0. 42 % increase in construction outputs for the two sectors respectively. In addition, the Granger causality tests confirm a distinct long-run causal flow from <b>property</b> <b>price</b> to construction output. Furthermore, the proposed ARDL approach provides an effective method for forecasting construction output. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|Open space {{may provide}} a variety of {{environmental}} services, such as flood control, prevention of soil erosion, storage and recycling of wastes, and scenic views, which do not have traditional market values. This study assesses {{the value of these}} amenities in Dakota County, Minnesota, by estimating the marginal price of open space proximity to housing, with the hedonic <b>property</b> <b>price</b> method. Utilizing residential housing and open space data, a propertys structural, neighborhood, regional, and environmental characteristics are related to its sale price. Key environmental characteristics are distances between a property and particular types of natural areas and farmland. The marginal price of proximity to open space was estimated with three models that illustrate the relationship between open space proximity and <b>property</b> <b>price.</b> The estimation results suggest that Dakota County homeowners pay, ceteris paribus, a higher <b>property</b> <b>price</b> ($ 115) to live 100 feet closer to any type of open space. Upon categorization of open space into natural areas and farmland, an interesting distinction was discovered: homebuyers paid more ($ 111) to live 100 feet closer to natural areas and less (-$ 53) to live the same distance closer to farmland. Further classification of open space into public lands, forests, prairies, wetlands, and water bodies, yielded varying marginal prices for proximity to these features. Proximity to public lands and forests had a positive relationship with <b>property</b> <b>price</b> ($ 80 and $ 70 respectively), while the marginal price for proximity to farmland remained negative (-$ 66). Living marginally closer to prairies also had a negative association with <b>property</b> <b>price</b> (-$ 48), while nearness to wetlands and water did not have a statistically significant effect. These last three marginal prices are unreliable due to the presence of multicollinearity. Finally, splitting the observations into urban and rural-urban fringe zones showed regional distinctions in the relationship of open space proximity to <b>property</b> <b>price.</b> In urban areas, proximity to publicly owned natural spaces and forests yielded a positive marginal price ($ 127 and $ 62 respectively). In the rural-urban fringe, proximity to forests and water features yielded positive marginal prices ($ 91 and $ 66 respectively). While proximity to farmland, prairies and wetlands was considered undesirable in the urban zone (with marginal prices -$ 102, -$ 55, -$ 63), nearness to these same features in the rural-urban fringe has a statistically insignificant relationship to <b>property</b> <b>price.</b> Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
