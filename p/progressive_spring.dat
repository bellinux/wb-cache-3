50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot {{provide a}} <b>progressive</b> <b>spring</b> rate.

This marked the first use of four-valve-per-cylinder heads and DOHC in the 944 series, derived from the 928 S4 featuring a redesigned camshaft drive, a magnesium intake tract/passages, magnesium valve cover, larger capacity oil sump, and revised exhaust system. The alternator capacity was 115 amps. The wheel bearings were also strengthened and the brake servo action was made more powerful. Floating 944 calipers were standard, but the rear wheel brake circuit pressure regulator from the 944 turbo was used. Small '16 Ventiler' script badges were added on the sides {{in front of the}} body protection mouldings. Performance was quoted as 0 - 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds (Best) and a 232 km/h top speed due to a 2857 lb weight.

40|$|Off-road {{and racing}} {{motorcycles}} require a particular setup of the suspension {{to improve the}} comfort {{and the safety of}} the rider. Further, due to ground unevenness, off-road motorcycle suspensions usually experience extreme and erratic excursions in performing their function. In this regard, the adoption of nonlinear devices, such as <b>progressive</b> <b>springs</b> and hydro pneumatic shock absorbers, can help limiting both the acceleration experienced by the sprung mass and the excursions of the suspensions. For dynamic analysis purposes, this option involves the solution of the nonlinear differential equations that govern the motion of the motorcycle, which is excited by the stochastic road ground profile. In this study a 4 degrees-of-freedom (4 -DOF) nonlinear motorcycle model is considered. The model involves suspension elements with asymmetric behaviour. Further, it is assumed that the motorcycle is exposed to loading of a stochastic nature as it moves with a specified speed over a road profile defined by a particular power spectrum. It is shown that a meaningful analysis of the motorcycle response can be conducted by using the technique of statistical linearization. The validity of the proposed approach is established by comparison with results from pertinent Monte Carlo studies. In this context the applicability of auto-regressive (AR) filters for efficient implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation is pointed out. The advantages of these methods for the synthesis of excitation signals from a given power spectrum, are shown by comparison with other methods. It is shown that the statistical linearization method allows the analysis of multi-degree-of-freedom (M-DOF) systems that present strong nonlinearities, exceeding other nonlinear analysis methods in both accuracy and applicability. It is expected that the proposed approaches, can be used for a variety of parameter/ride quality studies and as preliminary design tool by the motorcycle industry...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis a method is derived and presented, for the efficient analysis of the steady state response of dynamic systems with time variant propenies. The method is especially attractive for the simulation of the steady state response of lightly damped systems with low numbers of degree of freedom which are forced by a periodic excitation. A major feature of the method is that the system non-linearities can be successfully modelled as time variant propenies. An ideal application for this approach is the calculation of the dynamic response of a modal model for <b>progressive</b> valve <b>springs</b> in the frequency domain. The solution method is explained and derived using this example. The differences, drawbacks, and advantages are assessed by comparison with both a linear modal model and a discrete time-domain model; correlation with actual measurement is also shown. The extreme efficiency of the method allows its application in a more general study of the dynamic propenies of valve springs. This analysis is initially discussed and examined using statistical methods. Then the frequency domain solution method is employed to perform an automatic optimization of the spring frequency characteristic for a 16 valve prototype engine application. The spring design obtained from this study has been manufactured and the resulting hardware is discussed. The measured response of this hardware is compared with simulation results for the same configuration, verifying the fmdings from the statistical investigation and the optimization. Finally open issues and further envisaged work {{in the area of}} damping mechanisms in valve springs and manufacturing issues are diScussed and an approach for the next steps to take is outlined...|$|R
40|$|Since 2009, the ultra-wideband snow radar on Operation IceBridge (OIB; a NASA {{airborne}} {{mission to}} survey the polar ice covers) has acquired data in annual campaigns conducted during the Arctic and Antarctic <b>springs.</b> <b>Progressive</b> improvements in radar hardware and data processing methodologies have led to improved data quality for subsequent retrieval of snow depth. Existing retrieval algorithms differ {{in the way the}} air–snow (a–s) and snow–ice (s–i) interfaces are detected and localized in the radar returns and in how the system limitations are addressed (e. g., noise, resolution). In 2014, the Snow Thickness On Sea Ice Working Group (STOSIWG) was formed and tasked with investigating how radar data quality affects snow depth retrievals and how retrievals from the various algorithms differ.

40|$|Climate plays a {{fundamental}} role in limiting {{the range of}} a species, is a key factor in the dynamics of large herbivores, and is thought to be involved in declines of moose populations in recent decades. We examined effects of climate and growing-season phenology on recruitment (8 – 9 months old) of young Shiras moose (Alces alces shirasi) over three decades, from 18 herds, across a large geographic area encompassing much of the southern extent of their range. Recruitment declined in 8 of 18 herds during 1980 – 2009, whereas others did not exhibit a temporal trend (none showed a positive trend). During those three decades, seasonal temperatures increased, spring–summer precipitation decreased, and spring occurred earlier, became shorter in duration, and green-up occurred faster. Recruitment was influenced negatively by warm temperatures during the year before young were born, but only for herds with declining recruitment. Dry spring–summers of the previous year and rapid rates of spring green-up in the year of birth had similar negative influences across declining and stable herds. Those patterns indicate both direct (yeart) and delayed (yeart− 1) effects of weather and plant phenology on recruitment of young, which we hypothesize was mediated through effects on maternal nutritional condition. Suppressed nutrition could have been induced by (1) increased thermoregulatory costs associated with warming temperatures and (2) shortened duration of availability of high-quality forage in <b>spring.</b> <b>Progressive</b> reductions in net energetic gain for species that are sensitive to climate may continue to hamper individual fitness and population dynamics...|$|R
5000|$|Released in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a {{four-wheel drive}} one tenth scale short-course {{electric}} race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato {{was introduced in}} 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and axle carriers, otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length double wishbone suspension with four oil filled coilover shocks and <b>progressive</b> rate <b>springs</b> in staggered lengths ("long" [...] up front; [...] "XXlong" [...] in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same [...] "Velineon 3500" [...] 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and [...] "Velineon VXL-3S" [...] non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the M4 layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper clutch, the main one piece hollow aluminum drive shaft. The drive shaft sends power {{to the front and}} rear viscous limited slip differentials, which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping half shafts. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, nerf bars, and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A tires with white lettering, 2.2 inch satin chrome beadlock style [...] "SCT" [...] wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque steering servo, Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and hex hardware used throughout.

Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct [...] "drop in" [...] replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} advance in small car design was the 1959 848 cc FF layout Austin Mini from the British Motor Corporation, {{designed}} by Alec Issigonis {{as a response}} to the first oil crisis, the 1956 Suez Crisis, and the boom in bubble cars and Microcars that followed. It was the first front-wheel-drive car with a water-cooled in-line four-cylinder engine mounted transversely - the BMC A-Series engine. This allowed eighty percent of the floor plan for the use of passengers and luggage. The majority of modern cars use this configuration. Its <b>progressive</b> rate rubber <b>sprung</b> independent suspension (Hydrolastic 1964-1971), low centre of gravity, and wheel at each corner with radial tyres, increased the car's grip and handling over all but the most expensive automobiles on the market. The Mini was voted the second most important car of the 20th century after the Ford Model T. Badge engineered luxury versions with modified bodywork and wood and leather interiors were made under the names of Riley Elf and Wolesely Hornet. Customised versions were made by coach-builders like Harold Radford, and were very popular with the rich and famous of 1960s London. From 1964 a Jeep like version (that had been rejected by British Armed Forces), of the Mini, the Mini Moke was popular with the King's Road / Carnaby Street, Swinging London set. An Estate car / station-wagon (with a non-structural wood frame 'Countryman' version), a Van and Pick-up versions were also successful. In 1962, a slightly larger 1098cc (and later 1256cc) version of the Mini engineering design was launched, as the Austin/Morris 1100. It had front disc brakes as standard. It had Italian styling by Pininfarina and used front-to-rear interconnected independent Hydrolastic suspension. It was available in sporting MG versions, and luxury wood and leather interior Riley, Wolesely and Vanden Plas versions. It was for most of the 1960s, the top selling car in Britain, and was sold until the mid-1970s. It was sold as the Austin America in the U.S., Canada, and Switzerland between 1968 and 1972. It was also sold in South Africa - Austin Apache and Spain - Austin Victoria, with Triumph type Michelotti re-styling, built in local factories.BMC had hedged their bets after the launch of the front wheel drive Mini and 1100 and to meet the demands of more conservative customers, by keeping their rear wheel drive Austin A40 Farina in production until 1967 and Morris Minor until 1971, while front wheel drive was being accepted by the UK and European markets. Demand from older customers in particular kept the Minor in production, despite it being very outdated.|$|R
