2500|$|Microlepidoptera can {{be found}} in a broad variety of {{habitats}} and ecological niches worldwide, both terrestrial and freshwater aquatic (e.g. Acentropinae). [...] They have a wide variety of feeding habits in both larval and adult life stages. Caterpillars feed on a wide variety of plant tissue and across a wide spectrum of plant groups from liverworts to angiosperms. They are either external feeders ("exophagous") or more usually feed internally ("endophagous"), typically as miners or tunnellers, but some feed on fungi, scavenge on dead animals, are parasitoids usually of other insects (some Zygaenoidea) or are detritivores, and Hyposmocoma molluscivora even feeds on live snails. Adult moths feed with mandibles on spores and pollen (Micropterigidae) on dew (e.g. Eriocraniidae), with their proboscises on nectar (many groups e.g. Choreutidae) or are simply nonfeeding with mouthparts reduced or absent. The larvae of many smaller moths are considered economic pests, causing damage to plants, as well as fabrics and other man-made goods. Commonly noticed [...] "micros" [...] include the <b>plume</b> <b>moth</b> and the various species of clothes moth.|$|E

5000|$|The Pterophoridae or <b>plume</b> <b>moths</b> are {{a family}} of Lepidoptera with unusually {{modified}} wings.

50|$|The {{forewings}} of <b>plume</b> <b>moths</b> usually {{consist of}} two curved spars with {{more or less}} bedraggled bristles trailing behind.

50|$|The Tineodidae {{or false}} <b>plume</b> <b>moths</b> are {{a family of}} moths with in some cases unusually {{modified}} wings: Like in some related moths, the wings of several Tineodidae are decomposed into several rigid spines. This is a small family, with about a global total of 20 species described to date; some undescribed species are known or suspected to exist however. They seem to be of Australian origin, where they are most diverse, but range through the Wallacea to Southeast and South Asia, and into the Pacific to the Marquesas Islands.|$|R
5000|$|Aluctoidea is the {{superfamily}} of many-plumed {{and false}} <b>plume</b> <b>moths.</b> These small moths are most easily recognized by their wings. These each consist of many (typically more than 3) narrow strips of membrane around the major veins, {{instead of a}} continuous sheet of membrane between the veins. In living moths in the wild, this is often hard to see however. When they are at rest, the [...] "plumes" [...] partly overlap, appearing as solid wings. But even then, they can be recognized by the wings having a marked lengthwise pattern and uneven edge.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though they}} are [...] "micromoths", the Aluctoidea are not {{especially}} primitive Lepidoptera; the sizable carpenter moths (Cossidae) {{as well as the}} butterflies are not particularly distant relatives. The closest living relatives of the Aluctoidea, however, seem to be the <b>plume</b> <b>moths</b> (Pterophoroidea), which like the many-plumed moths have wings consisting each of several narrow straps (though less strikingly so than in the Aluctoidea). However, the taxonomic treatment of the many-plumed moths among the Ditrysia is disputed, mostly because of their unclear relationship to the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea).|$|R

5000|$|Platyptilia gonodactyla, {{common name}} {{triangle}} <b>plume,</b> is a <b>moth</b> {{of the family}} Pterophoroidea.|$|R
5000|$|These moths {{are usually}} small (with wingspans around 1-2 cm/less than 1 inch) and {{brownish}} in color. They have large compound eyes, thread-like antennae, and prominent labial palps. The body is slender, and the legs bear large spines.. The amount of wing modification varies in this family. Some genera (e.g. Cenoloba, Oxychirota and Tanycnema) resemble <b>plume</b> <b>moths</b> (superfamily Pterophoroidea), hence the common name [...] "false plume moths". Others have little- or almost unmodified wings, {{and in some}} cases (e.g. Tineodes) at a casual glance look like snout moths (family Pyralidae). The forewings may be simply drawn out to a slim point, or deeply divided into two narrow lobes. The hindwings are typically quite short, and may also be divided into two lobes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of this family}} is somewhat disputed. Here, they are united in superfamily Alucitoidea with the Tineodidae, {{a diverse group of}} numerous small genera with about 20 species altogether. However, the two supposed Alucitoidea families may be polyphyletic with regard to each other, and Tineodidae better included in Alucitidae. In any case, the similar-looking <b>plume</b> <b>moths</b> (Pterophoroidea) are widely held to be very close, if not the closest living relatives of the Alucitoidea. Earlier, many authors assumed that the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea) were also very closely related to the Alucitidae (and the fringe-tufted moths, Epermeniidae) [...] - [...] according to some, closer in fact than the Pterophoroidea and even the Tineodidae. In this Alucitoidea do not exist; Alucitidae and Tineodidae are assigned to different (but still most closely related) superfamilies. In the treatment here, the Copromorphoidea are presumed to be the most advanced of these lineages of small but fairly [...] "modern" [...] moths, while the Alucitoidea and Pterophoroidea are more primitive.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate between pupa, chrysalis and cocoon. The pupa is the stage between the larva and adult stages. The chrysalis generally refers to a butterfly pupa although the term may be misleading as there are some moths whose pupae resembles a chrysalis, e.g.: the <b>plume</b> winged <b>moths</b> of the family Pterophoridae and some geometrid moths. A cocoon is a silk case that moths, and sometimes other insects, spin around the pupa.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{exceptions}} to this rule, however. [...] For example, the hawk moths form an exposed pupa which is underground. Gypsy moths sometimes form butterfly-style pupae, hanging on twigs or tree bark, although usually they create flimsy cocoons out of silk strands and a few leaves, partially exposing the pupa. The <b>plume</b> winged <b>moths</b> of the family Pterophoridae also pupates without a cocoon and the pupa resembles the chrysalis of the pierid butterfly. A few skipper butterfly larvae also make crude cocoons in which they pupate, exposing the pupa a bit. The Parnassius butterfly larvae make a flimsy cocoon for pupation and they pupate near the ground surface between debris.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A mobile {{autonomous}} robot {{capable of tracking}} an odor plume to its source {{could be used to}} locate hazardous material spills or leaks. To test plume tracking strategies in a laboratory environment, a robotic platform consisting of a linear Cartesian robotic gantry mounted inside a wind tunnel with a mobile floor has been designed. A plume of ionized air is created by an ion detector installed in the wind tunnel. A twodimensional plume tracking strategy based on the behavior of the tobacco hornworm moth Manduca sexta was implemented and tested. It was discovered that a plume tracking algorithm can be implemented with the robotic platform almost as easily as in simulation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the plume {{structure of a}} piezo-electric sprayer system, set up to release ethanol in a wind tunnel, using a fast response mini-photoionizaton detector. We recorded the plume structure of four different piezo-sprayer configurations: the sprayer alone; with a 1. 6 -mm steel mesh shield; with a 3. 2 -mm steel mesh shield; and with a 5 cm circular upwind baffle. We measured a 12 ?×? 12 -mm core {{at the center of}} the plume, and both a horizontal and vertical cross-section of the plume, all at 100 -, 200 -, and 400 -mm downwind of the odor source. Significant differences in plume structure were found among all configurations in terms of conditional relative mean concentration, intermittency, ratio of peak concentration to conditional mean concentration, and cross-sectional area of the plume. We then measured the flight responses of the almond moth, Cadra cautella, to odor plumes generated with the sprayer alone, and with the upwind baffle piezo-sprayer configuration, releasing a 13 : 1 ratio of (9 Z, 12 E) -tetradecadienyl acetate and (Z) - 9 -tetradecenyl acetate diluted in ethanol at release rates of 1, 10, 100, and 1, 000 pg/min. For each configuration, differences in pheromone release rate resulted in significant differences in the proportions of moths performing oriented flight and landing behaviors. Additionally, there were apparent differences in the moths’ behaviors between the two sprayer configurations, although this requires confirmation with further experiments. This study provides evidence that both pheromone concentration and <b>plume</b> structure affect <b>moth</b> orientation behavior and demonstrates that care is needed when setting up experiments that use a piezo-electric release system to ensure the optimal conditions for behavioral observations. <br/...|$|R
