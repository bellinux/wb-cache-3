40|$|Crack {{growth and}} crack path under a {{fracture}} mechanical experiment in polycarbonate is studied. The material, a polycarbonate, is <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> witch {{makes it possible}} to do an optical stress field analysis. The crack path and crack branching is also predicted by an adaptive finite element analysis. The crack growth is a result of stress induced, chemically activated material dissolution that completely determines the geometry of the specimen, including the shape and length of the crack. In this case, the mechanisms and processes leading to crack growth are assumed to be incorporated in a general material dissolution process. As a consequence of this assumption {{there is no need for}} a crack criterion or crack path hypothesis. The lack of crack path criterion imposes an arbitrary length scale where the crack width scales with the square of the applied load but the crack growth rate is independent of the load. Numerical calculations suggest that the crack is capable of branching and that the branches will continue to grow at the same rate as the original crack. The numerical results are verified by the <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> experiments and a reasonable agreement is established...|$|E

Through the proper design of the substrate, we guided the differentiation of human healthy and dystrophic myoblasts into myotubes exhibiting marked functional differentiation and highly defined sarcomeric organization. A thin film of <b>photo</b> cross-linkable <b>elastic</b> poly-acrylamide hydrogel with physiological-like and tunable mechanical properties (elastic moduli, E: 12, 15, 18 and 21 kPa) was used as substrate. The functionalization of its surface by micro-patterning in parallel lanes (75 mu m wide, 100 mu m spaced) of three adhesion proteins (laminin, fibronectin and matrigel (R)) was meant to maximize human myoblasts fusion. Myotubes formed onto the hydrogel showed a remarkable sarcomere formation, with the highest percentage (60. 0 % +/- 3. 8) of myotubes exhibiting sarcomeric organization, of myosin heavy chain II and alpha-actinin, after 7 days of culture onto an elastic (15 kPa) hydrogel and a matrigel (R) patterning.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{resistance}} to fracture of endodontically treated teeth restored with esthetic post systems has not been extensively researched. This in vitro study compared the fracture patterns of endodontically treated teeth with esthetic post systems with different analysis methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 26 recently extracted human maxillary central incisors were decoronated and then endodontically treated. Teeth were restored with quartz fiber posts. All posts were cemented with Panavia dual curing adhesive resin cement and subsequently restored with composite cores. Three methods were used to test fracture resistance. Each specimen was embedded in acrylic resin and then secured in a universal load-testing machine. A compressive load was applied at 135 º degree angle at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min to the long axis of the tooth until fracture occurred. The two other methods, finite element analysis (FEA) and <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> study used the same angulation and 90 N force to simulate the first method. The data were then compared. RESULTS: Clinical results indicated that fracture was most likely to occur between core and dentin, {{and then in the}} cervical 1 / 3 of the root. <b>Photo</b> <b>elastic</b> study demonstrated similar results; the highest stresses occurred at the junction of dentin and core contralateral to the side where force was applied.

40|$|Among the {{different}} techniques available {{to study the}} molecular structure, chiral spectroscopy is a fast, reliable method, where molecules can be investigated in the liquid phase. Chiral spectroscopy is based on optical activity. A molecule {{is said to be}} optically active if it interacts differently with left- and right-circular polarised light. The difference of absorption between the two circular states is referred to as circular dichroism (CD), whereas the difference of refraction is known as optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). Because the optical activity finds its origin in asymmetry, it is directly dependent of the molecular geometry. Probing optically active vibrational transitions allows to retrieve even more structural information as infrared spectra are usually more resolved than electronics ones. Extension of this technique to the recording of time-resolved chiral vibrational signals may enable the dynamics of conformation changes in biomolecules such as peptides and proteins to be followed with unprecedented details. Toward this goal, we report the first pulsed laser set-up capable of recording both static infrared CD and ORD spectra and photo-induced changes in vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) with picosecond time resolution. A femtosecond laser system is synchronized to a <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> modulator to produce alternating left- and right-circular polarised mid-IR pulses. Transient changes in vibrational circular dichroism of the CH-stretch vibrations of the cobalt-sparteine complex Co(sp) Cl 2 are presented in a first proof-of-principle experiment. Both static and transient vibrational chiral spectroscopy suffer two important drawbacks: Chiral signals are usually small and sensitive to polarisation-based artefacts, which mainly originate from the interaction between an imperfect probe beam polarisation and a non isotropic sample. We report on a new scheme for synchronizing the laser system and the <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> modulator which generates almost perfect probe polarisation states. The technique reduces possible polarisation-based artefacts and allows multichannel detection of the chiral signals normally obscured by polarisation sensitive optics of the monochromator. To increase signal size, a self-heterodyning configuration is implemented where a part of the probe pulse acts as a phase-locked local oscillator heterodyning the chiral signal. The technical improvements presented in this thesis should open the door to measurements of transient vibrational chiral spectra of biomolecules...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis report {{concerns}} {{the difficulties in}} generating and measuring small forces properly. In fact, no direct force realization linked to the International System of Units (SI) below 1 N has ever been carried out.

Finally, {{it is very difficult}} to evaluate the uncertainties both for the measured value of the small force and for the time of the measurement. To generate a very small force in a controlled way, one needs to know its point of application, direction and intensity.

It showed uniaxiality at low voltage but changed to biaxiality parallel to the electric field at high voltage in the conoscopic experiment. The absolute value of the biaxiality was quite high, up to 0. 003, which means that the unwinding process of SmC*(alpha) is different from that of SmC*.

A {{new method}} of {{determining}} the stress-strain state of the rocks without dropping its individual parts {{on the basis of}} combination of observations of the dynamics of piezometric level in special hydrogeological wells of pre-planned network and by the change in the diameter of wells measured by <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> sensors is proposed. With the beginning of the formation of the stress-strain state of the geological environment, the chaotic structure of hydro-geodynamic field(HGD-field) goes into the abnormal condition of a certain form, in accordance with the geometric shape and sizes of the geological structure. Closed lines of equal abnormal values of piezometric levels form geometric circular structures in the Central parts of which are observed their most anomalous values corresponding to the greatest extent of stressstrain state of rock massif. Within abnormal (disturbed) HGD-field is carried out the measurement of the diameters of the wells, fixed by photoelastic sensors which clarify the concrete stress-strain plot (voltages source) of the rock massif. Well drilled for measuring by photoelastic sensors of changes in their diameters, are arranged in the rock massif in a staggered manner, and the special hydrogeological well, drilled up to an isolated water system for the registration of anomalous (perturbed) HGD-field are locatedin two mutually perpendicular profiles, taking into account the geometric shape of the monitored rock mass.

The long twisted blades of gas turbine blade will be treated as infinite plate with oblique holes/cooling holes constituting a geometrically complex, three- dimensional body that is subjected to the action of systems centrifugal force. Stress concentration and stress field around oblique holes is a major challenge area in design of aerofoil in aerospace applications for safety because of their highly specialized applications in aerospace field under severe operating conditions.

The advanced LIGO project is ongoing an upgrade to increase the detection sensitivity {{by more than a}} factor of 10, which will make the events detection a routine occurrence. In addition to using higher power lasers, heavier test mass, and better isolation systems, several new designs and techniques are proposed in the long-term upgrade, such as modifying the optics configuration to reduce the quantum noise, active noise cancellation of the Newtonian noise, optimizing the coating structure, and employing non-Guassian laser beams etc. In the first part of my thesis (Chapters 2 and 3), I apply statistical mechanics and elastostatics to the LIGO coated mirrors, and study the thermal fluctuations that dominate advanced LIGO’s most sensitive frequency band from 40 Hz to 200 Hz. In particular, in Chapter 2, I study the so-called coating Brownian noise, fluctuations of mirrors coated with multiple layers of dielectrics due to internal friction. Assuming coating materials to be isotropic and homogeneous, I calculate the cross spectra of Brownian fluctuations in the bulk and shear strains of the coating layers, as well as fluctuations in the height of the coating-substrate interface. The additional phase shifting and back-scattering caused by <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> effects are also considered for the first time. In Chapter 3, I study whether it is realistic to adopt higher-order Laguerre-Gauss modes in LIGO, in order to mitigate the effect of mirror thermal noise. We investigate the effect on the detector’s contrast defect caused by the mode degeneracy. With both analytical calculation and numerical simulation, we show that with this approach, the detector’s susceptibility to mirror figure errors is reduced greatly compared to using the nondegenerate modes, therefore making it unacceptable for LIGO requirements. For the future GW detectors, with much lower noises and higher sensitivity, this might be used to investigate the quantum behaviors of macroscopic mechanical objects. In recent years the linear optomechanical systems with cavity modes coupling to a mechanical oscillator have been studied extensively. In the second part of my thesis (Chapter 4), I study the interaction between a single photon and a high-finesse cavity with a movable mirror, in the so-called strong coupling regime, where the recoil of the photon can cause significant change in the momentum of the mirror.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Several {{authors have}} {{reported}} evidence of loosening of the acetabular component in 14 per cent of cases at 10 years follow-up. To understand this phenomena, parametric {{studies of the}} acetabulum have involved finite element analysis, <b>photo</b> <b>elastic</b> models or strain gauges. The differing and sometimes contradictory results were due {{to the way the}} model was solicited. If the classic "Resultant" is accurate {{for the study of the}} forces on the hip, Pauwels described other forces on the pelvis during the gait. The effect of the application of these other forces on the acetabulum are the object of this study. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Four pelvises were loaded with different forces. Nine strain gauges were pasted around the acetabulum. The pelvis was loaded up to 140 Kg and a compressive force was applied to the pubis by 10 Kg increments up to 40 Kg. The stress data with and without the second force were recorded. A cortical window was bored on the anterior inferior iliac spine. Through this patch, the trabecular bone of the acetabular roof was cut up to disturb its mechanical properties. The load was once again applied to the pelvis and the stress data recorded. RESULTS: The compressive force applied to the symphyseal surface decreases the deformation of the posterior acetabular rim and increases deformation in the proximity of the ischio-iliac and iliopubic junctions. The disruption of trabecular bone generates an increase in deformation mainly perpendicularly to the acetabular rim. DISCUSSION: The decrease of the stress on the posterior acetabular rim is interpreted as a reduction of the solicitations on a fragile zone and its increase on the iliopubic and ischio iliac junctions expresses the application of the acetabular horn on the femoral head permitting better settling of the hip during the gait. The constatation of a stress increase around the acetabulum after disruption of the traecbular bone is interesting. The bone behavior with different acetabular cup models on different pelvis may be studied by strain gauges pasted on the cortical bone. The variable quality of the trabecular bone may introduce an error factor in the measurement. CONCLUSION: The deformation of the acetabulum during gait has to be studied following the different forces described by Pauwels. The compressive force on the pubic symphysis during one leg stance permits a decrease of the stress on the acetabular rim and an increase in the setting of the femoral head. Different qualities of trabecular bone change the deformation of the cortical bone for an equivalent load. This incites us, in comparative studies, to be careful in the deduction of the acetabular roof stresses from the recorded cortical bone deformations.
