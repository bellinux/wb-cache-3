The efficiency in terms of vibration reduction of the optimized profile reliefs was checked using a one degree of freedom dynamic model. This dynamic model considers time varying mesh stiffness, backlash, and profile error. In the original paper the effect of intentional <b>profile</b> <b>modifications</b> was considered as part of the mesh stiffness, thus overestimating their effect in vibration reduction.

Symmetric tip relief on external and internal gear meshes are introduced as normal deviations {{along the lines of}} contact superimposed on a stiffness distribution aimed at simulating position- and time-varying mesh stiffness functions. The equations of motion are solved by the combination of a Newmarkâ€™s time-step integration scheme and a contact algorithm to account for possible partial or total contact losses.

After validating the reflectometer density profiles with other density profile diagnostics in easily diagnosed and well understood plasma conditions, detailed reflectometer density profile measurements in plasmas with application of ICRF, LH and ICRF+LH power will be shown {{in order to understand the}} physical mechanisms for RF-induced density <b>profile</b> <b>modifications.</b> Results indicate that both ICRF and LH power create significant poloidal density profile asymmetries that are correlated with video camera emissivity measurements. These results will be shown to depend on various plasma parameters such as launched nll of the LH waves, ICRF antenna location, and toroidal magnetic field direction. Both LH and ICRF power have been experimentally observed to modify the poloidal flow in the SOL. These flows are reminiscent of LH and ICRF induced convective cells that have been discussed in the literature. A 2 -D diffusive-convective model has been applied to quantify the effects of these RF-induced ExB drifts on the SOL density profiles. For the LH case, the simulation reproduces the experimental trends at all three reflectometer poloidal locations adjacent to the LH launcher and indicates that LH-induced ExB drifts is the dominant physical mechanism producing the experimentally measured density <b>profile</b> <b>modifications.</b> Understanding this RF-induced transport helps elucidate these nonlinear RF-SOL mechanisms. One consequence of these density <b>profile</b> <b>modifications</b> is a change in LH coupling efficiency. A 2 -D slab LH coupling model has also been used to quantify the effects of the density <b>profile</b> <b>modifications</b> on LH coupling. It will be shown that LH coupling is extremely sensitive to the edge density profile and to poloidal asymmetries in the density profiles. The inclusion of LH and ICRF-induced ExB drift effects on the observed density profile asymmetries is necessary to understand the experimentally measured LH coupling results during LH only and LH+ICRF operations. by Cornwall Lau.

40|$|Gear tooth modifications, such as lead crowning, {{are often}} {{recommended}} {{to compensate for}} misalignment (e. g. assembly deviations). Lead crowning means that the tooth centre is slightly thicker than the tooth edges and is usually described as a circular arc profile. The use of crowning shifts the peak load from the tooth flank edges and therefore reduces the risk for high contact pressures at the edges, which can otherwise result in a shortened service life. In this study a logarithmical lead profile was compared with traditional lead <b>profile</b> <b>modifications</b> for gears. The profiles were applied on a spur gear pair and a numerical method for contact {{analysis was used to}} calculate the contact pressure distribution at the pitch diameter. All lead profiles were optimised with respect to low contact pressure at a specific normal load, a specified maximum misalignment in the plane of action and a tooth flank edge contact criteria. The results show that the logarithmical profile responds differently to misalignments compared to the traditional lead <b>profile</b> <b>modifications.</b> The logarithmical <b>profile</b> resulted in lower maximum contact pressures for small misalignments and is therefore of further interest in terms of achieving a robust gear design...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} gear geometrical errors in wind turbine planetary gearboxes with a floating sun gear. Numerical simulations and experiments are employed throughout the study. A National Renewable Energy Laboratory 750 kW gearbox is modelled in a multibody environment and verified using the experimental data obtained from a dynamometer test. The gear geometrical errors, which are both assembly dependent and assembly independent, are described, and planet-pin misalignment and eccentricity are selected as the two most influential and key errors for case studies. Various load cases involving errors in the floating and non-floating sun gear designs are simulated, and the planet-bearing reactions, gear vibrations, gear mesh loads and bearing fatigue lives are compared. All tests and simulations are performed at the rated wind speed. For errorless gears, the non-floating sun gear design performs better in terms of gear load variation, whereas the upwind planet bearing has more damage. In the floating sun gear scenario, the planet misalignment is neutralized by changing the sun motion pattern and the planet gear's elastic deformation.

Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which produces dextran when supplied with sucrose, is a bacterium that is technically feasible for use in <b>profile</b> <b>modification.</b> However, the technique requires controlled bacterial growth to produce selective plugging. A kinetic model {{for the production of}} cells and polysaccharides has been developed for L. mesenteroides bacteria. This model, based on data from batch growth experiments, predicts saccharide utilization, cell generation, and dextran production. The underlying mechanism is the extracellular breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose and the subsequent production of polysaccharide (dextran). The monosaccharides are then available for growth. Accompanying sucrose consumption is the utilization of yeast extract. The cell requires a complex media that is provided by yeast extract as a source of vitamins and amino acids. Varying the concentration ratio of yeast extract to sucrose in the growth media provides a means of controlling the amount of polymer produced per cell. Consequently, in situ bacteria growth can be controlled by the manipulation of nutrient media composition, thereby providing the ability to create an overall strategy for the use of L. mesenteroides bacteria for <b>profile</b> <b>modification...</b>|$|E
