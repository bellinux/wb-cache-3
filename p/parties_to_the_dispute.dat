This requirement was {{a reflection of the}} League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> was not required for unanimity.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E
25|$|Griffith CJ {{expressed}} stronger {{views in}} relation to the constitutionality of the common rule provisions, stating that the function of an arbitrator was a judicial function that could only be exercised between <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> and after hearing them. The power to make a common rule award was a legislative function which, consistent with the decision in Whybrow (No 1), could not be conferred on the Arbitration Court. Griffith CJ emphasised the settlement of disputes between parties, with no apparent consideration as to the constitutional power {{in relation to}} the prevention of disputes. Griffith CJ held that the common rule provisions being unconstitutional did not invalidate the entire Act.|$|E

25|$|While {{all five}} judges are {{properly}} seen {{as among the}} framers of the Constitution, it was Higgins J who had taken {{a leading role in the}} Constitutional Conventions for the federal government the power to make laws relating to the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. As with the judgement of Isaacs J in Whybrow (No 1), Higgins J argues from the premise that the fundamental basis of the Australian legal system was that power was conferred on the Federal Parliament, not by the people of Australia but by the British parliament. Higgins J rejected the premise that the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> needed to have taken a definite stand or made definite claims, but that an order or award could not be made except as against identified or identifiable parties.|$|E
25|$|High-Low Arbitration, or Bracketed Arbitration, is an {{arbitration}} {{wherein the}} <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> agree in advance the limits {{within which the}} arbitral tribunal must render its award. It is only generally useful where liability is not in dispute, and the only issue between the party {{is the amount of}} compensation. If the award is lower than the agreed minimum, then the defendant only need pay the lower limit; if the award is higher than the agreed maximum, the claimant will receive the upper limit. If the award falls within the agreed range, then the parties are bound by the actual award amount. Practice varies as to whether the figures {{may or may not be}} revealed to the tribunal, or whether the tribunal is even advised of the parties' agreement.|$|E
25|$|The Conciliation and Arbitration Act {{provided}} at s 38(f) that the Arbitration Court could declare an award to {{be a common}} rule of any industry. The other constitutional argument was that the Australian parliament had no power to provide for common rule awards. There were two impediments to this argument (1) the award had not at that time been declared to be a common rule award and (2) The boot manufacturers who applied to the High Court were all <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> and thus would be bound by the Award regardless. As Higgins had noted, the High Court will not answer a constitutional question unless it is necessary. The State of Victoria had intervened in the case {{to protect the public}} of that State from the operation of what it said was an invalid federal law. The argument was that the common rule provisions were invalid and could not be severed from the balance of the Act, such that the entire Act was invalid.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{mandatory}} arbitration is not itself the problem. The problem is instead {{that in some}} instances, one <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> has exclusive control of {{the design of the}} dispute-resolution system. Consequently, research on mandatory arbitration should concentrate on who is structuring it, how they structure it, why this is so and how these choices affect dispute outcomes...|$|R

25|$|Procedures which {{necessarily}} lead to {{a determination}} which the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> may not enter into an agreement upon: Some court procedures lead to judgments which bind {{all members of the}} general public, or public authorities in their capacity as such, or third parties, or which are being conducted in the public interest. For example, until the 1980s, antitrust matters were not arbitrable in the United States. Matters relating to crimes, status and family law are generally not considered to be arbitrable, as the power of the parties to enter into an agreement upon these matters is at least restricted. However, most other disputes that involve private rights between two parties can be resolved using arbitration. In some disputes, parts of claims may be arbitrable and other parts not. For example, in a dispute over patent infringement, a determination of whether a patent has been infringed could be adjudicated upon by an arbitration tribunal, but the validity of a patent could not: As patents are subject to a system of public registration, an arbitral panel would have no power to order the relevant body to rectify any patent registration based upon its determination.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{files in}} a case calculated {{to lead to a}} judgment, the judges would exchange their views informally on the salient legal points of the case, and a time limit for producing a judgment would then be set. Then, each judge would write an anonymous summary containing his opinion; the opinions would be circulated among the Court for 2 or 3 days before the President drafted a judgment containing a summary of those submitted by individual judges. The Court would then agree on the decision that they wished to reach, along with the main points of argument they wished to use. Once this was done, a Committee of 4, including the President, the Registrar and two judges elected by secret ballot, drafted a final judgment, which was then voted on by the entire Court. Once a final judgment was set, it was given to the public and the press. Every judgment contained the reasons behind the decision and the judges assenting; dissenting judges were allowed to deliver their own judgment, with all judgments read in open court before the agents of the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> Judgments could not be revised except on the discovery of some fact unknown when the Court sat but not if the fact was known but not discussed because of negligence.|$|E

2500|$|One {{effect of}} the {{emphasis}} in Whybrow (No 3) to the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> was to exclude {{the possibility of an}} award being binding on employers who did not employ union members. This emphasis was overturned by the High Court in Burwood Cinema Ltd v Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association, on the basis that unions have an interest in protecting their members' working conditions and consequently, ensuring that these conditions are not undermined by employers employing non-union members at lower rates of pay or on lower conditions. [...] The emphasis on the need for a dispute has been said to have resulted in the prevention limb of the Federal parliaments power going largely unutilised.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some legal}} systems, {{it used to}} be common for each party to the dispute to appoint an {{arbitrator}} and for those two arbitrators to appoint a third arbitrator (who {{may or may not be}} called an umpire).

The standards for enforcing such awards are set out in the New York Convention, as interpreted by local law.|$|E
2500|$|India {{continues}} to assert its sovereignty or rights {{over the entire}} region of Kashmir, while Pakistan maintains {{that it is a}} disputed territory. Pakistan argues that the status quo cannot be considered as a solution and further insists on a UN-sponsored plebiscite. Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that {{they would be willing to}} accept alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the [...] "Chenab" [...] formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other sideeffectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the Valley of Kashmir, a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including Sajjad Lone, have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the Kargil War and the subsequent 9/11 attacks. These events put pressure on Pakistan to alter its position on terrorism. Many neutral <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> have noted that the UN resolution on Kashmir is no longer relevant.

30|$|Arbitrators in a meta-organization are third <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> {{which they}} are resolving {{but this does not}} mean that they are {{necessarily}} third <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization itself.

It is the glue that fixes the sometimes capricious contractual relations of meta-organizations when there is not only one locus of power. By the same token, arbitration is a vehicle to stabilize meta-organizations and to reap their specific benefits, while vertical integration or stand-alone production are only second best solutions in a globalized world with fragmented knowledge bases.|$|R

In the next chapter, when speaking more particularly of the manners and customs of the times, I shall give an account in full of one of these duels. I have only to say here that Richard, on hearing of the quarrel between his cousin Henry and Norfolk, decreed that they should settle it by single combat, and preparations were accordingly made for the trial, and the parties appeared, armed and equipped for the fight, in the presence of an immense concourse of people assembled to witness the spectacle.
