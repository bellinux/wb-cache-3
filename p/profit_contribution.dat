Soon Baťa found himself the fourth richest person in Czechoslovakia. From 1926 to 1928 the business blossomed as productivity rose 75 percent and the number of employees increased by 35 percent. In 1927 production lines were installed, and the company had its own hospital. By the end of 1928, the company’s head factory was composed of 30 buildings. Then the entrepreneur created educational organizations such as the Baťa School of Work and introduced the five-day work week. In 1930 he established a stunning shoe museum that maps shoe production from the earliest times to the contemporary age throughout the world. By 1931 there were factories in Germany, England, the Netherlands, Poland and in other countries.|$|E

40|$|Funds {{transfer}} pricing (FTP) is a management accounting technique {{used to identify}} the source of <b>profits</b> <b>contributions</b> for business units and products, and is a strategic tool to integrate risk management with decision-making. As very few studies have investigated the FTP model for commercial banks, this thesis attempts to identify the factors driving the bank FTP model and to develop the model. To develop the bank FTP model, the bank FTP process, which consists of the WHY, the WHAT, the WHO, the WHERE, the WHEN and the HOW factors, is designed. The WHY factor determines that the FTP model should be developed to enhance effective bank risk management process, and properly assign <b>profit</b> <b>contributions</b> within a bank to help achieve accurate bank performance evaluation. The WHERE factor demands that the FTP model should be developed at the bank business unit and instrument levels, and the WHEN factor requires that both the original and remaining term FTP models should be developed. The FTP model is developed with the responsibility accounting principles and financial risk management techniques, which are applied for the WHO, the WHAT and HOW factor design. The implications of the FTP model developed in this thesis are examined by applying the model in bank performance measurements. The FTP model {{is found to be}} able to properly assign bank risks to business unit managers who have control over the risks, and properly allocate <b>profit</b> <b>contributions</b> within a bank. The FTP model is also applied in the different types of banks, which have varying degrees of decentralization of risk management decision-making authority. It is found that the FTP model can achieves effective risk management and accurate business performance evaluation in the partially decentralized bank. The case study analysis of the FTP model in the Chinese bank shows that the bank FTP model developed in this thesis is more effective in risk management than the bank's FTP method...|$|R

40|$|A key {{conundrum}} facing {{organizations is}} how to adjust marketing budgets {{in response to the}} business cycle. While most firms use procyclical spending (spending less during economic contractions), academic studies often recommend countercyclical spending (spending more during contractions), which begs the question what {{is the right thing to}} do. The spending problem is compounded further when demand is not just driven by one country’s business cycle, but by the (non-synchronized) business cycles of multiple countries, as is the case for tourism marketing aiming to attract international tourists originating from different countries. We derive insights into the best way to allocate marketing budgets across countries under varying economic conditions. We show that the allocation decisions are driven by the pro- versus countercyclical nature of three factors: unit sales, marketing effectiveness, and per-unit <b>profit</b> <b>contribution.</b> To study how unit sales and marketing effectiveness respond to the business cycle, we develop a Transfer Function Dynamic Hierarchical Linear Model.

40|$|Retailers {{have been}} criticized for heavily relying on odd prices {{although}} their advantage over even prices has not been convincingly proven. In this paper we argue that such behavior does not have to stem solely from tradition, but may be seen as a rational way of dealing with uncertainty. We review 21 empirical studies on the effects of odd versus even prices and find that the results are inconclusive as to whether threshold effects exist. In an analysis of profit contributions we then show that in the light of such uncertainty it is rational to set odd prices. The reason is that only small losses in <b>profit</b> <b>contribution</b> are incurred when odd prices are set although no thresholds exist. In the opposite case, however, losses can be quite substantial. Results of a simulation show the size of the two errors for a realistic range of response parameters. ...|$|E
