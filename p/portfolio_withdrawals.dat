40|$|This study uses Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{to evaluate}} the ability of various deposit percentages and asset allocation weights to support withdrawals in retirement that permit smoothed income {{over the life of}} an individual. The results indicate that, in general, individuals need to deposit at least 15 percent of pre-retirement salary for 30 or more years in a portfolio consisting of at least 50 percent equity to achieve a high success rate for <b>portfolio</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> When Social Security payments are excluded from the retirement income, the success rate is greatly impacted by the savings rate, the savings period, and the amount of equity investment in the portfolio...|$|E
40|$|Individual's and couple's {{entering}} retirement face {{an uncertain}} future. They {{have to decide}} how to manage their savings so that they live the fullest life possible from a financial standpoint, while minimizing the risk of outliving their money. To get the best financial growth, retirees should invest their savings in a portfolio consisting of equity and fixed income securities. We use dynamic programming to maximize annual <b>portfolio</b> <b>withdrawals</b> dependent on mortality tables and stochastic models for stock and bond returns. We call our approach the Dynamic Forecasting (DF) approach because it assumes that the retiree's portfolio will repeat its past performances in the future. Two variations on the DF approach are the relaxed DF approach and the alternate DF approach. These provide two opposite withdrawal structures while guaranteeing a 0 % probability of failure. Our strategy is compared with the Constant Dollar (CD) approach and the Endowment approach, also known as the Constant Percentage approach (CP), using the Withdrawal Efficiency Rate (WER) metric. The strategies are compared under increasing, decreasing, and constant equity glide paths. The DF and alternate DF approaches outperform the other strategies under the WER metric and are the only strategies evaluated that a probability of failure of zero and are guaranteed to not leave money unspent {{at the end of the}} retirement period...|$|E
25|$|Although the 4% initial <b>portfolio</b> <b>withdrawal</b> rate {{described}} above {{can be used}} as a rough gauge, it is often desirable to use a retirement planning tool that accepts detailed input and can render a result that has more precision. Some of these tools model only the retirement phase of the plan while others can model both the savings or accumulation phase as well as the retirement phase of the plan. For example, an analysis by Forbes reckoned that in 90% of historical markets, a 4% rate would have lasted for at least 30 years, while in 50% of the historical markets, a 4% rate would have been sustained for more than 40 years.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{models of}} bank runs {{do not allow}} for herding e¤ects, because in these models {{withdrawal}} decisions {{are assumed to be}} made simultaneously. I extend the banking model to allow a depositor to choose his withdrawal time. When he withdraws depends on his consumption type (patient or impatient), his private, noisy signal {{about the quality of the}} banks <b>portfolio,</b> and the <b>withdrawal</b> histories of the other depositors. Some of these runs are e ¢ cient in that the bank is liquidated before the portfolio worsens. Others are not e ¢ cient; these are cases in which the herd is misled...|$|R
40|$|Highly risk-averse retirees are {{generally}} advised {{to adopt a}} fixed spending strategy such as the 4 % withdrawal rule. To prevent the premature depletion of a retirement portfolio, the rule attempts to proxy as the ‘safe withdrawal rate’. But a constant withdrawal rate means that retirees accumulate unspent surpluses when markets outperform and face spending shortfalls when markets underperform. While a safe withdrawal rate can prevent spending shortfalls, the opportunity cost of unspent surpluses associated with this strategy can be extreme. We apply a range of basic investment decision rules to a retirement <b>portfolio</b> applying various <b>withdrawal</b> rates and examine the probability of shortfalls over a retirement horizon. Using a block bootstrap simulation technique, we examine decision rules relating to stock and bond investments. Our results show that retirement portfolios with a bias towards stocks coupled with a decision rule that sources withdrawals from bonds and cash before stocks significantly outperforms alternative withdrawal strategies, despite the inherent increase in volatility. This finding is in direct contrast to the safe withdrawal rate conventions used in contemporary financial advice models...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{singular}} stochastic control model for pricing variable annuities with the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit. This benefit promises {{to return the}} entire initial investment, with withdrawals spread over the term of the contract, irrespective of the market performance of the underlying asset <b>portfolio.</b> A contractual <b>withdrawal</b> rate is set and no penalty is imposed when the policyholder chooses to withdraw at or below this rate. Subject to a penalty fee, the policyholder is allowed to withdraw at a rate higher than the contractual withdrawal rate or surrender the policy instantaneously. We explore the optimal withdrawal strategy adopted by the rational policyholder that maximizes the expected discounted value of the cash flows generated from holding this variable annuity policy. An efficient finite difference algorithm using the penalty approximation approach is proposed for solving the singular stochastic control model. Optimal withdrawal policies of the holders of the variable annuities with the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit are explored. We also construct discrete pricing formulation that models withdrawals on discrete dates. Our numerical tests show that the solution values from the discrete model converge {{to those of the}} continuous model...|$|R
