5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|Some Myxogastria {{species may}} produce asexually. These are {{continuously}} diploid. There is no meiosis before the germination of the spores {{and the production}} of the <b>plasmodium</b> proceeds without germination of two cells.|$|E
5|$|The grey-necked wood rail is {{the type}} host of <b>Plasmodium</b> bertii, an apicomplexan parasite, meaning that P. bertii was {{originally}} discovered on this organism. P. lutzi is also found on this bird.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, {{screening}} of anti-malarial drugs {{was carried out}} on avian malaria. Avian malaria species differ from those that infect humans. The discovery in 1948 of <b>Plasmodium</b> berghei in wild rodents in the Congo and later other rodent species that could infect laboratory rats transformed drug development. The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, a status they still retain. <b>Plasmodium</b> cynomolgi in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{were used in the}} 1960s to test drugs active against P. vivax.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common. 88% of common blackbirds {{were found to}} have intestinal parasites, most frequently Isospora and Capillaria species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (Leucocytozoon, <b>Plasmodium,</b> Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma species).|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (<b>Plasmodium</b> gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to <b>Plasmodium</b> reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|External parasites of the {{mistle thrush}} include the hen flea, the moorhen flea, the {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the thrush may be hosting tapeworms, nematodes, and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and <b>Plasmodium</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Mites of {{the genus}} Ptilonyssus, such as P. sittae, {{have been found in}} the Eurasian nuthatch's nasal cavities. Intestinal worms include the {{nematodes}} Tridentocapillaria parusi and Pterothominx longifilla. Small studies in Slovakia and Spain found no blood parasites, but a larger Spanish survey found some evidence of <b>Plasmodium</b> infection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plasmodium</b> knowlesi {{has been}} known since the 1930s in Asian macaque monkeys and as {{experimentally}} capable of infecting humans. In 1965 a natural human infection was reported in a U.S. soldier returning from the Pahang Jungle of the Malaysian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} mosquitoes preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely originated in Africa and coevolved with its hosts, mosquitoes and non-human primates. Malaria protozoa are diversified into primate, rodent, bird, and reptile host lineages. Humans may have originally caught <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum from gorillas. P. vivax, another malarial <b>Plasmodium</b> species among the six that infect humans, also likely originated in African gorillas and chimpanzees. Another malarial species recently discovered to be transmissible to humans, P. knowlesi, originated in Asian macaque monkeys. While P. malariae is highly host specific to humans, {{there is some evidence}} that low level non-symptomatic infection persists among wild chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of {{drug-resistant}} <b>Plasmodium</b> parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are {{taken up by the}} parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins. Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.|$|E
5|$|A white {{cockatoo}} and a sulphur-crested cockatoo {{were found to}} be infected with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite <b>Plasmodium</b> on analysis of faecal samples at Almu√±ecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|Apicomplexa is a {{major group}} of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes that encompasses several important parasites, including the malaria parasite <b>Plasmodium.</b> Three species are known from the marsh rice rat, all of which belong to the Eimerina clade. Two are in the genus Eimeria, members of which cause the economically significant disease coccidiosis in poultry. The third {{is a member of}} Isospora, which includes species that are pathogenic in humans and pigs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of <b>Plasmodium</b> to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Her {{best known}} work was a {{comprehensive}} study of <b>Plasmodium,</b> the malaria parasite, and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite, research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II. She discovered the potential for cross-resistance in these parasites during that same period. Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, {{as part of her}} research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.|$|E
5|$|If two {{cells of}} the same type meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei. The {{conditions}} which trigger this are not known. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated <b>plasmodium</b> through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For {{the production of a}} zygote, cells of different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E
5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of <b>Plasmodium,</b> a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne {{infectious}} disease affecting humans {{and other animals}} caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the <b>Plasmodium</b> type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can acquire}} blood parasites such as <b>Plasmodium,</b> but {{a study in}} Spain showed that the {{prevalence}} was less than one percent, and unlikely to affect the life history and conservation of this species. These low levels of parasitism contrast with a much higher prevalence in some other passerine groups; for example a study of thrushes in Russia showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma.|$|E
5|$|The choughs host bird fleas, {{including}} two Frontopsylla species which are Pyrrhocorax specialist. Other parasites recorded on choughs include a cestode Choanotaenia pirinica, and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia, Menacanthus and Philopterus. Blood parasites such as <b>Plasmodium</b> {{have been found}} in red-billed choughs, but this is uncommon, and apparently does little harm. Parasitism levels are much lower than in some other passerine groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is host {{to a range}} of parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid herpesvirus 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include <b>Plasmodium</b> relictum (usually not causing malaria in the {{peregrine falcon}}), Strigeidae trematodes, Serratospiculum amaculata (nematode), and tapeworms. Known peregrine falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice, Ceratophyllus garei (a flea), and Hippoboscidae flies (Icosta nigra, Ornithoctona erythrocephala).|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where <b>Plasmodium</b> is resistant to one or more medications, three medications‚Äîmefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)‚Äîare frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and <b>Plasmodium</b> malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|Bishop {{received}} several honorary titles and fellowships during her career. In 1932, she was appointed a Yallow Fellow of Girton College, an honour she held {{until her death}} in 1990. Bishop was also a Beit Fellow from 1929 to 1932. The Medical Research Council awarded her a grant in 1937 that sparked her study of <b>Plasmodium.</b> In 1945 and 1947, {{she was involved in}} organising Girton College's Working Women's Summer School, an institution designed to provide intellectual fulfilment for women whose formal education ended at the age of 14. She was elected to the Royal Society in 1959, and at one point {{was a member of the}} Malaria Committee of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced <b>Plasmodium</b> vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 200 {{parasitic}} <b>Plasmodium</b> {{species have}} been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals, and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates. Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P.coatneyi (a model for P.falciparum) and P.cynomolgi (P.vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP {{are similar to those}} employed for humans. Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P.berghei. Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P.relictum is known {{to play a role in}} limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} most {{commonly}} transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites {{travel to the}} liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of <b>Plasmodium</b> can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P.falciparum because P.vivax, P.ovale, and P.malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P.knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The only blood parasites {{found in}} a study of blackcaps trapped on {{migration}} were protozoans from the genera Haemoproteus and <b>Plasmodium.</b> Of those affected, 45.5% were males and 22.7% were females, but the number of parasites was small, and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of H. parabelopolskyi are found only in the blackcap, and form a monophyletic group; three further members of that group are found only in the garden warbler, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan Isospora ashmoonensis was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.|$|E
5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (<b>Plasmodium)</b> kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of <b>Plasmodium</b> ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E
25|$|With {{the use of}} the {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} additional species have been identified in humans, although whether these species can regularly infect humans is not known. An experimental infection of a human volunteer with <b>Plasmodium</b> eylesi and <b>Plasmodium</b> cynomolgi has been reported, although the infection was not able to be transferred to another susceptible host, suggesting the parasites {{may not be able to}} productively infect humans. A possible infection with <b>Plasmodium</b> tenue has also been reported, however doubts have been raised as to the validity of this diagnosis. Other species which have been reportedly isolated from humans include <b>Plasmodium</b> brasilianum, <b>Plasmodium</b> inui, <b>Plasmodium</b> rhodiani, <b>Plasmodium</b> schweitzi, <b>Plasmodium</b> semiovale, and <b>Plasmodium</b> simium.|$|E
25|$|The {{survivorship}} {{and relative}} fitness of mosquitoes are not {{adversely affected by}} <b>Plasmodium</b> infection, which indicates the importance of vector fitness in shaping the evolution of <b>Plasmodium.</b> <b>Plasmodium</b> has evolved the capability to manipulate mosquito feeding behavior. Mosquitoes harboring <b>Plasmodium</b> have a higher propensity to bite than uninfected mosquitoes. This tendency has facilitated the spread of <b>Plasmodium</b> to the various hosts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmodium</b> {{was first}} {{identified}} when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran described parasites {{in the blood}} of malaria patients in 1880. He named the parasite Oscillaria malariae. The fact that several species may be involved in causing different forms of malaria was first recognized by Camillo Golgi in 1886. Soon thereafter, Giovanni Batista Grassi and Raimondo Filetti named the parasites causing two different types of human malaria <b>Plasmodium</b> vivax and <b>Plasmodium</b> malariae. In 1897, William Welch identified and named <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum. This was followed by the recognition of the other two species of <b>Plasmodium</b> which infect humans: <b>Plasmodium</b> ovale (1922) and <b>Plasmodium</b> knowlesi (identified in long-tailed macaques in 1931; in humans in 1965). The contribution of insect hosts to the <b>Plasmodium</b> life cycle was described in 1897 by Ronald Ross and in 1899 by Giovanni Batista Grassi, Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli.|$|E
25|$|Mosquitoes {{of the genera}} Culex, Anopheles, Culiseta, Mansonia and Aedes may act as insect hosts {{for various}} <b>Plasmodium</b> species. The best studies of these have been the Anopheles {{mosquitoes}} which host <b>Plasmodium</b> parasites that cause human malaria, as well as Culex mosquitoes which host the <b>Plasmodium</b> species that cause malaria in birds. In all cases, only female mosquitoes can be infected with <b>Plasmodium</b> species, since only the females feed on the blood of vertebrate hosts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} one hundred species of mosquito-transmitted <b>Plasmodium.</b> The {{phylogeny}} of these malarial parasites suggests that the <b>Plasmodium</b> of mammalian hosts forms a well-defined clade strongly associated with the specialization to the Anopheles mosquito vector. This was a major evolutionary transition that allowed <b>Plasmodium</b> to exploit humans and other mammals.|$|E
25|$|The insect {{hosts of}} the <b>Plasmodium</b> species which infect {{primates}} are various species of Anopheles mosquitoes. Different species of Plasmdodium generally infect {{different species of}} mosquito, although some mosquito species can carry several <b>Plasmodium</b> species.|$|E
