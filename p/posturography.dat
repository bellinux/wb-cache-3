50|$|<b>Posturography</b> is {{a general}} term that covers all the {{techniques}} used to quantify postural control in upright stance in either static or dynamic conditions. Among them, Computerized dynamic <b>posturography</b> (CDP), also called test of balance (TOB), is a non-invasive specialized clinical assessment technique used to quantify {{the central nervous system}} adaptive mechanisms (sensory, motor and central) involved in the control of posture and balance, both in normal (such as in physical education and sports training) and abnormal conditions (particularly in the diagnosis of balance disorders and in physical therapy and postural re-education). Due to the complex interactions among sensory, motor, and central processes involved in posture and balance, CDP requires different protocols in order to differentiate among the many defects and impairments which may affect the patient's posture control system. Thus, CDP challenges it by using several combinations of visual and support surface stimuli and parameters.|$|E

In a study, an 86-year-old woman was unable to walk without close supervision, even with a walker, due to poor balance and a tendency to fall, after a stroke. She participated in four training sessions along with physical therapy. She was tested on the outcome measures of Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Functional Reach and Lateral Reach tests, Timed Up & Go test (TUG), computerized <b>posturography,</b> and the Short Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ).

5000|$|Due {{to recent}} {{technological}} advances, {{a growing trend}} in balance assessments has become the monitoring of center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion) (CoP), the reaction vector of center of mass on the ground, path length for a specified duration. With quantitative assessments, minimal CoP path length is suggestive of good balance. Laboratory-grade force plates are considered the [...] "gold-standard" [...] of measuring CoP. The NeuroCom Balance Manager (NeuroCom,Clackamas, OR, United States) is a commercially available dynamic <b>posturography</b> system that uses computerized software to track CoP during different tasks. These different assessments range from the sensory organization test looking at the different systems that contribute through sensory receptor input {{to the limits of}} stability test observing a participant's ankle range of motion, velocity, and reaction time. While the NeuroCom is considered the industry standard for balance assessments, it does come at a steep price (about $250,000).|$|E
5000|$|Mechanography (also {{referred}} to as jumping mechanography or Muscle Mechanography) is a medical diagnostic measurement method for motion analysis and assessment of muscle function and muscle power by means of physical parameters. The method is based on measuring the variation of the ground reaction forces over the time for motion patterns close to typical every day movements (e.g. chair rise or jumps). From these ground reaction forces centre of gravity related physical parameters like relative maximum forces, velocity, power output, kinetic energy, potential energy, height of jump or whole body stiffness are calculated. If the ground reaction forces are measured separately for left and right leg in addition body imbalances during the motions can be analysed.

They defined vestibulospinal function by ability to have proper posture, as well as by self reported dizziness. The results were determined by using the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) of the computerized dynamic <b>posturography</b> (CDP) as well as the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI). It was determined that subjects with damaged inferior spinal nerve performed worse on the posture test than the control group, but performed better than patients with superior vestibulo nerve damage. With this they determined that the superior vestibular nerve plays a larger role in balance than the inferior vestibulo nerve but that they both play a role. In terms of the DHI it was concluded that {{there was no difference between}} the patients with the two different impairments.|$|E
5000|$|Advancements in {{technology}} have allowed force platforms {{to take on}} a new role within the kinetics field. Traditional laboratory-grade force plates cost (usually in the thousands) have made them very impractical for the everyday clinician. However, Nintendo introduced the Wii Balance Board (WBB) (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) in 2007 and changed the structure of what a force plate can be. By 2010, {{it was found that the}} WBB is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the weight distribution, when directly compared to the [...] "gold-standard" [...] laboratory-grade force plate, while costing less than $100. More so, this has been verified in both healthy and clinical populations. This is possible due to the four force transducers found in the corners of the WBB. These studies are conducted using customized software, such as LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) that can be integrated with the board to be able to measure the amount of body sway or the CoP path length during trials for time. The other benefit to having a <b>posturography</b> system, such as the WBB, is that it is portable so clinicians around the world are able to measure body sway quantitatively, instead of relying on the subjective, clinical balance assessments currently in use.|$|E

The stated purpose of these tests is identification of lesion site and/or definition of functional balance deficits in a specific patient. During a recent consensus meeting (ESCEBD), 60 researchers and experienced clinical users of <b>posturography</b> (14 European countries, 9 different disciplines) inventoried and critically analyzed the various methodologies of <b>posturography</b> currently used for clinical evaluation. To complement <b>posturography,</b> alternative methods of assessment of balance control were considered. The indications for the clinical use of <b>posturography</b> were defined as well as recommendations regarding measurement parameters, type of perturbations and signal analysis techniques to improve assessment of balance control. Consensus was reached that a force platform cannot be considered as a technique which is sufficient on its own to perform a clinically relevant test for the assessment of neuro-otological and musculo-skeletal conditions, evaluation of compensation or treatment (rehabilitation) or prediction of falls. It should be supported by complementary methods, such as segment motion analysis, body-fixed 2 D or 3 D accelerometer-gyroscope or electromyography. At present, no generally applicable <b>posturography</b> test is available with reasonable sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of balance disorders.

40|$|Disturbance of {{postural}} {{control is}} one of the main symptoms of Parkinson´s Disease and alongside hyperkinesia and characteristic disturbances of gait including episodes of freezing, it is an important factor contributing to balance impairment. Postural instability {{is one of}} the most disabling features of Parkinson´s Disease, leading to recurring falls with severe physical and psychosocial consequences in the advanced stages. Therefore the assessment of different aspects of disequilibrium and postural control mechanisms, the quantification of balance impairment and the evaluation of the risk of falling are most important. <b>Posturography</b> has been proposed as an objective and quantitative measure of balance. Whereas static <b>posturography</b> measures spontaneus body sway, dynamic <b>posturography</b> with stabilometry requires patients to continuously compensate for self-induced perturbations by standing on an tilting platform with a cylindrical base. In the present study the posturographic measures of 58 patients with idiopathic Parksinon´s Disease were compared to their performance in established semi-quantitative clinical tests (pull-test and tandem gait). Posturographic sway was increased in patients who displayed disturbances in their tandem gait and pull-test, qualitatively reflecting the impairment of balance. Yet <b>posturography</b> did not mirror quantitative inter-individual differences according to the clinical rating. It was shown that the execution of tandem gait was reflected by both types of <b>posturography,</b> whereas deficient reactions to the pull-test were reflected only by dynamic and not by static <b>posturography.</b> The latter finding suggests that both clinical assessments, pull-test and tandem-gait, cover different aspects of (dis) equilibrium. Whereas the pull-test can be assumed to mainly reflect reactive responses to external perturbations (feed-back processing) and detect the static equilibrium in the saggital plane, tandem gait requires supportive, anticipatory and voluntary postural adjustments to compensate for self-initiated and internally generated movements (feed-forward processing). Impaired tandem gait may be a marker for a more complex disturbance of balance in Parkinson´s Disease, detecting the ability to maintain balance in a medio-lateral plane. It may be helpful to use a combination of balance tests to disclose different aspects of postural disturbance in Parkinson’s patients. Patients with deficient performance in both clinical balance tests had more sway in static and dynamic <b>posturography</b> and 80 % of this sub group had a history of falling over. It is only by combining tandem gait and pull tests that a patient’s ability to maintain their balance can be properly assessed. Thus it is recommendable to include tandem gait when examining Parkinson’s patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic <b>posturography</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} tool for understanding standing balance in clinical settings. A key test in the NeuroCom International (Clackamas, Oregon) dynamic <b>posturography</b> system, the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), provides information about the integration of multiple components of balance. The SOT test leads to an outcome measure called the “equilibrium score ” (ES), which reflects the overall coordination of the visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems for maintaining standing posture. Researchers, therapists, and physicians often use the ES from the SOT as a clinically relevant measure of standing balance. We discuss here the formula used for evaluating the ES and propose an additional measure of postural stability, called the Postural Stability Index (PSI), that accounts for shear force and individual anthropomorphic measures. We propose that this new measure provides a clinically important adjunct to the current SOT and can be calculated from data already collected by the Neuro-Com forceplate during the SOT.

40|$|Introduction Body {{balance is}} one of the most {{important}} functions of the organism and is directly associated with quality of life. Thus, given that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes pulmorary alterations as well as several systemic complications, it is extremely important to make a careful investigation of its implications for body stability. Objective To assess the balance of individuals with COPD by using Foam-Laser Dynamic <b>Posturography.</b> Materials and methods 29 patients (19 men and 10 women; mean age 64. 72 &# 177; 7. 67 years) who were former smokers and had COPD GOLD II and III were selected to participate in the study group. The control group was composed of 24 individuals (12 women and 12 men; mean age 63. 58 &# 177; 8. 17 years) who did not have COPD. To assess the balance of participants, we used Foam-Laser Dynamic <b>Posturography.</b> Results With regard to the Foam-Laser Dynamic <b>Posturography</b> test, we found no significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the experimental and the control group when compared to the variables of the SOT tests (SOT I to VI) or to the variables of the sensory analysis, i. e., somatosensory, visual and vestibular functions, and visual preference. Conclusion This study demonstrated that subjects with and without COPD showed a similar performance in the Foam-Laser Dynamic <b>Posturography</b> test...|$|E
