One of the difficulties {{for the study of}} viral origins and evolution is their high rate of mutation; this is particularly the case in RNA retroviruses like HIV. A 2015 study compared protein fold structures across different branches of the tree of life, where researchers can reconstruct the evolutionary histories of the folds and of the organisms whose genomes code for those folds. They argue that protein folds are better markers of ancient events as their three-dimensional structures can be maintained even as the sequences that code for those begin to change. Thus, the viral protein repertoire retain traces of ancient evolutionary history that can be recovered using advanced bioinformatics approaches. Those researchers think that [...] "the prolonged pressure of genome and <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> eventually reduced virocells into modern viruses (identified by the complete loss of cellular makeup), meanwhile other coexisting cellular lineages diversified into modern cells. The data suggest that viruses originated from ancient cells that co-existed with the ancestors of modern cells. These ancient cells likely contained segmented RNA genomes.|$|E

40|$|Poplar wood {{can be used}} as a {{feedstock}} {{for manufacturing}} cellulosic biofuel (ethanol) as an alternative to petroleum-based liquid transportation fuel. Producing biofuel from poplar wood involves reducing poplar wood into small <b>particles</b> (known as <b>size</b> <b>reduction),</b> hydrolyzing cellulose inside poplar particles to fermentable sugars, and converting these sugars to ethanol biofuel. <b>Size</b> <b>reduction</b> is usually done by wood chipping and biomass milling.

Sono-Ormosils are distinguished in comparison with conventional gels by a higher density as well as improved thermal stability. This may be a result from the higher degree of polymerization.|$|E
5000|$|Comminution is <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> of {{materials}}. Comminution may {{be carried}} out on either dry materials or slurries. Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on [...] "run-of-mine" [...] ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition. Compression and impact forces are extensively used in crushing operations while attrition is the dominant force in grinding. The primarily used equipment in crushing are-jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills, closed circuited with a classifier unit, are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant. Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy intensive.|$|E

Although the use of heptane (a nonpolar oil) created more selective agglomeration of the organic matter, its use caused the agglomeration to proceed at a slower rate. Of the three oils used, heptane, tetralin, and the heptane/heptanol combination, the mixture of heptane/heptanol produced the fastest agglomeration;In continuous runs employing Upper Freeport coal, there were runs where the size of the agglomerates was limited to about 1000 [mu]m or smaller.
