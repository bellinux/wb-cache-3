25|$|The {{burning of}} harder, older {{anthracite}} and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. This fly ash is <b>pozzolanic</b> in nature, and contains less than 7% lime (CaO). Possessing <b>pozzolanic</b> properties, the glassy silica and alumina of Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent, such as Portland cement, quicklime, or hydrated lime—mixed {{with water to}} react and produce cementitious compounds. Alternatively, adding a chemical activator such as sodium silicate (water glass) to a Class F ash can form a geopolymer.|$|E
25|$|Owing to its <b>pozzolanic</b> properties, fly ash {{is used as}} a {{replacement}} for Portland cement in concrete. The use of fly ash as a <b>pozzolanic</b> ingredient was recognized as early as 1914, although the earliest noteworthy study of its use was in 1937. Roman structures such as aqueducts or the Pantheon in Rome used volcanic ash or pozzolana (which possesses similar properties to fly ash) as pozzolan in their concrete. As pozzolan greatly improves the strength and durability of concrete, the use of ash is a key factor in their preservation.|$|E
25|$|When {{added to}} Portland cement as a {{pozzolan}} they can reduce chloride permeability and improve workability. They reduce weight and help moderate water content while allowing for slower drying which improves break strength. When added to lime mortars and lime-metakaolin mortars, synthetic zeolite pellets can act simultaneously as <b>pozzolanic</b> material and water reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash: A {{by-product}} of coal-fired electric generating plants, {{it is used}} to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general, siliceous fly ash is <b>pozzolanic,</b> while calcareous fly ash has latent hydraulic properties.|$|E
25|$|Cement {{was made}} of {{hydrated}} lime (calcium oxide) mixed with sand and water. The Romans discovered that substituting or supplementing the sand with a <b>pozzolanic</b> additive, such as volcanic ash, would produce a very hard cement, known as hydraulic mortar or hydraulic cement. They used it widely in structures such as buildings, public baths and aqueducts, ensuring their survival into the modern era.|$|E
25|$|Silica fume: A {{byproduct}} of the production of silicon and ferrosilicon alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller. This results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio and a much faster <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction. Silica fume is used to increase strength and durability of concrete, but generally {{requires the use of}} superplasticizers for workability.|$|E
25|$|Portland-fly ash cement {{contains}} up to 40% fly ash under ASTM standards (ASTM C595), or 35% under EN standards (EN 197-1). The fly ash is <b>pozzolanic,</b> so that {{ultimate strength}} is maintained. Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content, early strength {{can also be}} maintained. Where good quality cheap fly ash is available, this can be an economic alternative to ordinary Portland cement.|$|E
25|$|Lime (calcium oxide) {{was used}} on Crete {{and by the}} ancient Greeks. There is {{evidence}} that the Minoans of Crete used crushed potshards as an artificial pozzolan for hydraulic cement. It is uncertain where it was first discovered that a combination of hydrated non-hydraulic lime and a pozzolan produces a hydraulic mixture (see also: <b>Pozzolanic</b> reaction), but concrete made from such mixtures was used by the Ancient Macedonians and three centuries later on a large scale by Roman engineers.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks used {{volcanic}} tuff {{from the island}} of Thera as their pozzolan and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with lime. This mixture was able to set under water increasing its resistance. The material was called pozzolana {{from the town of}} Pozzuoli, west of Naples where volcanic ash was extracted. In the absence of <b>pozzolanic</b> ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.|$|E
2500|$|Inorganic {{materials}} that have <b>pozzolanic</b> or latent hydraulic properties, these very fine-grained materials {{are added to}} the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete (mineral admixtures), or as a replacement for Portland cement (blended cements). [...] Products which incorporate limestone, fly ash, blast furnace slag, and other useful materials with <b>pozzolanic</b> properties into the mix, are being tested and used. [...] This development is due to cement production being one of the largest producers (at about 5 to 10%) of global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as lowering costs, improving concrete properties, and recycling wastes.|$|E
2500|$|Fly ash {{produced}} {{from the burning}} of younger lignite or sub-bituminous coal, {{in addition to having}} <b>pozzolanic</b> properties, also has some self-cementing properties. In the presence of water, Class C fly ash hardens and gets stronger over time. Class C fly ash generally contains more than 20% lime (CaO). Unlike Class F, self-cementing Class C fly ash does not require an activator. Alkali and sulfate (...) contents are generally higher in Class C fly ashes.|$|E
2500|$|... zeolite-rich rock at {{low cost}} and the {{shortage}} of competing minerals and rocks {{are probably the most}} important factors for its large-scale use. According to the United States Geological Survey, it is likely that a significant percentage of the material sold as zeolites in some countries is ground or sawn volcanic tuff that contains only a small amount of zeolites. Some examples of such usage include dimension stone (as an altered volcanic tuff), lightweight aggregate, <b>pozzolanic</b> cement, and soil conditioners.|$|E
5000|$|Fuel ash - this <b>pozzolanic</b> {{material}} binds its constituent Si(OH)4 {{with the}} Ca² ions in a <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction. It contains burnt wood or coal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pozzolanic</b> {{reaction}} {{which occurs}} {{in the setting of}} the mixture of slaked lime and <b>pozzolanic</b> materials has also features similar to the alkali-silica reaction, mainly the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH).|$|E
50|$|Many pozzolans {{consist of}} a {{heterogeneous}} mixture of phases of different <b>pozzolanic</b> activity. Obviously, the content in reactive phases is an important property determining the overall reactivity. In general, the <b>pozzolanic</b> activity of phases thermodynamically stable at ambient conditions is low when compared to on an equal specific surface basis to less thermodynamically stable phase assemblages. Volcanic ash deposits containing large amounts of volcanic glass or zeolites are more reactive than quartz sands or detrital clay minerals. In this respect, the thermodynamic driving force behnind the <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction serves as a rough indicator of the potential reactivity of a (alumino-)silicate material. Similarly, materials showing structural disorder such as glasses show higher <b>pozzolanic</b> activities than crystalline ordered compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Fineness; {{the fine}} fly ash has more surface area {{available}} to react with lime, thus {{more will be}} the <b>pozzolanic</b> activity of fly ash. The greater <b>pozzolanic</b> activity contributes {{to the strength of}} fly ash brick. As per BIS it should not be more than 320 m2/kg.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pozzolanic</b> {{reaction}} is the chemical reaction {{that occurs in}} portland cement containing pozzolans. It is the main reaction involved in the Roman concrete invented in Ancient Rome. At {{the basis of the}} <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction stands a simple acid-base reaction between calcium hydroxide (as Portlandite) and silicic acid.|$|E
5000|$|GIC {{solution}} is polyacrylic acid. GIC is alumino-silicate (glass) bioceramic cement. As MTA is mainly composed of calcium-alumino-silicate, PAA (polyacrylic acid) is an accelerant for MTA. PAA set MTA within 15-18 minutes. More aluminate, faster set. Also high concentrated calcium chloride (CaCl2, 70% more) {{is well known}} as accelerator of Portland cement. So high concentrated -over 70%- Calcium Chloride solution sets MTA within 12 minutes. Or <b>Pozzolanic</b> reaction is also faster set chemical reaction of calcium silicate hydrate[...] But <b>pozzolanic</b> reacted cement has lower compressive strength at 15 MPa maximum. Easy broken and easily removable property of <b>pozzolanic</b> MTA.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pozzolanic</b> {{activity}} {{is a measure}} for the degree of reaction over time or the reaction rate between a pozzolan and Ca2+ or Ca(OH)2 {{in the presence of}} water. The rate of the <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction is dependent on the intrinsic characteristics of the pozzolan such as the specific surface area, the chemical composition and the active phase content.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pozzolanic</b> {{reaction}} is the chemical reaction {{that occurs in}} portland cement upon the addition of pozzolans. It is the main reaction involved in the Roman concrete invented in Ancient Rome and used to build, for example, the Pantheon. The <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction converts a silica-rich precursor with no cementing properties, to a calcium silicate, with good cementing properties.|$|E
5000|$|Calcium (CaO) content; the <b>pozzolanic</b> {{reactivity}} of fly ash {{is more in}} high calcium fly ash. The greater the <b>pozzolanic</b> activity leads to higher the strength of fly ash brick. As per ASTM C618 fly ash is classified into two; Class C contains more than 10% lime and Class F fly ash contains less than 10% lime.|$|E
50|$|Volcanic ash, pumice {{or other}} crushed {{volcanic}} aggregate {{are often used}} as <b>pozzolanic</b> agents.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{building}} with concrete and mortar next appeared in Greece. The excavation {{of the underground}} aqueduct of Megara revealed that a reservoir was coated with a <b>pozzolanic</b> mortar 12 mm thick. This aqueduct dates back to c. 500 BCE. <b>Pozzolanic</b> mortar is a lime based mortar, but is made with an additive of volcanic ash that allows it to be hardened underwater; thus it is known as hydraulic cement. The Greeks obtained the volcanic ash from the Greek islands Thira and Nisiros, or from the then Greek colony of Dicaearchia (Pozzuoli) near Naples, Italy. The Romans later improved the use and methods of making {{what became known as}} <b>pozzolanic</b> mortar and cement. Even later, the Romans used a mortar without pozzolana using crushed terra cotta, introducing aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide into the mix. This mortar was not as strong as <b>pozzolanic</b> mortar, but, because it was denser, it better resisted penetration by water.|$|E
50|$|Considered to have {{twice the}} {{reactivity}} {{of most other}} pozzolans, metakaolin is a valuable admixture for concrete/cement applications. Replacing portland cement with 8-20% (by weight) metakaolin produces a concrete mix, which exhibits favorable engineering properties, including: the filler effect, the acceleration of OPC hydration, and the <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction. The filler effect is immediate, while the effect of <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction occurs between 3 and 14 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{setting speed}} can be {{increased}} by using impure limestone in the kiln, to form a hydraulic lime that will set on contact with water. Such a lime must be stored as a dry powder. Alternatively, a <b>pozzolanic</b> material such as calcined clay or brick dust may {{be added to the}} mortar mix. Addition of a <b>pozzolanic</b> material will make the mortar set reasonably quickly by reaction with the water.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pozzolanic</b> {{material}} {{is by definition}} capable of binding calcium hydroxide {{in the presence of}} water. Therefore, the chemical measurement of this <b>pozzolanic</b> activity represents a way of evaluating <b>pozzolanic</b> materials. This can be done by directly measuring the amount of calcium hydroxide a pozzolan consumes over time. At high water to binder ratio (suspended solutions), this can be measured by titrimety or by spectroscopic techniques. At lower water to binder ratios (pastes), thermal analysis or X-ray powder diffraction techniques are commonly used to determine remaining calcium hydroxide contents. Other direct methods have been developed that aim to directly measure the degree of reaction of the pozzolan itself. Here, selective dissolutions, X-ray powder diffraction or scanning electron microscopy image analysis methods have been used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pozzolanic</b> {{reaction}} {{is a long}} term reaction, which involves dissolved silicic acid, water and CaO or Ca(OH)2 or other pozzolans to form a strong cementation matrix. This process is often irreversible. Sufficient amount of free calcium ion and a high pH of 12 and above is needed to initiate and maintain the pozzolanic reaction. This is because at a pH of around 12, the solubility of silicon and aluminium ions is high enough to support the <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction.|$|E
50|$|Physical surface {{adsorption}} is {{not considered}} as {{being part of the}} <b>pozzolanic</b> activity, because no irreversible molecular bonds are formed in the process.|$|E

5000|$|Add {{very fine}} {{siliceous}} materials {{to neutralize the}} excessive alkalinity of cement with silicic acid by deliberately provoking a controlled <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction at the early stage of the cement setting. Convenient <b>pozzolanic</b> materials {{to add to the}} mix may be, e.g., pozzolan, silica fume, fly ash, or metakaolin. These react preferentially with the cement alkalis without formation of an expansive pressure, because siliceous minerals in fine particles convert to alkali silicate and then to calcium silicate without formation of semipermeable reaction rims.|$|E
5000|$|Portland {{pozzolana}} cement is ordinary Portland cement blended with <b>pozzolanic</b> materials (power-station fly ash, burnt clays, ash from burnt plant material or silicious earths), either together or separately. Portland clinker is ground with gypsum and <b>pozzolanic</b> materials which, {{though they do}} not have cementing properties in themselves, combine chemically with Portland cement in the presence of water to form extra strong cementing material which resists wet cracking, thermal cracking and has a high degree of cohesion and workability in concrete and mortar ...|$|E
50|$|Indirect methods {{comprise}} on the {{one hand}} methods that investigate which material properties are responsible for the pozzolan’s reactivity with portlandite. Material properties of interest are the (re)active silica and alumina content, the specific surface area and/or the reactive mineral and amorphous phases of the <b>pozzolanic</b> material. Other methods indirectly determine the extent of the <b>pozzolanic</b> activity by measuring an indicative physical property of the reacting system. Measurements of the electrical conductivity, chemical shrinkage of the pastes or the heat evolution by heat flow calorimetry reside in the latter category.|$|E
