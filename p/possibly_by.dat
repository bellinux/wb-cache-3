5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by Leonardo da Vinci circa 1514 (or <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> one of his followers at his direction), was a world map in which the spherical {{surface of the earth}} was divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|Arden of Feversham is a {{play about}} the murder of Thomas Arden written around 1590, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> William Shakespeare or Christopher Marlowe.

5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2micrometers. The surface pressure {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E

5|$|The Thalassocalycida, only {{discovered}} in 1978 and known from only one species, are medusa-like, with bodies that are shortened in the oral-aboral direction, and short comb-rows {{on the surface}} furthest from the mouth, originating from near the aboral pole. They capture prey by movements of the bell and <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> using two short tentacles.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylindrical}} stone dovecote has a cone shaped roof. It contains over 300 nest boxes.

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was reinforced}} with buttresses {{and an additional}} courtyard built within the bailey around 1450, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> Thomas Clifford. During the Wars of the Roses between the rival houses of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, the Clifford supported the Lancastrians. Thomas died in 1455, followed by his son John in 1461; Brough was temporarily seized from the Cliffords by the Yorkists, until John's son Henry was restored to his lands in 1485 by Henry VII.|$|E

5|$|The {{generally}} accepted hypothesis among breeders {{is that the}} Maine Coon is descended from the pairings of local short-haired domestic cats and long-haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers (<b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> Captain Charles Coon) or 11th-century Norsemen. The connection to the Norsemen {{is seen in the}} strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that {{is said to be a}} descendant of cats that traveled with the Norsemen.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E
5|$|While {{some species}} of procellariid have populations that {{number in the}} millions, many species are much less common and several are {{threatened}} with extinction. Human activities have caused dramatic declines {{in the numbers of}} some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the IUCN 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids are threatened by introduced species on their breeding grounds, marine fisheries, pollution, exploitation and <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> climate change.|$|E

5|$|A castle {{may have}} been {{constructed}} on Castle Island by 1257, when the 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time and were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> the forces of William Wallace.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Board of Works in 1751 concluded that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation. In particular, it lacked a kitchen and scullery, and the cooking was still being {{carried out in the}} ground floor rooms of the Jewel Tower. Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The Jewel Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus {{discovered that she}} was conspiring against him and had her placed under house arrest in Antioch. By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died in Antioch, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown. Macrinus remained in Antioch {{instead of going to}} Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.|$|E
5|$|Henry became King of England {{following}} the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting. On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the New Forest, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow was fired, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had fired the fatal shot, or because he had been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1071, {{the sixth}} Count of Flanders, Arnulf III, {{was killed in}} the first Battle of Cassel by the forces of Robert the Frisian in a dispute over the {{succession}} to the title of count. Although Arnulf was numerically superior and was supported by King Philip I of France, Robert was able to defeat his rival's army and took the title of Count of Flanders with the acquiescence of Philip I after a further five years of struggle. The town was re-fortified, <b>possibly</b> <b>by</b> Robert, with a castle and a new set of walls built on the remains of the old Roman walls. The castle does not survive today – it was already in ruins by the early 18th century – but is depicted on old engravings as a large square tower, the Tour Grise, dominating the western flank of the hill.|$|E
