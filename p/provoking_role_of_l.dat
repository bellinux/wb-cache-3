40|$|L 1, a neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is widely expressed in the nervous system and important in axonal outgrowth, guidance, synapse formation, and signaling. Gene deletion studies emphasize the significance <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 1 during development of {{the central nervous system}} and L 1 is crucial for the topographic targeting of retinal axons. In contrast to the brain and retina, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 1 in the inner ear is largely unknown. While previous studies have localized L 1 in the developing inner ear of the chicken and mouse, its function during the innervation of the cochlea still remains largely unclear.

40|$|The {{speech of}} late second {{language}} (L 2) learners is generally marked by an accent. The dominant theoretical perspective attributes accents to deficient L 2 perception arising from a transfer <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 1 phonology, which {{is thought to}} influence L 2 perception and production. In this study we evaluate the explanatory <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 2 perception in L 2 production and explore alternative explanations arising from the L 1 phonological system, such as for example, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 1 production. Specifically we examine the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> an individual’s <b>L</b> 1 productions in the production <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 2 vowel contrasts. Fourteen Spanish adolescents studying French at school were assessed on their perception and production of the mid-close/mid-open contrasts, /ø-œ/ and /e-ε/, which are, respectively, acoustically distinct from Spanish sounds, or similar to them. The participants’ native productions were explored to assess 1) the variability {{in the production of}} native vowels (i. e., the compactness of vowel categories in F 1 /F 2 acoustic space), and 2) the position of the vowels in the acoustic space. The results revealed that although poorly perceived contrasts were generally produced poorly, there was no correlation between individual performance in perception and production, and no effect <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 2 perception on L 2 production in mixed-effects regression analyses. This result is consistent with a growing body of psycholinguistic and neuroimaging research that suggest partial dissociations between L 2 perception and production. In contrast, individual differences in the compactness and position of native vowels predicted L 2 production accuracy. These results point to existence of surface transfer <b>of</b> individual <b>L</b> 1 phonetic realisations to L 2 space and demonstrate that pre-existing features of the native space in production partly determine how new sounds can be accommodated in that space...|$|R

40|$|L 1, a neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in neuronal migration and differentiation and axon outgrowth and guidance. Mutations in the human and mouse L 1 gene result in similarly severe neurological abnormalities.

This mutant (L 1 fy+) did not show the overt morphological and behavioral abnormalities observed previously in constitutive L 1 -deficient (L 1 -/-) mice; however, there was an increase in basal excitatory synaptic transmission that was not apparent in L 1 -/-mice. Similar to L 1 -/- mice, no defects in short- and long-term potentiation in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus were observed. Interestingly, L 1 fy+ mice showed decreased anxiety in the open field and elevated plus-maze, contrary to L 1 -/- mice, and altered place learning in the water maze, similar to L 1 -/- mice. Thus, mice conditionally deficient in L 1 expression in the adult brain share some abnormalities, but also display different ones, as compared with L 1 -/- mice, highlighting the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>L</b> 1 in the regulation of synaptic transmission and behavior in adulthood. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
