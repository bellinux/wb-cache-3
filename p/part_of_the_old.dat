5|$|In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms {{one of the}} {{buildings}} making up Redland High School for Girls. In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Shambles, and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge. The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides. A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. At {{the time of the}} Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises. The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762–9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} seen by Llwyd, Jones and Glynne was {{demolished}} {{and the present}} structure was erected, designed by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor.

Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895.

Sprott Lane, a minor loop, was extended along a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Trunk 7 for a few households.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very {{similar to those of the}} lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E

5|$|Described by German {{zoologist}} Friedrich Boie in 1826, {{the genus}} Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> World warbler family Sylvidae, but {{has now been}} split off as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff's closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli's, wood and plain leaf warblers.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of the northern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English in language and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been {{under the control of the}} king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E

5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund {{the construction of the}} castle. Brougham Castle was constructed in the northern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son John was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.|$|E
