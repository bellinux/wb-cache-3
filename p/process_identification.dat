40|$|Abstract. The bias {{derivative}} {{method for}} aeroengine’s State Variable Model(SVM) doesn’t have a satisfying accuracy.

In this method, the coefficient matrices of the SVM are identified based on the input and output of the nonlinear model, according to the principle that the step responses of the SVM and the nonlinear model should be consistent. Then, the SVMs of small perturbation about steady operating points of an engine are established. Simulation {{results show that the}} SVMs established by the <b>process</b> <b>identification</b> based method have a good fidelity both in terms of steady and dynamic performance...|$|E
