5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, <b>phonation</b> type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E

40|$|This study revisits {{the issue}} of tonal {{registers}} by exploring the cues used in producing andperceiving the five level tones of Black Miao. Both production and perception experiments show that non-modal <b>phonations</b> are very important cues for tonal contrasts. Two different kinds of non-modal <b>phonations</b> that either enhance pitch contrasts or provide an additional contrastive cue divide tonal levels into several registers. Benefiting {{from more than one}} cue, 11, 33 and 55 are well distinguished in the tonal space; by contrast, 22 and 44, only contrasting in pitch, are the most confusable tones. The tonal registers model can explain the different uses of non-modal <b>phonations</b> across languages...|$|R

25|$|The vocal folds, {{also known}} {{commonly}} as vocal cords or voice reeds, {{are composed of}} twin infoldings of mucous membrane stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx. They vibrate, modulating the flow of air being expelled from the lungs during <b>phonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Burmese is a tonal language, {{which means}} phonemic {{contrasts}} {{can be made}} on the basis of the tone of a vowel.

However, some linguists consider Burmese a pitch-register language like Shanghainese.|$|E
25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act {{and it is}} difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, <b>phonation</b> only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like <b>phonation,</b> resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E

25|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} human vocal fold lamina propria {{are essential for}} their vibration, and depend on the composition and structure of their extracellular matrix (ECM). Adult VF have a layered structure {{which is based on}} the layers differential in ECM distribution. Newborns on the other hand, do not have this layered structure. Their VF are uniform, and immature, making their viscoelastic properties most likely unsuitable for <b>phonation.</b> HA plays a very important role in the vocal fold biomechanics. In fact, HA has been described as the ECM molecule that not only contributes to the maintenance of an optimal tissue viscosity that allows <b>phonation,</b> but also of an optimal tissue stiffness that allows frequency control. CD44 is a cell surface receptor for HA. Cells such as fibroblasts are responsible for synthesizing ECM molecules. Cell surface matrix receptors in return, feed back to the cells through cell-matrix interaction, allowing the cell to regulate its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|The Van der Pol {{equation}} has a {{long history}} of being used in both the physical and biological sciences. For instance, in biology, Fitzhugh and Nagumo extended the equation in a planar field as a model for action potentials of neurons.

25|$|Only {{the tone}} of the speech is saved in the whistle, while aspects as {{articulation}} and <b>phonation</b> are eliminated. These are replaced by other features such as stress and rhythmical variations. However, some languages, like that of the Zezuru who speak a Shona-derived dialect, include articulation so that consonants interrupt the flow of the whistle. A similar language is the Tsonga whistle language used in the highlands in the Southern parts of Mozambique.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{pediatric}} voice assessment guidelines include instrumental {{measurements of}} fundamental frequency (F 0) and the perturbation indices jitter and shimmer. In children below 10 years, gender, age, {{height and weight}} effects on these parameters have been inconsistently characterized. Recent research in healthy children showed, that differences in habitual speaking voice intensity (voice SPL) under the usual assessment procedure significantly affect jitter and shimmer. These effects were reduced in <b>phonations</b> with controlled voice SPL > 80 dBA. Reliable measurement methods and description of physiologic influencing factors are essential to identify pathologic voices. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional single cohort study investigates in children between 5; 0 and 9; 11 years how gender, age, height and weight affect voice F 0, jitter and shimmer in <b>phonations</b> at individually "medium" voice intensity (modeling the usual clinical practice) and with controlled voice SPL > 80 dBA. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 68 vocally healthy children (39 f/ 29 m) aged 5; 0 - 9; 11 years provided 3 prolonged <b>phonations</b> of/a/at individually "medium" and controlled voice intensity at "> 80 dBA" (visual feedback, 10 cm distance).

Also, <b>phonation</b> and resonation of sound occur during speech. Often, atrophy of the testes with resulting impotence occurs.|$|E
25|$|In linguistics, a {{register}} {{language is a}} language which combines tone and vowel <b>phonation</b> into a single phonological system. Within speech pathology, the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and {{a certain type of}} sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.|$|E
25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of <b>phonation</b> is {{enhanced}} in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.|$|E

Swati, by comparison, has clicks at only one place (dental [...] ), but five (or even six) manners and <b>phonations.</b> The reduced variety of clicks in Phuthi may be partly related to the nearly total absence of prenasalised consonants in Phuthi, assuming (for example) *nkx, *ngx would be analyzed as equivalent to prenasalized *ng, *nk.|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear source–filter {{coupling}} {{has been}} demonstrated in computer simulations, in excised larynx experiments, and in physical models, {{but not in a}} consistent and unequivocal way in natural human <b>phonations.</b> Eighteen subjects (nine adult males and nine adult females) performed three vocal exercises that represented a combination of various fundamental frequency and formant glides. The goal {{of this study was to}} pinpoint the proportion of source instabilities that are due to nonlinear source–tract coupling. It was hypothesized that vocal fold vibration is maximally destabilized when F 0 crosses F 1, where the acoustic load changes dramatically. A companion paper provides the theoretical underpinnings. Expected manifestations of a source–filter interaction were sudden frequency jumps, subharmonic generation, or chaotic vocal fold vibrations that coincide with F 0 –F 1 crossovers. Results indicated that the bifurcations occur more often in <b>phonations</b> with F 0 –F 1 crossovers, suggesting that nonlinear source–filter coupling is partly responsible for source instabilities. Furthermore it was observed that male subjects show more bifurcations in <b>phonations</b> with F 0 –F 1 crossovers, presumably because in normal speech they are less likely to encounter these crossovers as much as females and hence have less practice in suppressing unwanted instabilities...|$|R
25|$|The hypohydrotic {{symptoms}} of ectodermal dysplasia described above are evidenced {{not only in}} the skin of affected individuals, but also in their <b>phonation</b> and voice production. Because the vocal folds may not be as hydrated as is necessary during the adduction phase of vocal fold vibration (due to lack of lubrication), a complete seal may not be accomplished between the folds and mucosal wave movement may be disrupted. This results in air escapement between the folds and the production of breathy voice, which often accompanies the skin abnormalities of ectodermal dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Wound {{healing is}} a natural {{regeneration}} process of dermal and epidermal tissue involving a sequence of biochemical events. These events are complex and can be categorized into three stages: inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. The study on vocal fold wound healing is not as extensive as that on animal models due to the limited availability of human vocal folds. Vocal fold injuries can {{have a number of}} causes including chronic overuse, chemical, thermal and mechanical trauma such as smoking, laryngeal cancer, and surgery. Other benign pathological phenomena like polyps, vocal fold nodules and edema will also introduce disordered <b>phonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nerves {{within the}} corticospinal tract are {{involved}} in movement of muscles of the body.

By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain.|$|E
