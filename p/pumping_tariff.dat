30|$|The {{electrical}} grid system operation costs will mainly {{result from the}} electricity tariff (electricity price) in cent/kWh, with an additional overhead and manpower cost of 2  % per year of the initial grid cost. Considering the initial cost indicated in section “Electrical grid through Disi desert initial costs”, overheads and manpower cost about US$ 3, 571 /year for each well, totalling US$ 80, 000 per well for the whole study period. The water <b>pumping</b> <b>tariff</b> equals 60 cent/kWh according to the retail tariff of electricity according the National Electric Power Company of Jordan (NEPCO) (National Electric Power Company of Jordan NEPCO 2011). Addition of taxes and the soon-expected rise in electricity prices would approximately turn this value to 64 cent/kWh. According to the historical data of electricity prices in Jordan at certain periods, the rise of electricity tariffs has been fluctuating up and down due to {{the rate of inflation}} of those periods. In this study, the electricity tariff is assumed to be affected only by an inflation rate of 5  % per year, Blignaut et al. (Blignaut et al. 2005).|$|E

The tariffs are larger than for the Non-domestic RHI, but are paid over seven years, rather than for 20 years for non-domestic buildings. See table of tariffs for the Domestic RHI.|$|R

This paper examines the implications of liberalising trade in renewable energy, focussing on several representative fuels and technologies (charcoal, solar photovoltaic systems and their complements, and wind turbines and wind <b>pumps).</b> Eliminating <b>tariffs</b> on renewable energy and associated goods — which are 15 % or higher on an ad valorem basis in many developing countries — would reduce a burden on consumers of energy, particularly people living in rural areas of developing countries, as it is in such areas that many renewableenergy technologies are making, and are likely to make, their greatest contribution. Manufacturers located in OECD countries would benefit from increased trade in renewable-energy technologies and components, but so would a growing number of companies based in developing countries. The elimination of tariffs would also help to level the playing field between aid-financed goods, which often benefit from tariff waivers, and goods imported through normal market transactions, which often do not. For the maximum benefits of trade liberalisation in renewable-energy technologies to be realised, however, additional reforms may be required in importing countries’ domestic policies, especially those affecting the electricity sector in general, rural electrification in particular, and the environment. trade, environmental goods, renewable energy, developing countries, environmental technologies...|$|R
