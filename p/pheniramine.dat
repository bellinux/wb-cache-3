Group I (negative control) and group II (positive control) received sterile distilled water intramuscularly b. i. d. for 10 days. Groups II–VI were immunized on day 3 with intravenous injection of SRBC (1 × 109 cells/ml). Blood samples were collected on pre-immunization day 0, as well as on days 7 -, 14 -, 21 -, 28 -, and 58 -post-immunization. Biochemical parameters AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin [total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), and indirect bilirubin (IB) ] were determined. On each experimental day, the mean values of serum enzymes and bilirubin in group I and group II showed no significant changes while in group III, IV, V, and VI, these enzymes and bilirubin levels showed significant changes (p< 0. 05), when compared with their experimental values within the group.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the {{contractile}} status of neonatal small intestinal smooth muscle of dilated pre-atretic part of intestinal atresia to resolve debatable issues related to mechanisms of persistent dysmotility after surgical repair. Materials and Methods: A total of 34 longitudinally sectioned strips were prepared from pre-atretic dilated part of freshly excised 8 jejunal atresia type III a cases. Spontaneous as well as acetylcholine- and histamine-induced contractions were recorded in vitro by using organ bath preparations. Chemically evoked contractions were further evaluated after application of atropine (muscarinic blocker), <b>pheniramine</b> (H 1 blocker), and lignocaine (neuronal blocker) to ascertain receptors and neuronal involvement. Histological examinations of strips were made by using Masson trichrome stain to assess the fibrotic changes. Results: All 34 strips, except four showed spontaneous contractions with mean frequency and amplitude of 5. 49 ± 0. 26 /min and 24. 41 ± 5. 26 g/g wet tissue respectively. The response to ACh was nearly twice as compared to histamine for equimolar concentrations (100 μM). ACh (100 μM) induced contractions were attenuated (by 60 %) by atropine. Histamine (100 μM) -induced contractions was blocked by <b>pheniramine</b> (0. 32 μM) and lignocaine (4 μM) by 74 % and 78 %, respectively. Histopathological examination showed varying degree of fibrotic changes in muscle layers. Conclusions: Pre-atretic dilated part of jejunal atresia retains functional activity but with definitive histopathologic abnormalities. It is suggested that excision of a length of pre-atretic part and early stimulation of peristalsis by locally acting cholinomimetic or H 1 agonist may help in reducing postoperative motility problems in atresia patients...|$|E

Detection was performed by a DAD (Diode Array Detector) at 210 nm Separation time was less than 8 min After experimental conditions optimization, the proposed method was validated Precision of migration time (t(m)) ranging from 0 19 % to 0 29 % and corrected peak area (A(c)) from 2. 54 % to 3 680, 4 The linearity of detector response was tested in the range 5 - 40 mu g ml(- 1) obtaining the 0. 9962 <= r(2) 9982 LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery) and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method Analysis of the pharmaceutical real sample was performe...|$|E
