50|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, {{concrete}} was mixed {{on the job}} site and transported from the cement mixer to the formwork, either in wheelbarrows or in buckets lifted by cranes.

They <b>pumped</b> <b>concrete</b> to a height of 38 m and a distance of 120 m. Shortly after, a concrete pump was patented in Holland in 1932 by Jacob Cornelius Kweimn (Jacobus Cornelius Kooijman).

30|$|When {{concrete}} {{is being}} transported through a pipe, the lubrication layer is formed at {{the interface between}} concrete and the pipe wall and is the major factor facilitating concrete pumping. A possible mechanism that illustrates {{to the formation of}} the layer is the shear-induced particle migration and determining the rheological parameters is a paramount factor to simulate the concrete flow in pipe. In this study, numerical simulations considering various rheological models in the shear-induced particle migration were conducted and compared with 170 Â m full-scale pumping tests. It was found that the multimodal viscosity model representing concrete as a three-phase suspension consisting of cement paste, sand and gravel can accurately simulate the lubrication layer. Moreover, considering the particle shape effects of concrete constituents with increased intrinsic viscosity can more exactly predict the pipe flow of <b>pumped</b> <b>concrete.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{the pipe}} flow of <b>pumped</b> <b>concrete,</b> the shear stress {{is the highest}} at {{the wall of the}} pipe and linearly {{decreases}} as the position moves {{to the center of the}} pipe. The stress gradient is a driving force to move particles toward the center of the pipe as described in the first term of the right side in Eq. (1). The increase of the particle concentration due to the migration may increase the viscosity and the yield stress, which hinder the additional migration of the particles as described in the second term of the right side in Eq. (1). As a result, the concentration of the particle inside the pipe is determined by the balance between the two actions, namely, the migration due to the stress gradient and the hindrance due to the increased rheological properties.|$|E
30|$|During {{concrete}} pumping, {{the migration}} and redistribution of particles {{occur in a}} pipe and the lubrication layer that forms between the bulk concrete and the pipe wall is the governing factor determining the flow behavior. In order to identify flow behavior of pumping, in this study, the viscoelastic properties related to the microstructural behavior of a flocculated suspension were examined by using dynamic oscillatory measurements. Cement paste {{is assumed to be}} a constituent material of the lubrication layer and ten cases of mixing design are employed by changing the proportions of mineral admixtures. The relationship between the yield stress obtained from the steady shear test and the dynamic modulus resulted from the oscillatory shear measurement was derived and the implications of the correlation are discussed. Moreover, based on the investigation of the viscoelastic properties with oscillatory measurements, the initial behavior of <b>pumped</b> <b>concrete</b> was analyzed systematically.|$|E

30|$|As {{stated in}} the introduction, to predict the pipe flow of <b>pumped</b> <b>concrete,</b> the {{lubrication}} layer should be carefully investigated. Several possible mechanisms illustrating the formation of its layer {{could be found in}} existing studies (Kaplan et al. 2005; Kwon et al. 2013; Choi et al. 2013 b; Phillips et al. 1992; Jo et al. 2012; Wallevik 2008; Koehler et al. 2006). In this study, the shear-induced particle migration which demonstrated that particles in suspension migrate across the streamlines from a region of a higher shear rate to a region of a lower shear rate was considered as a major possible mechanism that contributes to the formation of the lubrication layer. Leighton et al. (Leighton and Acrivos 1987 a, b) suggested phenomenological models for particle migration in non-homogeneous shear flows that typically result from spatial variation in irreversible interaction frequency and effective viscosity. Phillips et al. (1992) adapted the scaling arguments of Leighton and Acrivos (1987 a, b) and proposed a diffusive flux equation to describe the time evolution of the particle concentration based on a two-body interaction model. In this study, the particle diffusive model proposed by Phillips et al. (1992), combined with general flow equations, was extended to solve the flow of concrete and predict the particle concentration distribution of suspensions in a pressure driven pipe flow.|$|E
30|$|The {{existence}} of the lubrication layer was first suggested by Aleekseev (1952) and Weber (1968). Morinaga (1973) noted that based on theoretical flow behaviors of concrete, the pumping of concrete {{would not be possible}} without the formation of the lubrication layer. Sakuta et al. (1979) reported that the flow properties of the bulk material were irrelevant; the only property that matters is the ability of the material to form this layer. Jacobsen et al. (2009) conducted experimental research with colored fresh concrete after flowing ordinary concrete to observe the flow conditions in various pipes. Rossig and Frischbeton (1974) pumped colored concretes in a pipe for the direct observation of the flow profiles. Their results revealed the {{existence of}} a high velocity and paste rich zone at the vicinity of the pipe wall. The thickness of the lubrication layer was estimated in the range of 1 Â mm and 5 Â mm (Choi et al. 2013 a, b; Browne and Bamforth 1977). Feys and Schutter (2005) reported that the thickness and rheological properties of the layer appear to depend on the mix proportions of the <b>pumped</b> <b>concrete.</b> The macroscopic consequences of this layer on the pumping pressure were considered by introducing interface properties measured macroscopically using a tribometer to the pumping process prediction (Kaplan et al. 2005). In summary, the formation and characteristics of the lubrication layer are essential on concrete pumping and thus a detailed analysis of the layer is necessary to understand flow behaviors.|$|E

The flow ability, passing ability, and self densification of Self-Consolidating concrete are beneficial when repair is needed for tight and heavily-reinforced situations. The research investigation presented herein was intended to study the influence of pumping on the fresh properties of self-consolidating Concretes (SCC). The selected SCCs were made with a constant water-to-cementitious materials ratio of 0. 40, a uniform cement content of 390. 38 kg/m 3 and a constant coarse-to-fine aggregate ratio of 1. 083. Both polycarboxylate-based High Rank Water-Reducing Admixture (HRWRA) and Viscosity Modifying Admixture (VMA) were used to produce self-consolidating concretes with a slump flow of 635 Â± 25 mm, VSI of 0, and T 50, of 2 to 5 seconds. A pumping distances of 60 m {{was used to evaluate}} the flow ability, passing ability, stability, rheology (yield stress and plastic viscosity), air content and air void characteristics of the selected self-consolidating concretes. Test results revealed that the pumping adversely affected the fresh performance of the self-consolidating concrete by decreasing the unconfined workability, flow rate, and passing ability; and by increasing the dynamic segregation resistance. The impact of pumping on the rheological properties of self-consolidating concrete was manifested by a moderate increase in relative yield stress and a significant decrease in relative plastic viscosity. The air content remained unaffected by the pumping action, whereas the air voids characteristic was altered through size increases of the air bubbles...|$|E
