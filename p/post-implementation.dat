40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) as {{business}} system integration evolves in the <b>post-implementation</b> phase {{due to the}} change in business requirements caused by competitive environments. Uncontrolled or poorly managed changes may lead to low quality, chaotic systems and data {{that are difficult to}} use and maintain. Constructivist approaches to effectively manage <b>post-implementation</b> change in ERP systems from the design-related standpoint are currently lacking. Research in this field mostly focuses on CSF (Critical Success Factors) of the <b>post-implementation</b> phase rather than providing a well-structured approach for managing the changes. Thus, this thesis is designed to close this gap by devising methods and tools for controlled ERP <b>post-implementation</b> change management to support stakeholders, such {{as business}} analysts and developers, in assessing the impact of the modification. Our methodology draws a parallel approach between ERP <b>post-implementation</b> change management and traditional engineering change management in product design and proposes a framework for impact analysis of ERP <b>post-implementation</b> modifications. The framework defines a meta-model of the dependencies among ERP entities such as business processes, functions, and data. Based on the identified dependencies, the framework allows to automatically analyse the impact of a proposed change through a set of impact analysis mechanisms. Then, evaluate the scope and depth of a proposed change through a set of impact assessment metrics. As part of the evaluation process, our framework has been embedded in a software tool i. e. decision support system to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Then, provides an empirical study to validate the research method and the tool through a panel of ERP experts and end users. The result confirms that our framework provides scientifically grounded method to manage ERP <b>post-implementation</b> modification in a controlled manner.

40|$|Background Pre-operative immunonutrition for upper {{gastrointestinal}} {{cancer patients}} {{is provided in}} a number of Australian tertiary hospitals. However, previous studies yielded inconsistent results; limited information on patient acceptance of pre-operative supplementation is likely to be an as yet unexplored contributing factor. Aims To determine patient acceptance of a pre-operative immunonutrition supplement protocol and to compare post-operative outcomes pre- and <b>post-implementation</b> of the protocol. Methods A retrospective review of medical records was undertaken for upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery patients pre- and <b>post-implementation</b> of a pre-operative immunonutrition protocol. Endpoints noted were surgery type, timing of attendance at the pre-admission clinic, post-operative complications, intensive care unit admissions, diet progression and length of stay. Patient feedback on the immunonutrition protocol and supplement acceptability was obtained via interview. Results The audit identified 74 patients as having undergone upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery (36 patients pre- and 38 patients <b>post-implementation).</b> Less than half of the postimplementation patients attended the pre-admission clinic as per protocol. Infectious and non-infectious complication rates were similar between the two groups. Number of days until patients received full diets post-operatively were 0. 80 days shorter <b>post-implementation,</b> but not statistically significant. Patients in the <b>post-implementation</b> group with infective complications spent significantly longer time nil by mouth {{than those who did not}} incur complications (26. 15 vs 17. 13 days, p= 0. 024). Length of stay was 1. 5 days shorter in the <b>post-implementation</b> group but not statistically different. Conclusion We found no difference in post-operative outcomes; however, the pre- and <b>post-implementation</b> comparison was limited by poor adherence to the protocol as a consequence of late attendance at pre-admission clinic. Of those who did attend as planned, patient acceptance was high. Future studies incorporating prospective, quantitative pre-operative immunonutrition intake are needed...|$|E

Conventional e-health <b>post-implementation</b> evaluations tend to emphasize technology-related (mostly positive) outcomes.

There remains limited focus on the <b>post-implementation</b> outcomes for users, particularly those directly involved in e-health design processes. This paper presents detailed analysis and insights into the outcomes experienced <b>post-implementation</b> by a cohort of junior clinicians involved in developing an electronic clinical handover tool in Tasma-nia, Australia.

40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) {{systems have}} now become an {{integral}} part of organisational infrastructures. However, many companies are confronted with a wide range of risks at the <b>post-implementation</b> stage, namely when using, maintaining and enhancing their ERP systems. In spite urgent need for research in this area, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on <b>post-implementation</b> in contrast with a over abundance of studies focusing on implementation and project management aspects.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to identify, assess and explore {{potential}} risks that can affect long-term viability of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the <b>post-implementation</b> and exploitation phase. Design/methodology/approach – The research took a large Chinese private group as a case study. A theoretical ERP risk ontology, which was adopted from the literature, was used to frame the study and generate data collection tools. Two questionnaires were thus designed and used to explore ERP <b>post-implementation</b> risks in the case company. Findings – The study identified 37 risk events, of which seven were identified as the most critical for ERP exploitation in the case company. The findings show that organisational and human-related risks are the crucial factors for potential ERP failure and not the usually suspect technical risks. Research limitations/implications – This study contributes to the knowledge of ERP in general, and provides valuable insights into ERP <b>post-implementation</b> risks in large companies in particular. Practical implications – The findings will not just be useful in supporting ERP risk identification and management in the large Chinese companies, but will also be beneficial to other large companies in general, which may be confronted with similar ERP exploitation challenges. Originality/value – The majority of large companies in China and in the West have implemented ERP systems and engaged in the system <b>post-implementation</b> phase. Most of the existing literature in the field focuses on the process of implementation. This paper looks forward to the risks involved in the <b>post-implementation</b> phase.

Many studies in the literature also report the power of Knowledge Management (KM) to assist organisational superiors in ES <b>post-implementation</b> phase. These studies highlight the capability of one of the most neglected KM processes, namely, Knowledge Integration (KI), and explore the crucial involvement of organisational superiors with different leadership styles (such as transformational and transactional) in the ES <b>post-implementation</b> phase through the employment of quantitative research methods. The present study commenced with an intensive literature review, and a series of interviews with company experts in order to identify the research gap and confirm the validity and reliability of the constructs in the developed survey. A total of 508 valid survey responses were analysed using the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. Mediating effect tests were performed using bootstrapping procedures to test the role of KI mechanisms as a mediator. The results indicate that KI mechanisms fully mediate the relationship between transactional leadership style and ES success. Conversely, KI mechanisms partially mediate the relationship of transformational leadership style and ES success.
