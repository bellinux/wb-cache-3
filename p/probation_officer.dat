40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the effects of <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> and their work. The {{following}} questions have been asked to come to a conclusion: How do <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> view their work and the purpose of it? What are the effects of <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> work? The approach of the study is of a qualitative nature and has been conducted by interviewing three officers of the correctional service system, three <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> and two ex-criminals that have been on probation. The selection is based on a snowball type selection. To analyse the results of the study we have applied previous research and phenomenological theory to examine the experience of correctional service <b>officers,</b> <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> and ex criminals. The results of our empirical study show that motivation is a key factor for successful results of <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> work. The effects <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> and their work have on preventing crime are uncertain, but the study shows that the experiences of the work of <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> are positive and that the work is meaningful to the clients. The supportive and prosocial aspects of <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> work has been identified as a priority. Our study also shows that the work of <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> has to change in order to successfully prevent crime and a number of improvements are suggested, such as giving the <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> specific assignments and giving the <b>probation</b> <b>officers</b> a better education before they are given assignment...|$|R

5|$|At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley {{laid out}} an agenda {{to reduce the}} county's debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite the Republican {{majority}} on the Court, most of the measures he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned.
