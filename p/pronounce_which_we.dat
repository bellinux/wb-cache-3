60|$|Finally, we {{have not}} such good {{evidence}} with fowls as with pigeons, of all the breeds having descended from a single primitive stock. In both cases the argument of fertility must go for something; in both we have the improbability of man having succeeded in ancient times in thoroughly domesticating several supposed species,--most of these supposed species being extremely abnormal as compared with their natural allies,--all being now either unknown or extinct, though the parent-form of no other domesticated bird has been lost. But in searching for the supposed parent- stocks of the various breeds of the pigeon, we were enabled to confine our search to species having peculiar habits of life; whilst with fowls {{there is nothing in}} their habits in any marked manner distinct from those of other gallinaceous birds. In the case of pigeons, I have shown that purely- bred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races frequently resemble, or revert to, the wild rock-pigeon in general colour and in each characteristic mark. With fowls we have facts of a similar nature, but less strongly <b>pronounced,</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> will now discuss.|$|R
40|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation we simultaneously ionize and excite one helium atom of a helium dimer (He_ 2) in a shakeup process. The populated {{states of the}} dimer ion (i. e. He^[*+](n = 2; 3) -He) are found to deexcite via interatomic coulombic decay. This leads to the emission of a second electron from the neutral site and a subsequent coulomb explosion. In this letter we present a measurement of the momenta of fragments that are created during this reaction. The electron energy distribution and the kinetic energy release of the two He^+ ions show <b>pronounced</b> oscillations <b>which</b> <b>we</b> attribute {{to the structure of}} the vibrational wave function of the dimer ion.

We obtain {{the strength of the}} Yb 3 + –Yb 3 + coupling <b>which</b> <b>we</b> find is considerably smaller than that between the rare earths (R 3 +) in the other RNi 5. From a study of the spin dynamics, we find that dynamic short range order is present just above the ordering temperature and that above 2  K, the relaxation rate of the paramagnetic Yb 3 + spins follows a T-linear Korringa law with a relatively <b>pronounced</b> slope <b>which</b> <b>we</b> link to a high density of states at the Fermi level.

40|$|The Compton and Thomson {{radiation}} spectra, {{generated in}} collisions of an electron beam {{with a powerful}} laser beam, are studied {{in the framework of}} quantum and classical electrodynamics, respectively. We show that there are frequency regimes where both radiation spectra are nearly identical, which for Compton scattering relates to the process which preserves the electron spin. Although the radiation spectra are nearly identical, the corresponding probability amplitudes exhibit different global phases. This has <b>pronounced</b> consequences, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> demonstrate by investigating temporal power distributions in both cases. We show that, contrary to Thomson scattering, it is not always possible to synthesize short laser pulses from Compton radiation. This happens when the global phase of the Compton amplitude varies in a nonlinear way with the frequency of emitted photons. We also demonstrate that while the Compton process driven by a non-chirped laser pulse can generate chirped bursts of radiation, {{this is not the case}} for the Thomson process. In principle, both processes can lead to a generation of coherent frequency combs when single or multiple driving laser pulses collide with electrons. Once we synthesize these combs into short bursts of radiation, we can control them, for instance, by changing the time delay between the driving pulses. Comment: 18 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

It turns out that between 1870 and 1910, the convergence forces that mattered were those that generated by commodity price convergence, stresses by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, and mass migration, stressed by Knut Wicksell. It turns out that offsetting forces were contributing to late 19 th century divergence, a finding consistent with economic historians' traditional attention to Britain's alleged failure and America's spectacular rise to industrial supremacy.

40|$|The Type-II solar radio burst {{recorded}} on 13 June 2010 by the radio spectrograph of the Hiraiso Solar Observatory {{was employed to}} estimate the magnetic-field strength in the solar corona. The burst was characterized by a well <b>pronounced</b> band-splitting, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> used to estimate the density jump at the shock and Alfven Mach number using the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. The plasma frequency of the Type-II bursts is converted into height [R] in solar radii using the appropriate density model, then we estimated the shock speed [Vs], coronal Alfven velocity [Va], and the magnetic-field strength at different heights. The relative bandwidth of the band-split {{is found to be}} in the range 0. 2 [...] 0. 25, corresponding to the density jump of X = 1. 44 [...] 1. 56, and the Alfven Mach number of MA = 1. 35 [...] 1. 45. The inferred mean shock speed was on the order of V ~ 667 km/s. From the dependencies V(R) and MA(R) we found that Alfven speed slightly decreases at R ~ 1. 3 [...] 1. 5. The magnetic-field strength decreases from a value between 2. 7 and 1. 7 G at R ~ 1. 3 [...] 1. 5 Rs depending on the coronal-density model employed. We find that our results are in good agreement with the empirical scaling by Dulk and McLean (Solar Phys. 57, 279, 1978) and Gopalswamy et al. (Astrophys. J. 744, 72, 2012). Our result shows that Type-II band splitting method is an important tool for inferring the coronal magnetic field, especially when independent measurements were made from white light observations.

40|$|As {{a program}} manager and {{curriculum}} developer {{who has spent}} the bulk of his 25 year career at the ground level of adult literacy education practice I have been highly invested in the issue of how adult literacy students take on the challenging process of learning how to read and how teachers, particularly volunteer tutors, have sought to assist them. Before entering the field of adult education in 1983 my only experience in teaching reading was with a 17 year old male who was suspended from high school.
