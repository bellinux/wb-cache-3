30|$|Anterior and {{posterior}} WB planar scans {{were acquired}} on a Philips dual-head gamma camera (<b>Philips</b> <b>Inc.,</b> Andover, MA, USA), using dual-energy acquisition centered at 171 and 245 keV with 20 % windows. Following each antibody administration, patients underwent {{at least three}} WB scans, the first obtained within 2 to 4 h of administration, followed by at least two additional scans between 24 and 196 h. Patients were also imaged by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) after each antibody administration. SPECT images were generated using iterative reconstruction and attenuation correction.|$|E
30|$|A field-emission {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (FESEM, JEOL JSM- 6700 [*]F, Tokyo, Japan) {{was used to examine}} the morphology of the Ag nanoislands and Si nanopillars, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to examine the composition of the obtained samples. The structural characteristics of the ultrathin ZnO films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique using Cu Kα radiation (λ[*]=[*] 1.54 [*]Å) (PANalytical X'Pert Pro, <b>Philips</b> <b>Inc.,</b> Almelo, The Netherlands), which was operated at 45 [*]kV and 40 [*]mA for grazing angle scan. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) was measured at room temperature using a He-Cd laser (325 [*]nm) for excitation and a CCD with a monochromator for detection.|$|E
30|$|Patients were pretreated with Lugol's {{solution}} {{approximately one}} hour before radiopharmaceutical administration. SPECT imaging was performed 3 – 5  h after IV injection of 185  MBq (5  mCi) of 123 I–FP-CIT, according to standardized guidelines (Darcourt et al., 2010). Data were acquired {{according to the}} manufacturer’s suggested protocol, employing a 15 % energy window centered at 159  keV, 128 [*]×[*] 128 matrixes, zoom factor of 1.0, pixel size of 4.66  mm, at 30  s/projection for 128 projections, for a total acquisition time of 34 – 35  min, using low energy high resolution collimators. The same dual detector rotating gamma camera system (Skylight, <b>Philips</b> <b>Inc.)</b> was used for all patient acquisitions. All tomograms were reconstructed by filtered backprojection (with Butterworth cutoff[*]=[*] 0.5 and order[*]=[*] 8) as per the manufacturer, and corrected for attenuation by the Chang method (linear attenuation coefficient μ[*]=[*] 0.11).|$|E

40|$|The idea {{of reverse}} {{innovation}}, local innovation happening in emerging markets {{for the global}} market, has gained much academic and managerial attention in recent years. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand how reverse innovation has successfully diffused into the product and market development strategies at <b>Philips</b> <b>Inc.,</b> a prominent multinational company (MNC) of the modern era. Furthermore, the study presents the success achieved by these innovations at both the domestic and global levels, along with their implications regarding socio-economic sustainability in emerging markets. In order to investigate the research questions, a case study of Philips China was conducted involving three product innovations that were found to be suitable examples of reverse innovation. After the study of extant literature on the topic, drawing from research databases, newspaper articles, and company press releases, five semi-structuredinterviews were conducted with key managers and a market practitioner to gain sufficient understanding for this exploratory study. Subsequent case analysis concludes that these innovations are examples of reverse innovation representing a new paradigm change in innovation flow. This flow of innovation from emerging markets to developed markets as confirmed by Corsi’s framework could potentially disrupt developed markets as well as contribute to ensure healthy living conditions for the population living in developing countries. If so, this represents a sustainable socio-economic change in-line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of “ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. ” This is relevant as Philips aspires to be a prominent private sector player in achieving the above-stated goal by defeating non-communicable disease and strengthening local healthcare systems...|$|E
30|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FT-IR) spectra {{were obtained}} using a JASCO FT-IR 300 E spectrometer (JASCO Inc., Easton, MD, USA) at {{a resolution of}} 4 cm- 1. Dried samples were ground with KBr powder and compressed into pellets for FT-IR examination. The samples were prepared by dropping the diluted nanoparticles on carbon-coated grids, followed by natural drying; then, the samples were observed by a transmission electron microphotograph (Philips CM 200 TEM; applied operation voltage, 120 kV; <b>Philips</b> <b>Inc,</b> Berlin, Germany. The hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution were determined by DLS {{by means of a}} standard laboratory-built light scattering spectrometer equipped with a BI 90 particle sizer (Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY, USA). It had a vertically polarized incident light of 514.5 nm supplied by an argon ion laser (Lexel laser, model 95; Cambridge Lasers Laboratories Inc., Fremont, CA, USA. To investigate the crystal structure of CSNPs and bare CdS, XRD (RA/FR- 571, Enraf Nonius, Deift, The Netherlands was used. The result was also compared with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file no. 10 - 454 to confirm whether or not any impurity phase exists in the CSNPs. The surface chemical composition was analyzed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA, ESCA LAB VIG microtech, Mt 500 / 1, etc., East Grinstead, UK) with MgK α at 1, 253.6 eV and 150 W of power at the anode. A survey scan spectrum was taken, and the surface elemental compositions relative to the carbon were calculated from the peak heights, taking into account atomic sensitivity. The zeta potential is a very useful way of evaluating the stability of any colloidal system. In this study, the zeta potential was measured with a NicompTM 380 Zeta Potential (ZLS, Tokyo, Japan) employing the electrophoretic light scattering technique and using double-distilled water as a diluent.|$|E
