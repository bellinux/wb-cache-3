25|$|In some cases, {{examination}} of laws by the Council is compulsory.

Guidance may be sought from the Council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as règlement (regulation) to be adopted with decree of the prime minister. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as regulatory matters initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the Council.|$|E

The General Assembly passed the requested cuts, and in July 1934, Laffoon called another special session to consider the sales tax. Pro-administration officials organized parades and demonstrations {{in favor of the}} tax. By contrast, a group of 100 unemployed men marched on Frankfort demanding financial relief. Some of them made death threats against Laffoon, and the Kentucky National Guard surrounded the governor's mansion to protect him. Although anti-sales-tax forces used <b>parliamentary</b> <b>procedures</b> that stalled a vote for weeks, a three percent sales tax was approved {{by the end of the}} session. The tax was derided in a children's chant that said [...] "Hippity-hop to the toy shop to buy a red balloon. A penny for you, a penny for me, a penny for Ruby Laffoon." [...] Following the special session, Laffoon was admitted to a sanatorium, where he was treated for exhaustion.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with other}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>procedures</b> in the House, members of {{opposition}} parties must place questions through the Speaker, addressing them only indirectly to the minister {{responsible for the}} issue at hand. When asking questions, members address the Speaker as [...] "Mr. Speaker" [...] or [...] "Madam Speaker" [...] ("Monsieur le président" [...] or [...] "Madame la présidente" [...] in French). There is no obligation for the minister {{referred to in the}} question to actually respond, and often the minister's parliamentary secretary or a fellow cabinet member will rise to answer the question. This is particularly true when the minister addressed is not actually present in the House during Question Period, and arguably occurs most often when the Prime Minister is addressed on a specific issue for which one of his ministers has more information.|$|E
