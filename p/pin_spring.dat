50|$|The first CPX-1 variant, the CPX-2 {{eliminates}} the external manual safety.

50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove <b>pins,</b> slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> and spirally coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Model 1763's {{sturdier}} design {{proved to}} be a bit too heavy, so in 1766 the musket's design was lightened. The barrel wall was thinned, the lock was shortened, the stock was slimmed, and the Model 1763's long iron ramrod cover was replaced by a <b>pinned</b> <b>spring</b> under the breech. The trumpet shaped ramrod of the Model 1763 was also abandoned in favor of a ramrod with a lighter button shaped end.|$|R
50|$|Seventeen {{parts of}} the M1911 were reduced in size {{for the design of}} the EMP. The slide and frame were both shortened, necessitating changes to the extractor, firing pin, firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> and trigger bow, as well as the plunger tube. The grip frame {{circumference}} has also been reduced due to the magazine itself being made shorter, front-to-back.|$|E
50|$|The firing {{mechanism}} {{features a}} two-stage progressive trigger that provides two modes of operation: semi-automatic fire, when the trigger is squeezed momentarily, and fully automatic fire—produced when the trigger is pulled {{all the way}} through and held back. No fire control selector is provided. The Jatimatic features a striker firing mechanism with a fixed firing pin installed inside the bolt (the dual-purpose return spring also serves as the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Unusual design {{features}} included {{the safety and}} the magazine. The safety was a lever inset {{into the back of}} the grip and, with the gun cocked, forced backward out of the grip into the [...] "safe" [...] position by spring tension from the firing pin upon depression of a button under the slide. Thus, engaging the safety simultaneously reduced tension on the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring.</b> To disengage the safety, a shooter simply would squeeze the grip, pressing the lever forward and locking it flush with the back of the frame.|$|E
5000|$|Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{cylindrical}} pins rolled from a {{strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are also known as roll pins or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> (also called {{tension pin}} or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> is considered a self retaining fastener. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
50|$|The manual pick gun (or snap gun) {{was invented}} by Ely Epstein. It usually has a trigger that creates a {{movement}} which (like bump keys) transfers sudden energy to the key pins which communicate this to the driver pins causing those pins only to jump, allowing the cylinder to turn freely for a brief moment, until the <b>pin</b> <b>springs</b> return the <b>pins</b> to their locking position. Electric versions are now also common, where by simply pressing a button the pins are vibrated while the normal torsion wrench is being used.|$|R
50|$|Like the M1911, the Ruger 1911 {{is single}} action only. It also has {{features}} such as a beavertail grip safety and a manually operated thumb safety. In addition to these two safeties, the Ruger SR1911 also has a sear disconnect, slide stop and half-cock position. Although Colt's 80 series developed a trigger operated firing pin block safety, and Kimber and Smith & Wesson use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety; the Ruger SR1911 pistol features a titanium firing pin and heavy firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> which negates {{the need for a}} firing pin block, offering an updated safety feature without compromising trigger pull weight.|$|E
50|$|The PM has a {{free-floating}} triangular {{firing pin}}, with no firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> or firing pin block. This theoretically allows {{the possibility of}} accidental firing if the pistol is dropped on its muzzle. Designer Nikolay Makarov thought the firing pin of insufficient mass to constitute a major danger. The Makarov pistol is notable for the safety elements of its design, with a safety lever that simultaneously decocks and blocks the hammer from contacting the firing pin and returns the weapon to the long-trigger-pull mode of double action when that safety is engaged. When handled properly, the Makarov pistol has excellent security against accidental discharge caused by inadvertent pressure on the trigger, e.g., in carrying the weapon in dense brush or re-holstering it. However, the heavy trigger weight in double-action mode decreases first-shot accuracy. The Bulgarian-model Makarov pistol was approved {{for sale in the}} US state of California, having passed a state-mandated drop-safety test though the certification was not renewed and it has since been removed from the roster of approved handguns.|$|E
5000|$|The design drew on many common {{concepts}} in firearms manufacture of the period, such as stamped sheet metal construction, belt feed (a modified mechanism for belt feed from the MG42 {{with a single}} pawl), quick barrel replacement, a pistol grip and stock, and a Semi bullpup design similar to the FG 42 (much of the action occupies the weapon's stock). The M60's operating system of an operating rod turning a rotating bolt {{was inspired by the}} FG 42, which was based on the much earlier Lewis Gun. The M60 was even constructed with a secondary assisting firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> that is used in the FG 42 in semi-automatic mode even though it is actually unnecessary in the M60 (which operates only in full automatic mode). The M60's gas operation is unique, and drew on technical advances of the period, particularly the White [...] "gas expansion and cutoff" [...] principle also exploited by the M14 rifle. The M60's gas system was simpler than other gas systems and easier to clean.|$|E
50|$|The AK-74 was {{designed}} by А.D. Kryakushin's group under the design supervision of Mikhail Kalashnikov and is an adaptation of the 7.62×39mm AKM assault rifle and features several important design improvements. These improvements were primarily the result of converting the rifle to the intermediate-caliber high velocity 5.45×39mm cartridge. In fact, some early models are reported to have been converted AKMs, re-barreled to 5.45×39mm. Compared to the preceding AKM the AK-74 has better effective range, firing accuracy (a main development goal) and reliability. The AK-74 and AKM share an approximate 50% parts commonality (interchangeable most often are <b>pins,</b> <b>springs</b> and screws).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> as an {{alignment}} pin in aluminum castings ...|$|R
50|$|When coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. Coiled pins continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|R
50|$|The P-11 was {{designed}} by Swedish-born George Kellgren, the designer of many earlier Husqvarna (Sweden), Intratec, and Grendel brand firearms. The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush {{to the bottom of}} the pistol. At 17.1 oz unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines. An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12-round magazines will also work, with a matching short adapter sleeve, as well. Accessories such as trigger shoes, finger-rests, belt clips, steel guide rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray- and OD green-colored polymer grip housings, night sights, and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s an {{elaborate}} modified {{variant of the}} Karabiner Model 1931 was developed for designated marksman/sniper use. This rifle was not issued as a Model 31 variant, but as the Zielfernrohr Karabiner 55 (ZfK55) Sniper Rifle. It featured a more powerful 3.5×22 telescopic sight made by Kern adjustable from 100 - 800 m in 100 m increments.The ZfK55 weighs 6.1 kg empty with the telescopic sight mounted and has an overall length of 1210 mm.The ZfK55 only has four small parts in common (the cocking piece, the firing pin, the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> and the extractor) with the Karabiner Model 1931. The telescopic sight mounts {{are an integral part}} of the receiver. The 3.5×22 telescopic sight features an integral quick release mount that connects to the mounts on the left side of the receiver. The entire action of the ZfK55 is tilted at an angle of approximately 15 degrees to provide room for the unimpaired loading and ejecting cartridges with the telescopic sight mounted. The tilting of the action and magazine also provided a centered position of the telescopic sight over the action and stock at the cost of widening the rifle somewhat. The barrel fitted to the ZfK55 is heavier than the one on the Karabiner Model 1931 and is fitted with a muzzle brake. The ZfK55 also has a half-stock with a checkered pistol grip instead of a semi-pistol grip and an underfolding integrated bipod. A total of 4,150 ZfK55s where manufactured.|$|E
5000|$|The pistol has a {{multi-stage}} {{safety system}} {{consisting of two}} automatic internal safeties, two external trigger safeties and a manual lock safety. The first external trigger safety acts as the primary fail-safe. A small, spring-loaded inner trigger is housed in a wide, outer trigger and cannot be actuated unless the inset trigger is depressed first. This keeps the trigger from being pulled by an inadvertent off-angle trigger pull. This trigger safety also activates and when released—deactivates the two internal safeties: the firing pin and drop safety. The firing pin safety is contained in the pistol’s slide and blocks the longitudinal movement of the striker. The second trigger safety is an optional, manually operated plastic bar located inside the trigger guard and projecting out {{from the base of}} the pistol’s frame when activated, revealing a small white dot. This indicates that the pistol is currently incapable of being fired. It is used as an additional safety that disables the trigger with the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> cocked (after reloading the pistol). This safety is engaged by simultaneously pushing in two buttons on both sides of the frame and then deactivated by simply lifting the trigger finger and pushing the bar up and into the pistol's frame, thus allowing the trigger to be pulled back and the weapon fired. These safeties enable safe handling of the pistol with a round present in the chamber (the so-called [...] "cocked and locked" [...] condition) and allow for rapid deployment and immediate firing; this arrangement however does not permit the firing mechanism to be re-cocked in case of a misfire after the trigger has been pulled.|$|E

50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> that push up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> may be too short.|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing <b>pin</b> <b>springs</b> back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{into the}} {{detailed}} {{design of the}} mechanism, the two sides had further agreed that the capture latches would follow the design developed at MSC and the structural latches and ring would follow the Soviet pattern. These paired sets of hooks had been successfully used on both Soyuz and Salyut. In addition, the group concurred on details regarding the alignment <b>pins,</b> <b>spring</b> thrusters (to assist in {{the separation of the}} spacecraft at undocking), and electrical connector locations. To evaluate the docking system concept and to ensure the establishment of compatibility at an early point in the development, the men planned to build a two-fifths-scale test model, the exact details of which would be decided at the next joint meeting.|$|R
