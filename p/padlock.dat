5|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical <b>padlock</b> to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or <b>padlock,</b> {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
50|$|After April 13, 2007, couples had to {{stop this}} habit because that day the lamppost, due to the weight of all <b>padlocks,</b> {{partially}} collapsed. However, couples decided to attach their <b>padlocks</b> elsewhere. In fact, all around the bridge, road posts and even garbage bins {{have been used to}} place these love <b>padlocks.</b> As an online replacement, a web site has been created allowing couples to use virtual <b>padlocks.</b> In 2007, the mayor of Rome introduced a 50 euro fine on couples found attaching <b>padlocks</b> to the bridge. Similar love <b>padlocks</b> traditions have appeared in Italy and the rest of Europe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Padlocks</b> {{have been}} used in China since the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). According to Hong-Sen Yan, {{director}} of the National Science and Technology Museum, early Chinese <b>padlocks</b> were mainly [...] "key-operated locks with splitting springs, and partially keyless letter combination locks". <b>Padlocks</b> were made from bronze, brass, silver, and other materials. The use of bronze was more prevalent for the early Chinese <b>padlocks.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{evidence of the}} wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists. Bristol's Hannah More was an influential member of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade. In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on the cruelty of the trade in humans. Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause, including a bust of Robert Southey. John Wesley opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion. Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic, including Oroonoko, {{the story of an}} enslaved African and The <b>Padlock,</b> which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause.|$|E

5000|$|Smokehouse locks, {{designed}} in England, were formed from wrought iron sheet and employed simple lever and ward mechanisms. These locks afforded little protection against forced and surreptitious entry. Contemporary with the smokehouse <b>padlocks</b> and {{originating in the}} Slavic areas of Europe, [...] "screw key" [...] <b>padlocks</b> opened with a helical key that was threaded into the keyhole. The key pulled the locking bolt open against a strong spring. <b>Padlocks</b> that offered more key variance were {{the demise of the}} screw lock. Improved manufacturing methods allowed the manufacture of better <b>padlocks</b> that {{put an end to the}} Smokehouse around 1910.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rest}} of Europe, love <b>padlocks</b> started {{appearing}} in the early 2000s as a ritual or epidemy. The reasons love <b>padlocks</b> started to appear vary between locations and in many instances are unclear. However, in Rome, the ritual of affixing love <b>padlocks</b> to the bridge Ponte Milvio {{can be attributed to}} the 2006 book I Want You by Italian author Federico Moccia, who made a film adaptation in 2007.|$|R

25|$|The Communist Party of Canada began {{organizing}} in Quebec {{upon its}} founding. Many important {{leaders of the}} CPC including Annie Buller, William Kashtan, Fred Rose, Madeleine Parent, and Léa Roback hailed from Montreal, and Norman Bethune joined the party in Montreal. The Quebec district fought hard battles against the Duplessis regime, which made the party illegal using the <b>Padlock</b> law, and to organize the unorganized. The election of Fred Rose in Cartier was a major boost to the Quebec communists and reflected {{the support of the}} CPC among working-class people in the city.|$|E
25|$|Gabrion's {{whereabouts}} were unknown, but {{he quickly}} became a prime suspect in her death. A search warrant was executed for his residence and keys that matched the <b>padlock</b> used to secure Rachel's body were found at Gabrion's home along with concrete blocks stained with the same paint as the ones retrieved from the lake. Marvin's nephew, Mikey Gabrion, also led police to a campsite that had frequently been used by his uncle. Gabrion's tent was found there, along with bolt cutters, chain, duct tape, a woman's hair clip, and nipples for a baby bottle.|$|E
25|$|The {{plantation}} produced oranges, {{sea island}} cotton, indigo, okra, and other vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to do what they wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located {{about a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to <b>padlock</b> their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in antebellum America.|$|E
50|$|<b>Padlocks</b> {{have been}} used in Europe since the middle La Tène period, {{subsequently}} spreading to the Roman world and the Przeworsk and Chernyakhov cultures. Roman <b>padlocks</b> had a long bent rod attached to the case, and a shorter piece which could be inserted into the case. Przeworsk and Chernyakhov <b>padlocks</b> had a sleeve attached to the case, and a long bent rod which could be inserted into the case and the sleeve.|$|R

25|$|The third POTF-album, {{entitled}} Revolution Roulette, {{was released}} in Finland and on iTunes on 26 March 2008. Its cover was designed by Tuomas Harju and features a giant <b>padlock</b> with a built-in roulette, abandoning the lolipop used on the previous album-covers. The record marks the first POTF-album not produced in Markus Kaarlonen's living-room, but the band's own professional studio. It {{went straight to the}} top of the Finnish charts and was certified gold two weeks after being released. The band also released the title track of the album as a promotional radio-single. Revolution Roulette is currently the only POTF album that has not been released physically outside Finland. While on tour with the album, the band played their first gig in the United States at Musexpo 2008 in Los Angeles on 29 April 2008.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} two trails through the Jewellery Quarter that {{were created by}} the city council. The Findings Trail was {{designed}} by Laura Potter, a practising maker and graduate from the School of Jewellery. There are 30 pavement slabs, with a stainless steel information plaque based on {{the form of a}} hallmarked tag usually found on jewellery. There is also a glass cat's eye set into each information plaque which reflects light at night and day on the principle of a gemstone set in jewellery. Slabs contain various elements of either stainless steel or cast bronze. The Charm Bracelet Trail was designed by the Birmingham-based artist partnership Renn and Thacker. The trail is shaped like a giant bronze charm bracelet. At the bottom of Newhall Hill is a charm bracelet <b>padlock</b> that illuminates at night, marking the start of the trail.|$|E
25|$|Mystery/puzzle caches require one to {{discover}} information or solve a puzzle {{to find the}} cache. Some mystery caches provide a false set of coordinates with a puzzle that must be solved to determine the final cache location. In other cases, the given location is accurate, but {{the name of the}} location or other features are themselves a puzzle leading to the final cache. Alternatively, additional information is necessary to complete the find, such as a <b>padlock</b> combination to access the cache. Finally, Challenge Caches, (a subtype of the Mystery cache) require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day, etc.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match was}} the triple threat {{hardcore}} match between Raven, Kane and The Big Show for the Hardcore Championship. During the match, the three wrestlers fought {{their way out}} of the ring and through the crowd into the backstage area. Big Show tried to lock himself, Raven and the referee in a security cage but Kane broke the <b>padlock</b> and afterwards threw Raven through a glass window. Big Show and Kane continued to brawl ending with the two throwing each other through a wall. Raven tried to escape by driving off in a golf cart, but Big Show stopped him and caused him to crash. Kane shortly followed with another golf cart, accompanied by the referee, and ran into Raven. The fight headed back into the stadium with Big Show attempting to press slam Raven off the entrance stage but both were kicked off it by Kane. Kane followed this with a diving leg drop off the stage onto Big Show, pinning him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|E
25|$|At first, Android {{did not use}} a gesture-based lock screen, electing to just {{require the}} user to press the phone's Menu button. On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based lock screen was introduced, {{displaying}} two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon {{to the center of}} the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen. Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with a <b>padlock</b> icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area. On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to the camera is provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up. Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the lock screen, allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the lock screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The camera is accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen. Android also allows devices to be locked using a password, passcode, a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or with facial recognition.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Bean's car, a Green 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000 Mark 4 with a {{matte black}} bonnet, {{was central to}} several antics, such as Mr. Bean's getting dressed in it, driving while sitting in an {{armchair}} strapped to the roof, or attempting to avoid a car park fee by driving out through the entrance. In the pilot, the car used was an orange 1969 BMC Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2 hardtop (registration RNT 996H), but this was destroyed in an off-screen crash {{at the end of}} the episode. From then on, the car was a 1976 model (registration SLW 287R), Green in colour with a matte black bonnet. Throughout the sitcom, Bean keeps it locked with a bolt-latch and <b>padlock,</b> rather than the lock fitted to the car, which formed a running joke in several episodes; in two episode, he demonstrated an additional, innovative security measure, in that he removes the steering wheel instead of the key, which in one episode deterred a car thief. In [...] "Back to School Mr. Bean", Bean's Mini is crushed by a tank as part of a demonstration, after he replaced an identical Mini (registration ACW 497V), meant for the demonstration, with his own to secure a parking space. Despite losing it, he later removes his <b>padlock</b> and bolt-latch from it, and finds another to use sometime after the episode.|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} years in WWE, Cena portrayed a vastly {{different}} character. This character, a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with a <b>padlock</b> around his neck, {{was known as}} the [...] "Doctor of Thuganomics". Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back. Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media, and even the crowd on occasion. Cena also regularly performed [...] "rap battles", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. Cena reverted to this persona once during his feud with The Rock. In 2005, shortly after his first debut film, The Marine, his wrestling character was shifted from a white rapper to that of a young private.|$|E

Although Japanese soldiers attempted to escape with twotrucks, the team was able to destroy the trucks and then the shack.|$|E
500|$|During his WWE career, Cena's attire has {{attempted}} to reflect the most current fashions and stylings within the hip hop culture that his character represents.

While Cena {{was a member of}} the SmackDown! brand, one of his WWE produced T-shirts bore the suggestive spoonerism [...] "Ruck Fules". Whenever it appeared on television the image was censored, not by the network, but by WWE to sell more shirts under the premise that it was [...] "too hot for TV". He also wore a chain with a large <b>padlock,</b> occasionally using it as a weapon, until WrestleMania 21, when it was replaced with a chromed and diamond studded [...] "Chain Gang" [...] spinner medallion – reminiscent of the ones worn by members of G-Unit – matching his spinner title belt.|$|E
