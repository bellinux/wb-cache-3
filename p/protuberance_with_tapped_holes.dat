40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} the experimental setup and the results of the CFD analysis for the investigation of the unsteady cavitating flow around a prismatic NACA 2412 hydrofoil at different flow conditions. The experimental research is carried out in the cavitation water tunnel located in the Centre of Hydraulic Research in Lutín. The tunnel is integrated into the closed horizontal loop of the hydraulic test rig. The transparent test section provides a full view of the flow around the hydrofoil. The hydrofoil incidence angle is fully adjustable. Two variants of hydrofoil of the same geometry have been designed. One variant is equipped <b>with</b> pressure <b>tap</b> <b>holes</b> for the measurement of the static pressure, and the other variant is covered with a grid of five PVDF films, fully integrated in the hydrofoil. The PVDF films enable to measure the impact forces exerted on the hydrofoil surface by the collapsing cavitation structures. The high-frequency pressure oscillations downstream of the hydrofoil trailing edge are measured using the PVDF hydrophone. The cavitating flow is visualized using two simultaneously operating high-speed cameras providing the top and side views of the flow. A preliminary CFD analysis using the ANSYS CFX package helped to determine the flow regimes for the experimental study. The obtained CFD results agree well with the preliminary measurements. ...|$|R

With depths beyond 2 diameters, the error becomes too pronounced to ignore. Another fact about this alignment task is that the first thread or two that is cut establishes the direction {{that the rest of the}} threads will follow.

The circular structures are quenched remnants of CO_ 2 bubbles on the surface. The bubble size, total number of bubbles, and bubble number density greatly vary with substrate composition (Fig.  1 d, e). Bubble number density is relatively high for 5 – 45, 10 – 40, and 15 – 35 substrates. Bubble occupancy (bubble area/area of petri dish) is relatively high for 15 – 35, 20 – 30, and 25 – 25 substrates. We found four patterns for the bubble characteristics: (1) Only a few microbubbles (< 1 mm^ 2) were observed for the 0 – 50 substrate, (2) small bubbles (1 ∼ 10 mm^ 2) were dominant for the 5 – 45, 10 – 40, and 15 – 35 substrates, (3) large bubbles (10 ∼ 1000 mm^ 2) with much smaller bubbles (1 ∼ 10 mm^ 2) within them were dominant for the 20 – 30, 25 – 25, 30 – 20, and 35 – 15 substrates, and (4) one large bubble was observed for the 50 – 0 substrate.

40|$|<b>Tap</b> <b>hole</b> {{refractories}} constitute critical {{parts of}} the refractory lining in submerged arc furnaces. For several hours every day, molten slag and metal flow through the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> calling for thorough selection of refractory materials able to withstand the intense thermal, corrosive and erosive conditions present in this area. Carbon-based refractories have shown excellent thermal properties and high strength, as well as low wettability towards process materials, and are therefore utilized in silicomanganese production furnaces both as side lining, in the hearth, and in the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> area. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine the compatibility of five refractory materials utilized in the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> area of an industrial silicomanganese furnace with two industrial silicomanganese slags: 	Investigate the suitability of the selected refractory materials for confining the process materials during industrial production of silicomanganese alloys. 	Identify critical refractory wear mechanisms upon slag-refractory interaction at industrial tapping temperatures. Compatibilities were investigated through 12 static crucible tests and two static plate tests in a vertical tube furnace redesigned during this investigation. Slag-refractory interaction was studied after two and four hours holding time at 1367 °C ± 1. 8 °C, 1464 °C ± 2. 1 °C and 1600 °C - 0. 6 °C /+ 0. 2 °C. Holding temperatures were verified through the wire-bridge method at the melting points of gold and palladium. Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and ramming paste at 1600 °C, the ramming paste investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient electrode paste disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. <b>Tap</b> <b>hole</b> clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C.

The purpose of the study presented here was to determine to what extent chemical reactions between carbon-based refractory and slag or metal in the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> of a SiMn furnace can contribute to wear of tap-hole refractory. The results of the study are reported in two parts. In Part I, the results of thermodynamic calculations of the potential for chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory material and slag or metal are reported. The results were tested experimentally using pure graphite and synthetic SiMn slag (produced from pure oxides). The paper also reports the composition, microstructure, and phases of industrial SiMn slag, and commercially available carbon block and cold ramming paste refractory materials. These compositions were used in predicted equilibria of refractory–slag reactions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that reaction between SiMn slag and carbonbased tap-hole refractory is possible, and experiments with nominally pure materials support this. However, practical refractory materials are by no means pure materials, and contain secondary phases and porosity which can be expected to affect reaction with slag. Such reactions are examined in Part II. National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant TP 2011070800005). [URL]...|$|R
