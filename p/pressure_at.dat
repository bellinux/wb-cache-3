In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C.

40|$|Big-hole {{production}} well Bulalo 100 is crossflowing while shut-in based on shut-in pressure, temperature, and spinner (PTS) survey results. The apparent crossflow is probably {{caused by a}} vertical upflow from the well’s deep, less permeable and pressure supported feedzones into its shallow, more permeable and pressure depleted entry zone. Consequently, shut-in wellbore <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the entry zones do not represent true static reservoir pressures.

5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
40|$|Claw {{lameness}} may {{be associated}} with biomechanical factors caused by imbalances of the pressure distribution under hooves when cows are confined on hard concrete flooring. Using a system based on a thin pressure measurement film (Matscan, Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, Mass.) developed forpressure distribution analysis of human feet, the pressures under the hooves of a population sample of 32 cows divided into trimmed and untrimmed groups were measured under dynamic conditions (stance phase) and compared to evaluate the effects of trimming in correcting the imbalance caused by overgrowth of hoof tissues. The results, obtained for three different points of the stance phase, showed that the pressure distribution under the medial sole, heel bulb, and toe of trimmed cows changed slightly as compared to untrimmed cows. The medial sole displayed higher peak pressures as compared to the heel bulb and toe, which displayed lower peak <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the midstance phase. In the acceleration phase, the overall peak pressures shifted to the toe, except on the rear feet of untrimmed cows, which maintained slightly greater (2. 5 %) peak <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the heel bulb than at the toe. The deceleration phase showed similar peak <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the heel bulb and lateral sole for both trimmed and untrimmed cows. It was concluded that trimming results in slightly higher pressures towards the medial sole. This may help improve gait stability by removing some of the peak <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the heel bulb and lateral sole (weight-bearing border). However, the higher peak <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the medial sole may cause an increase in stresses on that region and favor the incidence of lesions, particularly sole ulcers...|$|R

40|$|Communicated by Axel Klar) Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a model of the {{respiratory}} system. The real bronchial tree is embedded within the parenchyma, and ventilation is caused by negative <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> the alveolar level. We aim to describe the series of <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> alveolae in the form of a function, and to establish a sound mathematical framework for the instantaneous ventilation process. To that end, we treat the bronchial tree as an infinite resistive tree, we endow the space of <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> bifurcating nodes with the natural energy norm (rate of dissipated energy), and we characterise the <b>pressure</b> field <b>at</b> its boundary (i. e. set of simple paths to infinity). In a second step, we embed the infinite collection of leafs in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ Rd, and we establish some regularity properties for the corresponding pressure field. In particular, for the infinite counterpart of a regular, healthy lung, we show that the pressure field lies in a Sobolev space Hs(Ω), with s ≈ 0. 45. This allows us to propose a model for the ventilation process that takes the form of a boundary problem...|$|R
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of the}} pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of}} a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
