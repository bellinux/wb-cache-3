5|$|Tanyus Shahin Saadeh al-Rayfouni (also spelled Tanios Chahine Saadé Al Rayfouné, {{given name}} also spelled Taniyus or Tanius) (1815–1895) was a Maronite muleteer and peasant leader from Mount Lebanon. He led a peasants' revolt {{in the area}} of Keserwan in 1859, during which he drove out the area's Maronite nobility, the feudal Khazen lords, and {{declared}} a peasants' republic. While he had a reputation as a ruffian and <b>provocateur</b> among members of the Maronite clergy and European consuls, Shahin became a popular figure among Christian commoners, many of whom considered him the guardian of their interests, a view which Shahin promoted.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents <b>provocateur</b> in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Sensing growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, Lenin {{suggested an}} armed political demonstration in Petrograd {{to test the}} government's response. Amid deteriorating health, he left the city to recuperate in the Finnish village of Neivola. The Bolsheviks' armed demonstration, the July Days, took place while Lenin was away, but upon learning that demonstrators had violently clashed with government forces, he returned to Petrograd and called for calm. Responding to the violence, the government ordered the arrest of Lenin and other prominent Bolsheviks, raiding their offices, and publicly alleging {{that he was a}} German agent <b>provocateur.</b> Evading arrest, Lenin hid in a series of Petrograd safe houses. Fearing that he would be killed, Lenin and fellow senior Bolshevik Grigory Zinoviev escaped Petrograd in disguise, relocating to Razliv. There, Lenin began work on the book that became The State and Revolution, an exposition on how he believed the socialist state would develop after the proletariat revolution, and how from then on the state would gradually wither away, leaving a pure communist society. He began arguing for a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government, but at a clandestine meeting of the party's central committee this idea was rejected. Lenin then headed by train and by foot to Finland, arriving at Helsinki on 10 August, where he hid away in safe houses belonging to Bolshevik sympathisers.|$|E

25|$|The Iraqi Kurds {{may be seen}} in two ways.

This polarised notion of their status may be too simplistic, when one considers that there are opposing agendas within Iraqi Kurdistan with regard to issues such as the relationship with Turkey, nationalist aspirations and relations globally.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Ismail Nasution of the State University of Padang concurs, {{suggesting}} that the play is a criticism of the New Order government.

Quoting a line from Semar, in which he discounts his children's suggestion that Semar lead protests, Nasution also notes criticism of the youths who would demonstrate against the New Order, depicting them as being easily manipulated by agents <b>provocateur</b> and often needlessly destroying material goods.|$|E
