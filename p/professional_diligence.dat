5000|$|The rules {{referred}} to in the actual text of the Directive in relation to codes of conduct are quite limited (e.g. Article 6(2)(b), prohibiting non-compliance with codes of conduct in some circumstances, and Article 10). However, the 20th recital states: [...] "It is appropriate to provide a role for codes of conduct ... In sectors where there are specific mandatory requirements ... these will also provide evidence as to the requirements of <b>professional</b> <b>diligence</b> in that sector. ... consumers' organisations could be informed and involved in the drafting of codes of conduct." [...] Subscribers to a code of conduct drafted with the input of and endorsed by a major consumers' organisation could seek to argue during enforcement proceedings that compliance with the code of conduct is therefore evidence that they have not engaged in unfair commercial practices. Those charged with promoting and administering membership of codes of conduct will take note that Article 11(1) in effect contemplates the possibility of class-actions brought by consumer groups against code-owners where the code promotes non-compliance with legal requirements. Taken together, these provisions may be an incentive for those who administer and promote codes of conduct to consult with consumers' groups and take careful legal advice in relation to the drafting of such codes.|$|E

An analysis of these two countries' moral education curricula reveals traditions which reinforce national solidarity and central governmental authority.

40|$|The {{commercial}} activity primarily presumes the {{compliance with the}} legal provisions relating to the acts and deeds of commerce. The {{commercial activity}} is, from a legal perspective, a correct exercise of the ownership and free initiative by the legal person in the commercial activities, the business conduct being necessary to circumscribe the legal rules that govern the commercial market. This article has as starting point {{on the one hand}} the need for legal provisions ensuring a real protection to the Romanian consumers exposed to unfair trade practices, {{and on the other hand}} of some comprehensive legal stipulations on tradesmen’s contravention and criminal liability that show an unfair competitive conduct. The general regulatory framework regarding the unfair competition consists of the Law no. 11 / 1991 on combating the unfair competition, the legal stipulations which relate to the European provisions on the matter, namely the Directive 2005 / 29 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council from May 11 th 2005 concerning unfair commercial practices of enterprises in the internal market to consumers and amending the Directive 84 / 450 /EEC of the Council, of the Directives 97 / 7 /EC, 98 / 27 /EC and 2002 / 65 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) no. 2006 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European legislation includes the stipulations regarding the unfair commercial practices prohibited in the E. U. space, as well as the stipulations relating to the economic interests of consumers who enter into transactions with tradesmen. In this respect, the European regulations deem unfair trade practices those acts or actions that violate the principles of <b>professional</b> <b>diligence</b> and which may influence the commercial decisions of consumers, being categorized as misleading practices and aggressive commercial practices. In accordance with the provisions of the Law no. 11 / 1991 on combating the unfair competition, with the ulterior amendments and supplements, unfair competition represents the commercial practices of the enterprise that contravenes the fair usages and the general principle of good faith and which cause or may cause damage to any market participants. According to art. 301 of the old Criminal Code, the unfair competition consists in the manufacture or circulation of goods bearing a false designation of origin or false indications of origin and application on the products put in circulation of false mentions regarding the patents or the use of certain commercial names or of the denominations of industrial or trade organizations, in order to mislead the beneficiaries. In the new context of the European trading market where our country is a party and which involves certain rigors of expression and the development of online commercial transactions, the specific legislation requires an adaptation to the new conditions and a serious and sustained involvement of the competent bodies in combating and punishing the unfair competition practices...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} the vast {{differences in the}} quality, depth and reliability of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments performed by consultants have resulted in modifications to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Practice for Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs). The new “standard,” ASTM E 1527 - 05, was finalized to dovetail with 2002 changes in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) that took effect in 2006. Many do not understand that neither the new, nor the old “standards” were designed to address all environmental concerns. The 2005 upgrade has resulted in two basic options for Phase I ESAs: one to meet the “standard” and one with a broader scope that better addresses “environmental business risk. ” Even with all the changes, industry frustration remains high since many clients don’t understand the needs and the differences. This article’s original intent was to explain the recent changes, but in development it quickly became obvious {{a review of the}} entire process was in order. Unfortunately, to most real estate professionals, the grasp of environmental issues still lands somewhere between a necessary evil and the dreaded environmental financial black hole. Industry frustration is split between understanding the “standard” and the varying level of consultants’ performance. Our goal in this article is to help the real estate <b>professional</b> do due <b>diligence</b> on his or her due diligence process to provide a better understanding of what you need for a specific transaction. This includes understanding the update and the various environmental screening tools available as well as understanding the differences in environmental consulting firms and consultants.

They developed their own businesses within the range of typical female fields - retail trade and usual services, with the tendency to enter the area of intellectual services. It was established that there are specific problems and limitations for the entrepreneur activities of women in the unstable work conditions and in still rather patriarchally organized environment in our country. These problems also imply the lack of suitable credits and stimulative programmes for this type of business activities of women, skepticism of the environment toward women in business, double work of women (job, as well as family and children), lack of self-confidence. Envisaged personal characteristics necessary for the success in business include: work and <b>diligence,</b> <b>professional</b> knowledge and readiness for permanent education, persistence and perseverance responsibility and punctuality, communication skills, which are all characteristics quite realistically depicting the demands for the participants in business activities in market economy. As advantages of women over men in running a business, the interviewed female entrepreneurs pointed out: responsibility, persistence, consistency, realism, seriousness diligence and efficiency.
