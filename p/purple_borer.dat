50|$|The Asiatic pink stem borer, (Sesamia inferens), {{also known}} by {{names such as}} Gramineous stem borer, Pink borer, Pink rice borer, Pink rice stem borer, Pink stem borer, Pink stem borer, <b>Purple</b> <b>borer,</b> Purple stem borer or Purplish stem borer, is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It is found from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar to Japan and the Solomon Islands. A {{polyphagous}} species, {{it is a major}} pest in many worldwide crops.|$|E
40|$|The {{most serious}} borers of {{cultivated}} sugar-cane in Java were the striped borer, Proceras sacchariphagus Bojer, and the shining borer, Chilotraea auricilia Dudg. Other common ones were the grey borer, Argyroploce schistaceana Sn., and the <b>purple</b> <b>borer,</b> Sesamia inferens Walk. The first two almost exclusively tunnelled in young weak internodes and diminished their yield of sugar. They diminished {{the weight of}} younger internodes and the sucrose content of older internodes, {{even if they were}} not themselves infested. Infestation was assessed by the percentage of visibly infested parts. Few canes had to be checked and the method was reasonably accurate in the field. Infestation varied between clones, and was higher with heavier N dressings and with rapidly growing good cane. It was probably associated with rind hardness and fibre content. Control with insecticides was effective, especially if concentrated on the youngest leaves. <p/...|$|E
50|$|Sesamia cretica, the Corn stem borer, Greater {{sugarcane}} borer, Sorghum stem borer, Stem corn borer, Durra stem borer, Large corn borer, Pink sugarcane borer, Sugarcane pink borer, Sorghum borer, Pink corn borer, Maize <b>borer</b> or <b>Purple</b> stem <b>borer,</b> is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{was described}} by Lederer in 1857. It is found {{in most of the}} countries and islands of the Mediterranean basin. The range extends through the Middle East and Arabia to Pakistan, northern India and northern Africa. In the south, the range extends to northern Kenya and northern Cameroon.|$|R
50|$|In New York State {{there are}} a {{multitude}} of different invasive species including the Asian carp, the zebra mussel, emerald ash <b>borer,</b> <b>purple</b> loosestrife, the goby and more. An unfortunate byproduct of world travel and trade is the introduction of unwanted invasive species. Shipping pallets and crates, luggage, the ballast water of boats and even people can unintentionally transport invasive plants, insects and diseases to new areas. Without knowing that they would become problematic, some species have been introduced intentionally for use in landscaping, agriculture and other purposes. Invasive species impact all aspects of life, from recreation to livelihood. Spotted knapweed is an invasive plant that can take over crop fields, limiting crop production and feed for livestock. Hemlock woolly adelgid is an invasive insect that exfoliates and kills hemlock trees, a key species in maintaining important habitat along waterways.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{large number}} of insect chemosensory genes from {{different}} gene subfamilies have been identified and annotated, but their functional diversity and complexity are largely unknown. A systemic examination of expression patterns in chemosensory organs could provide important information. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified 92 putative chemosensory genes by analysing the transcriptome of the antennae and female sex pheromone gland of the <b>purple</b> stem <b>borer</b> Sesamia inferens, among them 87 are novel in this species, including 24 transcripts encoding for odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 24 for chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 2 for sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 39 for odorant receptors (ORs) and 3 for ionotropic receptors (IRs). The transcriptome analyses were validated and quantified with a detailed global expression profiling by Reverse Transcription-PCR for all 92 transcripts and by Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR for selected 16 ones. Among the chemosensory gene subfamilies, CSP transcripts are most widely and evenly expressed in different tissues and stages, OBP transcripts showed a clear antenna bias and most of OR transcripts are only detected in adult antennae. Our results also revealed that some OR transcripts, such as the transcripts of SNMP 2 and 2 IRs were expressed in non-chemosensory tissues, and some CSP transcripts were antenna-biased expression. Furthermore, no chemosensory transcript is specific to female sex pheromone gland and very few {{are found in the}} heads. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that there are a {{large number of}} chemosensory genes expressed in S. inferens, and some of them displayed unusual expression profile in non-chemosensory tissues. The identification of a large set of putative chemosensory genes of each subfamily from a single insect species, together with their different expression profiles provide further information in understanding the functions of these chemosensory genes in S. inferens as well as other insects...|$|R
