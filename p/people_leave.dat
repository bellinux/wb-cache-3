As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and coaster cars will fail during the ride and kill everyone on board. She panics, a fight breaks out and several <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> or are forced off the ride. They include Kevin; best friends Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. They see the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy and Kevin devastated.|$|E
5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the lack}} of employment, there is mass {{emigration}} from the area. Most rural people migrate to larger cities in Mexico or to the United States and many never return.

25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Bunker was paroled to {{the care}} of his aunt. However, at sixteen he was caught on a parole violation, and was this time sent to adult prison. There, he believed, he could either be {{predator}} or prey, and did his best to establish himself in the former category. In Los Angeles County Jail, he stabbed another inmate (Bunker claims it was convicted murderer Billy Cook, although circumstantial evidence shows Cook couldn't have been the victim) and soon gained a respectful reputation as a fearless young man. Some thought he was unhinged, but in his book Mr. Blue: Memoirs of a Renegade he stated this was a ruse designed to make <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> him alone.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters, which {{generally}} are night shelters, make <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> {{in the morning}} to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping. There are some daytime shelters where people could go, instead of being stranded on the streets, and they could be helped, get counseling, avail themselves of resources, meals, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is Saint Francis House in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in the early 1980s, which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model.|$|E
25|$|When Agnes Fletcher, a maid in Morley's apartment, {{admits to}} having seen Carter {{on the stairs}} going down to Morley's office, it seems that Carter {{is likely to be}} tried and convicted of both the murder and the {{attempted}} murder. The fact that the gun with which he was captured was the twin of the murder weapon only makes things worse for him. At the climax of the novel Poirot realises that by allowing Carter to persist in his lies he can ensure that the real killer goes free, and wrestles with his conscience. Eventually he presses Carter to admit the truth: that he had seen two <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> Morley's surgery, and that when he entered it the dentist was already dead. This is the final element in the puzzle.|$|E

25|$|In 45.5% of Oaxaca's municipalities, the {{population}} has declined due to migration. Poverty and migration are caused mostly {{by the lack of}} economic development in the state, which leaves most of {{the population}} working in the least productive sector. This has led to wide scale migration, mostly from the rural areas, to find employment. Within Oaxaca, many <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> rural villages to work in the city of Oaxaca, the Papaloapan area and the coast. Within Mexico, many leave for Mexico City, Mexico State, Sinaloa, Baja California and Baja California Sur. Most of those leaving the state are agricultural workers. As of 2005, over 80,000 people from Oaxaca state live in some other part of Mexico. Most of those leaving Oaxaca and Mexico go to the United States. Much of the current wave of emigration began in the late 1970s, and by the 1980s Oaxaca ranked 8th {{in the number of people}} leaving for the US from Mexico. Today, that percentage has fallen to 20th. Most of those migrate to the United States, concentrated in California and Illinois. In 2007, estimates of the number of Oaxacans residing in Los Angeles, California ranged from 50,000 to 250,000.|$|E
25|$|Though all the {{communities}} had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none {{had had to}} deal strongly with opposition in such matters {{and none of them}} had made a point of focusing on it as a priority. A national policy among Bahá'ís had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bahá'ís at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bahá'ís appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed {{of the nature of the}} resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that the facts were not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the shifting options became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice underscoring the short-term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendent of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bahá'í community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development.|$|E

He explained the latter as a description for humanity's ability {{to grow and}} overcome hardships through one's strength and spirit; this is a recurring theme {{that has been used}} in all following parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, portrayed through people succeeding in fights through their own actions, without relying on machines or gods. This theme, along with the passing of the torch, was influenced by Araki's grandfather's death near the start of the serialization, and his thoughts about how <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> parts of themselves behind for the next generation when they die.|$|E

500|$|In Zhejiang, about 10,000utility men {{worked to}} restore the {{widespread}} power outages. In the days following the storm, about 1.24million people were forced to stay in shelters due to damage. A total of 11,732soldiers or militia members assisted in helping in the storm's aftermath. Many cleared mudslides from roads, repaired dams, and helped <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> flooded homes. In Tongxiang in Zhejiang province, thousands of people blocked a highway in protest for not receiving aid, prompting the riot police {{to break up the}} gathering.

500|$|The final part of {{the book}} {{suggests}} that most people have three significant moves: when leaving their parents' home, when starting a family, and when retiring (or when their own adult children move out). When young <b>people</b> <b>leave</b> their home (or when they complete college), they tend to locate to areas that offer attractive job markets, cultural or recreational amenities, and rank high in quality of life factors. When they get married or have children, people choose areas that are perceived as safe and family-friendly. Florida suggests using a [...] "Trick-or-Treater Index" [...] to gauge if parents feel safe allowing their children to go door-to-door on Halloween. [...] He also cites Catherine Austin Fitts' [...] "Popsicle Index", which gauges how far are parents willing to allow their children to walk to buy a treat. Once retired, or when their adult children move away, people tend to gravitate towards similar areas as young people, if it is close to their grandchildren, but in quieter neighborhoods that provide opportunities for hobbies or for a second career.|$|E

500|$|In October 2013, Paul was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie Gattaca, Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier, the Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper.

[...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music).
