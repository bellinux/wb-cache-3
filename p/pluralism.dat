5|$|The {{need for}} liberty {{was one of}} the {{defining}} features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in <b>pluralism</b> of thought, but paradoxically, against <b>pluralism</b> in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Confucianism, Taoism favors {{philosophical}} anarchism, <b>pluralism</b> and laissez-faire-government. Laozi {{has been}} cited as an early example of a proponent of liberalism. On the other hand, politics never have been a main issue in Taoism.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought <b>pluralism</b> of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech and <b>Pluralism</b> is a {{book about}} {{freedom of speech and}} the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, written by author Samuel Peter Nelson. It was {{published}} by Johns Hopkins University Press in 2005. In it, Nelson discusses how the more general notion of free speech differs from that specifically applied to the First Amendment in American law.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{grew up in}} a Hindu and Jain {{religious}} {{atmosphere in}} his native Gujarat which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He, at age 57, declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious <b>pluralism.</b>|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious <b>pluralism.</b> Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa promulgated {{financial}} and educational reforms, {{with the assistance}} of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz and Gerard van Swieten, promoted commerce and the development of agriculture, and reorganised Austria's ramshackle military, all of which strengthened Austria's international standing. However, she refused to allow religious <b>pluralism</b> and advocated for the state church and contemporary adversary travelers criticized her regime as bigoted and superstitious.|$|E
5|$|Ruma Maida, {{which uses}} {{different}} filming styles for {{scenes in the}} past and present, deals with the importance of education, history, and <b>pluralism.</b> Critical reception to the film was mixed; reviewers praised the visuals but disapproved of the plot and dialogue. It was nominated for twelve Citra Awards at the 2009 Indonesian Film Festival, of which it won one.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishadic age was {{characterized}} by a <b>pluralism</b> of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the Katha Upanishad, are dualistic. The Maitri {{is one of the}} Upanishads that inclines more toward dualism, thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school. They contain a plurality of ideas.|$|E
5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, the experiences he had and the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from them in order to consolidate the political <b>pluralism</b> within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural <b>pluralism,</b> had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|In 1335 Orleton {{collated}} Edington to {{the rectory}} of Cheriton, Hampshire, and from 1335 to 1346 he was {{master of the}} Hospital of St Cross in Winchester. Also the King was eager to reward his capable servant; in 1341 {{he was given the}} prebend of Leighton Manor (Lincoln), by 1344 he also held that of Netheravon (Salisbury), and by 1345 that of Putston (Hereford). This level of <b>pluralism</b> was not unusual at the time. His greatest preferment, however, came with his papal appointment– on the King's request– to the see of Winchester in 1345. This was the richest see in England, considered second only to the archbishopric of Milan.|$|E
5|$|Jesse is Jewish and {{was brought}} up in a secular Jewish family that {{originated}} in Poland and Ukraine. He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School. Eisenberg then transferred to the High School of Performing Arts in New York. When he was a senior, he received his breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film Roger Dodger. His work in the film prevented Eisenberg from enrolling at New York University. Instead, Eisenberg would go on to study anthropology and contemporary architecture at The New School in Greenwich Village, where he majored in liberal arts, with a concentration in democracy and cultural <b>pluralism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr was {{the focus}} of the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited <b>pluralism</b> and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
5|$|Stigand (died 1072) was an Anglo-Saxon churchman in pre-Norman Conquest England {{who became}} Archbishop of Canterbury. His birth date is unknown, but by 1020 he was {{serving as a}} royal {{chaplain}} and advisor. He was named Bishop of Elmham in 1043, and was later Bishop of Winchester and Archbishop of Canterbury. Stigand was an advisor to {{several members of the}} Anglo-Saxon and Norman English royal dynasties, serving six successive kings. Excommunicated by several popes for his <b>pluralism</b> in holding the two sees, or bishoprics, of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently, he was finally deposed in 1070, and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by William the Conqueror. Stigand was imprisoned at Winchester, where he died without regaining his liberty.|$|E
5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his <b>pluralism.</b> Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth {{and how it was}} earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{vision of}} an {{independent}} India based on religious <b>pluralism,</b> however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs {{made their way to}} their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's defeat {{also changed}} the {{religious}} {{balance in the}} northwestern states. Although the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had addressed earlier the problem of religious <b>pluralism,</b> the solution potentially converted simple, and usually local, legal disputes into dynastic and religious warfare, as the Cologne War itself demonstrated. The result of the Cologne War gave the Counter Reformation {{a foothold in the}} lower Rhine. Ernst was a product of Jesuit education. Once his position was secured, he invited Jesuits into the territory to help re-establish Catholicism, a task which the Order approached zealously. They ejected Protestant pastors from parishes, sometimes by force, and re-established catechism education and pastoral visitations. Even when communities appeared to be reconverted, the Jesuits maintained strict supervision to identify recalcitrant Protestants or backsliders. The Jesuit reintroduction of Catholicism postponed the solution of Germany's religious problems for another half century.|$|E
5|$|In around 1270, Peckham {{returned}} to England, where he {{taught at the}} University of Oxford, and was elected the provincial minister of England (Minoriten) in 1275. After a brief stint in Rome, he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1279. His time as archbishop was marked by efforts to improve discipline in the clergy as well as reorganize the estates of his see. <b>Pluralism,</b> or holding more than one clerical benefice, {{was one of the}} abuses that Peckham combatted. He served King Edward I of England in Wales, where he formed a low opinion of the Welsh people and laws. Before and during his time as archbishop, he wrote a number of works on optics, philosophy, and theology, as well as writing hymns. Numerous manuscripts of his works survive. On his death, his body was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, but his heart was given to the Franciscans for burial.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from <b>pluralism,</b> critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
5|$|Rudra's {{evolution}} from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BC), according to Gavin Flood. Prior to it, the Upanishadic literature is monistic, and the Shvetashvatara text presents the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva {{is identified as}} {{the creator of the}} cosmos and liberator of souls from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Shaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BC) and in the Mahabharata. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents <b>pluralism,</b> pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious <b>pluralism,</b> although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
5|$|After his {{translation}} to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to {{his brother}} Æthelmær, but retained the bishopric of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one, there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained Winchester out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury {{may not have been}} secure. Besides these, he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps other abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared <b>pluralism</b> to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.|$|E
5|$|Because of the 1976 {{disturbances}} and {{the subsequent}} arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by Jacek Kuroń, Antoni Macierewicz, Jan Józef Lipski and Adam Michnik founded and operated the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotników; KOR). The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression. Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role {{of the working class}} in resisting the abuses of the regime and the newly formed opposition increasingly became characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers. The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered political <b>pluralism.</b> More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (ROPCiO), Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZW) and the Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN). The periodical Robotnik ("The Worker") was distributed in factories from September 1977. The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970–71, but was later developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of Solidarity. The KPN represented the minority at that time right-wing of the Polish opposition scene. The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the Polish constitution, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. They fit within the post-Helsinki Soviet Bloc human rights movements {{and for the most part}} had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Mikhail Gorbachev {{introduced}} perestroika and its reforms, permitting {{free speech and}} <b>pluralism,</b> Aeroflot had shown considerable growth. In 1950, air transportation only accounted for 1.2 {{percent of the total}} passenger transportation turnover in the Soviet Union, yet, by 1987, air travel accounted for 18.7 of that. It continues growing today. After the Soviet Union broke up, Boris Yeltsin ushered in a new, free market economy. Foreign airlines were permitted to land in Russia and Aeroflot split into several sectors, including today's airline that bears the same name. It became a privatized company, and soon other airlines found their way into the Russian spotlight. Transaero Airlines and S7 (Sibir) Airlines commenced operations in mid-1992. In 1993, Transaero became the first Russian aircraft operator to receive Boeing airplanes. Transaero only operated three Russian built Tu-124 airplanes, the rest of their fleet consists of only Boeing types (747, 777, 767)—modernizing and Westernizing Russian aviation. S7, though originally operating more Soviet-built airplanes, currently fly only Airbus and Boeing types. Aeroflot, too, followed suit. Beginning in 1994, Aeroflot began taking deliveries of Western Airplanes. Aeroflot uses its Airbus and Boeing fleet primarily on Western routes to encourage Western passenger travel. In 2006, Aeroflot joined the global airline alliance SkyTeam, and in 2010, S7 joined a different global alliance, OneWorld. The Soviet aviation industry has unequivocally shifted to adapt more modern and Western philosophies of air travel, although it was the inventive Soviet style of air transportation that helped build Russia, its industries and its widespread global influence into what it is today.|$|E
5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious <b>pluralism.</b> Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E
5|$|For some Germans, the {{definition}} of nation did not include <b>pluralism,</b> and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Center Party, in schools and education and language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, {{under the control of the}} state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourteenth century the Papacy managed to {{minimise}} {{the problem of}} clerical <b>pluralism,</b> by which clerics held two or more livings, which elsewhere resulted in parish churches being without priests, or serviced by poorly trained and paid vicars and clerks. However, the number of poor clerical livings and a general shortage of clergy in Scotland, particularly after the Black Death, meant that {{in the fifteenth century}} the problem intensified. As a result, parish clergy were largely drawn from the lower and less educated ranks of the profession, leading to frequent complaints about their standards of education or ability. Although there is little clear evidence that standards were declining, this {{would be one of the}} major grievances of the Reformation. Heresy, in the form of Lollardry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century. Lollards were followers of John Wycliffe (c. 1330–84) and later Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415), who called for reform of the Church and rejected its doctrine on the Eucharist. Despite evidence of a number of burnings of heretics and limited popular support for its anti-sacramental elements, it probably remained a small movement. There were also further attempts to differentiate Scottish liturgical practice from that in England, with a printing press established under royal patent in 1507 to replace the English Sarum Use for services.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Protestant historiography {{tended to}} stress the {{corruption}} and unpopularity of the late medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated {{the ways in which}} it met the spiritual needs of different social groups. Historians have discerned a decline of monasticism in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. New monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the 15th century. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later 15th century, who placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s. In most burghs, in contrast to English towns where churches tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, but as the doctrine of Purgatory gained in importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them grew rapidly. The number of altars to saints also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50, as did the number of saints celebrated in Scotland, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary also began to reach Scotland in the 15th century, including The Five Wounds, The Holy Blood and The Holy Name of Jesus and new feasts including The Presentation, The Visitation and Mary of the Snows. In the early 14th century the Papacy managed to minimise the problem of clerical <b>pluralism,</b> but with relatively poor livings and a shortage of clergy, particularly after the Black Death, in the 15th century the number of clerics holding two or more livings rapidly increased. This meant that parish clergy were largely drawn from the lower and less educated ranks of the profession, leading to frequent complaints about their standards of education or ability, although there is little clear evidence that this was actually declining. Heresy, in the form of Lollardry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early 15th century, but despite evidence of a number of burnings of heretics and some apparent support for its anti-sacramental elements, it probably remained a relatively small movement.|$|E
25|$|Evangelical Christians {{believe that}} {{religious}} <b>pluralism</b> is heresy and contradicts the Bible. Some Christians {{have argued that}} religious <b>pluralism</b> is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious <b>pluralism</b> claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some, {{but by no means}} all, Christians hold such <b>pluralism</b> to be logically impossible. Roman Catholicism believes that while it is the fullest and most complete revelation of God to Man, other Christian denominations have also received genuine revelation from God, although partial and incomplete.|$|E
