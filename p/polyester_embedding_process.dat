Optimal embedding is achieved using network flow algorithms {{by considering the}} modifications on the cover image as flows of pixels among different states. This method is not an independent steganographic scheme, but rather it minimizes the embedding impact after the <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> and it’s compatible {{with the majority of}} embedding techniques. Due to its dependence on the <b>embedding</b> <b>process,</b> many optimization problems, such as the minimization of a globally interactive distortion function, that are intractable during the <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> can be solved with relatively low computational cost by rectifying the modifications on the cover image after the <b>embedding</b> <b>process.</b> A distortion function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is provided as a concrete example to illustrate the basic idea of this method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} wafer level <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> for a three dimensional (3 D) embedded micro wafer level package (EMWLP). Wafer level <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> {{was carried out by}} using compression molding machine and low-cost granular epoxy molding compound (EMC). Various molding process parameters such as molding time and temperature and three EMCs of different CTEs were analyzed to achieve reliable 3 D EMWLP. Several molding process issues, such as warpage, die-sweep, EMC penetration, and die-shift, were faced during <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> development. A large warpage of more than 1 mm and die-shift of more than 600 μm were found to occur in reconstructed molded wafer. Wafer level <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> was optimized to reduce warpage and die-shift problems. A significant reduction in warpage (∼ 30 %) and die-shift (∼ 88 %) were achieved after <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> optimization. The detail of process optimization is presented in the paper. Reconstructed molded wafers were subjected to various reliability tests, such as thermal cycle (TC), moisture sensitivity test-level 3 (MST-L 3), and highly accelerated stress test (HAST). Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) analysis of molded wafers was carried out to analyze the void formation and delamination in molded wafers. No major void or delamination was observed in reconstructed wafer after molding as well as after reliability tests. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

Perisporal, membranous organelles connected both to the developing forspore envelope and to the cytoplasmic membrane were encountered in the four species studied. Similar organelles were prominent during growth at the sites of transverse septa formation.

The <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> considers hiding a secret stego message (as watermark), and thus mainly aims at achieving confidentiality and robustness properties in terms of mutual information.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{non-linear}} method of embedding a signature in colour and monochrome images and demonstrate its recovery. The <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> {{can be viewed as}} pseudo-random perturbations to angles between vector elements. The derived angles are dithered by the addition of a watermark, and encoded as a pseudo-noise sequence of dither angle offsets. This is followed by a re-quantisation for storage or transmission. The dither angles are recovered by scaling according to the pre-determined angle quantisation intervals. These intervals may be fixed according to some pattern, or they could be obtained adaptively from the local image. Performing a complex correlation with the known sequence enables recovery of sub-degree dither angles embedded in 8 -bit data. This occurs without recourse to the original image. This <b>embedding</b> <b>process</b> is additive in the angular domain and therefore multiplicative in the signal domain. Since the magnitude of the image vector is conserved, the image energy is largely unaltered by the <b>embedding</b> <b>process.</b> Colour watermarks can be treated as sets of ordered triples (RGB), as pixel pairs in spatial or YIQ/YCbCr colour domain, or in a transform domain.
