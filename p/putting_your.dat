5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{currently}} {{resides in}} San Miguel de Allende, {{a city in}} central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial [...] "Mexican-pink" [...] home with [...] "many creatures little and large." [...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to... Because writing is like <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> head underwater." ...|$|E
500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{hand drill}} {{is a similar}} tool, but uses a longer, thinner spindle; and instead of a bearing block and bow combination, the {{downward}} pressure and spinning is achieved by rubbing the hands together around the spindle. As the hands move downward to the base, where the drill is pinched and the hands are brought quickly to the top one at a time. This can be made unnecessary by cutting a nock {{at the top of}} the drill, tying a cord through this, and then <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> thumbs through loops in the cord. However, skilled operators can either maintain pressure with their hands almost stationary vertically; or, in a movement comparable to floating, can [...] "float" [...] their hands back to the top of the drill. There is a more limited choice of materials to use with this method, needing much softer materials, such as mullein, yucca, cattail, and root wood.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Dwyer went to {{his press}} conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21 page {{prepared}} text later described as a [...] "rambling polemic about the criminal justice system". It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer spoke out {{against the death penalty}} and expressed regret for voting in favor of it {{while he was in the}} Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, [...] "Those of you who are <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The choice {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from Republicans and conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson stated [...] "the timing and choice were inspired", and Mark Steyn stated he was [...] "happy" [...] over the choice. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell said of Palin, [...] "She is strong. She is capable. She is articulate," [...] and suggested opponents should not underestimate her. Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a [...] "bold choice" [...] in picking a [...] "maverick {{who has done}} {{exactly the same thing}} at the state level that he's done at the federal level." [...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal." [...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The longer I think about it, the less well this selection sits with me.... If it were your decision, and you were <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> country first, would you put an untested small-town mayor [...] a heartbeat away from the presidency?". Following an NBC interview, Peggy Noonan commented, [...] "It's over... the most qualified? No." ...|$|E

2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and <b>putting</b> <b>your</b> foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
