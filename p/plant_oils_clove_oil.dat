40|$|AbstractSix {{members of}} the {{mammalian}} transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels respond to varied temperature thresholds. The natural compounds capsaicin and menthol activate noxious heat-sensitive TRPV 1 and cold-sensitive TRPM 8, respectively. The burning and cooling perception of capsaicin and menthol demonstrate that these ion channels mediate thermosensation. We show that, in addition to noxious cold, pungent natural compounds present in cinnamon <b>oil,</b> wintergreen <b>oil,</b> <b>clove</b> <b>oil,</b> mustard oil, and ginger all activate TRPA 1 (ANKTM 1). Bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide acting through its G protein-coupled receptor, also activates TRPA 1. We further show that phospholipase C is an important signaling component for TRPA 1 activation. Cinnamaldehyde, the most specific TRPA 1 activator, excites a subset of sensory neurons highly enriched in cold-sensitive neurons and elicits nociceptive behavior in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRPA 1 activation elicits a painful sensation and provide a potential molecular model for why noxious cold can paradoxically be perceived as burning pain...|$|R

In the laboratory, low concentrations (0. 5 ppt) of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution {{had no effect on}} coral colour or photosynthetic efficiency, irrespective of exposure time (1 – 60 min). Corals treated with high concentrations (50 ppt) of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution died immediately, including those that were exposed briefly (1 min). Intermediate concentrations (5 ppt) of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution produced variable results: a 1 min exposure had no effect, a 10 min exposure caused bleaching and reduced photosynthetic efficiency, and a 60 min exposure caused total mortality. To validate these observations, <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution was applied to corals in situ. Sixty-three days after application, corals treated with 10 ml of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution appeared to be unaffected. It was concluded that (1) limited amounts of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution are unlikely to harm this coral, and (2) <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> solution may represent an 'eco-friendly' alternative to cyanide for use in the live reef-fish trade...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} {{concentrations of}} <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> {{were applied to}} two different size groups of singhi (Heteropneustes fossilis) and lata (Channa punctatus) fish to observe the anaesthetic effect and to find an optimum dose. Two groups each consisting of 10 fish was exposed to 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 03 % <b>clove</b> <b>oil.</b> All fish of either size anaesthetized with 0. 01 % <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> exhibited longer induction and shorter recovery period. Exposure to 0. 03 % concentration of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> produced shorter induction and longer recovery period. The smoothness of induction of anaesthesia and recovery was the best in all groups with 0. 02 % <b>clove</b> <b>oil.</b> There was no mortality encountered with 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % concentration. Exposure to 0. 03 % of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> produced 20 % mortality in larger singhi. In smaller and larger lata, the mortality rate was 60 and 50 %, respectively. <b>Clove</b> <b>oil</b> (0. 02 %) {{appeared to be a}} suitable agent for anaesthesia in these two species of fish.

50|$|Many {{essential}} oils affect {{the skin and}} mucous membranes {{in ways that are}} valuable or harmful. Many {{essential oils}}, particularly tea tree oil, may cause contact dermatitis. They are used in antiseptics and liniments in particular. Typically, they produce rubefacient irritation at first and then counterirritant numbness. Turpentine oil and camphor are two typical examples of oils that cause such effects. Menthol and some others produce a feeling of cold followed by a sense of burning. This is caused by its effect on heat-sensing nerve endings. Some essential <b>oils,</b> such as <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> or eugenol, were popular for many hundred years in dentistry as antiseptics and local anesthetics.|$|R
40|$|A noninvasive device {{capable of}} {{recording}} both gill and lateral fin movements was assembled {{and used to}} analyze initial and post-treatment activity frequency (Hz) in fish exposed to anesthetics. Exposure of platy fish (Xiphosphorus maculatus) to saponins from quillaja bark (0. 185 mM and 0. 555 mM) initially caused hyperactivity, but within five minutes all activity ceased and the fish failed to recover. In contrast, <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> (67 μg/L) added to water at 22 oC reduced activity by 22. 8 % ± 8. 9 % (P = 0. 038) after 125 ± 19 sec, a sedative effect that was totally reversible. Cinnamon <b>oil</b> compared with <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> had a significantly longer time to sedation (125 ± 19 versus 235 ± 24 sec, P = 0. 02), although {{no significant difference in}} the decline in activity was noted.

30|$|Another {{important}} {{trait of}} pathogenicity is biofilm formation. Biofilms exhibit greater resistance to antimicrobial agents and {{are difficult to}} treat (Ahn et al. 2008; Curtis et al. 2011). Therefore, the antibiofilm activities of carvacrol (M- 1) and thymol (M- 2) against S. mutans was determined. The results of crystal violet assay and the qualitative examination of the biofilms under SEM (Fig.  6) suggest that the two compounds significantly reduce the biofilm formation by S. mutans. In gene expression studies also the downregulation of glycosyl transferase B (gtfB) gene suggests the inhibition of biofilm formation. Previously the antibiofilm activity of thymol and carvacrol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported (Ceylan and Ugur 2015). Chlorhexdine digluconate also reduced the biofilm formation at a concentration of 10  µg/ml. Inhibition of biofilm formation by chlorhexidine {{has been reported in}} in vivo studies also (Bailón-Sánchez et al. 2014). As far as the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> are concerned <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> was found to be least effective.|$|R
40|$|A <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> {{microemulsion}} {{system was}} proposed for preparing silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). The {{effects of the}} <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> concentration and the reaction time on the formation of Ag-NPs were investigated. The synthesized Ag-NPs was characterized by UVâVis, X-ray diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. It {{was found that the}} <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> acted as a reducing agent and a stabilizer in the formation of silver nanoparticles. The mechanism was that Ag+ was adsorbed on the oilâwater interface by the active groups of the <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> in the microemulsion in which it was then reduced to nano-Ag. Furthermore, microspheres were formed on the surface of nano-Ag through complexation of macromolecular substances. Alkyl and aromatic hydrophobic groups that were distributed on the surface of nano-Ag were driven into the <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> phase under the promotion of Gibbs free energy. Thus, Ag nano-particles with good dispersibility and stability were obtained. The infrared spectrum shows that the outer layer of the nanoparticles coated with active groups of <b>clove</b> <b>oil,</b> which can give the silver nanoparticles better antibacterial. Ag nano-particles of spherical, polygonal, and rod-like shapes were achieved by controlling the initial <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> concentration and the reaction time.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the mosquito repellent activity of herbal essential oils against female Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Methods: On a volunteer’s forearm, 0. 1 mL of each essential oil {{was applied to}} 3 cm伊 10 cm of exposed skin. The protection time was recorded for 3 min after every 30 min. Results: Essential <b>oil</b> from <b>clove</b> <b>oil</b> in olive oil and in coconut oil gave the longest lasting period of 76. 50 min and 96. 00 min respectively against Aedes aegypti. The citronella grass oil in olive oil, citronella grass oil in coconut oil and lemongrass oil in coconut oil exhibited protection against Culex quinquefasciatus at 165. 00, 105. 00, and 112. 50 min respectively. Conclusions: The results clearly indicated that <b>clove,</b> citronella and lemongrass <b>oil</b> were the most promising for repellency against mosquito species.
