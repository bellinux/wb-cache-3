5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the <b>papillary</b> <b>dermis.</b> Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E

40|$|Delivering a drug {{into and}} through the skin is of {{interest}} as the skin can act as an alternative drug administration route for oral delivery. The development of new delivery methods, such as microneedles, {{makes it possible to}} not only deliver small molecules into the skin, which are able to pass the outer layer of the skin in therapeutic amounts, but also macromolecules. To provide insight into the administration of these molecules into the skin, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the transport of macromolecules within and between its various layers. The diffusion coefficients in the epidermis and several locations in the <b>papillary</b> and reticular <b>dermis</b> were determined for fluorescein dextran of 40 and 500 kDa using a combination of fluorescent recovery after photobleaching experiments and finite element analysis. The diffusion coefficient was significantly higher for 40 kDa than 500 kDa dextran, with median values of 23 and 9 µm 2 /s in the dermis, respectively. The values only marginally varied within and between <b>papillary</b> and reticular <b>dermis.</b> For the 40 kDa dextran, the diffusion coefficient in the epidermis was twice as low as in the dermis layers.

The OCT images of neonatal thin skin have organized layered structure with four horizontally oriented layers. Thick skin of newborns has no structure typical for adult skin and no clear transition from the papillary to the cellular dermis.

40|$|Drugs can be {{delivered}} transdermally using jet injectors, which can be an advantageous route compared to oral administration. However, these devices inject large volumes deep into the skin or tissues underneath the skin often causing bruising and pain. This may be prevented by injecting smaller volumes at lower depth in a repetitive way using a microjet injection device. Such a device {{could be used to}} apply drugs in a controllable and sustainable manner. However, the efficacy of microjet injection has been rarely examined. In this study, the penetration and delivery capacity was examined of a repetitive microjet injection device. Various experiments were performed on epidermal and full-thickness ex vivo human as well as ex vivo porcine skin samples. Results revealed that microjets with a velocity exceeding 90 m/s penetrated an epidermal skin sample with a delivery efficiency of approximately 96 %. In full-thickness human skin, the delivery efficiency drastically decreased to a value of approximately 12 %. Experiments on full-thickness skin revealed that the microjets penetrated to a depth corresponding to the transition between the <b>papillary</b> and reticular <b>dermis.</b> This depth did not further increase with increasing number of microjets.

40|$|Steroid atrophy was induced in 3 volunteers by the continuous, {{occlusive}} {{application of}} clobetasol propionate to the forearms for 6 weeks. The changes were followed sequentially by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. A 59 % decrease in viable epidermal thickness was noted after the sixth week of treatment, {{as well as}} a flattening of the dermal-epidermal junction. The 3 -dimensional architecture of the dermis was strikingly reorganized. This was largely brought about by resorption of the ground substance as revealed by a progressive dimunition of Hale's stain for acid mucopolysaccharides. Loss of ground substance resulted in decreased spaces between collagen and elastic fibers as shown by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The fibrous network consequently collapsed, yielding a more compact <b>papillary</b> and reticular <b>dermis.</b> This compression caused the reorientation of both collagen and elastic fibers. However, no differences in collagen and elastin fine structure were noted. Fibroblasts were shrunken but not reduced in density. A marked decrease in number of mast cells was noted in 3 -week specimens and virtually no mast cells were observed after 6 weeks. We found that the primary effect of short-term steroid use was a rearrangement of the geometry of the denial fibrous network. This was not due to alterations in the fibers themselves but a secondary consequence of the loss of ground substance...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study is to present the ‘chronic’ or ‘persistent’ form of hookworm-related {{cutaneous}} larva migrans. MethodsFrom 1998 to 2011, 13 patients were seen in our department with clinically typical hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans that had been present for more than 5 months and that, because of the absence of pruritus, had never been treated. ResultsThe duration of hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans ranged from 5 to 14 months (mean 7. 8 months) in these 13 patients (10 males and three females, aged 23 – 55 years). The infestation was acquired in Brazil (three patients), Jamaica (three patients), Mexico (two patients), Tanzania (two patients), Thailand (two patients), and Martinique (one patient). The infestation was located on the feet in 10 patients; one of these patients also presented tracks on the back and another presented tracks on a knee. The chest (two patients) and thigh (two patients) were also involved. All patients presented with clinically typical hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans: seven patients had one track and six patients had two tracks. Laboratory and instrumental examinations were within the normal range or negative. Histopathological examination revealed edema in the <b>papillary</b> and upper <b>dermis,</b> and a perivascular and perifollicular infiltrate in the upper dermis, consisting mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils. No larvae were detected. ConclusionsThis can be considered the ‘chronic’ or ‘persistent’ form of hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans. Some pathogenetic hypotheses are suggested...|$|R

40|$|Background: The histologic {{diagnosis}} of early mycosis fungoides (MF) and its distinction from inflammatory dermatoses is challenging, {{owing to the}} overlap of several features. Aims: 1) To assess the efficacy of histologic criteria to diagnose early MF, 2) to study their utility in differentiating inflammatory mimics of MF. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed slides from 50 cases clinically/histologically suspicious for MF. The diagnoses were established based on response to treatment and follow-up. The slides were analyzed double-blinded by two observers independently. Twenty-eight histologic criteria were assessed and each criterion was graded. Univariate analysis {{was performed on the}} results. Results: There were 17 cases of MF and 33 of inflammatory dermatoses. Of the 28 criteria, the following 15 achieved significance on univariate analysis: disproportionate epidermotropism, tagging of lymphocytes along the basal layer, haloed lymphocytes, convoluted lymphocytes, Pautrier&#x 2032;s abscesses, larger epidermal lymphocytes, wiry dermal collagen, absence of edema, eccrine infiltration, folliculotropism, follicular mucin, involvement of <b>papillary</b> and reticular <b>dermis,</b> monomorphous infiltrates, and atypia of dermal lymphocytes. The criteria that were 100 &#x 0025; specific for MF included convoluted lymphocytes, eccrine infiltration, and follicular mucin. Absence of edema was 100 &#x 0025; sensitive and specific in distinguishing MF from its inflammatory mimics. Conclusions: A combination of histologic patterns and cytology of lymphocytes is reliable in distinguishing MF from inflammatory dermatoses. No single criterion is effective in achieving this. Rather than merely recording {{the presence or absence of}} a criterion, grading each of them adds objectivity to the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide is {{a potent}} {{mediator}} of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, the synthesis of which is catalyzed by the constitutively expressed enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In this study we have investigated whether human dermal microvascular endothelial cells express endothelial nitric oxide synthase and whether the vasodilator neuropeptides, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, stimulate the release of nitric oxide from these cells. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase was identified by immunohistochemistry in the blood vessels in both the <b>papillary</b> and deep <b>dermis</b> of normal skin, and also in monolayers of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. On western blots of protein extracts prepared from both the dermis of normal human skin and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, a 135 -kDa band corresponding to endothellal nitric oxide synthase was identified. Nitric oxide was released from unstimulated human dermal microvascular endothelial cells as assessed by inhibition of platelet aggregation and nitrite formation. Endothelial cell-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation was blocked by hemoglobin, which binds nitric oxide. Substance P (10 nM) potentiated micro-vascular endothelial cell inhibition of platelet aggregation, and this effect was also blocked by hemoglobin. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (100 pM to 100 nM) directly inhibited platelet aggregation, and this direct effect was not modulated by microvascular endotheial cells. Substance P (10 nM to 1 μM) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (100 pM to 10 nM) significantly (p < 0. 05) increased nitrite formation, and this increase was blocked by the competitive nitric oxide synthase antagonist, NGmonomethyl-L-arginine. These results demonstrate that endothelial nitric oxide synthase is expressed in the microvascular endothelium of normal human skin and that human dermal microvascular endothelial cells release nitric oxide constitutively {{and in response to}} vasodilator neuropeptides...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are {{diagnosed}} by clinical evaluation, which can include dermoscopic evaluation, biopsy, and histopathologic examination. Recent translation of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to clinical practice {{raises the possibility}} of noninvasive, label-free in vivo imaging of BCCs that could reduce the time from consultation to treatment. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the capability of MPM to image in vivo BCC lesions in human skin, and to evaluate if histopathologic criteria can be identified in MPM images. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Imaging in patients with BCCwas performed at the University of California-Irvine Health Beckman Laser Institute & Medical Clinic, Irvine, between September 2012 and April 2014, with a clinical MPM-based tomograph. Ten BCC lesions were imaged in vivo in 9 patients prior to biopsy. The MPM images were compared with histopathologic findings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: MPM imaging identified in vivo and noninvasively the main histopathologic feature of BCC lesions: nests of basaloid cells showing palisading in the peripheral cell layer at the dermoepidermal junction and/or in the dermis. RESULTS: The main MPM feature associated with the BCC lesions involved nests of basaloid cells present in the <b>papillary</b> and reticular <b>dermis.</b> This feature correlated well with histopathologic examination. Other MPM features included elongated tumor cells in the epidermis aligned in 1 direction and parallel collagen and elastin bundles surrounding the tumors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study demonstrates, in a limited patient population, that noninvasive in vivo MPM imaging can provide label-free contrast that reveals several characteristic features of BCC lesions. Future {{studies are needed to}} validate the technique and correlate MPM performance with histopathologic examination...|$|R
