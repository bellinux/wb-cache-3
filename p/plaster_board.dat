500|$|Radcliffe became {{well known}} for its paper industry; its mills {{included}} the East Lancashire Paper Mill and Radcliffe Paper Mill. The former was founded by the Seddon family on 29 March 1860, {{along the banks of}} the Irwell. Its construction provided much-needed employment: in the 1860s living standards within the town were poor, and local mills often operated on [...] "short time". A reduction in the demand for coal had placed many colliers out of work, and the Lancashire Cotton Famine was starving Lancashire of raw materials, especially cotton. Soup kitchens were opened by local benefactors, and many local residents were on poor relief. The mill began producing low grade paper and newsprint, moving on to other products including high quality printing and writing papers. Radcliffe Paper Mill was formed during the First World War, when it took over from a paper mill and a pipe plant. It originally produced paper suitable for roofing felt, to cater for a national shortage. After World War II the mill employed over 600people and produced 70,000tons of paper annually. British <b>Plaster</b> <b>Board</b> Industries (BPB) took over the company in 1961.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{different}} {{commercially available}} gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>boards</b> are investigated experimentally at fire temperatures {{with respect to}} their thermo-physical properties i. e., thermal conductivity, effective heat capacity and density. It is shown that depending on different ingredients (carbonates) different endothermic reactions occur between room temperature and 9008 C. These reactions strongly influence the temperature dependence of the mentioned properties which in turn affect the response of the material to fire. Based on these experimental results the thermal reaction of a gypsum-protected steel column in fire is modeled for the four types of gypsum. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate clearly the advantages caused by certain ingredients of the chemical composition of gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>boards.</b> KEY WORDS: gypsum board, thermal analysis, dehydration, calcination, effective heat capacity, ISO standard fire, steel columns, dolomite, calcite...|$|R

50|$|Gypsum board evolved between 1910 and 1930 {{beginning}} with wrapped board edges and {{elimination of the}} two inner layers of felt paper in favor of paper-based facings. In 1910 United States Gypsum Corporation bought Sackett <b>Plaster</b> <b>Board</b> Company and by 1917 {{came out with a}} product they called Sheetrock. Providing efficiency of installation, it was developed additionally as a measure of fire resistance. Later air entrainment technology made boards lighter and less brittle, then joint treatment materials and systems also evolved. Rock lath (gypsum lath) was an early substrate for plaster. An alternative to traditional wood or metal lath, it was a panel made up of compressed gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>board</b> that was sometimes grooved or punched with holes to allow wet plaster to key into its surface. As it evolved, it was faced with paper impregnated with gypsum crystals that bonded with the applied facing layer of plaster.|$|E

40|$|<b>Plaster</b> <b>boards</b> are {{heterogeneous}} {{materials with}} quite substantial {{degree of attenuation}} when exposed to ultrasonic waves. The attenuation properties are determined from the frequency shifts induced {{by the presence of}} scatterers within the material continuum. In this work, ultrasonic principle is used to estimate the frequency shifts in three different <b>plaster</b> boards-Cement <b>board</b> (CB), Glass Fiber Reinforced Gypsum (GRG) and Exterior Glass fiber Reinforced Gypsum (EGRG) - for the purpose of attenuation characterization. 49 signals, obtained via ultrasonic backscattered echo technique, were extracted from the samples of each material with contact mode Harisonic 2. 25 MHz transducer connected to the workstation. These signals are processed via time domain and optimized homomorphic analyses. Histograms of the time domain results indicate a general shift towards the low amplitudes and non-uniform shift magnitudes are observed in each sample and across the three materials. The skewness and standard deviation of the frequency shifts clearly show some fundamental differences in scattering and absorption nature of these materials. Downwards shifts in the centre frequencies compared to the steel reference material are equally significant. The mean center frequencies are found to be 2. 3891, 2. 2695 and 2. 2102 MHz for CB, GRG and EGRG respectively indicating lowest attenuation in CB. Also, attenuations are found to increase with increase in frequency within the limit of the transducer bandwidth of 2. 0286 and 3. 4402 MHz. Tests of repetitions confirm that the observed frequency changes are due to sample non-uniformity and not signal processing artifacts...|$|R
