40|$|Bartlett (1958. Thinking. New York: Basic Books) {{described}} the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> as a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> irrevocable commitment to action, which {{was preceded by}} a period of gradually increasing commitment. As such, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> reflects a fundamental limit {{on the ability to}} control thought and action. I review the literature on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return,</b> taking three perspectives. First, I consider the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> {{from the perspective of the}} controlled act, as a locus in the architecture and anatomy of the underlying processes. I review experiments from the stop-signal paradigm that suggest that the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> is located late in the response system. Then I consider the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> from the perspective of the act of control that tries to change the controlled act before it becomes irrevocable. From this perspective, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> is a point in time that provides enough “lead time ” for the act of control to take effect. I review experiments that measure the response time to the stop signal as the lead time required for response inhi-bition in the stop-signal paradigm. Finally, I consider the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> in hierarchically controlled tasks, in which there may be many <b>points</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> at different levels of the hierarchy. I review exper-iments on skilled typing that suggest different <b>points</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> for the commands that determine what is typed and the countermands that inhibit typing, with increasing commitment to action the lower the level in the hierarchy. I end by considering the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return</b> in perception and thought as well as action...|$|R

50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>return.</b> The <b>point</b> {{with the}} {{greatest}} y-coordinate is called the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>return,</b> as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best. While c in Figure 1 is labeling the return curve in general, the highlighted point just above it at X=6, represents the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>return.</b> Extending our above example, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>return</b> for first-year graduate students would be 6 cups of coffee; they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups.

50|$|The {{ability to}} {{diagnose}} AKI before {{acute kidney failure}} is financially beneficial and favorable for preventative health measures. More than 10% {{of people in the}} United States will develop some kind of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with higher incidences for individuals that suffer from obesity, elevated cholesterol, and a family history of CKD. There is no <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> once there is a significant injury to the kidney; therefore, early diagnosis of kidney injury is important for preventing AKI. Using NGAL as a biomarker can lower hospital costs because less patients will reach a critical stage in kidney injury. Ultimately, diagnosis of AKI with NGAL can reduce the time a patient stays in a hospital. For example, the early diagnosis of AKI with NGAL as a biomarker can help a patient avoid kidney dialysis.|$|E

Also, the airfield became a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> for many aircraft being flown from Europe back to the United States, along with their aircrews and some support personnel.

He was educated in India and at Columbia University, US. Deb began his career in journalism as a sports {{journalist}} in Calcutta in 1994 before moving to Delhi to continue regular journalism until 1998. His first novel, The <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Return,</b> is semi-autobiographical in nature and is set in a fictional hill-station that closely resembles Shillong in India's Northeast. His second novel, Surface, also set in Northeast India, is about a disillusioned Sikh journalist. His first non-fiction book, The Beautiful And the Damned: A Portrait of the New India was published in June 2011 by Viking Penguin. He has also contributed to The Boston Globe, The Guardian, The Nation, New Statesman, Harper's, the London Review of Books, and The Times Literary Supplement.

5000|$|The {{necessary}} {{elements to}} tackle this enormous problem illegal immigration effectively are: (1) Increasing {{the funding of}} technology and security personnel along the border, (2) Making {{it more difficult for}} illegal aliens to get jobs in this country, and (3) providing a workable and practical means for migrant workers to meet the job needs in this country when those jobs cannot be filled otherwise. When, and only when, these security measures are established then it is appropriate to begin a conversation on providing a temporary legal status to the eight million illegal workers already in this country. It is a significant security vulnerability to allow such a large population live and work anonymously in our communities, with no legal identities or other common connections to society. It is, in fact, a terrorist's dream. Moreover, any legal status should be a temporary work permit with a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to the alien's home country." ...|$|E

With this aim we consider not only the most common measures, but also new indicators {{based on the information}} theory: the quadratic and the double quadratic measures. The polynomic functions related to these measures provide more flexible expressions than those obtained from the common measures of inequality. As a consequence these new expressions allow the possibility of the existence of more than one <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> suggesting a better capability of adaptation to different empirical realities. The work also includes the estimation of the growth-inequality relationship and the contrast of the Kuznets’hypothesis for an international database...|$|E

The analysis emphasizes three explanations of why it should be optimal to migrate only temporarily: differences in relative prices in the host and home country, the possibility of accumulating human capital abroad, which is only earnings effective back home, and complementarities between consumption and the environment where consumption takes place. Some hypotheses implied by the theory are empirically tested, using micro data on migrant workers in Germany.

40|$|Prepared for {{presentation}} at the Congress of the International Institute of Public Finance (IIPF) in Seville, Spain, 28 – 31 August 2000, for the session on the opportunity-equalising effects of fiscal systems. University education is nowadays provided as public goods in the Czech Republic. Due to economic pressure on public finance the trend of the 90 s became the internalisation of costs associated with university education. The generally accepted hypothesis is that nowadays the returns from the costs of university education are achieved in a shorter time than before economic transition. Additionally, {{it is thought that}} the return on university education is differentiated by professions. We aim to test these hypotheses. That is why the cornerstone of our study is the deeper analysis of the differentiation of selected professions in the current state in comparison to the period before transition. After 1989, due to the economic transition and development of the market economy, wage differentiation accelerated in the Czech Republic. An important factor in differentiation seems to be the level of human capital, represented above all by university education. Education significantly increased the chance of finding a job, as another analysis has proven. However, these positive effects of education have been paid for by considerable monetary and non-monetary costs. The paper provides an economic analysis at the level of an individual and his <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> between costs and revenues from university education. To achieve an exact but still simple analysis we take into account only quantifiable monetary costs and revenues. The calculation of the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> is done {{with the use of the}} construction of a cumulated whole-life income and its interpolation. The analysis uses data for the Czech Republic in 1988 and 1997.
