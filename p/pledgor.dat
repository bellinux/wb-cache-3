Furtum had in the early and mid-Republic required the carrying away of a thing. This was widened and there are several examples from the classical Rome and later where it is even hard to find physical contact in any sense. Contrectatio extended to dealing with the thing as if the owner, and [...] "physical interference" [...] can be considered a more accurate term than just touching. The idea of furtum, and conrectatio in particular, broadened during the republic to complement the narrowly defined Lex Aquilia. This did, for example, include using a borrowed thing in a way which went beyond that agreed with the lender (furtum usus), such as borrowing a horse and riding it for longer than agreed. During the Republic, no distinction was made in language between furtum usus and furtum in general. Contrectio included what might be thought of as fraud: knowingly accepting a wrongful payment, or embezzlement, for example. The case of wrongful payment is problematic, because a mistaken payment still transferred ownership; it seems contradictory that the receiver was granted ownership and still liable for theft. To accept a thing as a pledge knowing that it did not belong to the <b>pledgor</b> was also furtum [...] not merely acting as an accomplice. Plautus, a playwright, suggests that failing to report a theft after the fact was furtum, but this should not be assumed. The development of contrectio as the preferred prohibited act accompanied that of the criminal law, the actio doli (for fraud) and the Aquilian actions.|$|E

40|$|Spurred by {{the harsh}} {{economics}} of the Great Depression, California enacted several statutes designed to protect <b>pledgors</b> of real property from unfair and often ruinous deficiency judgments. This legislation includes Code of Civil Procedure sections 580 a,the fair value section, 580 b,the purchase-money anti-deficiency statute, 580 d; the nonjudicial foreclosure anti-deficiency statute, and 726, the 2 ̆ 2 one-action 2 ̆ 2 rule. Three decades of judicial interpretation, however, have created a body of case law which fails to advance the legislative purposes upon which the courts purportedly base their decisions. The {{time has come for}} California to substantially revise its Depression-era anti-deficiency legislation in order to express and effectuate purposes consistent with the expectations of both debtor and creditor in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. Current sections 580 a, 580 b and 726 have generated much controversy in their application. The results obtained in the everyday application of the statutes as interpreted by the courts, are irreconcilable with the court-declared principles that underlie this legislation. Therefore, the author proposes a revision of sections 580 a, 580 b and 726 to bring those statutes in line with the needs of real estate borrowers and creditors today. The author proposes an amendment of section 580 a which, while leaving section 580 d intact, would breathe new vitality into the dormant statute by applying its principle of fair valuation to certain foreclosure situations in which the value should, in equity, be considered by the courts. A growing trend in both case law and in legislation has been to provide increasing protection for homeowners, while exercising a hands-off policy in commercial transactions. The author 2 ̆ 7 s proposed amendments would codify this trend by incorporating the protection forwarded homeowners, while allowing deficiency judgments in commercial transactions subject to the fair value provisions of the amended section 580 a. The two aspects of section 726 - affirmative defense and sanction effect - must be clarified so that the courts will apply the statute as the Legislature intended. Section II of this article reviews the present statutes and case law interpreting them in order to illustrate the problems with the anti-deficiency statutes and the contexts in which they have arisen. Section III highlights the current legislative policy to give special protection to residential real estate purchasers. In section IV, the proposed statutory revisions are set out and analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The major flaw {{with the}} pledge {{is that it}} {{requires}} physical possession by the pledgee, which traps a business <b>pledgor</b> in a paradox. Unless the pledgee literally occupies the same premises as the pledger, the collateral once transferred is unavailable for the <b>pledgor</b> to operate its business and generate income to repay the pledgee. Lawyers in many jurisdictions tried to get around this problem with creative devices like conditional sales and trust receipts (see below) with varying results.|$|E

50|$|As {{the pledge}} {{is for the}} benefit of both parties, the pledgee is bound to {{exercise}} only ordinary care over the pledge. The pledgee has the right of selling the pledge if the <b>pledgor</b> fails to make payment at the stipulated time. No right is acquired by the wrongful sale of a pledge except in the case of property passing by delivery, such as money or negotiable securities. In the case of a wrongful sale by a pledgee, the <b>pledgor</b> cannot recover the value of the pledge without a tender of the amount due.|$|E
50|$|It {{developed}} {{later than}} the similar fiducia, where ownership was transferred as well as possession. Accordingly, the thing could be sold by the owner and deducted from the debt without recourse to the <b>pledgor,</b> and whilst it was owned by pledgee the <b>pledgor</b> had no right of use. It also required a formal conveyance. This {{is in contrast to}} the pignus, which could be carried out by traditio. Fiducia remained popular with lenders who enjoyed increased security, whereas a pignus was more useful to the pledger. Fiducia lasted until the late empire, but was increasingly eclipsed by pignus.|$|E
50|$|A pledge {{does not}} confer {{a right to}} appoint a {{receiver}} or foreclose. If the holder of pledge sells or disposes of the pledged assets when not entitled to do so, they may be liable in conversion to the <b>pledgor.</b>|$|E
50|$|A pledge {{does not}} give the <b>pledgor</b> (or debtor) the option of {{retaining}} the property while burdening it with the real security right, {{but it can be}} created in respect both of corporeal and of incorporeal property. A pledge in respect of incorporeal property is commonly referred to as a security cession (cessio in securitatem debiti), meaning that a claim against a third party is ceded to the pledgee; in this case, personal rights vest in the pledgee. Control that vests in the pledgee is known as quasi-control. The primary claim, however, remains vested in the <b>pledgor.</b> An act of publicity may be required: for example, sending notice of cession to the pledgor's debtors.|$|E

50|$|A pledge is a {{bailment}} that conveys {{possessory title}} to property owned by a debtor (the <b>pledgor)</b> to a creditor (the pledgee) to secure repayment for some debt or obligation and to the mutual benefit of both parties.

50|$|The chief {{difference}} between Roman and English law is that certain things (e.g. apparel, furniture and instruments of tillage) {{could not be}} pledged in Roman law, {{while there is no}} such restriction in English law.

50|$|The most {{important}} of the entitlements conferred by the pledge on the pledgee is his right of preference to the {{proceeds of the sale}} in execution. Although the pledgee is entitled to possession, he is not entitled to use it, enjoy it or take any of its fruits.

50|$|The pledgee, {{if he was}} in {{physical}} control of the object (as was usually the case) was required to safeguard the thing. Like the borrower, a pledgee was held to the culpa levis in abstracto standard; again, this may have developed from custodia. The <b>pledgor</b> was liable for damage done by his thing deposited, if he acted without the care of a bonus paterfamilias. If the pledgee fell short of the expected standard, the contract was terminated immediately. The pledgee could claim for expenses incurred in maintaining the thing (such as an animal or slave). The pledgee had to set any profits derived from the thing against the outstanding debt. The pledge was repaid when the debt was settled, along with any accretions. The <b>pledgor</b> had no action without repayment. The pledgee did not have ownership, and therefore could not sell or destroy the thing, which was restrictive. A right of sale was typically agreed between the parties, to come into effect after a set time. So common was this that it was often considered implied. The amount would be deducted from the debt, interest and expenses added, and this could then be sued for under whichever contract had formed the debt.|$|E

50|$|For {{a pledge}} to come into {{existence}} as a real security right, {{it is essential that}} delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive, but the pledgee must retain possession of the pledged object. The transfer of possession is intended to publicise the fact that a real security right, {{in the form of a}} pledge, has been established over the pledged object. The transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real security right by preventing the <b>pledgor</b> from alienating the pledged object or pledging it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted.|$|E
50|$|If on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or {{exceeds the}} Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the <b>Pledgor</b> must {{transfer}} Eligible Collateral with a Value at least {{equal to the}} Delivery Amount.

The Credit Support Amount is the Secured Party's Exposure plus Pledgor's Independent Amounts minus Secured Party's Independent Amounts minus the Pledgor's Threshold. The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which haircuts are applied.

Three types of pledges have been analysed: an ordinary pledge regulated by articles 306 - 335 of the civil code, a registered pledge and a statutory pledge related to the agricultural lease (article 701 civil code). The paper presents different issues related to the pledge, including the pledge being a subject and object o f the transaction, and the recovery o f the benefit secured by the pledge.

40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a debtor s bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the <b>pledgor</b> was unable to earn the receivable before the <b>pledgor</b> s bankruptcy, the <b>pledgor</b> s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the <b>pledgor</b> s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the <b>pledgor</b> prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the <b>pledgor</b> s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project. Tutkimuksesta yleensä Tutkimuksessa on pyritty hakemaan vastausta siiten, miten Suomeen voitaisiin luoda maakaasumarkkinat rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeudellisesti kannattavalla tavalla rakentamalla putki Norjasta Ruotsin läpi Suomeen. Tarkastelun kohteena ovat erityisesti projektiyhtiön maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien rakentamista varten ottaman projektilainan vakuudet ja pankkikonsortion vakuusoikeudellinen asema. Tämä pääkysymys huomioiden tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten rahoitus- ja vakuusoikeuden yleisiä oppeja ja sen mahdollistamia oikeudellisia instrumentteja voitaisiin hyödyntää siten, että projektin rahoittava pankkikonsortio saisi lainalleen kattavat vakuudet. Maakaasuputken vaatimat kiinteisöt Tutkimuksen viitekehys muodostuu kiinteistöjen osalta tarkasteltavien maiden kiinteistöjärjestelmien erojen ja yhtäläisyyksien sekä kiinteistön ulottuvuuden selvittämisestä. Kiinteistön ulottuvuudella on merkitystä sen suhteen, mitä omaisuutta kuuluu kiinteistö- tai laitoskiinnityksen piiriin ja mikä osuus on vakuutena yhtiön varoihin vahvistetun yrityskiinnityksen nojalla. Maakaasuputken rahoittajien asema Maakaasuputken rakentaminen toteutetaan projektilainalla/(-lainoilla), jonka myöntää yleensä pankkikonsortio. Senioriluotonantaja, jonka saatavalle junioriluotonantajan saatava on alistettu, on kohdeyhtiön varoja jaettaessa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä muita rahoittajia edellä, joten huonommassa asemassa olevien juniorilainojen pääoma ja korot voidaan maksaa pääsääntöisesti silloin, kun senioriluoton pääoma ja korot on maksettu. Mezzanine-instrumentit ovat sopimuksellisesti tai rakenteellisesti alisteisia suhteessa seniorilainoihin. Mezzanine-velkojat luetaan junioriluotonantajiin. Ne tulevat velkojien keskenään sopimassa maksunsaantijärjestyksessä senioriluotonantajien jälkeen, mutta ennen muita junioriluotonantajia. Tutkimuksessa tullaan perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että tarkoituksenmukaisinta olisi mieltää velkojien välinen alistamissopimus saatavan panttaukseksi tai siirroksi (vaikka sitä kansainvälisessä luotonannossa ei näin jäsennetäkään), taikka vaihtoehtoisesti omaksi vakuusmuodokseen, johon voitaisiin analogisesti soveltaa velkakirjalain määräyksiä. Urakkasopimuksen rakenteen vaikutus ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuuteen sekä ansaintaperiaatteen soveltuvuus maakaasuputken tuottaman kassavirran panttaukseen Ansaintaperiaatteella tarkoitetaan panttioikeudellisessa mielessä, ettei saamista koskeva panttaus sido pantinantajan ulosmittausvelkojia ja konkurssivelkojia, ennen kuin pantatun saamisen perusteena olevan pantinantajan suoritusvelvollisuus on täytetty. Ansaintaperiaatteen vaikutusta projektirahoituksessa tarkastellaan tässä tutkimuksessa silmällä pitäen urakoitsijan mahdollisia taloudellisia vaikeuksia ja näiden vaikutusta projektilainan vakuuksiin. Sillä, toimiiko urakoitsija rakennuttajana omaan lukuunsa niin, että maakaasuputken ja kompressoriasemien omistusoikeus luovutetaan projektiyhtiölle vasta niiden valmistuttua vai rakennetaanko putki suoraan projektiyhtiön lukuun niin, että omistusoikeus maakaasuputkeen ja kompressoriasemiin siirtyy sitä mukaa kuin ne valmistuvat, on ratkaiseva merkitys. Ansaintaperiaatetta on perinteisesti tutkittu ja oikeuskäytännössä sovellettu kassavirran panttaamisen yhteydessä. Maakaasun siirtomaksuista kertyvä kassavirta on projektiyhtiön tärkein omaisuuserä. Maakaasua siirtävän projektiyhtiön kassavirran panttaamiseen ansaintaperiaate soveltuu hyvin alalla noudatetun käytännön vuoksi. Tässä tutkimuksessa ansaintaperiaatteen sovellettavuutta tutkitaan kuitenkin myös rakennutettavien esineiden omistusoikeuden siirtymisen kohdalla. Projektiyhtiön pankkitilien panttaus Pankkitilien panttausta koskeva sääntely on tässä tutkimuksessa soveltuvilta osiltaan Pohjoismaissa hyvin samankaltaista. Sillä sijaitsevatko projektiyhtiön pankkitilit pankkikonsortiopankeissa vai jossain näiden ulkopuolisissa pankeissa on kuitenkin merkitystä Ruotsissa. Ruotsin konkurssilaissa ei nimittäin ole erityistä kieltoa pankille kuitata saatavansa pankkitilillä olevia saatavia vastaan, vaikka kuittaus konkurssin ulkopuolella olisikin sopimuksen nojalla kielletty. Ruotsissa tilipankissa olevien varojen on katsottu olevan pankin omaisuutta ja sen käytettävissä kuittaukseen panttauksesta huolimatta. Velkoja voi kuitata velallisen konkurssissa sekä siinä tapauksessa, että hänen oma velkansa on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen että siinä tapauksessa, että velallisen velka on erääntymätön tai ehdollinen. Suomessa pankkien eriarvoisuudesta johtuvat ongelmat on huomioitu konkurssilaissa. Ongelma esiintyy ainoastaan tilanteessa, jossa projektilainanvakuudet täytyy jakaa pankkikonsortion jäsenten kesken. Käytännössä kuitenkin projektilainan vakuuksia hallinnoi aina vakuusagentti kaikkien pankkikonsortion jäsenten lukuun ja pankkikonsortion jäsenten kuittausoikeus on sopimusoikeudellisesti estetty velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen (intercreditor agreement) kuittauskielloilla. Tutkimuksessa päädytään perustellusti siihen tulokseen, että vakuusagentin käyttö ja velkojien välisen alistamissopimuksen määräykset ovat välttämättömiä erityisesti Ruotsissa, jotta vältetään tilipankin kuittausoikeuden aiheuttama ongelma. Osakekantapantti ja kontrollifunktio Osakekantapantti on projektirahoituksessa takauslain mukainen vierasvelkapanttaus. Pankkikonsortio kontrolloi projektiyhtiön hallintoa tälle annetun valtakirjan ja hallituksen tarkkailijajäsenten avulla. Osakekantapanttiin liittyvä kontrollioikeuden käyttäminen ei merkitse ainoastaan vaikuttamista osakekantapantin kohteena olevaan yhtiöön, vaan kontrollioikeudella säädellään myös osakekantapantin realisointiajankohtaa. Mahdollinen maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaus Kansainvälisiä sijoittajia voisi houkutella sijoittamaan suomalaisiin/Pohjoismaalaisiin hankkeisiin mahdollistamalla maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäytön. Esimerkkiä lupien vakuuskäytölle löytyy muun muassa kaivosluvan vakuuskäytöstä sekä Norjasta, missä putken operoimiseen ja rakentamiseen myönnettyä lupaa voidaan käyttää vakuutena operointia ja rakentamista varten otetulle lainalle. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisen mahdollistaminen ei aiheuttaisi suurta hallinnollista taakkaa maakaasumarkkinaviranomaisena toimivalle Energiamarkkinavirastolle sen vuoksi, ettei Suomeen tule useita maakaasuputkihankkeita. Kyse olisi todennäköisesti muutamasta luvasta. Maakaasuverkkoluvan panttaamisella olisi ehkä enemmänkin merkitystä maakaasuputkihankkeen vakuuskokonaisuuden kannalta. Olisi varmasti oikeuspoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaista, mikäli maakaasuverkkoluvan vakuuskäyttö sallittaisiin, samassa yhteydessä muuttaa lakia/maanmittauslaitosten kirjaamisohjeita mahdollistaen pakkolunastetun käyttöoikeuden luokitteleminen rasitteeksi. Näiden kahden vakuusoikeuteen liittyvän muutoksen avulla pantin kohteena olisi projektiyhtiön harjoittama maakaasuverkkotoiminta sekä toiminnan edellyttämä kiinteistöomaisuus kokonaisuutena. ...|$|E
40|$|A real {{security}} right improves a creditor’s {{chances of}} recovering a debt owed {{to him by}} the debtor. In the case of an ordinary pledge, the <b>pledgor</b> delivers physical control of his movable property to his creditor to serve as security for the repayment of the principal debt. The increasing value and use of movable property as an object of security coupled with technological advancement have resulted in many countries calling for legal reform of real security rights over movable property. In South Africa this led to the introduction of the Security by Means of Movable Property Act 57 of 1993 which makes provision for a pledge without possession. The Act regulates only special notarial bonds and does not apply to general notarial bonds. The real security right vests in the bondholder upon registration of the bond, provided that the movable property encumbered is described in a notarial bond {{in a way that makes}} it readily recognisable. The Act has substituted delivery with registration in the Deeds Registry. Registration of the notarial bond in the Deeds Registry is questioned as to whether it complies with the publicity principle. This is because movable property can be shifted from one place to another without any knowledge on the part of the creditor due to the inaccessible and costly registration system. The third party then receives the property subject to the real security right of the creditor. The substitution of delivery with registration is the controversial feature in this study. Linked to the legal problems regarding compliance with the publicity principle, is the description and identification requirement as provided for under the Act, the exclusion of general notarial bonds from the application of the Act, and the question of whether it is appropriate to regard special notarial bonds as pledges without possession. This study questions whether the current land registry system should be used for the registration of notarial bonds and suggests that a new system designed specifically for the registration of real security rights over movables be considered. I compare the position in the Belgian legal system as regards developments in real security rights over movables to identify possible solutions and recommendations for the South African approach.
