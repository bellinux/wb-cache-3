In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal <b>proliferation</b> <b>and</b> keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of microRNA (miR) - 145 on the <b>proliferation,</b> migration <b>and</b> invasion of the human oral cancer line, TCA 8113. Expression levels of miR- 145 in TCA 8113 cells were detected by quantita-tive PCR. miR- 145 was transfected into human TCA 8113 oral cancer cells <b>and</b> the <b>proliferation,</b> migration <b>and</b> invasion abili-ties of treated TCA 8113 cells were detected by <b>proliferation,</b> migration <b>and</b> invasion assays, respectively. The expression levels of miR‑ 145 in TCA 8113 cells were significantly lower than those in human normal oral keratinocytes (P< 0. 05). Cellular <b>proliferation,</b> migration <b>and</b> invasion abilities in the miR‑ 145 transfection group were significantly lower than those in the control group (all P< 0. 05). High miR- 145 expression was found to negatively regulate the <b>proliferation,</b> migration <b>and</b> invasion of TCA 8113 cells. Results of the present study indicate that the expression of miR- 145 may be associated with the genesis and development of human oral cancer...|$|R

5|$|These GTPases {{regulate}} cell motility, <b>proliferation</b> <b>and</b> {{also contribute}} to tumor progression and invasion. In many cell types, NEDD9 overexpression increases spreading and crescent morphology (an indicator of high motility). However, in fibroblasts, some work has found that absence of NEDD9 leads to more rapid focal adhesion turnover, which led to increase of migration in NEDD9-/- compared to wild type.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear <b>proliferation</b> <b>and</b> a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>proliferation</b> rate <b>and</b> {{degree of differentiation}} has been studied in different regions of transplantable B 16 melanomas. The regions studied were peripheral parts of the tumours and the inner (perivascular) and outer (external) zones of so-called corded structures. The highest <b>proliferation</b> rates <b>and</b> the poorest cellular differentiation (estimated by volume densities of premelanosomes and melanosomes) occurred in the perivascular zones of corded structures. Conversely, the lowest <b>proliferation</b> rates <b>and</b> the best cellular differentiation was encountered in the external zones of corded structures. <b>Proliferation</b> rates <b>and</b> cellular differentiation in the peripheral parts of the tumours were intermediate between the values obtained in the perivascular or external regions of corded structures. The results in corded structures indicate an inverse {{relationship between}} <b>proliferation</b> rate <b>and</b> degree of differentiation, and {{a positive correlation between}} proliferative capacity and blood vessel proximity. The intermediate values in the peripheral parts of tumours may reflect the presence of a mixed population of cells which vary in their proximity to the nearest blood vessel. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.

30|$|Cell cycle {{regulation}} {{is an old}} topic in cell biology and is observed during almost all kinds of cell fate conversions. iPSC have a high <b>proliferation</b> rate <b>and</b> short G 1 phase similar to ESC (Neganova and Lako, 2008; White and Dalton, 2005).

5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear <b>proliferation</b> <b>and</b> the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E

These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal <b>proliferation</b> <b>and</b> migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E

40|$|Therapy that {{promotes}} epithelial repair whilst protecting against fibroproliferation {{is critical for}} restoring lung function in acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Primary human alveolar type II cells were used to model the effects of lipoxin A 4 in vitro upon wound repair, <b>proliferation,</b> apoptosis <b>and</b> transdifferention. Effects of lipoxin A 4 upon primary human lung fibroblast <b>proliferation,</b> collagen production, <b>and</b> myofibroblast differentiation were also assessed. Lipoxin A 4 promoted type II cell wound repair <b>and</b> <b>proliferation,</b> blocked {{the negative effects of}} soluble Fas ligand/tumour necrosis factor α upon cell <b>proliferation,</b> viability <b>and</b> apoptosis, and augmented the epithelial cell proliferative response to bronchoaveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In contrast, Lipoxin A 4 reduced fibroblast <b>proliferation,</b> collagen production <b>and</b> myofibroblast differentiation induced by transforming growth factor β and BALF from ARDS. The effects of Lipoxin A 4 were phosphatidylinositol 3 ′-kinase dependent and mediated via the lipoxin A 4 receptor. Lipoxin A 4 appears to promote alveolar epithelial repair by stimulating epitheial cell wound repair, <b>proliferation,</b> reducing apoptosis <b>and</b> promoting trans-differentiation of alveolar type II cells into type I cells. Lipoxin A 4 reduces fibroblast <b>proliferation,</b> collagen production <b>and</b> myofibroblast differentiation. These data suggest that targeting lipoxin actions may be a therapeutic strategy for treating the resolution phase of ARDS...|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TSC) research spans less than 200 years. TSC is a rare, multi-system genetic disease {{that can cause}} benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors and regulate cell <b>proliferation</b> <b>and</b> differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.|$|E

40|$|Mesothelial lesions pose {{considerable}} diagnostic challenges {{not only}} because benign tumours, reactive <b>proliferations</b> <b>and</b> malignant mesothelioma can mimic one another, {{but also because the}} morphological patterns displayed by malignant mesothelioma can simulate a variety of epithelial and non-epithelial malignancies. Immunohistochemical markers can aid in distinguishing epithelioid malignant mesothelioma from metastatic adenocarcinoma, but because no single marker reliably separates all cases, a panel of stains is recommended. Immunohistochemical studies are of more limited value in sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma, and other features often play an essential role. The separation of reactive mesothelial proliferations from malignant mesothelioma on small biopsy can be quite difficult, as distinguishing features, such as stromal invasion, often cannot be adequately assessed. In adequately sampled lesions, however, the distinction between malignant mesothelioma, benign mesothelial <b>proliferations</b> <b>and</b> other tumours can be achieved in most cases by using a carefully intergrated approach that incorporates clinical and radiographic data, immunohistochemical studies and, in selected cases, histochemical and ultrastructural techniques...|$|R
