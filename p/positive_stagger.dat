50|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is a}} {{tendency}} for the upper wing to contribute a greater proportion of the total lift than the lower with <b>positive</b> <b>stagger,</b> and less with negative stagger. Increase in <b>positive</b> <b>stagger</b> also tends to move the centre of lift forward on the upper wing and backward on the lower wing. When unstaggered, the centres of lift for upper and lower wings are almost coincidental.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVarious {{structural}} {{models for}} amyloid β fibrils have been {{derived from a}} variety of experimental techniques. However, these models cannot differentiate between the relative position of the two arms of the β hairpin called the stagger. Amyloid fibrils of various hierarchical levels form left-handed helices composed of β sheets. However it is unclear if positive, negative and zero staggers all form the macroscopic left-handed helices. To address this issue we have conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations of amyloid β sheets of various staggers and shown that only negative staggers lead to the experimentally observed left-handed helices while <b>positive</b> <b>staggers</b> generate the incorrect right-handed helices. This result suggests that the negative staggers are physiologically relevant structure of the amyloid β fibrils...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to place the lower wing's leading edge ahead of the upper wing, giving negative stagger. This is usually done in a given design for practical engineering reasons. Examples of negative stagger include the Sopwith Dolphin and Beechcraft Staggerwing. However, <b>positive</b> (forward) <b>stagger</b> is more common because it improves both downward visibility and ease of cockpit access for open cockpit biplanes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>stagger</b> {{is by far}} {{the most}} common, as this {{positioning}} of the upper wing(s) allows better visibility for the crew as well as increased aircraft longitudinal stability, aerodynamic efficiency and maximum lift.|$|E
50|$|Biplanes were {{originally}} designed with the wings positioned directly one above the other. Moving the upper wing forward {{relative to the}} lower one is called <b>positive</b> <b>stagger</b> or, more often, simply stagger. It can help increase lift and reduce drag by reducing the aerodynamic interference effects between the two wings. Many biplanes have such staggered wings. A common example from the 1930s is the layout found for the Waco Standard Cabin series.|$|E
50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{is said to}} have <b>positive</b> <b>stagger,</b> {{or simply}} stagger, when the upper wing is positioned forward of the lower (bottom) wing, Examples include the de Havilland Tiger Moth or Stearman. Conversely, an aeroplane {{is said to have}} negative stagger in unusual cases where the upper wing is positioned behind the lower wing, as in the Sopwith Dolphin or Beech Model 17 Staggerwing. An aircraft with the wings positioned directly above each other is said to have unstaggered wings, as in the Sopwith Cuckoo or Vickers Vildebeest.|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{streams in}} a {{microchannel}} are hardly mixed to form laminar flow, and the mixing issue is well {{described by a}} low Reynolds number scheme. The staggered herringbone mixer (SHM) using repeated patterns of grooves in the microchannel have been {{proved to be an}} efficient passive micro-mixer. However, only a negative pattern of the staggered herringbone mixer has been used so far after it was first suggested, {{to the best of our}} knowledge. In this study, the mixing efficiencies from negative and <b>positive</b> <b>staggered</b> herringbone mixer patterns as well as from opposite flow directions were tested to investigate the effect of the micro-structure geometry on the surrounding laminar flow. The positive herringbone pattern showed better mixing efficiency than the conventionally used negative pattern. Also, generally used forward flow gives better mixing efficiency than reverse flow. The mixing was completed after two cycles of staggered herringbone mixer with both forward and reverse flow in a positive pattern. The traditional negative pattern showed complete mixing after four and five cycles in forward and reverse flow direction, respectively. The mixing effect in all geometries was numerically simulated, and the results confirmed more efficient mixing in the positive pattern than the negative. The results can further enable the design of a more efficient microfluidic mixer, as well as in depth understanding of the phenomena of positive and negative patterns existing in nature with regards to the surrounding fluids...|$|R
40|$|Modern flow {{diagnostics}} {{applied to}} a very old aerodynamic problem produced a number of intriguing new results and produced new insight into previous results. The aerodynamic performance and associated flow physics of the biplane with endplates {{as a function of}} variation in gap and stagger were analytically and experimentally investigated. A combination of vortex lattice method, integrated force measurement, streamwise PIV, and Trefftz plane Stereo PIV were used to better understand the flowfield around the biplane with endplates. This study was performed to determine the configuration with the optimal aerodynamic performance and to understand the fluid mechanics behind optimal and suboptimal performance of the configuration. Part I specifically addresses experimentally determined differences in aerodynamic performance due to changes in gap and <b>positive</b> and negative <b>stagger</b> not predicted by inviscid codes and Munk’s theory. Downwash angles determined through streamwise PIV are used to better understand the individual contributions to lift of the upper and lower wings as a function of gap and stagger. The downwash data were subsequently used to calculate lift. This downwash calculated lift compared well to the force balance results except at large angles of attack for configurations with negative stagger. Background Discussion begins with a basic review of existing Biplane nomenclature and literature. Figure 1 shows th...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{regarding the}} relationship between speeding behavior and crashes suggests that drivers who engage in frequent and extreme speeding behavior are over-involved in crashes. However, many of these earlier studies relied on estimates of prevailing and pre-crash speeds, and as a result, their conclusions have been questioned. Over {{the last several years}} automotive manufacturers have begun installing airbag systems that collect and maintain accurate pre-crash speeds. Though, patterns of driver speeding behavior are also necessary to discern whether drivers who regularly participate in speeding have increased risk of crash involvement. 	This dissertation presents a framework and methods for quantifying and analyzing individual driver behavior using instrumented vehicles. The goals of the research were threefold: 1) Develop processing methods and observational coding systems for quantifying driver speeding using instrumented vehicle data; 2) Develop a framework for analyzing aggregate and individual driver speeding behavior; and 3) Explore the potential application of behavioral safety concepts to transportation safety problems. Quantitative assessments of driver speeding behavior could be used in combination with event data recorder data to analyze crash risk. Additionally, speed behavior models could aid in the early identification of problem behavior {{as well as in the}} development of targeted countermeasure programs. 	For this research, 172 instrumented vehicles from the Commute Atlanta program were utilized to collect individual driver speeding behavior. Continuous monitoring capabilities allowed the capture of speed and location for every second of vehicle operation. Driver speeds were then matched to road networks and subsequently to posted speed limits using a geographic information system. This allowed differences between the drivers speed and the posted speed. Several processes were developed to assess the accuracy and the completeness of the data prior to analysis. Finally, metrics and analysis frameworks were tested for their potential usefulness in future behavioral risk analysis. 	The results of the research were both <b>positive</b> and <b>staggering.</b> On average, nearly 40 % of all driving activity by the sample population was above the posted speed limit. The amount and extent of speeding was highest for young drivers. Trends indicate that speeding behavior decreases in amount and extent as age increases. Ph. D.

40|$|Practical MAVs missions, such as outdoor urban {{environment}} recognitions, simultaneously require a capability of both dashing to escape enemy fire and slowly loitering over a target {{in order to}} capture and transmit clear images to a ground station. Since an MAV intrinsically offers better payload and endurance capabilities than a rotorcraft of an equal size, fixed-wing MAVs {{can be considered as}} promising platforms to start with. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the possibility of developing a fixed-wing MAV which can both perform rapid translations and low-speed flights through urban canyons. Alow-speed wind tunnel testing is conducted to compare several powered configurations including monoplane, biplane and tandem wing combinations. The testing also focuses on wing-propeller interactions. Results indicate that a <b>positive</b> <b>stagger</b> biplane configuration powered by counter-rotating propellers placed in pusher position provides the best trade-off between a high-speed performance and a low-speed capability with a limited electric consumption.

40|$|Modern flow {{diagnostics}} {{applied to}} a very old aerodynamic problem has produced a number of intriguing new results and new insight into previous results. Part I demonstrated large differences in lift due to changes in gap and positive and negative stagger. Part I also used downwash to elucidate {{some of the reasons}} behind this behavior; however it is noted that the inviscid assumption was not adequate to capture this behavior in the theoretical and computational models used. Part II will present a generalized empirical method for the prediction of lift coefficient as a function of gap, stagger and angle of attack determined from the parametric force balance results. The resulting empirical approach allows for a rapid determination of CL for a biplane having different gap, stagger, AR and taper without the need for a complete viscous flowfield analysis. The momentum deficit method and Kutta-Joukowski theorem (Trefftz plane Stereo PIV) were applied to the PIV data for the purpose of measuring the drag and lift force. The accuracy of these methods was found to be comparable to the force balance measurements. Trefftz-plane Stereo PIV shows that the <b>positive</b> <b>stagger</b> configuration has significantly different flow morphology. The spanwise and vertical velocity components in the wake can be largely manipulated by the presence and shape of the endplates and the stagger condition of the upper wing. A dramatic lift slope change (LC) was found almost universally on all biplane models tested at an angle of attack around 5 and appears to defy explanation based on the usua...|$|E
40|$|For highly non-planar {{lifting systems}} like the box wing, induced drag {{predictions}} based on common potential-flow methods can have limited accuracy. This is primarily {{related to the}} linear, fixed-wake surrogate models, which neglect the correlation of the effective height-to-span ratio and system angle of attack or insufficiently account for free-wake deformations such as deflection and roll-up effects. Dependent on the vertical and horizontal wing arrangement of simplified box wing and biplane configurations and the system angle of attack, the present research analyses the unknown impact of wake model effects, investigates the accuracy of potential-flow induced drag predictions against an Euler-flow reference and explores the influence of higher-order wake effects. The computational expense of considered methodologies is assessed to evaluate their applicability within an aerodynamic design and optimization methodology for highly non-planar lifting systems. Under certain conditions, higher-order wake and wake surrogate effects are confirmed to impact on the induced drag prediction. The body-fixed wake model is found generally inappropriate for induced drag estimation of present lifting systems, whereas the freestream-fixed wake model provides consistent results. Positive-staggered systems at positive angels of attack are found particularly prone to higher-order wake effects, due to the vertical contraction of wake trajectories, which leads to smaller effective height-to-span ratios than compared with negative stagger and thus closer interactions between trailing wakes and lifting surfaces. A relaxed, force-free wake model is found compulsory to enable fast but accurate induced drag predictions when using potential-flow methods {{for the analysis of}} highly non-planar lifting systems with significant <b>positive</b> <b>stagger...</b>|$|E
