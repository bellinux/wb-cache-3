This infection causes demineralization and hence destruction of the hard tissues of the teeth. Diagnosis of dental caries is conventionally carried out with the help of radiographic films.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionOsteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe, {{generally}} irreversible {{complication of}} radiotherapy due to failure of healing. The pentoxifylline-tocopherol combination decreases the superficial fibrosis induced by radiotherapy. Potentiation by Clodronate (PENTOCLO) {{appears to be}} effective in ORN of the mandible. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PENTOCLO to treat osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. MethodsRetrospective study of 27 patients {{with a mean age of}} 65 ± 12 years, managed for ORN of the mandible secondary to irradiation for head and neck cancer, treated by the PENTOCLO protocol between January 2010 and March 2011. The primary endpoint was regression of exposed bone until complete healing. Assessment was both clinical (measurement of mucosal ulceration) and radiological (<b>panoramic</b> <b>dental</b> <b>x-rays)</b> before treatment, after antibiotic-corticosteroid combination therapy for one month (M 1), and then after 3, 6, 12 months of PENTOCLO. ResultsAn improvement of mucosal ulceration was observed in 16 / 21 patients after 3 months and in 12 / 17 patients after 6 months of PENTOCLO. Healing was obtained in 16 patients. Median healing time was 82 days (range: 32 – 266), and was shorter after surgery and radiotherapy (49 days) and longer after chemoradiotherapy (169 days). Radiological healing was achieved later than clinical healing with improvement in 9 out of 20 patients at 3 months. The safety and efficacy of treatment were evaluated by intraoral clinical examination, and assessment of feeding, weight and analgesic consumption. No patient discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. ConclusionThe PENTOCLO protocol achieved clinical and radiological regression of ORN with, in parallel, a reduction of the indications for major surgery.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the reconstruction of <b>dental</b> <b>panoramic</b> <b>x-ray</b> images with experimental results. The reduction of the x-ray dose that offers higher safety for the patient reduces diagnostic image quality. Inverse filtering often fails due to insufficient knowledge about the noise, which varies depending on the location. In order to overcome the aforementioned obstacles, the method proposed in this thesis firstly develops a semi-empirical scatter-glare model of the photon projection process and applies it to the auto computation of an appropriate noise-estimate. Secondly, the energy of the noise-estimate is then subtracted from that of the diagnostic image in the different resolution levels of a Multiresolution Decomposition. Experiments show that the method outperforms state-of-the-art denoising in terms of better modulation transfer function and signal to noise ratio. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Although it {{has been}} clearly {{demonstrated}} that X-rays {{play a key role}} in diagnosing medical and dental problems, this type of ionizing radiation is also able to induce noxious activities, such as genetic damage. the aim of the present study was to evaluate DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death in exfoliated buccal mucosa cells from healthy individuals (smokers and nonsmokers) following <b>dental</b> <b>X-ray</b> exposure. Material and methods. A total of 39 healthy people who had submitted to <b>panoramic</b> <b>dental</b> radiography were included in the study: 9 smokers and 30 nonsmokers. Results. the results indicated no significant statistically differences (P > 0. 05) in micronucleated oral mucosa cells before and after <b>dental</b> <b>X-ray</b> exposure. On the other hand, X-ray exposure did increase other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity, such as karyorrhexis, pyknosis, and karyolysis. It seems that cigarette smoke did not affect X-ray outcomes induced in buccal cells. Conclusion. These data indicate that <b>dental</b> <b>panoramic</b> radiography may not induce chromosomal damage, but it is able to promote cytotoxicity.

40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} {{presented an}} appropriate approach for the robust estimation of noise statistic in <b>dental</b> <b>panoramic</b> <b>x-rays</b> images. To achieve maximum image quality after denoising, a new, low order, local adaptive Gaussian Scale Mixture model is presented, which accomplishes nonlinearities from scattering. State of art methods use multi scale filtering of images {{to reduce the}} irrelevant part of information, based on generic estimation of noise. The usual assumption of a distribution of Gaussian and Poisson statistics only lead to overestimation of the noise variance in regions of low intensity (small photon counts), but to underestimation in regions of high intensity and therefore to non-optional results. The analysis approach is tested on 50 samples from a database of 50 panoramic X-rays images {{and the results are}} cross validated by medical experts. In this thesis, prominent constraints are firstly preservation of image's overall look; secondly preservation of the diagnostic content in the image and thirdly detection of small low contrast details in diagnostic content of the image. As shown in previously, state of the art methods provide non-convincing results. The new approach is funded on an attempt to interpret the problem from the view of blind source separation (BSS), thus to see the panoramic image as a simple mixture of (unwanted) background information, diagnostic information and noise.
