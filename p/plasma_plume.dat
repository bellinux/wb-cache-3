40|$|The {{collision}} of two laser generated <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> can result, under appropriate conditions, {{in the formation}} of ‘stagnation layer’. The processes underlying this phenomenon are complex and time dependent. The majority of experiments over the last few decades have focused upon spectroscopic diagnostic of colliding plasmas. We have performed electrostatic diagnosis of multiply charged copper ions (Cu+ to Cu 5 +) generated via Q-switched pulsed laser (λ= 1. 06 μm, τ= 6 ns, EL= 52 - 525 mJ) generation of copper <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> from a planar target. Time dependent current traces, charge yields and kinetic energy (Ke) distributions are obtained for single <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> (Sp) and colliding <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> (Cp). The charge yield from a Cp relative to twice that from a Sp is characterized by a charge yield ratio (CYR) parameter. Superior ion yields for all charge states occur for a discrete range of fluences (F) from colliding <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> leading to a CYR parameter exceeding unity. The kinetic energy distributions from colliding <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> display well defined energy compression via narrowing of the distributions for all fluences and charge states. The extent of this energy compression is charge dependent. Space charge forces within the stagnation layer and the resulting charge dependent acceleration of ions is proposed to account for the transfer of ion kinetic energy in favour of collisional ionization mechanisms...|$|R

Results are {{presented}} of measurements and numerical modeling of emission spectra of laser <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> arising on surfaces of metal samples at their elemental {{analysis by the}} laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique. The <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> have been considered, which are induced by single and double laser pulses of the nanosecond range duration. The modeling of the <b>plume</b> <b>plasma</b> parameters consists of a solution of the thermal, hydro-dynamics and optical problems accounting for the laser beam action on a solid surface. The numerical code allows investigating the dynamics of two-dimensional erosion plumes supposing their axial symmetry.

Optical Absorption Spectroscopy and Laser Induced Fluorescence {{can be used to}} characterise <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> and jets derived from plumes to allow us to move from an empirical approach to P. ulsed Laser Deposition to a more quantitative approach. In this thesis, several aspects of such quantitative measurements are applied to titanium based <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> produced using a KrF (248 nm, 30 ns) excimer laser system and probed using a tuneable dye laser. Using optical absorption spectroscopy we estimated the spatially resolved number density of atomic titanium in <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes,</b> produced with an average KrF laser fluence of 2. 5 J/cm 2, to vary from 5 'x 1012 to 2 x 1013 cm- 3 Ã‚Â• Simultaneous laser induced fluorescence yielded an estimate of the atomic temperature of 1. 7 Ã‚Â± 0. 3 eV. The bandwidth of the pumping laser was reduced by up to 30 % with an intracavity etalon in the pump laser and the LIF images produced for this and the standard case were used to calculate Ti I species temperature. The introduction of a pinhole on the main expansion axis of a plume restricts the lateral expansion and produces a 'plasma jet', generating of a more homogeneous ion source. Estimates of the temporal and spatial evolution of the relative proportion of ionic material in plasma jets were also made. A fundamental problem with the PLD process is the production of micron sized particulates during the laser ablation process. The interaction of two <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> has been shown to remove particulates from the thin film.

Comprehensive comparisons of the plasma characteristics, including electrical properties, optical emission spectra, gas temperatures, plasma dynamics, and bacterial inactivation ability of the two plasmas are carried out. It is shown that the dc pulse excited plasma features a much larger discharge current and stronger optical emission than the sine-wave excited plasma. The gas temperature in the former discharge remains {{very close to the}} room temperature across the entire plume length; the sine-wave driven discharge also shows a uniform temperature profile, which is 20 - 30 degrees higher than the room temperature.

40|$|Abstract—Dynamics of atmospheric-pressure <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> have {{recently}} attracted significant attentions. However, {{the nature of}} the “plasma bullet ” behavior is still not clearly understood. The plasma bullets have some feature of a cathode-directed streamer. However, there are several notable differences between the stream-erlike <b>plasma</b> <b>plumes</b> and the cathode-directed streamers. One of the differences is the repeatability (reproducible in time and space) of the two types of the discharges. All reports on the plasma bullet behavior suggested that the plasma bullets are very repeatable. This feature is different with that of the cathode-directed stream-ers, which are typically unrepeatable due to the stochastic nature of their initiation. In this paper, a simple plasma jet device is used to study the plasma bullet behavior. It is found that, when the applied voltage is 8 kV or lower, the plasma bullets are not repeatable. On the other hand, when the applied voltage is 9 kV or higher, they are very repeatable. This characteristic is similar with that of the cathode-directed streamer discharge.

50|$|LIBS {{operates}} {{by focusing}} the laser onto {{a small area}} at {{the surface of the}} specimen; when the laser is discharged it ablates a very small amount of material, in the range of nanograms to picograms, which generates a <b>plasma</b> <b>plume</b> with temperatures in excess of 100,000 K. During data collection, typically after local thermodynamic equilibrium is established, plasma temperatures range from 5,000-20,000 K. At the high temperatures during the early plasma, the ablated material dissociates (breaks down) into excited ionic and atomic species. During this time, the plasma emits a continuum of radiation which does not contain any useful information about the species present, but within a very small timeframe the plasma expands at supersonic velocities and cools. At this point the characteristic atomic emission lines of the elements can be observed. The delay between the emission of continuum radiation and characteristic radiation is in the order of 10 µs, which is why it is necessary to temporally gate the detector.|$|E
