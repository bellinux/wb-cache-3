40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The {{generalized}} variational <b>principle</b> of Herglotz {{defines the}} functional whose extrema are sought by a differential equation {{rather than an}} integral. It reduces to the classical variational <b>principle</b> under classical conditions. The Noether theorems are not applicable to functionals defined by differential equations. For a system of differential equations derivable from the generalized variational <b>principle</b> of Herglotz, a first Noether-type theorem is proven, which gives explicit conserved quantities corresponding to the symmetries of the functional defined by the generalized variational <b>principle</b> of Herglotz. This theorem reduces to the classical first Noether theorem in the case when the generalized variational <b>principle</b> of Herglotz reduces to the classical variational <b>principle.</b> Applications of the first Noether-type theorem are shown and specific examples are provided. A second Noether-type theorem is proven, providing a non-trivial identity corresponding to each infinite-dimensional symmetry group of the functional defined by the generalized variational <b>principle</b> of Herglotz. This theorem reduces to the classical second Noether theorem when the generalized variational <b>principle</b> of Herglotz reduces to the classical variational <b>principle.</b> A new variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables is defined. It reduces to Herglotz's generalized variational <b>principle</b> {{in the case of}} one independent variable, time. It also reduces to the classical variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables, when only the spatial independent variables are present. Thus, it generalizes both. This new variational <b>principle</b> can give a variational description of processes involving physical fields. One valuable characteristic is that, unlike the classical variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables, this variational <b>principle</b> gives a variational description of nonconservative processes even when the Lagrangian function is independent of time. This is not possible with the classical variational <b>principle.</b> The equations providing the extrema of the functional defined by this generalized variational <b>principle</b> are derived. They reduce to the classical Euler-Lagrange equations (in the case of several independent variables), when this new variational <b>principle</b> reduces to the classical variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables. A first Noether-type theorem is proven for the generalized variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables. One of its corollaries provides an explicit procedure for finding the conserved quantities corresponding to symmetries of the functional defined by this variational <b>principle.</b> This theorem reduces to the classical first Noether theorem in the case when the generalized variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables reduces to the classical variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables. It reduces to the first Noether-type theorem for Herglotz generalized variational <b>principle</b> when this generalized variational <b>principle</b> reduces to Herglotz's variational <b>principle.</b> A criterion for a transformation to be a symmetry of the functional defined by the generalized variational <b>principle</b> with several independent variables is proven. Applications of the first Noether-type theorem in the several independent variables case are shown and specific examples are provided...|$|R
