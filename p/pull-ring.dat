When he tells Hud to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, his uncle replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did.

5000|$|A Barzón, {{in terms}} of agriculture, is the yoke-ring to which a rope or chain is {{attached}} to pull a farm plow; a hitch-ring, connecting-ring, a <b>pull-ring.</b> The name comes from a Mexican revolutionary song that speaks about injustice {{in the fields of}} the countryside. Their motto is: [...] "Debo, no niego, pago lo justo" [...] ("I owe, I don't deny it, I'll pay what is fair").|$|E

5000|$|The {{safety and}} litter {{problems}} were both eventually solved {{later in the}} 1970s with Daniel F. Cudzik's invention of the non-removing [...] "Stay-Tab". The <b>pull-ring</b> was replaced with a stiff aluminum lever, and the removable tab was replaced with a pre-scored round tab that functioned similarly to the push-tab, but the raised blister was no longer needed, as the riveted lever would now do the job of pushing the tab open and into {{the interior of the}} can.|$|E
50|$|Typically, breakfast {{consists}} of: {{a chocolate}} bar, fruit candy, crackers or sweet bread, instant coffee, sugar, and {{a tube of}} sweetened condensed milk. A lunch will have: two <b>pull-ring</b> cans with precooked foods (Tortellini al Ragù, Pasta e Fagioli, Wurstel, Tacchino in Gelatina, Insalata di Riso, etc.), a small can of fruit cocktail, a multivitamin tablet, energy and fiber tablets, instant coffee, sugar, and a plastic spoon wrapped with a napkin.Dinner will consist of two more meal cans plus crackers, an energy bar, instant coffee, and sugar.Accessories are: a folding stove, fuel tablets, water purification tablets, toothpick, matches, and three small disposable toothbrushes with pre-applied tooth powder.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{operational}} ration used in Greece is {{the so-called}} [...] "Merida Eidikon Dynameon" [...] (Special Forces' Ration, {{also known as a}} 4B-ration), a 24-hour ration pack inside a cardboard box measuring 240 x 140 x 130 mm & weighing 1 kg. Most items are commercially procured, with the main meals in round <b>pull-ring</b> cans. Typical contents include: a 200 g canned meat ("SPAM"); 280 g can of meat with vegetables (beef and potatoes, etc.) (termed Prepared Food With Meat or ΠΦΜΚ); a 280 g can of cooked vegetables (green peas, etc.) (Prepared Food Without Meat or ΠΦΑΚ); an 85 g can of cheese; 6 hard biscuits; 40 g honey; three 50 g packages of raisins or chocolate; 30 g sugar; 1.5 g black tea, 2 g instant coffee; 19 g instant milk powder; two small packets of salt; a multivitamin tablet; 4 water purification tablets; a pack of tissues; a disposable ration heater with 5 fuel tablets; and a box of matches. In wartime, packs of locally commandeered cigarettes may also be issued.|$|E
5000|$|A cornelius keg is a {{stainless}} steel cylinder which can hold a maximum of 130 PSI. There are three openings in the keg: a large central hole which, by its design, can only be opened when the keg is not pressurized, and two ports with integral poppet valves which open when a hose with an appropriate fitting is attached to them. The central opening is used for filling and cleaning the keg, and {{is large enough to}} permit reaching inside for hand scrubbing. The two ports are used to dispense the beverage, one for [...] "gas in", and the other for [...] "liquid out". The separate metal lid for the central opening provides a clamp mechanism that closes and seals the lid against the keg with an large rubber O-ring. The lid also provides a pressure relief valve that is typically identified by a circular <b>pull-ring</b> (like a key ring). The relief valve can be manually opened to release the pressure in the keg; {{in the event of an}} unsafe overpressure in the keg, the relief valve automatically opens to avoid the hazard of bursting the cylinder. Two metal tubes are attached to the ports on the inside of the keg. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has a short tube, not reaching the fluid. The [...] "liquid out" [...] port has a long tube (a [...] "dip tube") which reaches to the bottom of the keg. Headspace gas pressure (usually carbon dioxide and sometimes nitrogen forced into the [...] "gas in" [...] port) pushes the drink from the bottom of the keg, up the tube, and then out of the [...] "liquid out" [...] port connected to a tap or other dispensing device.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, Ermal Fraze {{devised a}} can-opening method {{that would come}} to {{dominate}} the canned beverage market. His invention was the [...] "pull-tab". This eliminated {{the need for a}} separate opener tool by attaching an aluminum <b>pull-ring</b> lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted {{to the center of the}} top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the beverage flow out while air flowed in. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab. [...] Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were also called [...] "pop-tops" [...] colloquially. In Australia these were colloquially known as [...] "ring-pull". Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them.These problems were both addressed by the invention of the [...] "push-tab". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminum blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening. An unusual feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent — a convenience that was lost with the switch from can opener to pull-tab. The [...] "push-tab" [...] was introduced into Australia in the early 1980s and was locally known as [...] "pop-tops".|$|E
