40|$|Introduction: Magnetic {{stimulation}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} muscle function by calculating voluntary activation using an interpolated twitch during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and control twitches to <b>potentiated</b> <b>muscle.</b> In this study we assessed the reliability of torque, electromyography (EMG), and voluntary activation variables. Methods: Fifteen men completed 5 testing sessions (2 familiarization and 3 reliability trials) to assess quadriceps femoris muscle function. Intra- and interday reliability levels of torque and EMG variables were estimated using typical error ± 90...|$|E
40|$|Fibrodysplasia {{ossificans}} progressiva (FOP) {{is a rare}} heritable disease {{characterized by}} progressive heterotopic ossification of connective tissues, {{for which there is}} presently no definite treatment. A recurrent activating mutation (c. 617 G→A; R 206 H) of activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ACVR 1 /ALK 2), a BMP type I receptor, has been shown as the main cause of FOP. This mutation constitutively activates the BMP signaling pathway and initiates the formation of heterotopic bone. In this study, we have designed antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to knockdown mouse ALK 2 expression by means of exon skipping. The ALK 2 AON could induce exon skipping in cells, which was accompanied by decreased ALK 2 mRNA levels and impaired BMP signaling. In addition, the ALK 2 AON <b>potentiated</b> <b>muscle</b> differentiation and repressed BMP 6 -induced osteoblast differentiation. Our results therefore provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of FOP disease by reducing the excessive ALK 2 activity in FOP patients...|$|E
50|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that {{upregulation}} of IFRD1 in vivo in injured <b>muscle</b> <b>potentiates</b> <b>muscle</b> regeneration by increasing the production of staminal muscle cells (satellite cells). The underlying molecular mechanism lies in the ability of IFRD1 to cooperate with MyoD at inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2C. This relies on the ability of IFRD1 to bind selectively MEF2C, thus inhibiting its interaction with HDAC4. Therefore, IFRD1 appears to act as a positive cofactor of MyoD. More recently {{it has been}} shown that IFRD1 <b>potentiates</b> <b>muscle</b> regeneration by a second mechanism that potentiates MyoD, i.e., by repressing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, which is known to inhibit MyoD mRNA accumulation. IFRD1 represses the activity of NF-κB p65 by enhancing the HDAC-mediated deacetylation of the p65 subunit, by favoring the recruitment of HDAC3 to p65. In fact IFRD1 forms trimolecular complexes with p65 and HDAC3.|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to reduced}} gravity during space travel profoundly alters the loads placed on bone and muscle. Astronauts suffer {{significant}} losses of muscle and bone strength during weightlessness. Exercise as a countermeasure is only partially effective in remedying severe muscle atrophy and bone demineralization. Similar wasting of muscles and bones affects people on Earth during prolonged bed rest or immobilization due to injury. In {{the absence of}} weight bearing activity, atrophy occurs primarily in the muscles that act in low power, routine movements and in maintaining posture. Hormonal disfunction could contribute {{in part to the}} loss of muscle and bone during spaceflight. Reduced levels of human Growth Hormone (hGH) were found in astronauts during space flight, as well as reduced GH secretory activity was observed from the anterior pituitary in 7 -day space flight rats. Growth hormone {{has been shown to be}} required for maintenance of muscle mass and bone mineralization, in part by mediating the biosynthesis IGF-I, a small polypeptide growth factor. IGF biosynthesis and secretion plays an important role in <b>potentiating</b> <b>muscle</b> cell differentiation and has been shown to drive the expression of myogenin, a myogenic specific basic helix-loop-helix factor. IGF-I has also been shown to have an important role in <b>potentiating</b> <b>muscle</b> regeneration, repair and adult muscle hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|When Aplysia are {{initially}} {{exposed to}} food stimuli, their biting responses show progressive increases in speed and strength. The accessory radula closer (ARC) buccal muscles {{have been used}} to study this phenomenon, and {{it has been shown that}} changes in ARC muscle contraction are partially due to activity of a serotonergic neuron that modulates this muscle, by both a direct action and an action on two ARC motor neurons (B 15 and B 16). The motor neurons use acetylcholine as their excitatory transmitter, but they also contain bioactive peptides that can <b>potentiate</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions when they are exogenously applied. Motor neuron B 15 contains the structurally related small cardioactive peptides A and B, whereas motor neuron B 16 contains a different peptide [...] termed myomodulin. In the present study we determined the full amino acid sequence of myomodulin. Myomodulin is present in the ARC muscle, and exogenous application of the peptide <b>potentiates</b> ARC <b>muscle</b> contractions in a manner similar to the potentiation by small cardioactive peptides A and B. The structure of myomodulin, however, bears little resemblance to the small cardioactive peptides. Thus it appears that ARC muscle contractions may be regulated by at least three distinct classes of neuromodulators: serotonin, the small cardioactive peptides, and myomodulin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{regenerative}} medicine, based on the potential of stem cells to restore diseased tissues, epigenetics is becoming a pivotal area of interest. Therapeutic interventions that promote tissue and organ regeneration have as primary objective the selective control of gene expression in adult stem cells. This requires a deep understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms controlling transcriptional programs in tissue progenitors. This review attempts to elucidate the principle epigenetic regulations responsible of stem cells differentiation. In particular {{we focus on the}} current understanding of the epigenetic networks that regulate differentiation of muscle progenitors by the concerted action of chromatin-modifying enzymes and noncoding RNAs. The novel exciting role of exosome-bound microRNA in mediating epigenetic information transfer is also discussed.

40|$|The ends of coiled-coil {{tropomyosin}} molecules {{are joined}} together by nine to ten residue-long head-to-tail “overlapping domains”. These short four-chained interconnections ensure formation of continuous tropomyosin cables that wrap around actin filaments. Molecular Dynamics simulations {{indicate that the}} curvature and bending flexibility at the overlap is 10 – 20 % greater than {{over the rest of}} the molecule, which might affect head-to-tail filament assembly on F-actin. Since the penultimate residue of striated muscle tropomyosin, Ser 283, is a natural target of phosphorylating enzymes, we have assessed here if phosphorylation adjusts the mechanical properties of the tropomyosin overlap domain. MD simulations show that phosphorylation straightens the overlap to match the curvature of the remainder of tropomyosin while stiffening it to equal or exceed the rigidity of canonical coiled-coil regions. Corresponding EM data on phosphomimetic tropomyosin S 283 D corroborate these findings. The phosphorylation-induced change in mechanical properties of tropomyosin likely results from electrostatic interactions between C-terminal phosphoSer 283 and N-terminal Lys 12 in the four-chain overlap bundle, while promoting stronger interactions among surrounding residues and thus facilitating tropomyosin cable assembly. The stiffening effect of D 283 -tropomyosin noted correlates with previously observed enhanced actin–tropomyosin activation of myosin S 1 -ATPase, suggesting a role for the tropomyosin phosphorylation in <b>potentiating</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction...|$|R
40|$|Membrane excitability is a {{critical}} regulatory step in skeletal muscle contraction and is modulated by local ionic concentrations, conductances, ion transporter activities, temperature, and humoral factors. Intense fatiguing contractions induce cellular K efflux and Na and Cl influx, causing pronounced perturbations in extracellular (interstitial) and intracellular K and Na concentrations. Muscle interstitial K concentration may increase 1 - to 2 -fold to 11 – 13 mM and intracellular K concentration fall by 1. 3 - to 1. 7 -fold; interstitial Na concentration may decline by 10 mM and intracellular Na concentration rise by 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -fold. Muscle Cl concentration changes reported with muscle contractions are less consistent, with reports of both unchanged and increased intracellular Cl concentrations, depending on contraction type and the muscles studied. When considered together, these ionic changes depolarize sarcolemmal and t-tubular membranes to depress tetanic force and are thus likely to contribute to fatigue. Interestingly, less severe local ionic changes can also augment subtetanic force, suggesting that they may <b>potentiate</b> <b>muscle</b> contractility early in exercise. Increased Na-K-ATPase activity during exercise stabilizes Na and K concentration gradients and membrane excitability and thus protects against fatigue. However, during intense contraction some Na-K pumps are inactivated and together with further ionic disturbances, likely precipitate muscle fatigue...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSchwartz-Jampel {{syndrome}} (SJS) is a recessive neuromyotonia with chondrodysplasia. It {{results from}} hypomorphic mutations {{of the gene}} encoding perlecan, leading to {{a decrease in the}} levels of this heparan sulphate proteoglycan in basement membranes (BMs). It has been suggested that SJS neuromyotonia may result from endplate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) deficiency, but this hypothesis has never been investigated in vivo {{due to the lack of}} an animal model for neuromyotonia. We used homologous recombination to generate a knock-in mouse strain with one missense substitution, corresponding to a human familial SJS mutation (p. C 1532 Y), in the perlecan gene. We derived two lines, one with the p. C 1532 Y substitution alone and one with p. C 1532 Y and the selectable marker Neo, to down-regulate perlecan gene activity and to test for a dosage effect of perlecan in mammals. These two lines mimicked SJS neuromyotonia with spontaneous activity on electromyogramm (EMG). An inverse correlation between disease severity and perlecan secretion in the BMs was observed at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, consistent with a dosage effect. Endplate AChE levels were low in both lines, due to synaptic perlecan deficiency rather than major myofibre or neuromuscular junction disorganization. Studies of muscle contractile properties showed muscle fatigability at low frequencies of nerve stimulation and suggested that partial endplate AChE deficiency might contribute to SJS <b>muscle</b> stiffness by <b>potentiating</b> <b>muscle</b> force. However, physiological endplate AChE deficiency was not associated with spontaneous activity at rest on EMG in the diaphragm, suggesting that additional changes are required to generate such activity characteristic of SJS...|$|R
40|$|Fish oil (FO) supplementation <b>potentiates</b> <b>muscle</b> protein {{synthesis}} (MPS) {{in response to}} a hyperaminoacidemic–hyperinsulinemic infusion. Whether FO supplementation potentiates MPS in response to protein ingestion or when protein ingestion is combined with resistance exercise (RE) remains unknown. In a randomized, parallel group design, 20 healthy males were randomized to receive 5 g/day of either FO or coconut oil control (CO) for 8 weeks. After supplementation, participants performed a bout of unilateral RE followed by ingestion of 30 g of whey protein. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained before and after supplementation for assessment of muscle lipid composition and relevant protein kinase activities. Infusion of l‐[ring‐ 13 C 6] phenylalanine was used to measure basal myofibrillar MPS at rest (REST), in a nonexercised leg following protein ingestion (FED) and following RE and protein ingestion (FEDEX). MPS was significantly elevated above REST during FEDEX in both the FO and CO groups, but there was no effect of supplementation. There was a significant increase in MPS in both groups above REST during FED but no effect of supplementation. Supplementation significantly decreased panPKB activity at REST in the FO group but not the CO group. There was a significant increase from REST at post‐RE for PKB and AMPKα 2 activity in the CO group but not in the FO group. In FEDEX, there was a significant increase in p 70 S 6 K 1 activity from REST at 3 h in the CO group only. These data highlight that 8 weeks of FO supplementation alters kinase signaling activity in response to RE plus protein ingestion without influencing MPS...|$|R
40|$|Editorial Committee of Journal of Human KineticsThe aim of {{this study}} was to measure the extent to which {{potentiation}} changes in response to an isometric maximal voluntary contraction. Eleven physically active subjects participated in two separate studies. Single stimulus of electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve was used to measure torque at rest in unpotentiated quadriceps muscles (study 1 and 2), and <b>potentiated</b> quadriceps <b>muscles</b> torque in a 10 min period after a 5 s isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps muscles (study 1). Additionally, <b>potentiated</b> quadriceps <b>muscles</b> torque was measured every min after a further 10 maximal voluntary contractions repeated every min (study 2). Electrical stimulation repeated several times without previous maximal voluntary contraction showed similar peak twitch torque. Peak twitch torque 4 s after a 5 s maximal voluntary contraction increased by 45 ± 13 % (study 1) and by 56 ± 10 % (study 2), the rate of torque development by 53 ± 13 % and 82 ± 29 %, and the rate of relaxation by 50 ± 17 % and 59 ± 22 %, respectively, but potentiation was lost already two min after a 5 s maximal voluntary contraction. There was a tendency for peak twitch torque to increase for the first five repeated maximal voluntary contractions, suggesting increased potentiation with additional maximal voluntary contractions. Correlations for peak twitch torque vs the rate of torque development and for the rate of relaxation were r 2 = 0. 94 and r 2 = 0. 97.

This study examined appetite and energy intake following consumption of protein- and carbohydrate-containing drinks after resistance exercise. Methods - After familiarisation, 15 resistance training males (age 21 ± 1 years, body mass 78. 0 ± 11. 9 kg, stature 1. 78 ± 0. 07 m) completed two randomised, double-blind trials, consisting of lower-body resistance exercise, followed by consumption of a whey protein (PRO 23. 9 ± 3. 6 g protein) or dextrose (CHO 26. 5 ± 3. 8 g carbohydrate) drink in the 5 min post-exercise. An ad libitum meal was served 60 min later, with subjective appetite measured throughout. Drinks were flavoured and matched for energy content and volume. The PRO drink provided 0. 3 g/kg body mass protein. Results - Ad libitum energy intake (PRO 3742 ± 994 kJ; CHO 4172 ± 1132 kJ; P = 0. 007) and mean eating rate (PRO 339 ± 102 kJ/min; CHO 405 ± 154 kJ/min; P = 0. 009) were lower during PRO.

Conclusion - These results suggest whey protein consumption after resistance exercise reduces subsequent energy intake, and this might be partially mediated by a reduced eating rate.

40|$|Caffeine is {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} socially acceptable drug {{in the world and}} is commonly used for its ergogenic properties with demonstrated performance enhancing effects in endurance, power and strength based activities. Despite a wealth of evidence concluding a caffeine induced performance benefit, the direct effects of the drug on peripheral physiological processes have not been fully examined. Early works showed high dose caffeine has direct force potentiating effect on skeletal muscle, a notion that has only recently been confirmed by James et al. (2005) to also occur at a maximal human physiological concentration (70 µM). The present research, using mouse muscle as a model for mammalian muscle in general, provides an in-depth assessment of the direct effect of physiological concentrations of caffeine on isolated skeletal muscle performance. This research uniquely: quantifies the dose response relationship; assesses the effects of caffeine on maximal and sub maximal muscle power output and fatigue; looks at the relationship between muscles with different fiber type compositions. As high concentrations of caffeine and taurine are a constituent of many energy drinks, the suggested interaction of these ingredients to further <b>potentiate</b> <b>muscle</b> mechanical performance was also assessed. The study further examines how mammalian muscle mechanical properties change over an age range of development to aged, and how this differs between muscles with predominantly different anatomical locations and functions. In light of this the age related direct effect of physiological concentrations of caffeine was assessed in order to examine whether the ergogenic benefit changed with age. The present results demonstrate a direct muscle performance enhancing effect of physiological concentrations of caffeine that is likely to promote greater benefit on long duration endurance based activities. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates that there is no direct effect of physiological concentrations of taurine and no further performance enhancing benefit when combined with caffeine. Finally this research uniquely highlights the muscle specific age related changes in mechanical performance and further indicates that the direct effect of caffeine changes with age...|$|R

40|$|The {{ergogenic}} {{effects of}} caffeine in human exercise {{have been shown}} to improve endurance and anaerobic exercise performance. Previous work has demonstrated that 70 μM caffeine (physiological maximum) can directly increase mouse extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle power output (PO) in sprintlike activity by 3 %. Our study used the work loop technique on isolated mouse muscles to investigate whether the direct effect of 70 μM caffeine on PO differed between 1) maximally and submaximally activated muscle; 2) relatively fast (EDL) and relatively slow (soleus) muscles; and 3) caffeine concentrations. Caffeine treatment of 70 μM resulted in significant improvements in PO in maximally and submaximally activated EDL and soleus (P 0. 420 in all cases). Therefore, the ergogenic effects of caffeine on PO were higher in muscles with a slower fiber type (P 0. 72 in both cases). Caffeine concentrations below the physiological maximum can directly <b>potentiate</b> skeletal <b>muscle</b> PO. This caffeine-induced increase in force could provide similar benefit across a range of exercise intensities, with greater gains likely in activities powered by slower muscle fiber type...|$|R

To test if loss of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (Nf 1) compromises fibroblast function in vivo following trauma, skin wounding was performed in Nf 1 knockout mice. The pattern and amount of collagen-rich granulation bed tissue, manufactured by fibroblasts, was grossly abnormal in 60 % of Nf 1 +/– wounds. Nf 1 mutant fibroblasts showed cell autonomous abnormalities in collagen deposition in vitro that were not mimicked by Ras activation in fibroblasts, even though some Nf 1 effects are mediated through Ras.

Therefore, the effects of caffeine on human performance continue to be a popular area of research as we strive to improve our understanding of this drug and make more precise recommendations for its use in sport. Although variations in exercise intensity seems to affect its ergogenic benefits, it is largely thought that caffeine can induce significant improvements in endurance, power and strength-based activities. There are a number of limitations to testing caffeine-induced effects on human performance that can be better controlled when investigating its effects on isolated muscles under in vitro conditions. The hydrophobic nature of caffeine results in a post-digestion distribution to all tissues of the body making it difficult to accurately quantify its key mechanism of action. This review considers the contribution of evidence from isolated muscle studies to our understating of the direct effects of caffeine on muscle during human performance.

We studied {{the effect of}} inhalational anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) on neuromuscular blockades and hemodynamic responses by cisatracurium bolus injection. Methods: Forty patients undergoing elective surgery were randomly divided into isoflurane and propofol-remifentanil groups. A bolus dose of cisatracurium of 0. 15 mg/kg (3 × ED 95) was administered after induction and the onset time and clinical duration of action were recorded. The nueromuscular blockade was monitored using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. Hemodynamic parameters were also recorded. Results: Onset time was 194. 0 ± 39. 1 sec in the isoflurane group and 226. 5 ± 62. 2 sec in the propofol-remifentanil group. Clinical duration of action was 49. 2 ± 9. 0 min in the isoflurane group and 43. 0 ± 9. 2 min in the propofol-remifentanil group. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) immediately before intubation decreased in the propofol-remifentanil group.

In fireflies, DUM neurones of the terminal abdominal ganglia control flashing by activating the photocytes of the lantern (Christensen and Carlson, 1981).

40|$|Inactivity and {{microgravity}} cause both significant muscle atrophy and {{fibre type}} switching. Muscle mass and fibre type composition {{is under the}} control of signalling pathways that only recently are being defined. The overall process governing muscle growth and fibre type determination is defined excitation-transcription coupling. Mass reduction (atrophy) is associated to the prevailing of catabolism over anabolism and, in particular, to the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Muscle growth is primarily mediated by the PI 3 K-PKB/Akt system through the recruitment of protein kinase mTOR and NFATc 2, a downstream effector of calcineurin. In addition, muscle growth is also the result of PI 3 K-PKB repressing activity over the transcription factors of the Foxo family, which activators of ubiquitin ligase atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1 activities. As a consequence, the atrophic program is initiated by the removal of the inhibitory action of the Akt system over Foxo. Thus, it is emerging a scenario where a wide cross talk of diverse signalling pathways appears to govern muscle growth or reduction. However, it is still unclear the major determinant initiating these signalling pathways. What is certain is that the “first messenger” is related to the electrical activity and, in part, to trophic factors released from the nerve. It is predictable that the initiating events occur at cell membrane, however, the molecular element(s) involved in the process are still unknown. It is also certain that the lack of such messenger(s) represents the primary event leading to mass reduction. The main objective of our project is to investigate the upstream processes governing the overall excitation-transcription coupling of skeletal muscle and disclose the nature of the first messenger that mediates the transcriptional activity of skeletal muscle electrical stimulation. The proposed project is also willing to introduce a novel approach to study the signal transduction pathways involved in muscle atrophy. In fact, besides animal experimental models that mimic microgravity, we want to utilize adult muscle fibres isolated and cultivated in vitro. In our laboratory we have established culture conditions that permit to cultivate in vitro isolated muscle fibres for as long as three weeks. The isolation procedure, by removing the nerve, eliminates any contractile activity of cultivated fibres and starts the atrophic program and the cognate signalling pathways. Since atrophy in cultured muscle fibres progresses very slowly, this protocol appears to be an ideal tool to scrutinize in details signalling pathways that activate atrophy. Importantly, we have demonstrated recently that cultivated muscle fibres release ATP in the extracellular medium each time they are electrically stimulated, a condition that mimic contractile activity. This finding makes the nucleotide a good candidate as a first messenger promoting excitation-transcription coupling. In fact, extracellular ATP signalling is a well known modulator of various physiological responses, including cell growth, platelet activation, neurotransmission, immune responses, cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that skeletal muscle expresses diverse cell membrane ATP receptors, whose function is still undefined. Importantly, we have recently demonstrated that the nucleotide exerts an autocrine action in <b>potentiating</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction, an effect that is abolished if soluble ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes are added to the contracting muscle or in the presence of specific inhibitors of ATP receptors. We propose that under microgravity and, more in general, under conditions of reduced muscle use (bed rest, cachexia, and aging) the decreased contractile activity is strictly correlated with the drop of ATP release and of the cognate signalling functions...|$|R
40|$|Agonist-induced {{vasoconstriction}} {{triggers a}} negative feedback response whereby movement of charged ions through gap junctions and/or release of endothelium-derived (NO) limit further reductions in diameter, a mechanism termed myoendothelial feedback. Recent {{studies indicate that}} electrical myoendothelial feedback can {{be accounted for by}} flux of inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) through myoendothelial gap junctions resulting in localized increases in endothelial Ca 2 + to activate intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium (IKCa) channels, the resultant hyperpolarization then conducting back to the smooth muscle to attenuate agonist-induced depolarization and tone. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that activation of IKCa channels underlies NO-mediated myoendothelial feedback. Functional experiments showed that block of IP 3 receptors, IKCa channels, gap junctions and transient receptor potential canonical type- 3 (TRPC 3) channels caused endothelium-dependent potentiation of agonist-induced increase in tone which was not additive with that caused by inhibition of NO synthase supporting a role for these proteins in NO-mediated myoendothelial feedback. Localized densities of IKCa and TRPC 3 channels occurred at the internal elastic lamina/endothelial-smooth muscle interface in rat basilar arteries, potential communication sites between the two cell layers. Smooth muscle depolarization to contractile agonists was accompanied by IKCa channel-mediated endothelial hyperpolarization providing the first demonstration of IKCa channel-mediated hyperpolarization of the endothelium in response to contractile agonists. Inhibition of IKCa channels, gap junctions, TRPC 3 channels or NO synthase <b>potentiated</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> depolarization to agonists in a non-additive manner. Together these data indicate that rather being distinct pathways for the modulation of smooth muscle tone, NO and endothelial IKCa channels are involved in an integrated mechanism for the regulation of agonist-induced vasoconstriction...|$|R
40|$|Control {{of exercising}} muscle blood flow is {{a balance between}} local vasodilatory factors and the {{increase}} in global sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow. Hypoxia has been shown to <b>potentiate</b> the <b>muscle</b> sympathetic nerve response to exercise, potentially limiting the increase in muscle blood flow. Accordingly, we investigated sympathetic restraint to exercising muscle during whole body exercise in hypoxia. Six dogs chronically instrumented with ascending aortic and hindlimb flow probes and a terminal aortic catheter were studied at rest and mild [2. 5 miles/h (mph), 5 % grade] and moderate (4. 0 mph, 10 % grade) exercise while breathing room air or hypoxia (PaO 2 ∼ 45 mmHg) in the intact control condition and following systemic α-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine). Hypoxia caused an increase in cardiac output (CO), hindlimb flow (FlowL), and blood pressure (BP), while total (CondT) and hindlimb conductance (CondL) were unchanged at rest and mild exercise but increased with moderate exercise. During both mild and moderate exercise, α-blockade in normoxia resulted in significant vasodilation as evidenced by increases in CO (10 %), FlowL (17 %), CondT (33 %), CondL (43 %), and a decrease in BP (− 18 %), with the increase in CondL greater than the increase in CondT during mild exercise. Compared with the normoxic response, α-blockade in hypoxia during exercise resulted in a significantly greater increase in CondT (59 %) and CondL (74 %) and a correspondingly greater decrease in BP (− 34 %) from baseline. These findings indicate that there is considerable hypoxia-induced sympathetic restraint of muscle blood flow during both mild and moderate exercise, which helps to maintain arterial blood pressure in hypoxia...|$|R

This study was conducted in repeated and cross-over designed. Thirteen collegiate males aged 25. 4 ± 3. 46 years voluntarily participated in this study.

40|$|The {{action of}} nerve {{breakdown}} products on innervated fibres of soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was investigated {{with the following}} procedures: partial denervation, sensory or sympathetic denervation, section of a previously transplanted foreign nerve. Each procedure was performed either in isolation or combined with chronic muscle inactivity obtained by blocking impulse conduction along the sciatic nerve. Silastic cuffs containing tetrodotoxin (TTX) and sodium chloride were utilized for the block. Partial denervation induced extrajunctional sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and resistance to tetrodotoxin {{not only in the}} denervated but also in the innervated fibres. The effects in the innervated fibres were equal in magnitude to those in the denervated fibres, provided they were paralysed. The onset of the membrane changes was synchronous in the two classes of fibres and their amount correlated with the extent of partial denervation. If the innervated fibres were normally active, the membrane changes were still detectable, but considerably smaller than in the denervated fibres. Sensory denervation (removal of dorsal root ganglia L 4 and L 5) was followed by the development of moderate ACh supersensitivity and TTX resistance in chronically paralysed muscles. Furthermore, section of radicular nerves (total denervation, i. e. efferent plus afferent) induced larger membrane changes than those observed following section of ventral roots alone (efferent denervation). Sympathetic denervation was ineffective even when associated with chronic muscle paralysis. Section of a previously transplanted mixed nerve (superficial fibular) was ineffective if the soleus muscle was normally active, while it induced marked extrajunctional ACh sensitivity and TTX resistance when combined with chronic paralysis of the muscle. Section of a transplanted sensory nerve (sural) also induced extrajunctional membrane changes in paralysed soleus muscles, but their magnitude was much smaller than after section of mixed nerves. We conclude that products of nerve destruction, especially those of motor axons, induce membrane changes of striking magnitude when <b>potentiated</b> by <b>muscle</b> inactivity. Such an action may also explain the greater efficacy of denervation vs. pure inactivity, at least at early times after their onset...|$|R
40|$|Smad (Sma and Mad-related protein) 2 / 3 are {{downstream}} signaling molecules for TGF-β and myostatin (Mstn). Recently, Mstn {{was shown}} to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skeletal muscle via canonical Smad 3, nuclear factor-κB, and TNF-α pathway. However, mice lacking Smad 3 display skeletal muscle atrophy due to increased Mstn levels. Hence, our aims were first to investigate whether Mstn induced muscle atrophy in Smad 3 (-/-) mice by increasing ROS and second to delineate Smad 3 -independent signaling mechanism for Mstn-induced ROS. Herein we show that Smad 3 (-/-) mice have increased ROS levels in skeletal muscle, and inactivation of Mstn in these mice partially ablates the oxidative stress. Furthermore, ROS induction by Mstn in Smad 3 (-/-) muscle was not via nuclear factor-κB (p 65) signaling but due to activated p 38, ERK MAPK signaling and enhanced IL- 6 levels. Consequently, TNF-α, {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} oxidase, and xanthine oxidase levels were up-regulated, which led to an increase in ROS production in Smad 3 (-/-) skeletal muscle. The exaggerated ROS in the Smad 3 (-/-) <b>muscle</b> <b>potentiated</b> binding of C/EBP homology protein transcription factor to MuRF 1 promoter, resulting in enhanced MuRF 1 levels leading to muscle atrophy...|$|R
40|$|IMPAIRED SKELETAL MUSCLE ENERGETICS {{in heart}} failure (HF) {{patients}} (32) {{may contribute to}} physical disability and metabolic dysfunction. Decreased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (63), secondary to reduced mitochondrial density (12, 13) and/or function (10, 36, 52), may contribute to exercise intolerance, the hallmark symptom of HF. Moreover, as mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with fiber atrophy (7), impaired energetics may reduce physical function by promoting muscle wasting and, in turn, weakness (21). Because mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes (41), alterations in mitochondrial content and/or function could {{also contribute to the}} high prevalence of insulin resistance in the HF population (53), which could provoke deleterious protein metabolic effects that predispose to atrophy (56). Knowledge of the unique effects of HF on mitochondrial biology is limited, because nearly all studies have failed to account for several factors that accompany the syndrome of HF and can alter mitochondrial structure and function, the most notable being muscle disuse (55) and hospitalization. Studies that have attempted to control for muscle disuse in the HF population by recruitment of sedentary controls have found minimal effects of HF on mitochondrial function (8, 33, 68). There are, however, deficiencies in mitochondrial biology that persist following control for muscle disuse [e. g., mitochondrial and cytosolic enzyme activity (33) ] and other aspects of the mitochondrial myopathy of HF that have not been compared between patients and controls matched for activity level. Thus it is unclear whether deficits in mitochondrial content or aspects of mitochondrial function are related to the HF syndrome per se or are a consequence of muscle disuse and/or other disease-related factors (47). If muscle disuse contributes to deficiencies in mitochondrial structure and function in HF (8, 33, 68), exercise interventions should improve muscle energetics. In support of this notion, aerobic exercise training improves physical function in HF patients (11), and some portion of its beneficial effect is likely related to increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and/or function (20, 71). Despite the many benefits of aerobic exercise training, it is generally not considered an effective intervention to increase muscle size or strength (24, 26). Exercise that provokes muscle anabolism, such as resistance training, may need to be incorporated into standard, aerobic exercise-based rehabilitation regimens to more completely address the range of morphological and functional alterations in skeletal muscle in HF that limit physical function. Indeed, studies that have employed a combination of aerobic- and resistance-training programs in HF patients have shown improved aerobic fitness and muscle strength (4, 14, 67) accompanied by improved mitochondrial function (67). However, it is unclear whether the resistance-training component of the program contributes to improvements in mitochondrial biology or whether these improvements are related solely to the aerobic component. Conventional wisdom, which has been gleaned largely from studies in younger individuals, holds that resistance training has minimal or deleterious effects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial content or function (22, 54). Recent studies, however, have challenged this notion (44, 62). In elderly individuals, in particular, beneficial effects of resistance training on mitochondrial content, enzyme activity, and the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial size and function (23, 31, 43), as well as improvements in aerobic fitness (15), have been found. In HF patients and controls, resistance exercise training improves physical function (1, 49), including activities that are believed to be dependent on aerobic metabolism, such as walking endurance (1, 42, 45, 49), suggesting that this training modality has salutary effects on muscle endurance. In HF patients, resistance training has been reported to increase aerobic fitness (14, 27), along with mitochondrial enzyme activity (45), suggesting that this training modality may <b>potentiate</b> <b>muscle</b> endurance through effects on mitochondrial biology. However, a systematic evaluation of whether resistance training has beneficial effects on mitochondrial structure, enzyme activity, and gene expression in HF patients has not been undertaken. The goals of this study were twofold. First, we sought to evaluate the unique effect of HF on skeletal muscle mitochondrial content, gene expression, and enzyme activity. To accomplish this objective, we geared our recruitment strategies to mitigate the effects of chronic muscle disuse (55) and other aspects of the HF syndrome that could modify mitochondrial biology. Second, we sought to examine whether resistance training has beneficial effects on these mitochondrial properties. To accomplish this aim, these parameters were reassessed in the cohort after an 18 -wk high-intensity, resistance exercise-training program...|$|R
40|$|Recovery {{from the}} demands of daily {{training}} is {{an essential element of}} a scientifically based periodized program whose twin goals are to maximize training adaptation and enhance performance. Prolonged endurance training sessions induce substantial metabolic perturbations in skeletal muscle, including the depletion of endogenous fuels and damage/disruption to muscle and body proteins. Therefore, increasing nutrient availability (i. e., carbohydrate and protein) in the post-training recovery period is important to replenish substrate stores and facilitate repair and remodelling of skeletal muscle. It is well accepted that protein ingestion following resistance-based exercise increases rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and <b>potentiates</b> gains in <b>muscle</b> mass and strength. To date, however, little attention has focused on the ability of dietary protein to enhance skeletal muscle remodelling and stimulate adaptations that promote an endurance phenotype. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the results of recent studies that have examined the role of dietary protein for the endurance athlete. Our primary aim is to consider the results from contemporary investigations that have advanced our knowledge of how the manipulation of dietary protein (i. e., amount, type, and timing of ingestion) can facilitate muscle remodelling by promoting muscle protein synthesis. We focus on the role of protein in facilitating optimal recovery from, and promoting adaptations to strenuous endurance-based training...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear receptor-mediated {{activation}} of transcription involves coactivation by cofactors collectively denoted the steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs). The process also involves the subsequent recruitment of p 300 /CBP and PCAF {{to a complex}} that synergistically regulates transcription and remodels the chromatin. PCAF and p 300 have also been demonstrated to function as critical coactivators for the muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD during myogenic commitment. Skeletal muscle differentiation and the {{activation of}} muscle-specific gene expression {{is dependent on the}} concerted action of another bHLH factor, myogenin, and the MADS protein, MEF- 2, which function in a cooperative manner. We examined the functional role of one SRC, GRIP- 1, in muscle differentiation, an ideal paradigm for the analysis of the determinative events that govern the cell 2 ̆ 7 s decision to divide or differentiate. We observed that the mRNA encoding GRIP- 1 is expressed in proliferating myoblasts and post-mitotic differentiated myotubes, and that protein levels increase during differentiation. Exogenous/ectopic expression studies with GRIP- 1 sense and antisense vectors in myogenic C 2 C 12 cells demonstrated that this SRC is necessary for (1) induction/ activation of myogenin, MEF- 2, and the crucial cell cycle regulator, p 21, and (2) contractile protein expression and myotube formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SRC GRIP- 1 coactivates MEF- 2 C-mediated transcription. GRIP- 1 also coactivates the synergistic transactivation of E box-dependent transcription by myogenin and MEF- 2 C. GST-pulldowns, mammalian two-hybrid analysis, and immunoprecipitation demonstrate that the mechanism involves direct interactions between MEF- 2 C and GRIP- 1 and is associated with the ability of the SRC to interact with the MADS domain of MEF- 2 C. The HLH region of myogenin mediates the direct interaction of myogenin and GRIP- 1. Interestingly, interaction with myogenic factors is mediated by two regions of GRIP- 1, an amino-terminal bHLH-PAS region and the carboxy-terminal region between amino acids 1158 and 1423 (which encodes an activation domain, has HAT activity, and interacts with the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase). This work demonstrates that GRIP- 1 <b>potentiates</b> skeletal <b>muscle</b> differentiation by acting as a critical coactivator for MEF- 2 C-mediated transactivation and is the first study to ascribe a function to the amino-terminal bHLH-PAS region of SRCs...|$|R

To date, there is no uniform agreement about the recovery time required between the HRT and subsequent muscle performance to gain performance benefits in the upper body. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the recovery time required to observe enhanced upper-body muscle performance after HRT (i. e., complex training). Twenty-six professional rugby players performed a ballistic bench press (BBP) at baseline and at approximately 15 seconds and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 2 4 minutes after HRT (3 sets of 3 repetitions at 87 % 1 repetition maximum). Peak power output (PPO) and throw height were determined for all BBPs. A significant time effect with regard to PPO (F = 29. 145, partial Eta 2 = 0. 538, p, 0. 01) and throw height (F = 17. 362, partial Eta 2 = 0. 410, p, 0. 01) was observed. Paired comparisons indicated a significant decrease in PPO and throw height in the BBP performed approximately 15 seconds after the HRT compared with the baseline BBP. After 8 minutes of recovery from the HRT, both PPO and throw height were significantly higher than the PPO and throw height recorded at baseline (e. g., PPO: 879 6 100 vs. 916 6 116 W,p, 0. 01).

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{sensitivity}} of gastric smooth muscle to C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. METHODS: The spontaneous contraction of a gastric smooth muscle strip was recorded by using physiological methods in rats. The expressions of CNP and natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) in gastric tissue were examined by using immunohistochemistry techniques in the diabetic rat. RESULTS: At 4 wk after injection of STZ and vehicle, the frequency of spontaneous contraction of gastric smooth muscle was significantly reduced in diabetic rats, and the frequency was decreased from 3. 10 ± 0. 14 cycle/min in controls to 2. 23 ± 0. 13 cycle/min (n = 8, P < 0. 01). However, the amplitude of spontaneous contraction was not significant different from the normal rat. CNP significantly inhibited spontaneous contraction of gastric smooth muscle in normal and diabetic rats, but the inhibitory effect was significantly potentiated in the diabetic rats. The amplitudes of spontaneous contraction were suppressed by 75. 15 % ± 0. 71 % and 58. 92 % ± 1. 32 % while the frequencies were decreased by 53. 33 % ± 2. 03 % and 26. 95 % ± 2. 82 % in diabetic and normal rats, respectively (n = 8, P < 0. 01). The expression of CNP in gastric tissue was not changed in diabetic rats, however the expression of NPR-B was significantly increased in diabetic rats, and the staining indexes of NPR-B were 30. 67 ± 1. 59 and 17. 63 ± 1. 49 in diabetic and normal rat, respectively (n = 8, P < 0. 01).

Further survey of this same wasp venom extract allowed the structural characterization {{of two other}} novel BRPs, named here as fulvonin and cyphokinin. Biochemical characterization performed here showed that although the high primary structure similarity observed with BK, these wasp peptides are not good substrates for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) acting more likely as inhibitors of this enzyme. in pharmacological assays, only those more structurally similar to BK, namely cyphokinin and Thr(6) -BK, were able to promote the contraction of guinea-pig ileum smooth muscle preparations, which was completely blocked by the B(2) receptors antagonist HOE- 140 {{in the same way}} as observed for BK. Only fulvonin was shown to <b>potentiate</b> BK-elicited smooth <b>muscle</b> contraction. Moreover, the 2 new wasp BRPs, namely fulvonin and cyphokinin, as well as Cd- 146 and Thr(6) -BK, showed hyperalgesic effect in the rat paw pressure test after intraplantar injection. This effect was shown here to be due to the action of these peptides on BK receptors, since the hyperalgesia induced by both Cd- 146 and fulvonin was blocked by B(1) receptor antagonist, while the effect of both cyphokinin and Thr(6) -BK was reversed by B(2) antagonist. This data give support to a better understanding of the function and targets of the kinin-related peptides widely found in several insect venoms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
