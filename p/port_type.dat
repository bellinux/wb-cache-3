5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new <b>port</b> <b>type,</b> the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E

5000|$|The {{appeal of}} the GBIC {{standard}} (and [...] in general) in networking equipment, as opposed to fixed physical interface configurations, is its flexibility. Where multiple different optical technologies are in use, an administrator can purchase GBICs as needed, not in advance, {{and they can be}} the specific type needed for each link. This lowers the cost of the base system and gives the administrator far more flexibility. On the other hand, if a switch will mostly have one <b>port</b> <b>type</b> (especially if that <b>port</b> <b>type</b> is copper) purchasing a switch with that <b>port</b> <b>type</b> built in will be cheaper and take up less space per port.|$|E

5000|$|Agents {{communicate}} through entities called channels. Channels have an alphabet, defining {{the set of}} symbols which may be transmitted. Channels are created dynamically and accessed {{through the use of}} port variables. A <b>port</b> <b>type</b> is defined by a distinct set of symbols constituting its alphabet. Symbols with multiple values are defined with a specific type. For example:stream = eos;The symbol [...] denotes a message symbol called [...] of any integer value. The second typeless symbol declaration [...] (end of stream) is known as a signal. Once a <b>port</b> <b>type</b> has been defined, a port variable of that type can be declared:out : streamin : streamAnd then a channel entity, internal to the agent creating it, can be activated as follows:+out;Symbols can then be sent and received on channels using the CSP-style input and output operators [...] and [...] respectively. A communication can only occur if there is a receiving agent matching the sending agent. The receiving agent must expect to receive the symbol type being sent.

To achieve this, it defines an extensible XML language for specifying agreement offers and agreement templates. These templates are WS-Agreement-compliant and include a negotiation context and a set of negotiation constraints that are used for the negotiation.
