5000|$|The 'second wave' {{of sound}} {{recording}} history was ushered {{in by the}} introduction of Western Electric's integrated system of electrical microphones, electronic signal amplifiers and electromechanical recorders, which was adopted by major US record labels in 1925. Sound recording now became a hybrid process — sound could now be captured, amplified, filtered and balanced electronically, and the disc-cutting head was now electrically powered, but the actual recording process remained essentially mechanical - the signal was still physically inscribed into a wax 'master' disc, and consumer discs were mass-produced mechanically by stamping a metal electroform made from the wax master into a suitable substance, originally a shellac-based compound and later <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>plastic.</b> The Western Electric system greatly improved the fidelity of sound recording, increasing the reproducible frequency range to a much wider band (between 60 Hz and 6000 Hz) and allowing a new class of professional - the audio engineer - to capture a fuller, richer and more detailed and balanced sound on record, using multiple microphones connected to multi-channel electronic amplifiers, compressors, filters and mixers. Electrical microphones led to a dramatic change in the performance style of singers, ushering {{in the age of the}} [...] "crooner", while electronic amplification had a wide-ranging impact in many areas, enabling the development of broadcast radio, public address systems, and electronically-amplified home record players. In addition, the development of electronic amplifiers for musical instruments now enabled quieter instruments such as the guitar and the string bass to compete on equal terms with the naturally louder wind and horn instruments, and musicians and composers also began to experiment with entirely new electronic musical instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, the electronic organ, and the Hammond Novachord, the world's first analogue polyphonic synthesiser.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third wave}} of {{development}} in audio recording began in 1945, when the allied nations gained access to a new German invention - magnetic tape recording. The technology was invented in the 1930s, but remained restricted to Germany (where it was widely used in broadcasting) {{until the end of}} World War II. Magnetic tape provided another dramatic leap in audio fidelity — indeed, Allied observers first became aware of the existence of the new technology because they noticed that the audio quality of obviously pre-recorded programs was practically indistinguishable from live broadcasts. From 1950 onwards, magnetic tape quickly became the standard medium of audio master recording in the radio and music industries, and {{led to the development of}} the first hi-fi stereo recordings for the domestic market, the development of multi-track tape recording for music, and the demise of the disc as the primary mastering medium for sound. Magnetic tape also brought about a radical reshaping of the recording process — it made possible recordings of far longer duration and much higher fidelity than ever before, and it offered recording engineers the same exceptional plasticity that film gave to cinema editors — sounds captured on tape could now easily be manipulated sonically, edited, and combined in ways that were simply impossible with disc recordings. These experiments reached an early peak in the 1950s with the recordings of Les Paul and Mary Ford, who pioneered the use of tape editing and [...] "multi-tracking" [...] to create large 'virtual' ensembles of voices and instruments, constructed entirely from multiple taped recordings of their own voices and instruments. Magnetic tape fueled a rapid and radical expansion in the sophistication of popular music and other genres, allowing composers, producers, engineers and performers to realize previously unattainable levels of complexity. Other concurrent advances in audio technology led to the introduction of a range of new consumer audio formats and devices, on both disc and tape, including the development full-frequency-range disc reproduction, the change from shellac to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> for disc manufacture, the invention of the 33rpm, 12-inch long-playing (LP) disc and the 45rpm 7-inch [...] "single", the introduction of domestic and professional portable tape recorders (which enabled high-fidelity recordings of live performances), the popular 4-track cartridge and compact cassette formats, and even the world's first [...] "sampling keyboards" [...] - the pioneering tape-based keyboard instrument the Chamberlin, and its more famous successor, the Mellotron.|$|E

40|$|In 1885, Charles Symonds {{placed the}} first rigid {{endoprosthesis}} across a malignant esophageal stricture. With {{the introduction of}} the fiberoptic endoscope and the development of the rigid Celestin tube nearly one century later, the revolution was initiated. Over the past 2 decades, esophageal stents have drastically improved. Prior to 1990, stents were made from rigid <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>plastic</b> or rubber. These prostheses were able to restore luminal patency, however placement was difficult and bleeding, pain, and perforations frequently occurred. In the early nineties, rigid endoprostheses were replaced by uncovered self-expandable metal stents (SEMS). SEMS placement appeared to be less invasive, provided wider lumen, and was associated with fewer complications. However, new problems soon appeared. Through the uncovered mesh tumor ingrowth frequently occurred, leading to recurrent dysphagia shortly after placement. To impede tissue ingrowth, SEMS were modified with a plastic or silicone layer {{in the middle of the}} endoprosthesis. These partially-covered SEMS (PCSEMS) were not only able to re-open a blocked esophagus, but also sealed malignant esophagorespiratory fistulae. In 2001, removable fully covered metal stents (FCSEMS) and plastic stents (SEPS) were introduced. The ability to remove these stents after deployment has opened up new applications, such as the insertion of a stents as a temporary device in patients with benign esophageal fistulae or stenosis and to bridge chemo- and radiotherapy in patients with malignant esophageal disease. Initial results were suboptimal as well. Fully-covered expandable stents were associated with a higher migration rate.
