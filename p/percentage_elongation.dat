40|$|The use of {{radiation}} as a sterilization process is increasing. The well-developed {{technology of the}} radiation sterilization as applied to medical devices has assured the food industry that the process is reliable. Due to the food industry 2 ̆ 7 s possibility of widespread use, it is especially crucial that an appropriate packaging material be chosen so that its integrity is maintained after irradiation. This is because the commercial food packaging process carries products through more rigorous paths and channels than medical supplies. Many polymers used in the medical field show various degrees of degradation after radiation exposure, which can be determined either by visual or physical measurement. This paper studies the mechanical properties of polymeric films after irradiation doses of less than 10. 0 Mrads {{and the extent to}} which this process causes film degradation. In this study, two mechanical properties will be measured: tensile strength and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break. Eight polymeric films commonly used in the food packaging industry are selected as the material samples. These materials will be irradiated with doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads to determine cause-effect and dose related effect. Data collected for tensile strength and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break for each sample of one type of film before and after irradiation is analyzed and compared with data collected for other samples. Two primary purposes in undertaking this analysis are (1) to determine if the type of film significantly changes or degrades after irradiation, and (2) to study the relationship between the changes in mechanical properties of each film and the radiation doses of 0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads. In the analysis at 0. 05 level of significance, polyethylene film (TD-transverse direction) is the only film which did not significantly change in either tensile strength or <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break. The polyester/polyethylene film (MD-machine direction) significantly changed in <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break although not in tensile strength. The rest of the film samples -PP, OPP, PETG, Polyester/PE(TD), polyester-MYLAR, PE(MD), PE/Nylon and PS film- exhibited significant changes in both mechanical properties after irradiation with doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads. In the analysis of the degree of relationship between mechanical properties of each film and radiation doses of less than 10. 0 Mrads [0. 0 (non-irradiated), 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, andlO. O Mrads] found in this study can be catagorized into three types: the dose-dependent, the dose-independent, and the weak correlation. Among three film samples which exhibited the 2 ̆ 2 dose-dependent 2 ̆ 2 relationship, only oriented polypropylene(OPP) film was found to have the correlation between mechanical properties (both tensile strength and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break) and radiation doses; both mechanical properties decreased as the dose increased. Polypropylene (PP) was determined to exhibit the same correlation but only between tensile strength and radiation dose. For polyethylene (machine direction only), this correlation was found only for <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> at break and radiation dose. The rest of the film samples were found to have no correlation between either mechanical property and radiation doses such as that indicated above. They are either 2 ̆ 2 dose-independent 2 ̆ 2 or exhibit a weak relationship between the two variables. For example, the polyester-MYLAR film exhibited obvious 2 ̆ 2 dose-independent 2 ̆ 2 characteristics since both mechanical properties increased significantly from 0. 0 to 5. 0 Mrads and then decreased at 7. 0 Mrads. The films which obviously showed a very weak relationship between the mechanical properties and the radiation doses are two films which exhibited no change in mechanical properties after irradiation in the first study [PE(TD-tensile 2 ̆ 6 <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation)</b> and polyester/PE (MD- <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation)</b> ]. The films which exhibited a somewhat weak relationship between the two variables are PS (MD 2 ̆ 6 TD- tensile 2 ̆ 6 <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation)</b> and PE (MD-tensile). These last two films also showed a very small change in the mechanical properties after irradiation although not as small as the films irradiated in the first study...|$|E

Fortunately, the esthetic qualities of ceramic materials can be combined with the strength and toughness of metals to produce restorations that have both natural tooth like appearance and very good mechanical properties. Since ceramic alloys are subjected to heat treatment during porcelain application, mechanical tests of such alloys should be performed with heat treatment as an experimental variable. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the effect of simulated porcelain firing cycles on the ultimate tensile strength, ductility and estimated toughness of a Ni-Cr and a Co-Cr ceramic alloys. The microstructural changes of each alloy as a consequence to the heat treatment were also studied. Thirty tensile specimens of each alloy were cast. The specimens were divided into six groups having five specimens in each. Group 1 (Control) : the specimens were kept in the as-cast condition. In groups II-VI, a standard heat treatment simulating porcelain firing was performed. Group II was subjected to four firing cycles representing preoxidation, opaque application, body application and glaze. Groups III-VI were subjected to 5, 6, 7 and 8 firing cycles where the extra cycles represented porcelain body corrections. Tensile testing was carried out on a universal testing machine and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and <b>percentage</b> <b>elongation</b> were calculated.

40|$|Abstract: Preliminary {{investigations}} on the Comparative Tensile Strength (CTS) and <b>Percentage</b> <b>Elongations</b> (PE) of some selected plastic {{materials used}} for gari packaging and storage was carried out. With the initial CTS and PE determined, 500 g each of freshly produced gari were packaged in a 20 x 40 cm polyester, polypropylene and hessian bags respectively. The CTS and PE were determined on monthly basis for 6 months at three replicates each. The {{results show that}} the polyester, polypropylene and hessian bags had initial CTS of 0. 98, 3. 19, 3. 68 and PE of 57. 0 %, 17. 0 %, and 14. 0 % respectively. The CTS of all the packaging materials decreased with increase in storage duration. PE decreased by 75 % and 53 % for polyester and polypropylene bags, while it increased by 7 % in hessian bags. CTS and PE of packaging bags were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than their initial values. The CTS of polypropylene and hessian bags were lower than their threshold values of 1. 49 and 1. 2 N/mm indicating their unsuitability for long term storage of gari, while for polyester bag it is still within the threshold value. However, further work should be carried out to ascertain the probability {{of the effects of the}} composition of gari on the effects of these mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reports {{the effect of}} the heat {{treatment}} on the tensile properties of the reverse flow-formed AA 6082 Aluminum alloy tube. Tensile specimens obtained after each forming pass have been subjected to three different heat-treatment conditions viz., as-flow formed (AFF), as-flow formed followed by artificial aging (170 oC/ 6 h) and HT (solutionizing + 170 oC/ 6 h) treatments. Characterization of the tensile properties reveals that as-flow formed condition (followed by natural aging) gives the best combination of yield strength, UTS and <b>percentage</b> of <b>elongation.</b> The variations in tensile properties are correlated with microstructure of the materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{sorbitol}} and formaldehyde on the morphology, water absorption and mechanical properties of sodium alginate films were analyzed. The morphology {{of the films}} indicated the presence of small aggregates in the surface of uncrosslinked films, which disappeared with the crosslinking process. The water uptake and <b>percentage</b> of <b>elongation</b> increased {{with the addition of}} sorbitol in uncrosslinked films. At the same time, a decrease in tensile strength and Young's modulus occurred. The swelling ratio and water uptake of crosslinked alginate/sorbitol films decreased with an increase in sorbitol content suggesting an enhanced crosslinking density due to the presence of plasticizer...|$|R
