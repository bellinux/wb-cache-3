The adsorption of these bacteria to spheroidal hydroxyapatite beads and mechanically powdered root material followed Langmuir isotherm kinetics. From such data, the number of binding sites per 20 mg of substrate and the affinity constants were evaluated for two strains of Cytophaga sp. Resting cells of the two strains tested adhered relatively tenaciously to hydroxyapatite beads in numbers similar to those observed with cells of Streptococcus sanguis.

Rickettsial entry increased linearly with multiplicity of infection up to a multiplicity of 500; thereafter, additional rickettsiae adhered, but without a concomitant {{increase in the number of}} intracellular rickettsiae.

Because rickettsiae adhered to inactivated endothelial cells, adherence could be examined in the absence of entry. Rickettsial adherence was inhibited by poisons that inhibited rickettsial hemolysis. Calcium ionophore A 23187, which did not inhibit endothelial pinocytosis, stimulated rickettsial adherence to endothelial cells, but inhibited rickettsial entry. These results indicated that typhus rickettsiae entered endothelial cells via induced phagocytosis, and that the signal for entry, which was dependent upon rickettsial energy, probably involved formation of a calcium gradient...|$|R
