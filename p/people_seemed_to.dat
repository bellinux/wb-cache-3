25|$|In pre-Christian Rome and Greece, {{there had}} been some debate on which form of {{sexuality}} was preferable. While many <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> not oppose bisexuality, there were those who preferred to be exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. For example, a debate between homosexual and heterosexual love was included in Plutarch's Moralia.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one other}} notable event {{remained}} in the Indochina drama. In May 1975 Khmer Rouge forces boarded and captured {{the crew of the}} Mayaguez, an unarmed U.S.-registered freighter. The United States bombarded military and fuel installations on the Cambodian mainland while Marines landed by helicopter on an offshore island to rescue the crew. The 39 captives were retrieved, but the operation cost the lives of 41 U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless, the majority of the American <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> approve of the administration's decisive action.|$|E

By the end of the First World War, <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> want an even more exciting entertainment, a need met by roller coasters. Although {{the development}} of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance. The 1920s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides.|$|E

25|$|The {{album cover}} {{contributed to the}} image of Jones as a stylish beret-wearing beatnik. Jones had said the {{inspiration}} of it was from a photo of her father (an aspiring musician and waiter) in a similar pose, lighting a cigarette while sitting on a beach towel at a Chicago beach along Lake Michigan, near where the family lived. Although Donna Summer had already been wearing berets and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell wore one for the album cover of her 1976 album Hejira, it was Jones Parisian-boho jazz sensibility that finally popularized it, propelling as a mainstay of hipster chic and (perhaps unintentionally) branding her image in the process. Despite Jones' beautiful looks and street gamine wildness, she would recall that <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> only recognize her in public when she was wearing the beret. The album cover photography and design was by Norman Seeff.|$|E

Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, {{the writers of}} the episode, however, credit an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled [...] "Shadow Play" [...] (1961). Gilligan later noted: [...] "The funny thing about 'Monday' is <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> really like it a lot, but people always sorta [...] smiled and said you're sort of ripping off Groundhog Day aren't you? [...] And I'd say, we're not ripping off Groundhog Day, we're ripping off The Twilight Zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, {{featured}} ten of {{the thirteen}} extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. [...] All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation.... Many <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. [...] He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived." ...|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the [...] "MSX" [...] {{abbreviation}} remains a matter of debate. At the time, most <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> agree it meant [...] "MicroSoft eXtended", referring to the built-in [...] "Microsoft eXtended BASIC" [...] (MSX-BASIC), specifically adapted by Microsoft for the MSX system. Another suggested source for the abbreviation was Matsushita-Sony. However, according to Kazuhiko Nishi, the team used [...] "Machines with Software eXchangeability" [...] during its development. In 1985, Kazuhiko Nishi said that he named MSX after the MX missile.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet {{government}} itself said very little publicly about {{the change in}} the law, and few <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be aware that it existed. [...] In 1934, the British Communist Harry Whyte wrote a long letter to Stalin condemning the law, and its prejudicial motivations. [...] He laid out a Marxist position against the oppression of homosexuals, as a social minority, and compared homophobia to racism, xenophobia and sexism. While the letter was not formally replied to, Soviet cultural writer Maxim Gorky authored an article, published in both Pravda and Izvestia titled [...] "Proletarian Humanism", that seemed to reject Whyte's arguments point by point. He rejected the notion that homosexuals were a social minority, and argued that the Soviet Union, governed by [...] "manly proletariat", is obliged to persecute homosexuals to protect the youth from their corrupting effect. He also equated homosexuality with fascism, stating that destroying homosexuality would in turn destroy fascism. In 1936, Justice Commissar Nikolai Krylenko publicly stated that the anti-gay criminal law was aimed at the decadent and effete old ruling classes.|$|E
