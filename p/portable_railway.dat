5000|$|The first French-built narrow-gauge railway was the Casablanca-Bouskoura-Berrechid [...] line, {{built with}} <b>portable</b> <b>railway</b> track from Decauville, which also {{delivered}} {{the rolling stock}} to the line. Construction started in May 1908 and the 52 km line was completed in late July 1908. The trains reached a maximum speed of 20 km/h averaging only 12 km/h between Casablanca and Berrechid.|$|E
40|$|Interruption of {{railway traffic}} creates {{important}} financial losses for the transportation utilities and society at large. At this moment, to limit this impact, the CN uses emergency girders stored around their territory {{to decrease the}} time to transport the materials to the site. However, this method is difficult {{to put in place}} and bypass of the traffic is not possible everywhere. The development of a <b>portable</b> <b>railway</b> bridge is interesting for this purpose. This structure has to be transported, erected and in services within 48 h. This type of bridge should also be adjustable in length to allow reusing of the existing bearings, piers and abutments (5 to 28 m of span). Between the steel superstructure possibilities, three solutions have been chosen: (a) plate girder, (b) through girder and (c) through truss. The geometry and the construction method are the particularities to consider. After those conceptions, the three alternatives have been analyzed as a function of many criteria. The number of bolts, the quantity of material and the dimension of the prefabricated sections were considered to determine the best solution for this kind of utilization...|$|E

5000|$|The French {{narrow gauge}} railway pioneer Paul Decauville wanted to {{experiment}} with passenger transport using his <b>portable</b> <b>railways,</b> already successfully introduced in the industry and agriculture. For the 1878 Exposition Universelle he proposed to use his concept for the exhibition by a line Trocadéro - Military Academy passing the Champ-de-Mars, but permission was denied. He then offered the same facility at the Zoological Gardens, which was accepted. Two kilometers of railway line at the track gauge of [...] was constructed for the transportation of the exhibit visitors over a circular track, having a maximum speed of 15 km/h. The line carried up to 3000 passengers on some Sundays and received a very positive response from the visitors. But for some unknown reason, the network was quickly removed.|$|R
2500|$|France had {{developed}} <b>portable</b> Decauville <b>railways</b> for agricultural areas, small scale mining and temporary construction projects. France had standardized [...] narrow gauge Decauville military equipment and Germany adopted similar feldbahn {{of the same}} gauge. British War Department Light Railways and the United States Army Transportation Corps used the French [...] narrow gauge system. Russia used Decauville [...] narrow gauge and narrow gauge systems.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} {{to explore the}} vulnerability of working-class housing in South Africa to ideological manipulation, be it of economic and/or political derivation. More descriptively, by delineating the ideological role of early forms of workers' housing {{in the development of}} capitalist South Africa, this two-part enquiry aims to reveal the instrumental potential of working-class housing in the spheres of labour control and social management, and to bring to the fore the manner in which ideology can operate through design. Two early innovations in the realm of working-class housing, the establishment of which dates back to the later nineteenth century and the birth of South Africa's first industrial community, form the focus in the opening study. Part I seeks to expound, by investigating the contrasting approach to the housing of black and white mineworkers at the Kimberley diamond fields, the true deliberations which lay behind the creation of the parallel institutions of the closed compound, on the one hand, and the garden suburb of Kenilworth on the other. The former is shown to have provided the mineowners with a directly coercive means of coming to terms with black migrant labour, and the latter to have furnished them with a means of surmounting, by 'acquiescence' rather than through the exercise of force, the growing power of white labour. Both innovations came to serve as practicable models in the spheres of labour control and social management to other large employers of labour in South Africa, such as the State Railways, and to urban management in general. Part II negotiates railway housing provision {{during the first half of}} this century against the backdrop of the 'poor white' crisis, a social dilemma of major proportions caused by pervasive rural impoverishment and the subsequent drift into the urban areas of unskilled and mostly illiterate Afrikaners. Poor white relief in time developed into a chief objective of Government, with the Railways forming the vanguard of its so-called 'civilised labour' policy after 1924 in giving preference to white workers over black in unskilled and skilled jobs regardless of the greater expense. The State Railways in due course became the largest single employer of Afrikaners in the urban areas. One result of the Railways' 'rehabilitative function' in easing the adjustment to the urban way of life of newly proletarianised Afrikaners will be shown to have been the <b>portable</b> <b>railway</b> model village. It will also be illustrated how it was to design, among other things, that the Railway Administration looked in an attempt to integrate its white employees into the social fabric of towns - the cultural strongholds of English-speaking whites - when the custom of housing railway families on the opposite side of the railway line to the town gave rise to the association thereof with 'living on the wrong side of the tracks'...|$|E
50|$|The company rapidly {{developed}} {{a range of}} traction engines, steam rollers, ploughing engines, agricultural implements and stationary engines. One of their forgotten achievements is the invention (see British Patent 763 of 1880) of the traction-centre engine, for driving steam-powered fairground roundabouts. This is often wrongly attributed to Savage of King's Lynn. In the 1890s, McLaren {{developed a}} range of vertical triple-expansion engines for the new industry of electricity generation. The zenith of this effort {{was a pair of}} 3000 ihp engines for Leeds Corporation’s Whitehall Road Power Station. After the start of the 20th century, the company introduced a tractor for direct haulage and a range of powerful direct-ploughing engines. The largest of these, rated 125 ihp, was fitted with superheater, feedwater heater and fully lagged cylinders. This provided a very efficient engine, which won many awards both at home and abroad. Other minor products were, showmen's engines, crane engines, <b>portable</b> engines, <b>railway</b> locomotives and Darby Steam-Diggers.|$|R
