25|$|The {{misinterpretation}} of some regulations {{has led to}} {{the confusion}} that certain universities do not prescribe headwear, most notably the Open University where the <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> academic headgear is not worn at graduation ceremonies, whilst some universities have abandoned headwear for socio-political reasons or because the designer intended it, such as is the case of Vivienne Westwood and her design for King's College London.|$|E
25|$|After an {{incident}} at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit flagman waved a green flag {{but the light}} at the end of pit road was red, NASCAR added a light to the rear of the pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when pit road will be open, and thus removed the flagman from the entrance of pit road. NASCAR's official <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in the event of a discrepancy, {{the light at the}} end of pit road is official.|$|E
25|$|As a Muslim ruler in {{a largely}} Hindu domain, Tipu Sultan faced {{problems}} {{in establishing the}} legitimacy of his rule, and in reconciling his desire {{to be seen as}} a devout Islamic ruler with the need to be pragmatic to avoid antagonising the majority of his subjects. A scholarly assessment of his religious <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was secular, tolerant to most religious groups, and with regular endowments made to Hindus and Hindu institutions including 156 temples, including lavish gifts to temples such as Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam.|$|E

25|$|Camarilla <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> vampires {{should try}} {{to fit in with}} and hide from the rest of humanity, as to easily feed on them. For this reason, they created a web of lies and misinformation, called the Masquerade, to make the public believe that supernatural beings like vampires could not {{possibly}} exist. The Camarilla also believes that the only way the vampire species can survive in these modern nights is if it unites—any breach of the Masquerade by any vampire risks exposing the entire race. Both viewpoints are fundamentally opposed by the Sabbat.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the attacks}} against the United States on September 11, 2001, the National Guard's general policy {{regarding}} mobilization was that Guardsmen {{would be required to}} serve no more than one year cumulative on active duty (with no more than six months overseas) for each five years of regular drill. Due to strains placed on active duty units following the attacks, the possible mobilization time was increased to 18 months (with no more than one year overseas). Additional strains placed on military units {{as a result of the}} invasion of Iraq further increased the amount of time a Guardsman could be mobilized to 24 months. Current Department of Defense <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no Guardsman is involuntarily activated for more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s medical care, {{public hygiene}} and {{sanitation}} improved considerably, and epidemics were controlled. Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The population growth rate surged as {{the mortality rate}} dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population {{has always been a}} major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958–60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population control drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per family policy was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%. China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> China {{is now one of the}} most rapidly ageing countries in the world.|$|E

500|$|The {{presence}} {{of nuclear weapons}} on board U.S. aircraft carriers {{since the end of}} the Cold War has neither been confirmed nor denied by the U.S. government.

At that time, the Strike Group commander Rear Admiral John Terence Blake stated that: [...] "The U.S. <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we do not routinely deploy nuclear weapons on board Nimitz." ...|$|E
5000|$|New Zealand's anti-nuclear {{policy of}} the 1980s was partly {{motivated}} by economic considerations.

500|$|In {{addition}} to charging for lawn seating, the event promoters prohibited concertgoers from bringing beverages, including bottled water, to the lawn; drinks instead {{had to be}} purchased onsite. The city later stated that confiscation of unopened beverage bottles was a mistake and that [...] "Bottled water is always allowed at the free concerts we host at the park, and will be allowed at any future events as well." [...] An estimated 300 attendees set up blankets beyond the trellis system, where they could enjoy their own beverages while listening to the concert. The official Chicago <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> alcohol is permitted throughout Jay Pritzker Pavilion during public performances, but cans and glass bottles are not permitted on the Great Lawn. During the concert, the Gehry-designed BP Pedestrian Bridge that connects Millennium Park with Daley Bicentennial Plaza was closed until 7:00a.m. the next day.|$|E

The Trust {{has the power to}} take synagogues and non-Christian places of worship but in spite of negotiations has not yet done so. [...] The Trust arranges for the chapels to be open to the public at advertised times, and wherever possible it introduces disabled access.

2500|$|A common {{criticism}} of French energy <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the country may have over-invested in nuclear power plants, requiring electricity export when French electricity demand is low or [...] "dumping" [...] in the French market, encouraging {{the use of}} electricity for space heating and water heating.|$|E
