40|$|New {{method of}} canning {{specimens}} made of composites of arc-sprayed and plasma-sprayed tape reduces outgassing and warping during hot isostatic pressing. Produces can having reliable, crack-free seal and thereby helps to ensure <b>pressed</b> <b>product</b> of high quality. Specimen placed in ring of refractory metal between two face sheets, also of refractory metal. Assembly placed in die in vacuum hot press, where simultaneously heated and pressed until plates become diffusion-welded to ring, forming sealed can around specimen. Specimen becomes partially densified, and fits snugly within can. Ready for further densification by hot isostatic pressing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Forming {{tools for}} a press are usually {{machined}} with {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools. This could be quite time consuming—calculating tool tracks, selecting cutting tools, cutting blanks, design fixation and finally machining—especially for a small batch of parts. One alternative method is to cut a die and draw punch tools from a blank sheet and join the plates together. Clamping plates together is fast and easy to implement by using, for example, threaded rods and guide bars with a certain tolerance to ensure alignment. A laser, a waterjet or a plasma cutter {{can be used for}} cutting plates. The laser and the fine beam plasma cutting in particular are precise methods that give a fine surface quality even without a need for fine-tuning [4]. The method saves material compared with machining because a die and a punch could be cut at the same time from a blank sheet as a compatible pair; in addition, the required number of plates could be estimated depending of the length of a <b>pressed</b> <b>product.</b> The University of Oulu, Oulu Southern Institute and the Future Manufacturing Technology group has manufactured several forming tools within this technique and found it suitable for easily experimenting with different solutions and options. Furthermore, the method is likely to help especially small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in research and development phase by lowering production costs in an efficient way...|$|E

The factors of complete versus incomplete families,employed and non ??employed women, women's educational and age level, and family income level {{were related to}} selection and use of permanent press. The above factors were analyzed in rela??tion to responses on;ownership,care,and planned replacement of permanent press products;consumer motivation which included reasons for purchasing permanent press;and awareness and influences of advertising media. Generally,the complete families had a larger variety and {{a greater number of}} permanent <b>press</b> <b>products</b> than the incomplete families. The employed women owned a larger number of permanent press shirts and blouses than the non??-employed women. The non-employed were less aware of advertising but more were influenced by the advertising media than employed women. No significant differences occurred among the various educational groups when related to permanent press behavior. The twenty-five to fifty- four age groups were the major owners of permanent <b>press</b> <b>products</b> and had equipment for recommended care of these products. All consumers in the 5, 000 - 19, 999 income range owned permanent <b>press</b> <b>products</b> and would replace items with permanent press.

To compare the emissions of TVOCs with <b>pressed</b> wood <b>products,</b> a PVC board, often used as floor covering, was also measured. The temporal change of TVOCs concentrations was tested. The quantity of TVOCs emissions was measured by a Gas Chromatography/Flame Ionisation Detector (GC-FID).

Model evaluation studies indicate that the hardboard I has the smallest model accuracy while the plywood and PVC board have the largest model accuracy.

40|$|The rubber {{pressing}} process is {{applied for the}} rapid production of thermoplastic composite <b>products.</b> However, rubber <b>pressed</b> <b>products</b> show geometrical distortions, such as warpage, due to processinduced residual stresses. An experimental study is performed to measure the curvature after rubber pressing of initially flat woven fabric glass/poly(phenylenesulphide) composite panels. A material model is proposed that incorporates the solidification of the composite in order to predict the residual stresses and the warpage due to inhomogeneous cooling. The model is employed in finite element simulations of the rubber {{pressing process}}. The simulations are compared to the experimentally obtained curvatures. It shows that unbalanced cooling has a minor effect on the warpage in this case. It is demonstrated that transverse shear loading of the composite during consolidation, for example by a non-flat rubber tool, results in warpage-inducing residual stresses...|$|R
