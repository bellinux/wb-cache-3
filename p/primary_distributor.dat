40|$|E-book, in its {{broadest}} meaning, {{has been}} defined as a text accessible in electronic medium. Based on this definition, either a publication stored on a cd-rom or accessed through the Web can be considered as an e-book. These examples show that e-books actually have been available for years. The e-books, evolving over years, became texts readable on e-book readers. This evolution triggered not only the variation in the e-book readers, but also in the standards used. While a universal e-book standard has been emerging, different marketing trends have been taking place in the e-book market. Among those trends, the most significant ones are the distributors such as netLibrary, Ebrary, and Questia.
