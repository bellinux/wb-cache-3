5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the abnormal; the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of murders of psychics and fortune tellers. The two are assisted by Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), an enigmatic and reluctant individual who possesses the ability to foresee how <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to die.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
25|$|A {{high level}} of {{paranoia}} is present throughout the film with the visual manifestation of corporate power, omnipresent police, probing lights; and in the power over the individual represented particularly by genetic programming of the replicants. Control over the environment is seen {{on a large scale}} but also with how animals are created as mere commodities. This oppressive backdrop clarifies why many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to the off-world colonies, which clearly parallels the migration to the Americas. The popular 1980s prediction of the United States being economically surpassed by Japan is reflected in the domination of Japanese culture and corporations in the advertising of LA 2019. The film also makes extensive use of eyes and manipulated images to call into question reality and our ability to perceive it.|$|E

[...] Phil Ewing, Gartrell's best friend, said at the hearing that the entire case was a misunderstanding and said, [...] "Now <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to see him as}} a racist, and that is not him."

500|$|On September 27, 2012, Big Sean {{announced}} his second studio album {{with the title}} Hall of Fame: Memoirs of a Detroit Player, and then has announced a release date for December 2012. Sean explains why chose {{this to be the}} title, stating that [...] "its because it'll represent who he is". He then said that he feels [...] "like situations are really going to be relatable to people." [...] He then stated that he [...] "didn't want to just do another club song", and he didn't even wanted to follow these popular music standards. [...] "This is just what the fuck I want to do. Some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to like it. Some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel". He even indicated that the song [...] "Mula" [...] featuring French Montana (which also this track was included on the mixtape Detroit), could be featuring as the track for his deluxe edition.|$|E

Between that and my four children, I don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] {{featured}} three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and {{was written}} for the main antagonist in Lifehouse, Brick. Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on {{the first half of}} the track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as [...] "the longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life." [...] The closing track, [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, [...] "a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get hurt". The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an ARP synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] {{was written}} by Scott M. Gimple and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren.

[...] In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album. [...] "There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day.

[...] In August 2009, Columbia Pictures hired screenwriters Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara to write the sequel, and the studio plans to bring back the producing team from the original film. [...] Charlize Theron confirmed that she would reprise her role, and Berg said to expect a third actor to star as another figure with powers like Smith's and Theron's characters.|$|E

Liz later notifies Jenna {{that no one is}} going to be fired, and that the executive is actually an extra on the show. Jenna aims to get back at the pair, and although Toofer admits that he was too smart for Jenna's tactics, Frank is seen running around naked outside Jack's balcony.

500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. I think <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the {{work has been done}} very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{surprise}} {{success of}} Guitar Hero readily {{led to the}} development of a sequel for the game. According to developer John Tam, the team felt they [...] "hit the sweet spot" [...] of genres and decades within the set list and wanted to maintain that for the sequel. [...] The costs of obtaining licensing rights for music from [...] "big bands" [...] such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Metallica, in addition to the lack of understanding of how the music would be used prevented these groups from being used in Guitar Hero. [...] However, Tam notes that with the success of Guitar Hero, [...] "They understand that we're not going to embarrass their music, we're going to actually pay homage to their music and get it to the point where <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to fall in love with their music and understand their music in a totally different way than they've ever experienced it before." [...] They also had requests by artists to include master tracks within the game.|$|E
500|$|A {{central part}} of Fall Out Boy's sound {{is rooted in the}} band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who {{commonly}} uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories. Wentz stated, [...] "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, or what I imagine <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> through most of the time." [...] He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the Cork Tree include narcissism and megalomania, while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss {{the ups and downs of}} fame. While writing Folie à Deux, he explored moral dilemmas and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E
