40|$|This article {{examines}} the discovery and appropriation of the Chinese diaspora in nationalistic and literary discourse in early 20 th-century China. The overseas Chinese experience entered into the main field of vision of the Chinese intellectuals at a strategic moment {{at the turn of}} the century, when the diasporic frontier was uncovered only to be re-incorporated into the nationalistic imagination. This analysis begins with a look at Liang Qichao’s ambivalent attitude toward the overseas Chinese whom he praised as national colonial heroes on the one hand, and denigrated for tarnishing China’s image abroad on the other. In the context of national survival and the theory of evolution, Chinese laborers were hailed by some writers as the exception to the rule of extinction of the unfit. This representation was in no small part reinforced by literary and fictional writings about <b>post-apocalyptic</b> <b>societies</b> where the Chinese once again found their proper role of leadership and dominance over other races. After examining the hitherto largely unknown novels and stories on the subject, the discussion ends with an analysis of the 1906 novel, Icy Mountains and Snowy Seas, set in the 24 th century in a brave new world near the South Pole.

Dr. Cable, {{the head of the}} mysterious Special Circumstances, cuts Tally a deal: betray her friends and help the city locate the runaways or remain an “Ugly” forever. When Tally joins the Smokies, she learns a chilling truth: the surgeries that the city performs are not just intended to render its inhabitants beautiful. The city also puts lesions into the minds of the “Pretties,” making them shallow, unintelligent, and ultimately easier to control population.

40|$|Sexuality {{and sexual}} {{behavior}} {{in relation to}} gender roles are prominent issues in socio-political debates and have been the central topics of feminism and emancipation through centuries of inequality and gender differences. These socio-political issues are reflected also, {{in the field of}} literature. A particular genre, dystopian fiction, centers on a rigidly controlled society, totalitarian in character, and strongly regulatory in terms of individual behavior. A special emphasis will be placed on the theme of sexuality. An analysis of these themes in the three novels by Aldous Huxley and Margaret Atwood answer two research questions: (1) In what way does sexuality act as an authority’s instrument in the total subjugation of its citizens and can it be regulated to define a person’s social position, and (2) how does the commodification of sexual behavior define the choices the novels’ characters make to survive? In this thesis, I will focus on the different manifestations of regulated sexual behavior within a <b>post-apocalyptic</b> and dystopian <b>society</b> as instruments of the reigning authority to impose on its subjects rules to safeguard power structures. ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Story to End All Stories for Harlan Ellison’s Anthology Dangerous Visions" [...] (1968) is a 117-word {{short story}} by Philip K.

It is a simply written {{account of a}} decadent, dystopian, <b>post-apocalyptic</b> <b>society,</b> characterised by inter-species sex, infanticide, and {{cannibalism}} (the story can be read in its entirety below).

Beyond its literary context, Roth's open declaration of her religion as a Christian has brought commentary from Christian communities both endorsing and challenging the novel.|$|E
5000|$|Nausicaä, {{the protagonist}} of Hayao Miyazaki's manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and its film adaptation, is the humane and peace-loving Warrior Princess of the Valley of the Wind, a small <b>post-apocalyptic</b> <b>society</b> in a world {{dominated}} by large, powerful insects who reside in the [...] "Sea of Corruption". Fueled by her love for others and for life itself, Nausicaä attempts to restore the balance of life among other human tribes and the insects, often making numerous sacrifices to do so. Although her character {{was intended to be}} viewed in the context of animistic philosophies by Miyazaki, she is often interpreted, especially in regards to Disney's English dub, as a Christ figure.|$|E
40|$|The new {{millennium}} has witnessed a staggering outpouring of literature, film and art which depict dystopian and <b>post-apocalyptic</b> <b>societies.</b> These stories {{have come in}} the form of massively popular films like the Matrix and Hunger Games trilogies; Emmy-winning television adaptations such as The Walking Dead; and Pulitzer Prize-winning novels like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, or Kazuo Ishiguro’s Booker Prize-nominated Never Let Me Go. In the last five years, a wave of critically-lauded video games – The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite, and Dishonored come immediately to mind—have depicted dystopian worlds while reaching mass audiences. Combined, The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite sold over 12 million copies in 2013 alone. The combination of award recognition and mainstream popularity these texts have garnered speaks to their burgeoning cultural significance. John Joseph Adams notes that dystopian stories went through an earlier cycle of cultural prominence in the Western reading world after WWII—a popularity forged in the shadow of the twin horrors of the hydrogen bomb and the Nazi Holocaust. Adams wonders if the genre’s sudden resurgence is connected to widespread global conflict: “Is it because the political climate now is reminiscent of the climate during the Cold War? During times of war and global unease, is it that much easier to imagine a depopulated world, a world destroyed by humanity’s own hand?” (2). While the concept of “global unease” is certainly central to the re-emergence of fiction that depicts widespread violence, destruction, disease and political strife, the truth is that the international political climate resembles very little of the Cold War. Rather than a long-simmering conflict between established nations with legacies of military and economic might, the contemporary global community is more frequently defined by amorphous entities. International corporations, global community organizations and groups of non-state actors both engage and defy nation-state governments, while individuals, corporations and states all participate in an expansive and complex global economy. In my dissertation, I argue that the antagonisms that arise from these transnational exchanges are both the subject and the modus operandi for dystopian stories which analyze, and are influenced by, terrorism and events of mass destruction. This project explores the myriad ways that contemporary dystopian fear is woven into a global culture in which terrorism, biological warfare and scarcity of natural resources coalesce to create cultures of anxiety and paranoia that exist alongside more cosmopolitan conceptions of globalization. To understand the contemporary proliferation of dystopian stories, the genre itself needs to be seen within the synchronal rise of globalization. In chapter one, I argue that dystopian literature has been produced in a variety of forms through the last century, and that the best way to understand its current significance is to first contextualize the genre within the history of early twentieth century transatlantic travel and communication that precedes twenty-first century globalization. Chapter two turns to issues of memory, trauma and representation in American fiction dealing with the September 11 th terrorist attacks. A host of prominent writers use the imagery of burning skyscrapers and human rubble that the attacks engendered to argue that contemporary terrorism and terrorists need to be understood as emerging from the processes of globalization. Don DeLillo and Jonathan Safran Foer, in particular, insist that terrorism is both a physical and cultural phenomenon, and that psychologies of terror impact global culture. My third chapter moves to fiction in the War on Terror decade, investigating the role of regional identities and organizing communities in a globalized world as they are depicted in a range of texts and films. Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later and Alfonso Caurón’s Children of Men not only dramatize but explore globalization critiques that focus on concerns about population growth, migration, and scarcity of resources. As critics of globalization raise these concerns, the disassembling and rebuilding of families in dystopian fiction stands in for the interaction that individuals and small groups have with the global community. In focusing their stories on small groups of survivors who form improvised domestic units, McCarthy, Boyle and Caurón position the family as a counterbalance to a myriad of dystopian global crises. The final chapter of my project uses Paolo Bacigalupi’s Hugo Award-winning novel The Windup Girl and the celebrated American video game Bioshock Infinite to theorize about the present moment. As the War on Terror decade lapses into the global financial recession of 2008 - 2009, dystopian fiction moves away from the drastic imagery of catastrophic urban destruction, and instead transitions toward a discussion of the anxieties which animate post-recession culture: class conflict, the gulf between corporations and individuals, and the further depletion of world resources...|$|R
40|$|Terminal: A Miracle Play with Popular Music {{from the}} End of the World {{is a film}} and live {{performance}} project exploring the politics of post-apocalyptic fiction. A theatrical staging of a morality play for end times and future folk music, it recasts eschatology, as a foundational myth for a future <b>society.</b> <b>Post-apocalyptic</b> writing and cinema are grounded in an ethos of survivalism. Invoking Rousseau’s state of nature, or time before government, these fictions propose violent scenarios in which nuclear holocaust, environmental catastrophe and other disasters generate an individualistic politics of pure pragmatism, negating the possibility of democratic deliberation. Terminal narrates this familiar scenario, {{but at the same}} time questions its validity. The film, shot on black and white VHS at Kurt Schwitters’ Merzbarn in Cumbria, dramatises a series of conversations between future-historical archetypes about the needs and pressures of the situation in which they find themselves at the end of the world. The performers then gather to play worshipful songs about acid rain, radiation sickness and eating the dog, using a mix of conventional, obscure and makeshift instruments In the tradition of books such as Russell Hoban’s Riddley Walker and Arthur M. Miller Jr. ’s A Canticle for Liebowitz, Terminal imagines artistic expression and new folk traditions for a world to come after the apocalypse. If, as Slavoj Žižek would have it, it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to think of the end of capitalism, the project juxtaposes these two endpoints to test out how alternative scenarios might emerge from the collaborative practice of making theatre and music against a setting of social collapse...|$|R
