40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the International Labour Process Conference: [URL] article presents a detailed review of the vast <b>partnership</b> literature which has emerged over the last decade. It begins by examining definitions of <b>partnership,</b> and suggests that while academic definitions are unhelpfully vague, practitioner definitions tend to conflate <b>partnership</b> processes with <b>partnership</b> outcomes. An alternative definition based upon <b>partnership</b> processes and practices is offered. This is followed by a review of the conceptual advocates/critics debate, and the abundance of empirical <b>partnership</b> studies exploring trade union representative capacity/mutual gains outcomes. It is proposed that while recent empirical evidence identifies a variety of outcomes and presents various typologies of <b>partnership,</b> there is an absence of debates on typologies in the literature. The article then identifies several limitations of the existing literature including ideological positions, a lack of sensitivity to context and to different types of <b>partnership,</b> and a focus on outcomes. The article concludes by suggesting a need to understand more about the process of <b>partnership,</b> to clarify the meaning and expectations of <b>partnership,</b> and stresses the importance of evaluating <b>partnership</b> in context...|$|R
