40|$|Background: Recombinant allergens {{are under}} {{investigation}} for replacing allergen extracts in immunotherapy. Site-directed mutagenesis has been suggested as a strategy to develop hypoallergenic molecules that will {{reduce the risk of}} side effects. For decades, chemically modified allergen extracts have been used for the same reason. Aim: To evaluate whether glutaraldehyde modification is a good strategy to produce hypoallergenic recombinant allergens with retained immunogenicity. Methods: Fel d 1 was cloned as a single construct linking both chains of the molecule and expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. After <b>physicochemical</b> <b>purification,</b> recombinant Fel d 1 (rFel d 1) was chemically modified using glutaraldehyde. The effect of modification on immune reactivity was evaluated using radioallergosorbent test, CAP-inhibition, competitive radioimmunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, basophil histamine release, and T-cell proliferation assays. Both natural Fel d 1 and recombinant unmodified Fel d 1 were used as controls. Results: rFel d 1 demonstrated similar IgE binding and biological activity as its natural counterpart. Upon modification, IgE-binding potency decreased to 3 ̆e 1000 -fold, which was translated into a 3 ̆e 106 - fold reduction in the biological activity assessed by basophil histamine release. In contrast, the modified recombinant did not show a decreased but even a moderately increased capacity (1. 5 -fold) to stimulate proliferation of T cells (P Conclusions: Chemical modification is a practical and highly effective approach for achieving hypoallergenicity of recombinant allergens with retained immunogenicity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn apatitic calcium {{phosphate}} gel (HaG) was elaborated {{and used to}} treat municipal wastewater in a physicochemical cycle prior to the standard biological degradation process. Preliminary laboratory batch experiments outlined the kinetics of heavy metal sorption by monitoring the concentrations found in filtered fractions {{as a function of}} treatment time. On site experiments were performed in a municipal wastewater treatment plant by derivation of real wastewater into an experimental tank. In this case, the sorption of organic and metal pollution was studied on the whole effluent. The solid and liquid phases were both characterized using elemental analysis, total and organic carbon, and thermal analysis of the solids collected. Results showed significant reductions in heavy metal contents of about 50 to 60 % for main metals such as lead, aluminum and iron in the liquid phase. The concentrations went respectively from initial values of 0. 07, 0. 15 and 1. 80 ppm to 0. 04, 0. 11 and 0. 03 ppm in the treated waters for these elements. Organic matter also reacted with the HaG by adsorbing to the solid particles, with the contents of organic carbon increasing from zero to 80 g/Kg on the solids and decreasing from 130 ppm to 24 ppm in the liquid phase. This allows foreseeing improvements in the biological treatment process following this <b>physicochemical</b> <b>purification</b> step. The elemental analysis showed that up to 50 and 90 percent of the heavy metals could be removed from the effluent. The presence of the organic matter adsorbed on {{calcium phosphate}} was confirmed by thermal methods...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that repeated intravenous injections of a relatively large amount of Leishmania amazonensis amastigote extract (LaE) in BALB/c mice exacerbates the infection of these mice by Leishmania braziliensis. The identification of the extract active principle(s) through <b>physicochemical</b> <b>purification</b> often involves dilution and losses of protein in the course of successive purification procedures. The large amount of the extract required to induce the phenomenon, therefore, hinders the carrying out of experiments aimed at identifying the active molecule(s) through extract purification. In the present work, a dose-response experiment was done to find out if smaller amounts of LaE than that necessary to be used by the intravenous route would reproduce the phenomenon when injected by the intradermal route. In addition, it was also investigated whether a Leishmania braziliensis amastigote extract (LbE) would exert the same effect and whether the effect would occur in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. RESULTS: It was found that a single injection of either LaE or LbE containing 5 µg of protein was capable of enhancing the infection in BALB/c but not in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In addition, it was observed that the largest tested doses of LbE (containing 30 and 180 µg of protein) failed to enhance the infection by L. braziliensis, whereas all doses of LaE enhanced equally that infection. CONCLUSIONS: Those results indicate the possible existence in LbE, and not in LaE, of molecules that interfere with the extract infection-enhancing activity when it is injected in large amounts, and that the inoculation of Leishmania extracts through the intravenous and intradermal routes potentiate the infection by L. braziliensis through the same mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of marine biological pharmaceutical research, high-effective and low-toxic drugs and functional foods isolated from marine organisms have become a new field of pharmacy and bromatology. The pharmacological actions, such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, antitumor, immunological enhancement, and hepatorenal protection of C-phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis, have been reported, and C-PC has important value of development and utilization either as drug or as functional food. There are many researches about the various pharmacological actions and mechanisms of C-PC, but related reports are only to some extent integrated deeply and accurately enough, which put some limitations to the further application of C-PC in medicine. Particularly, with the improvement of living standards and attention to health issues, C-PC being a functional food is preferred by more and more people. C-PC is easy to get, safe, and nontoxic; thus, it has a great potential of research and development as a drug or functional food. Here, the separation and <b>purification,</b> <b>physicochemical</b> properties, physiological and pharmacological activities, safety, and some applications are reviewed to provide relevant basis for the development of natural medicine and applied products...|$|R
40|$|Plague {{has been}} the cause of three pandemics and {{has led to the}} death of {{millions}} of people. Plague is a typical zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis that circulates in populations of wild rodents inhabiting natural plague foci on all continents except for Australia. Transmission of plague is provided by flea bites. Circulation of Y. pestis in natural plague foci is supported by a numerous of pathogenicity factors. This review explores one of them, plasminogen activator Pla. This protein is one of representatives of omptins, a family of enterobacterial outer membrane proteases that are responsible for colonization of specific organs or even infection generalization as a result of successful overcoming of the host innate immunity. The review reflects the history of its discovery and studying of its genetic control, biosynthesis, isolation and <b>purification,</b> <b>physicochemical</b> properties. Highly purified preparations of plasminogen activator are deficient in enzymatic activities but renaturation in the presence of Y. pestis lipooligosaccharide restores enzymatic properties of Pla. This pathogenicity factor is absent in representatives of the most ancient phylogenetic group of the plague pathogen, bv. caucasica, while the ancestor of other groups of Y. pestis subsp. microtus obtained in result of horizontal transfer Pla isoform with characteristics similar to properties of omptins from the less virulent enterobacteria. After that in the course of microevolution the “classic” isoform of Pla with increased protease activity was selected that is typical of all highly virulent for humans strains of Y. pestis subsp. pestis. The “classic” isoform of Pla Y. pestis is functionally similar to mammalian plasminogen activators transforming plasminogen into plasmin with the help of limited proteolysis. Pla protease activating plasminogen and also degrading the main plasmin inhibitor — α 2 -antiplasmin and, respectively, determining Y. pestis ability to lyse fibrin clots preventing bacteria dissemination after bites of infected fleas or subcutaneous challenge {{is believed to be the}} main Y. pestis factor responsible for generalization of infectious process. Pla-mediated ability of Y. pestis for selective binding with extracellular matrix and basal membranes may promote further hydrolysis of these structures by the host’s plasmin and overcoming tissue barriers by the pathogen. Y. pestis plasminogen activator also hydrolyses C 3 complement component, human antimicrobial peptide — cathelicidin LL- 37 and such cytokines as tumor necrosis factor α, interferon γ, interleukin 8 and protein 1 of monocyte chemotaxis. The main endogenic TFPI tissue factor pathway inhibitor also highly susceptible to proteolytic action of Pla, and efficiency of TFPI inactivation is much higher than efficacy of plasminogen activation. The review also debates the possibility of using Pla as a molecular target for prophylaxis and treatment of plague.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Wastewaters of {{the wood}} {{processing}} into groundwood are characterized by increased concentrations of organic contaminants (oils, resin acid, lignin (polymeric phenols), lignin salts (sulphonates, phenoxides), tannins, triglycerides, waxes, free long-chained fatty acids and other). Organic compounds which appear as colour come from extracted lignin, tannins and resin acids. Wood processing effluents are often resistant to degradation using biological methods, and are not removed effectively by conventional physicochemical treatment methods, such as coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and ozonation. For processing of those effluents it is often necessary to link different methods of purification, {{and one of the}} alternative methods is sorption. In this work the removal of organic pollutants was tested from effluent of the production of mechanically milled groundwood by using sorption to clinoptilolite tuff and to samples of tuff which were modified using the solutions of cationic surfactant- hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) of different concentrations. The sorption processes of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were researched on the clinoptilolite tuff from Turkey (Aegean Region Turkey, Bigadic), which contains more than 70 % of clinoptilolite, and in smaller mass fraction quartz and opal-CT are present. The tested effluent has the following characteristics: chemical oxygen demand (COD) : 13200 mg dm- 3, total organic carbon (TOC) : 3010 mg dm - 3, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) : 470 mg dm- 3, colour: 681 Pt Co, turbidity: 799 NTU, pH 4. 8. All testing was done without the adjustment of pH. The conventional process of pre-processing of effluent by coagulation with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O) was tested and the application ofHDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff with the intention of further decrease in organic burden of wastewater. In the Fig. 1 A the results of the HDTMA uptake onto clinoptilolite tuff are shown, and in Fig. 1 B the pertaining zeta potentials of the samples are shown. HDTMA cations were essentially quantitatively taken up by the clinoptilolite tuff up to loading level of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 -(Fig. 1 A). The results of the zeta potential measurements show that the negative surface charge changed to positive after modification with surfactant solutions (Fig. 1 B). HDTMA cations form a stable organophilic coating on the clinoptilolite surface, and above surfactant loading level of 0. 110 mmol g - 1 (isoelectric point), a second layer of HDTMA+ cations reverses the surface charge into positive. The optimal mass concentration of coagulant AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O for the tested wastewater is γ = 0. 8 g dm - 1 (Figs. 2 A and 2 B). Zeta potential of the solution above sediment received by coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration γ= 0. 8 g dm - 3 is ζ= - 3. 92 mV. The efficiency of removing the turbidity (Table 1) and COD is η = 67 % (from 799 to 263 NTU) and 54 % (from 13 200 to 6 040 mg dm - 3). The efficiency of removing solved organic carbon and colour is significantlylesser: 22. 7 % (from 3010 to 2322 mg dm- 3) and η = 33. 0 % (from 681 to 457 Pt Co). By processing the solutions received after coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration of 0. 8 g dm - 3, with natural tuff and organo-zeolites whose loading are: 0. 074; 0. 123; 0. 164 and 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, TOC was decreased from γ= 2322 mg dm- 3 to the following: γ= 2042, 1976, 1945, 1907 and 1821 mg dm - 3 and was sorbed: q = 28. 0; 34. 6; 37. 7; 41. 5; and 50. 1 mg g - 1 TOC (Fig. 3 A). Using the sample of organo-zeolite with loading of 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, the efficiency of removing the organic carbon was improved from η= 22. 7 % to 40. 0 %. The efficiency of discolouring the tested solutions also increases with the change of the surface charge of organo-zeolites from negative to positive(Fig. 3 B). The efficiency of removing the colour by using the natural tuff was improved from η= 33. 0 % to η = 40. 0 %, and by using the organo-zeolite with loading of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA to η= 76. 3 %. In order for the biodegradation of the processes effluents to be tested, the rations of BOD 5 /COD are predetermined (Figs. 4 A and 4 B). According to literature data, the good value of biodegradation is the ratio of BOD 5 /COD higher than 0. 5. The tested effluent was characterized as having particularly poor biodegradation. After processing the effluent with coagulation and organo-zeolite (0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA), the biodegradation has not shown significant improvement. It could be concluded that HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff can be used for discolouring and purification of the examined wastewater in one part of wastewater treatment which combines and some other <b>physicochemical</b> and/or biological <b>purification</b> methods...|$|R

Zbog toga je za obradu takvih efluenata često potrebno integrirati različite dostupne tehnološke procese i metode pročišćavanja. Jedna od alternativnih metoda je sorpcija onečišćavača na modificiranu hidrofilnu ili hidrofobnu vanjsku mineralnu površinu. Ovaj rad obuhvaća konvencionalni proces predobrade koagulacijom s aluminijevim kloridom heksahidratom, AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O i primjenu HDTMA-Br [C 16 H 33 (CH 3) 3 N+ Br-] modificiranog klinoptilolitnog tufa kao sorbensa za poboljšanje učinkovitosti pročišćavanja efluenta proizvodnje drvenjače. Otpadna voda tretirana je uzorcima klinoptilolitnog tufa opterećenih s L = 0, 074 do 0, 204 mmol g- 1 HDTMA. Od ispitivanih modificiranih uzoraka u reakciji s otpadnom vodom, najdjelotvornijim se pokazao uzorak organo- zeolita koji je maksimalno opterećen heksadeciltrimetilamonijevim kationima u obliku dvosloja. Dodatak modificiranog uzorka klinoptilolitnog tufa s masenim udjelom od w = 1, 0 % u filtrat dobiven nakon procesa koagulacije, poboljšao je učinkovitost smanjenja kemijske potrošnje kisika od 54, 0 % na 65, 0 %, ukupnog organskog ugljika od 23, 0 % na 40, 0 % te boje od 33, 0 % na 77, 0 %. HDTMA-modificirani klinoptilolitni tuf može se upotrijebiti za obezbojenje i pročišćavanje ispitivane otpadne vode u složenom tehnološkom postupku koji uključuje i neke druge fizikalno-kemijske i/ili biološke metode pročišćavanja.
