2500|$|In 1970 she {{proposed}} a similar idea {{to the same}} gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramović would {{stand in front of}} the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. [...] "From the right <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> skirt I take a gun. From the left <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. I pull the trigger." [...] The performance had two possible outcomes.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} {{not a word}} to Oscar's protestations--I only searched vehemently in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress.|$|E
60|$|I drew a skin {{bag from}} the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat, and poured some out upon the table, which he {{examined}} carefully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She did,' rejoined Bob. 'She said I {{had kept}} the parcel so long in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> corduroys, that the apple was unpleasantly warm.' ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} I was washing out the block house, and then washing up the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing {{stronger}} and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, {{and no one}} then observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat with biscuit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Balfour," [...] replied Alan, [...] "by {{all that}} I could hear, {{there were two}} ways of it: either ye liked David and would pay to get him back; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him, and would pay for us to keep him. It seems it's not the first; well then, it's the second; and blithe am I to ken it, for {{it should be a}} pretty penny in my pocket and the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hooked his {{forefinger}} in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> army-shirt, {{led me to}} one side, {{and breathed}} in my ear impressively these words: ...|$|E
6000|$|... [11] In the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> receptacle-book I find {{a list of}} {{suggested}} {{and rejected}} names for this volume, or parts of it--such as the following: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Vyner, grave as a judge, {{held up his}} disgraceful hands. [...] "They are in a case in {{the inside}} <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat," [...] he said, calmly.|$|E
60|$|The drawers of the {{writing-desk}} were locked. Its revolving top {{was also}} locked. I {{could see no}} indications of the keys, and there were none in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> trousers. I shuffled back at once to the bedroom, {{and went through the}} dress suit, and afterwards the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> all the garments I could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined that burglars had been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not only were there no keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of paper--save only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner.|$|R
60|$|All the rages I {{had ever}} been in {{before in my life}} were as nothing {{compared}} with the rage that devoured me when I had read that fourth page of Mrs. Finch's letter. Nugent had got the better <b>of</b> me and <b>my</b> precautions! Nugent had robbed his brother of Lucilla, in the vilest manner, with perfect impunity! I cast all feminine restraints to the winds. I sat down with my legs anyhow, like a man. I rammed my hands into the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dressing-gown. Did I cry? A word in your ear--and let it go no farther. I swore.|$|R
60|$|The hour of dejeuner has arrived. I entreat {{them to be}} my guests. I can run to it, you understand, {{for there}} are still in <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> plenty <b>of</b> <b>my</b> uncle's francs. They consent. I am in 'eaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{an inner}} <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pyjamas," [...] Norgate explained. [...] "I had them {{made with a}} sort of belt inside, at the time I was a king's messenger." ...|$|E
60|$|Reaching {{into the}} inside <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{buckskin}} vest, I turned the lining out. A star-shaped, bright, silver object flashed as I shoved it, pocket and all, under Jim's hard eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where do {{you keep}} your money?" [...] he asked me, and I {{told him that the}} greater part of it--all but some pocket-money--was stowed away in an inside <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> vest.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{always were}} greedy," [...] she commented. [...] "Just before I turned the hose on you, I {{remember}} you had made yourself thoroughly disliked by <b>pocketing</b> a piece <b>of</b> <b>my</b> birthday cake." ...|$|R
60|$|I went, {{creeping}} back to {{our place}} by the chests for that purpose, and as I was coming away an idea struck me. We had not thought much of the diamonds for the last twenty-four hours or so; indeed, {{the very idea of}} diamonds was nauseous, seeing what they had entailed upon us; but, reflected I, I may as well pocket some in case we ever should get out of this ghastly hole. So I just put my fist into the first chest and filled all the available <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old shooting-coat and trousers, topping up--this was a happy thought--with a few handfuls of big ones from the third chest. Also, by an afterthought, I stuffed Foulata's basket, which, except for one water-gourd and a little biltong, was empty now, with great quantities of the stones.|$|R
60|$|Then I landed and {{stepping}} into the reeds, pulled off my wet shirt and pants, which I stuffed away into the big <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shooting coat, for I {{did not want to}} lose them, and put on the dry things that, although scratchy, were quite good enough clothing in that warm climate. After this I treated myself to a good sup of brandy from the flask, and ate some food which I seemed to require. Then I told them the story, and cutting short their demonstrations of wonder and admiration, bade them place the Holy Flower in the canoe and get in themselves. Next with the help of Hans who poked out his fingers through the skin of the gorilla's arms, I carefully re-loaded the rifle, setting the last cap on the nipple. This done, I joined them in the canoe, taking my seat in the prow and bidding Brother John and Stephen paddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Groome, sir," [...] he pronounced, [...] "you are a wizard! You {{must have}} seen right through into the breast <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat. Allow me to read {{you a couple of}} letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{arrived at}} six o'clock, and went {{straight}} into the inner <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat; {{it has not been}} out of my possession for a single second. Even while I talk to you I can feel it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{arrived at}} six o'clock," [...] the {{ambassador}} declared. [...] "It went {{straight into the}} inner <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat; {{it has not been}} out of my possession for a single second. Even whilst I talk to you I can feel it." ...|$|E
60|$|While he spoke, so {{profound}} was the stillness {{that one might}} have heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?--must I say that I felt all {{the horrors of the}} damned? Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte, and, in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.|$|R
5000|$|Sue {{led the way}} {{upstairs to}} her bedroom, and {{directing}} me to help her we pulled off the coverings of a bed that was dainty enough to be the resting-place of a fairy. We then rolled back the upper mattress and I began to unload the yellow double eagles. The breast and tail <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat were filled with the handsome coins…and while I was thus engaged the beautiful lady, standing {{on the opposite side}} of the bed, was engaged in spreading them over the lower mattress. We then replaced the upper mattress, and I could not help but laugh when I realized the extraordinary situation in which I found myself, assisting a strange lady in the making-up of her bed! Mrs. King was laughing, too, but for a different reason. Her cause of merriment was so good that she could not keep it to herself. Everybody knew that Mr. Wagner had paid ten thousand dollars to keep from being arrested…and Mrs. King’s joke was that the provost marshal, who had scared Mr. Wagner out of the money, and the commanding general, were both present among her guests downstairs.|$|R
60|$|With {{a sigh of}} {{disappointment}} {{we made our way}} back, and next day started for Loo. And yet it was really very ungrateful of us to be disappointed; for, as the reader will remember, by a lucky thought, I had taken the precaution to fill the wide <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old shooting coat and trousers with gems before we left our prison-house, also Foulata's basket, which held twice as many more, notwithstanding that the water bottle had occupied some of its space. A good many of these fell out in the course of our roll {{down the side of the}} pit, including several of the big ones, which I had crammed in on the top in my coat pockets. But, comparatively speaking, an enormous quantity still remained, including ninety-three large stones ranging from over two hundred to seventy carats in weight. My old shooting coat and the basket still held sufficient treasure to make us all, if not millionaires as the term is understood in America, at least exceedingly wealthy men, and yet to keep enough stones each to make the three finest sets of gems in Europe. So we had not done so badly.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, we lost no time {{in getting}} away from the tool house. We walked side by side, I with the pistol in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> jacket, and Dick with the lantern held aloft, that we might see to make rapid {{progress}} over the unaccustomed road.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour I was ready for the journey, spurred and booted, with my rapier at my side, and in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> haut-de­chausses a purse {{containing}} some fifty pistoles--best part of which I had won from Vilmorin at lansquenet some nights before, and which moderate sum represented all the moneys that I possessed.|$|E
6000|$|... "What to do {{with the}} real thing worried me no end. Finally I opened it out flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it between two of the {{advertisement}} pages of a magazine. I stuck the two pages together round the edge with some gum off an envelope. I carried the magazine carelessly stuffed into the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ulster.|$|E
40|$|For years I dragged around {{poems in}} the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> white coat, {{pressing}} {{them into the}} hands of unsuspecting medical students and residents. As an attending physician at a teaching hospital in New York City, my job was to supervise the medical students and residents. I had to ensure that our patients received good medical care and that our doctors in training were learn-ing {{the ins and outs of}} inpatient and outpatient medicine. But medical training is a stressful time. Conventional wisdom as well as a growing body of literature [1 – 3] suggests it is a critical component of the hardening of character, contributing to burnout, cynicism, brusqueness, and all the unappetizing traits we’ve come to hate in doc-tors. The humanities were one of those things that was thought might smooth some of the rough edges of training, humanizing—as the word itself suggests—our otherwise brutish selves. American medical schools were giving at least lip service to the ideal of the well-rounded doctor, though not much was actually transpiring on the ground. Nobody was ceding academic territory from the basic sciences or clinical training to engage in the development of this much-lauded ideal. Anyone foraying in this arena was pretty much left to squeeze it in on his or her own time...|$|R
60|$|It was doubtless {{that same}} sister {{who told me}} not to sulk when my mother lay {{thinking}} of him, but to try instead to get her to talk about him. I did not see how this could make her the merry mother she used to be, but I was told that if I could not do it nobody could, and this made me eager to begin. At first, they say, I was often jealous, stopping her fond memories with the cry, ‘Do you mind nothing about me?’ but that did not last; its place was taken by an intense desire (again, I think, my sister must have breathed it into life) to become so like him that even my mother should not see the difference, and many and artful were the questions I put to that end. Then I practised in secret, but after a whole week had passed I was still rather like myself. He had such a cheery way of whistling, she had told me, it had always brightened her at her work to hear him whistling, and when he whistled he stood with his legs apart, and his hands in the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his knickerbockers. I decided to trust to this, so one day after I had learned his whistle (every boy of enterprise invents a whistle of his own) from boys who had been his comrades, I secretly put on a suit of his clothes, dark grey they were, with little spots, and they fitted me many years afterwards, and thus disguised I slipped, unknown to the others, into my mother’s room. Quaking, I doubt not, yet so pleased, I stood still until she saw me, and then—how it must have hurt her! ‘Listen!’ I cried in a glow of triumph, and I stretched my legs wide apart and plunged my hands into the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> knickerbockers, and began to whistle.|$|R
6000|$|I {{tried to}} make amends for my forgetfulness--even to the extent <b>of</b> <b>pocketing</b> <b>my</b> pride, and {{commissioning}} Fleming to purchase for me (out of the little stock of money left me by Fanny) a cradle, as a wedding present for Pollie, and a chest of tools for her husband. Oddly enough, she did not sniff at this request. Her green eyes almost sparkled. At the very word, wedding, she seemed to revive into a new woman. And Pollie completely forgave me:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{send you}} {{herewith}} some books belonging to you. A thousand {{thanks for the}} [...] "Hermit." [...] He took my fancy mightily when I first {{saw him in the}} [...] "Illuminated;" [...] and I have stowed him away in the left-hand breast <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> travelling coat, that we may hold pleasant converse together on the Rhine. You see what confidence I have in him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Dan; but be {{a little}} careful with the water, {{you seem to be}} pretty near {{drowning}} me as it is. Just wipe my face and hair, and get the handkerchief from the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> jacket, and open the shirt collar and put the handkerchief inside round my neck. Then see how the battle is going on. The roar seems louder than ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, Captain," [...] John Wilkes said, that day, at dinner, [...] "I {{have just}} bethought me of this letter, {{that was given}} me by the sailor who brought Cyril here. It is for you, from young Lord Oliphant. It has clean gone {{out of my mind}} till now. I put it in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> doublet, and have {{forgotten}} it ever since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{offered me}} twenty {{thousand}} pounds," [...] she went on, [...] "for the packet in your <b>pocket.</b> Think <b>of</b> that, <b>my</b> friend. It {{would be a}} start in life, would it not? I am an extravagant woman. Even if I would, I dared not think of a poor man. But twenty thousand pounds is sufficient. When I reach London, I am going to a flat which {{has been waiting for}} me for weeks--15, Dover Street. If you bring that packet to me instead of taking it to the Austrian Embassy, there will be twenty thousand pounds and--" ...|$|R
5000|$|From Rugby, Hawtrey went {{briefly to}} a crammer in London, {{to study for}} a career in the army, but soon {{abandoned}} the idea. He worked as a private tutor from 1876 to 1879 and then he began his theatrical career. It started badly: he broke his collar-bone while playing football and had to withdraw from the cast before the opening night. In February 1881 he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, but withdrew in October, having been cast in the supporting role of Edward Langton in F. C. Burnand's The Colonel at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, London. Uncertain of success, he temporarily adopted the stage name Charles Bankes. He was well received in the play, and was given valuable lessons in stagecraft from the producer: He taught me a great many elementary rules which were most helpful - such as the actions <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hands and arms, walking on the stage, holding myself as easily as I could, and above all things he would never let me put my hands in <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> <b>Of</b> course <b>my</b> hands always felt like two great hams and I never knew what to do with them, but I found that eventually I forgot all about them and then they behaved naturally! ...|$|R
60|$|He then related that, {{the morning}} on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and {{confined}} to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn {{on the night of}} the murder, had discovered in her <b>pocket</b> the picture <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.|$|R
