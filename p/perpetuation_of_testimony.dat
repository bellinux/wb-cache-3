5000|$|In 1765 William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, {{brought against}} James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and the {{corporation}} of Carlisle bills in chancery for the <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>testimony,</b> believing {{that he was}} the owner of a fishery on the River Eden in right of the socage manor of Carlisle but because of the type of fishing carried on by the defendants it had become useless. However Lonsdale's team discovered in the original grant from William III to the first Duke of Portland that the socage manor of Carlisle and the forest of Inglewood had been expressly omitted in the grant. But an Act from the reign of James I had laid down that lands in undisturbed possession of over sixty years no one could challenge a title except the Crown. In 1767 Lonsdale therefore successfully petitioned the Treasury for a grant of Crown interest in the two properties [...] "for three lives, on such terms as to their lordships should seem meet". Portland's allies claimed no land was safe if the legal maxim Nullum tempus occurrit regi ("No time runs against the king") was to be implemented so therefore in February 1767 Sir George Savile introduced a Bill to abrogate the legal maximum and to abolish Lonsdale's rights. This was defeated by 134 votes to 114. In 1768 another Bill was introduced, this time including a clause which excluded all Crown grants made before 1 January 1769 from the operation of the Bill unless the grantees prosecuted their claims within one year. With the passing of this Act Lonsdale at once filed a bill against Portland and evicted three hundred tenants. However the Court of Exchequer ruled against Lonsdale {{on the grounds that the}} grant was unlawful under the provisions of the Crown Lands Act 1702 because of the insufficiency of the rent reserved by the Crown. Portland's title to the socage manor of Carlisle and Inglewood forest was never tried and he eventually sold the properties to the Duke of Devonshire in 1787.|$|E
50|$|Either {{party may}} seek {{discovery}} on any topic that {{is relevant to}} the subject matter involved in the pending action, irrespective of whether the discovered materials would be admissible at trial, or even whether they are calculated to lead to admissible information. Deadlines to respond to discovery requests are usually 21 days. Parties may propound a maximum of 30 interrogatories on one another (including subparts), {{but there is no}} set limit on the number of depositions that can be taken, or the number of times a single witness may be deposed. An attorney may also issue a subpoena duces tecum. Where a witness to a case is about to leave the jurisdiction, a deposition of that witness may be taken within 21 days of filing a case; otherwise, a court order would be required to take early depositions. Alternately a party could seek <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> the witness pursuant to a verified petition filed in the jurisdiction in which the defendant resides.|$|R

40|$|The relay {{hypothesis}} [R. Nayak, S. Mitra-Kaushik, M. S. Shaila, <b>Perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> immunological memory: a relay hypothesis, Immunology 102 (2001) 387 - 395] was earlier {{proposed to}} explain <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> immunological memory without requiring long lived memory cells or persisting antigen. This hypothesis envisaged cycles of interaction and proliferation of complementary idiotypic B cells (Burnet cells) and anti-idiotypic B cells (Jerne cells) {{as the primary}} reason for <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> immunological memory. The presence of pepti-domimics of antigen in anti-idiotypic antibody and their presentation to antigen specific T cells was postulated to be primary reason for <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> T cell memory. Using a viral hemagglutinin as a model, in this work, we demonstrate the presence of peptidomimics in the variable region of ail anti-idiotypic antibody capable of functionally mimicking the antigen derived peptides. A CD 8 (+) CTL clone was generated against the hemagglutinin protein which specifically responds to either peptidomimic synthesizing cells or peptidomimic pulsed antigen presenting cells. Thus, it appears reasonable that a population of activated antigen specific T cells is maintained in the body by presentation of peptidomimic through Jerne cells and other antigen presenting cells long after immunization.
