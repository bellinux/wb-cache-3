5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's <b>Plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Room</b> at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E
5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E

Alternatively, headset controls {{can be used to}} pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E
5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E

However, when Mary's water breaks, he forces them {{to stay in the}} barn. Mary successfully gives birth to the baby, and the three wise men, along with the two shepherds (Lenny and Carl) come to see Jesus. Joseph is upset because he is not Jesus's father, and when he drinks some wine, the baby turns it into water.|$|R

25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E
25|$|Griffith Stadium hosted {{numerous}} football events {{before the}} Redskins moved there in 1937. It {{was the home}} of Georgetown Hoyas football from 1921 until 1950, George Washington Colonials football in the 1930s and 1940s, and Maryland Terrapins football in 1948. The stadium was the host of an annual Thanksgiving Day game between Howard and Lincoln Universities, {{which was one of}} the most popular events during the year, drawing many African American alumni and fans from the surrounding neighborhoods. One major reason for the stadium's early-1920s expansion was that Clark Griffith had envisioned the stadium hosting the annual Army–Navy football game, played every December. Temporary seats were often placed in right field for football games at Griffith, with the gridiron stretching from left field to the first base line. The exceptional distance from home to the left-field area allowed <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for the football field.|$|E
25|$|Other castles {{begun in}} the 11th century were built on {{elevated}} sites that {{took advantage of the}} steep slopes for defense, rather than on moats. The central tower became the final defensive layer of the castle, while the main domestic quarters were built against the walls around the perimeter, allowing <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for a variety of functions. Conisborough Castle is an English example, with the shell keep rising on the earlier motte, and a wall with the residential and service quarters built into it, enclosing the bailey. The ruins within the bailey show remains of a great hall with central fireplace, a kitchen and a two storeyed residential block with adjacent latrines. The keep itself contains a room for the lord, complete with a hooded fireplace, while a small vaulted chapel was built into the thick outer wall of the keep. Ludlow Castle, Shropshire {{begun in the}} 11th century, was lived in by a number of members of the Tudor royal family and had both its fortifications and living quarters improved over several centuries.|$|E

I think the situation itself almost the finest in Paris; and the children will have a window from which to look on the busy life outside.|$|R
5000|$|Nowadays, {{tourism is}} Zoutelande's most {{important}} source of existence. Zoutelande, together with the beach of Dishoek and Westkapelle, are often called [...] "Zeeland's Rivièra", after the famous south-coast of France. It is one of Zeeland's most-visited coasts, {{and one of the}} few places in the Netherlands where the beach faces south. <b>Plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms,</b> studios, bungalows and apartments are available to thousands of visitors every summer; most of the tourists are of German origin, although other nationalities are also widely represented. The remaining agriculture in the area benefits of the demand for accommodation in the form of mini-campings. Bicycle-rental, beachfront establishments, hotels, B&Bs, shops and a nice boulevard are all to be found in and around the village.|$|R
25|$|At 1:50 pm, {{the troops}} of A/27/9 AIB {{set out for}} the town. Thirty minutes later, Engemen led the 17 tanks of A/14/9 AIB forward. The troops and tanks arrived {{at about the same time}} and {{advanced}} quickly through Remagen against light resistance. The Germans relied for local defense on Volksturm, citizens who were conscripted close to their homes in the belief that they would defend their towns and villages. German defensive policy did not include planning for defending rear areas in depth. There were no antitank ditches or mines, barbed wire, or trenches on the route to Remagen. The few defensive obstacles that had been constructed were too weak to block tanks or had been placed in open terrain, and the roadblocks they had built usually allowed <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for vehicles to pass. The only defense that slowed the Americans down was a machine gun manned by infantry over the town square, which two of the Pershings quickly dispatched. Relatively unmolested, the Americans arrived in strength at the western end of the bridge and the tanks began covering the bridge and the east shore with tank rounds, destroying a locomotive attached to a string of freight cars on the rail line parallel to the river.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1972, Dylan {{protested the}} move to deport John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who {{had been convicted of}} {{possessing}} cannabis, by sending a letter to the U.S. Immigration Service, in part: [...] "Hurray for John & Yoko.

60|$|We {{could have}} got a {{beautiful}} apartment in the Rue Faubourg St. Honoré for a very little more, most elegantly furnished; but {{the greater part of}} it was on a courtyard, and it would never have done for the children. This, that I have taken for six months, is seven hundred francs per month, and twenty more for the concierge. What you have to expect is a regular French residence, which a little habitation will make pretty and comfortable, with nothing showy in it, but with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms,</b> and with that wonderful street in which the Barrière de l'Étoile stands outside. The amount <b>of</b> <b>rooms</b> is the great thing, and I believe it to be the place best suited for us, at a not unreasonable price in Paris.|$|R

500|$|Shau {{enjoyed the}} game's presentation, praising {{the music and}} visuals, but wished {{that there had been}} a larger visual variety for the levels. Joynt, however, found the {{graphics}} unimpressive, while noting that they were unimportant compared to the gameplay. DeVries thought the animations were underwhelming for a Super Famicom game, noting situations such as lighting undead soldiers on fire as examples of when further visual spectacle would have added to the experience. Gann said that the graphics were [...] "simple and functional" [...] and, while improved in the Nintendo DS version, still had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for improvement; he also wished that there had been character art accompanying the dialogue boxes, and more cutscenes. He called the music and sound effects excellent, calling the sound impressive and fitting, causing him to start searching for all soundtrack releases from the Mystery Dungeon series.|$|E
500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, {{something that they}} said was missing in the previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was still <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for growth, the episode gave {{a better understanding of}} Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E

Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music used [...] "Stephen" [...] {{as an example}} of the songs on Animal that exemplified the singer's vocals, saying it had [...] "beautiful layered a cappella harmonies. Sure, it tumbles into clunky pop straight afterwards, but then, that also seems to be what she does: beautiful things are bashed against ugly things, pretty melodies ruined by silly noises, emotional lyrics stuffed with buzzwords." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote of the album that [...] "in a post–'Birthday Sex' pop landscape, there's <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for dumb if it's done well." [...] He described [...] "Stephen" [...] as [...] "an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher."

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{called the}} song a [...] "perfect kickoff to {{the career of}} Justin Bieber", noting the song had an effect of a younger Chris Brown, commended the {{production}} of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart for making the single contemporary and commercial. However Lamb criticized the song for being too [...] "generic", and that Bieber had little room to show his voice. Billboards Michael Menachem called the song [...] "a hallmark pop song that also taps into a prevalent teen hip-hop aesthetic". He also compared Bieber to Brown on the track, and said that [...] " [...] tenor brings to mind [...] vocal debut on [...] "Run It!" [...] in 2005, when he, too, was 15 and {{on the cusp of}} stardom". Unlike Lamb, Menachem said the song gave Bieber's vocals <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> to shine as he confidently breaks into the chorus. Leah Greenblat of Entertainment Weekly named the song one of the hottest songs of fall of 2009, saying that Bieber's [...] "pop-soul bonafides with this refreshingly age-appropriate chronicle of young love." ...|$|E
500|$|The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund {{was founded}} in 1972 as a {{non-profit}} organization by three lawyers, Jorge Batista, Victor Marrero, and Cesar A.

It was created as a privately funded, nonprofit and nonpartisan organization {{with the goal of}} changing discriminatory practices via advocacy and litigation. [...] It was inspired in form and purpose by the high-profile NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which Thurgood Marshall had established in 1957. [...] PRLDEF (pronounced [...] "pearl-deaf") had $300,000 of initial funding from foundations, government sources, and private corporations.

40|$|Image {{interpolation}} is {{to convert}} a low-resolution (LR) image into a high-resolution (HR) image through mathematical modeling. An accurate model usually {{leads to a}} better reconstruction quality, and the autoregressive (AR) model is a widely adopted model for image interpolation. Although {{a large amount of}} works have been done on AR models for image interpolation, there are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms</b> for improvements. In this work, we propose a robust and precise k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) searching scheme to form an accurate AR model of the local statistic. We make use of both LR and HR information obtained from a large amount of training data, in order to form a coherent soft-decision estimation of both AR parameters and high-resolution pixels.
