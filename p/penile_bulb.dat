40|$|Abstract Background Prostate bed (PB) {{contouring}} is {{time consuming}} and associated with inter-observer variability. We evaluated an automated atlas-based segmentation (AABS) engine in {{its potential to}} reduce contouring time and inter-observer variability. Methods An atlas builder (AB) manually contoured the prostate bed, rectum, left femoral head (LFH), right femoral head (RFH), bladder, and <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> of 75 post-prostatectomy cases to create an atlas according to the recent RTOG guidelines. 5 other Radiation Oncologists (RO) and the AABS contoured 5 new cases. A STAPLE contour {{for each of the}} 5 patients was generated. All contours were anonymized and sent back to the 5 RO to be edited as clinically necessary. All contouring times were recorded. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to evaluate the unedited- and edited- AABS and inter-observer variability among the RO. Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests and a Pearson correlation were performed. ANOVA analysis using logit transformations of DSC values was calculated to assess inter-observer variability. Results The mean time for manual contours and AABS was 17. 5 - and 14. 1 minutes respectively (p = 0. 003). The DSC results (mean, SD) for the comparison of the unedited-AABS versus STAPLE contours for the PB (0. 48, 0. 17), bladder (0. 67, 0. 19), LFH (0. 92, 0. 01), RFH (0. 92, 0. 01), <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> (0. 33, 0. 25) and rectum (0. 59, 0. 11). The DSC results (mean, SD) for the comparison of the edited-AABS versus STAPLE contours for the PB (0. 67, 0. 19), bladder (0. 88, 0. 13), LFH (0. 93, 0. 01), RFH (0. 92, 0. 01), <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> (0. 54, 0. 21) and rectum (0. 78, 0. 12). The DSC results (mean, SD) for the comparison of the edited-AABS versus the expert panel for the PB (0. 47, 0. 16), bladder (0. 67, 0. 18), LFH (0. 83, 0. 18), RFH (0. 83, 0. 17), <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> (0. 31, 0. 23) and rectum (0. 58, 0. 09). The DSC results (mean, SD) for the comparison of the STAPLE contours and the 5 RO are PB (0. 78, 0. 15), bladder (0. 96, 0. 02), left femoral head (0. 87, 0. 19), right femoral head (0. 87, 0. 19), <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> (0. 70, 0. 17) and the rectum (0. 89, 0. 06). The ANOVA analysis suggests inter-observer variability among {{at least one of the}} 5 RO (p value = 0. 002). Conclusion The AABS tool results in a time savings, and when used to generate auto-contours for the femoral heads, bladder and rectum had superior to good spatial overlap. However, the generated auto-contours for the prostate bed and <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> need improvement. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether alternative HDR prostate brachytherapy catheter patterns {{can result in}} improved dose distributions while providing better access and reducing trauma. Methods: Prostate HDR brachytherapy uses a grid of parallel needle positions to guide the catheter insertion. This geometry does not easily allow the physician to avoid piercing the critical structures near the <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> nor does it provide position flexibility {{in the case of}} pubic arch interference. On CT data from ten previously-treated patients new catheters were digitized following three catheter patterns: conical, bi-conical, and fireworks. The conical patterns were used to accommodate a robotic delivery using a single entry point. The bi-conical and fireworks patterns were specifically designed to avoid the critical structures near the <b>penile</b> <b>bulb.</b> For each catheter distribution, a plan was optimized with the inverse planning algorithm, IPSA, and compared with the plan used for treatment. Irrelevant of catheter geometry, a plan must fulfill the RTOG- 0321 dose criteria for target dose coverage. Results: Thirty plans from ten patients were optimized. All non-standard patterns fulfilled the RTOG criteria when the clinical plan did. In some cases, the dose distribution was improved by better sparing the organs-at-risk. Conclusion: Alternative catheter patterns can provide the physician with additional ways to treat patients previously considered unsuited for brachytherapy treatment (pubic arch interference) and facilitate robotic guidance of catheter insertion. In addition, alternative catheter patterns may decrease toxicity by avoidance of the critical structures near the <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> while still fulfilling the RTOG criteria.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{prostate}} volume delineated on MRI {{is smaller}} than on CT. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the influence of MRI- vs. CT-based prostate delineation using multiple observers on the dose to the target and organs at risk during external beam radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MRI scans of the pelvic region were made of 18 patients and matched three-dimensionally on the bony anatomy. Three observers delineated the prostate using both modalities. A fourth observer delineated the rectal wall and the bulb of the penis. The planning treatment volume (PTV) was generated from the delineated prostates with a margin of 10 mm in three-dimensions. A three-field treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 78 Gy to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements point was automatically generated from each PTV. Dose-volume histograms were calculated of all PTVs, rectal walls, and <b>penile</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The equivalent uniform dose was calculated for the rectal wall using a volume exponent (n = 0. 12). RESULTS: The equivalent uniform dose of the CT rectal wall in plans based on the CT-delineated prostate was, on average, 5. 1 Gy (SEM 0. 5) greater than in the plans based on the MRI-delineated prostate. For the MRI rectal wall, this difference was 3. 6 Gy (SEM 0. 4). Allowing for the same equivalent uniform dose to the CT rectal wall, the prescribed dose to the PTV could be raised from 78 to 85 Gy when using the MRI-delineated prostate for treatment planning. The mean dose to the bulb of the penis was 11. 6 Gy (SEM 1. 8) lower for plans based on the MRI-delineated prostate. The mean coverage (volume of the PTV receiving > or = 95 % of the prescribed dose) was 99. 9 % for both modalities. The interobserver coverage (coverage of the PTV by a treatment plan designed for the PTV delineated by another observer in the same modality) was 97 % for both modalities. The MRI rectum was significantly more ventrally localized than the CT rectum, probably because of the rounded tabletop and no knee support on the MRI scanner. CONCLUSIONS: The dose delivered to the rectal wall and bulb of the penis is significantly reduced with treatment plans based on the MRI-delineated prostate compared with the CT-delineated prostate, allowing a dose escalation of 2. 0 - 7. 0 Gy for the same rectal wall dose. The interobserver coverage was the same for CT and MRI delineation of the prostate. A statistically significant difference in position between the CT- and MRI-delineated rectum was observed, probably owing to a different tabletop and use of knee suppor...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Erectile {{dysfunction}} following prostate brachytherapy {{is reported}} to be related to dose received by the <b>penile</b> <b>bulb.</b> To minimise this, whilst preserving prostate dosimetry, we have developed a technique for I- 125 seed brachytherapy using both stranded seeds and loose seeds delivered with a Mick applicator, and implanted via the sagittal plane on trans-rectal ultrasound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post-implant dosimetry and potency rates were compared in 120 potent patients. In Group 1, 60 patients were treated using a conventional technique of seeds implanted in a modified-uniform distribution. From January 2005, a novel technique was developed using stranded seeds peripherally and centrally distributed loose seeds implanted via a Mick applicator (Group 2). The latter technique allows greater flexibility when implanting the seeds at the apex. Each patient was prescribed a minimum peripheral dose of 145 Gy. No patients received external beam radiotherapy or hormone treatment. There {{was no significant difference in}} age or pre-implant potency score (mean IIEF- 5 score 22. 4 vs. 22. 6, p= 0. 074) between the two groups. RESULTS: The new technique delivers lower <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> doses (D(25) as %mPD - Group 1 : 61. 2 +/- 35. 7, Group 2 : 29. 7 +/- 16. 0, p< 0. 0001; D(50) as %mPD - Group 1 : 45. 8 +/- 26. 9, Group 2 : 21. 4 +/- 11. 7, p< 0. 0001) whilst improving prostate dosimetry (D(90) - Group 1 : 147 Gy+/- 21. 1, Group 2 : 155 Gy+/- 16. 7, p= 0. 03). At 2 years, the potency rate was also improved: Group 1 : 61. 7 %; Group 2 : 83. 3 % (p= 0. 008). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the novel brachytherapy technique using both peripheral stranded seeds and central loose seeds delivered via a Mick applicator results in a lower <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> dose whilst improving prostate dosimetry, and may achieve higher potency rates...|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the integral dose (ID) received by normal tissue from intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five radiation treatment plans, including MRT using a conventional linac with both 6 (6 MV-IMRT) and 20 MV (20 MV-IMRT) as well as 3 DCRT using 6 (6 MV- 3 DCRT) and 20 MV (20 MV- 3 DCRT), and IMRT using tomotherapy (6 MV) (Tomo-IMRT), were created for five patients with localized prostate cancer. The ID (mean dose X tissue volume) received by normal tissue (NTID) was calculated from dose-volume histograms. Results: 6 MV-IMRT resulted in 5. 0 % lower NTID than 6 MV- 3 DCRT; 20 MV beam plans resulted in 7. 7 - 11. 2 % lower NTID than 6 MV- 3 DCRT. Tomo-IMRT NTID was comparable to 6 MV-IMRT. Compared to 6 MV- 3 DCRT, 6 MV-IMRT reduced IDs to the rectal wall and <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> by 6. 1 % and 2. 7 %, respectively. Tomo-IMRT further reduced these IDs by 11. 9 % and 16. 5 %, respectively. 20 MV did not reduce IDs to those structures. Conclusions: The difference of NTID between 3 DCRT and IMRT is small. 20 MV plans somewhat reduced NTID compared to 6 MV plans.

Note to Practitioners Brachytherapy treats cancer by delivering radioactive sources proximal to cancer sites via needles. Current methods use standardized fixed mechanical templates that force needles into parallel arrangements that may prevent needles from reaching prostate volumes blocked by the pubic arch and often require needles to puncture sensitive organs. Skew-line (non-parallel) arrangements of needles can reach targets under the pubic arch and avoid sensitive organs. However these arrangements cannot be achieved with standard templates, motivating the use of automation. We present a human-centered automation system that integrates state-of-the...|$|E

40|$|Conventional beam {{orientation}} optimization (BOO) algorithms for IMRT {{assume that}} {{the same set of}} beam angles is used for all treatment fractions. In this paper we present a BOO formulation based on group sparsity that simultaneously optimizes non-coplanar beam angles for all fractions, yielding a fraction-variant (FV) treatment plan. Beam angles are selected by solving a multi-fraction FMO problem involving 500 - 700 candidate beams per fraction, with an additional group sparsity term that encourages most candidate beams to be inactive. The optimization problem is solved using the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm. Our FV BOO algorithm is used to create non-coplanar, five-fraction treatment plans for prostate and lung cases, as well as a non-coplanar 30 -fraction plan for a head and neck case. A homogeneous PTV dose coverage is maintained in all fractions. The treatment plans are compared with fraction-invariant plans that use a fixed set of beam angles for all fractions. The FV plans reduced mean and max OAR dose on average by 3. 3 % and 3. 7 % of the prescription dose, respectively. Notably, mean OAR dose was reduced by 14. 3 % of prescription dose (rectum), 11. 6 % (<b>penile</b> <b>bulb),</b> 10. 7 % (seminal vesicle), 5. 5 % (right femur), 3. 5 % (bladder), 4. 0 % (normal left lung), 15. 5 % (cochleas), and 5. 2 % (chiasm). Max OAR dose was reduced by 14. 9 % of prescription dose (right femur), 8. 2 % (<b>penile</b> <b>bulb),</b> 12. 7 % (prox. bronchus), 4. 1 % (normal left lung), 15. 2 % (cochleas), 10. 1 % (orbits), 9. 1 % (chiasm), 8. 7 % (brainstem), and 7. 1 % (parotids). Meanwhile, PTV homogeneity defined as D 95 /D 5 improved from. 95 to. 98 (prostate case) and from. 94 to. 97 (lung case), and remained constant for the head and neck case. Moreover, the FV plans are dosimetrically similar to conventional plans that use twice as many beams per fraction.

The patients were positioned during both exams using an immobilizing device. A radiation oncologist and a radiologist delineated the prostate gland, intra-prostatic and peri-prostatic structures, and pelvic organs of interest in both CT and MRI images. The CT and MRI images were fused based on fuducial markers to accurately align the prostate. Radiation Therapy Oncology protocol RTOG 0938 was followed to meet the target volume (prostate plus margin) dose coverage requirement, and dose-volume constraints for organs at risk, including rectum, bladder, femoral heads, <b>penile</b> <b>bulb,</b> urethra, skin and NVBs.

40|$|Using {{intracellular}} recording techniques, {{two distinct}} layers of smooth muscle {{were identified in}} the rat <b>penile</b> <b>bulb.</b> The inner muscle layer (parenchyma) exhibited spontaneous action potentials, while the outer sheet (sac) was electrically quiescent. In the parenchyma, transmural stimulation initiated non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) which were abolished by NÏnitro-L-arginine (LNA) or 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ). The amplitude of IJPs was reduced by ouabain, dinitrophenol or decreasing the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) but not by several K+ channel blockers. The parenchyma also received an excitatory innervation mediated by Î±-adrenoceptors which caused a contraction that {{was not associated with}} a membrane potential change. In the sac, transmural stimulation initiated two component excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) mediated by Î±-adrenoceptors and associated action potentials. The initial component was more dramatically suppressed than the secondary component by caffeine, ryanodine or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Lowering of the extracellular chloride concentration ([Clâ]o) selectively inhibited the rapid component of EJPs, while niflumic acid was less potent. These results suggest that IJPs in the parenchyma result from the release of NO which stimulates sodium pump activity following the activation of guanylate cyclase.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{presents}} {{the steps and}} criteria involved in the series of image registrations used clinically during the planning and dose delivery of focal high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy of the prostate. Material and methods: Three imaging modalities â Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI), and Computed Tomography (CT) â were used at different steps during the process. MRSI is used for identification of dominant intraprosatic lesions (DIL). A series of rigid and nonrigid transformations were applied to the data to correct for endorectal-coil-induced deformations and for alignment with the planning CT. Mutual information was calculated as a morphing metric. An inverse planning optimization algorithm was applied to boost dose to the DIL while providing protection to the urethra, <b>penile</b> <b>bulb,</b> rectum, and bladder. Six prostate cancer patients were treated using this protocol. Results: The morphing algorithm successfully modeled the probe-induced prostatic distortion. Mutual information calculated between the morphed images and images acquired without the endorectal probe showed a significant (p = 0. 0071) increase to that calculated between the unmorphed images and images acquired without the endorectal probe. Both mutual information and visual inspection serve as effective diagnostics of image morphing. The entire procedure adds less than thirty minutes to the treatment planning.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} patient-reported health-related quality of life following proton therapy for prostate cancer in men 60 years old. METHODS: Between August 2006 and January 2010, 262 hormone-naive men 60 years old were treated with definitive proton therapy for prostate cancer. Before treatment and every 6 months after treatment, patients filled out the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires. Potency was defined as successful sexual intercourse in the prior month or an EPIC sexual summary (SS) score 60. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 24 months; 90 % of men completed follow-up EPIC forms within the last year. For EPIC urinary, bowel, and hormone subscales, the average decline from baseline to 2 years was 5 points, except for bowel function (5. 2 points). SS scores declined 12. 6 points after 2 years. Potency rates declined by 11 % from baseline at 2 years, but 94 % of men were potent with a baseline IIEF> 21, body mass index < 30, and no history of diabetes. At 2 years after treatment, only 1. 8 % of men required a pad for urge incontinence. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with a significant decline in SS score were mean <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> dose 40 cobalt Gy equivalents (P. 012) and radiation dose 80 cobalt Gy equivalents (P. 017); only diabetes {{was significantly associated with}} impotence (P. 015).

40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} single-center {{experience}} treating patients with squamous- cell {{carcinoma of the}} anal canal using helical Tomotherapy (HT) and concurrent chemotherapy (CT). Materials/Methods: From October 2007 to February 2011, 55 patients were treated with HT and concurrent CT (5 -fluorouracil/capecitabin and mitomycin) for anal squamous-cell carcinoma. All patients underwent computed- tomography-based treatment planning, with pelvic and inguinal nodes receiving 36 Gy in 1. 8 Gy/fraction. Following a planned 1 -week break, primary tumor site and involved nodes were boosted to a total dose 59. 4 Gy in 1. 8 Gy/fraction. Dose-volume histograms of several organs at risk (OAR; bladder, small intestine, rectum, femoral heads, <b>penile</b> <b>bulb,</b> external genitalia) were assessed in terms of conformal avoidance. All toxicity was scored according to the CTCAE, v. 3. 0. HT plans and treatment were implemented using the Tomotherapy, Inc. software and hardware. For dosimetric comparisons, 3 D RT and/or IMRT plans were also computed {{for some of the}} patients using the CMS planning system, for treatment with 6 - 18 MV photons and/or electrons with suitable energies from a Siemens Primus linear accelerator equipped with a multileaf collimator. Locoregional control and survival curves were compared with the log-rank test, and multivariate analysis by the Cox model. Results: With 360 -degree-of-freedom beam projection, HT has an advantage over other RT techniques (3 D or 5 -field step-and-shot IMRT). There is significant improvement over 3 D or 5 -field IMRT plans in terms of dose conformity around the PTV, and dose gradients are steeper outside the target volume, resulting in reduced doses to OARs. Using HT, acute toxicity was acceptable, and seemed to be better than historical standards. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HT combined with concurrent CT for anal cancer is effective and tolerable. Compared to 3 D RT or 5 -field step-andshot IMRT, there is better conformity around the PTV, and better OAR sparing...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE The Clarity {{system allows}} {{monitoring}} of intrafraction target organ movements in external beam radiation therapy {{of prostate cancer}} by using transperineal ultrasound. The probe positioning at the perineum {{could lead to a}} compression and shift of the <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> (PB) toward the high-dose region. Dose to the PB has been reported {{to be associated with the}} risk of posttreatment erectile dysfunction. This planning study reports on PB translations and changes in volume and dose when applying the transperineal ultrasound probe. METHODS AND MATERIALS For 10 patients treated with external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer between 2013 and 2014, a planning computed tomography scan with and without the ultrasound probe in place was acquired. The planning target volume and organs at risk including the PB were contoured in the computed tomography scan with and without the probe. Radiation therapy plans for both scenarios were calculated. In a second step, for planning with the probe in position, an additional objective for improved sparing of the PB was introduced. RESULTS The median PB volume was 5. 5 mL (range, 3. 8 - 7. 1 mL) without the probe and 3. 5 mL (range, 2. 0 - 5. 8 mL) with the probe. The median shift of the PB was 1 mm in the posterior (range, 3 mm posterior- 2 mm anterior) and 6 mm in the superior direction (range, 0 - 14 mm superior), with no relevant shift of the prostate. The median mean dose in 95 % of the PB was 34. 1 Gy (range, 6. 0 - 50. 4 Gy), 48. 3 Gy (range, 7. 2 - 56. 8 Gy), and 39. 4 Gy (range, 5. 6 - 51. 3 Gy) for plans without probe, with probe, and with probe and additional planning objective, respectively.

A prospective multi-Institute study (DUE- 01) was implemented with the aim to assess the predictive parameters of ED. Previously, an evaluation of inter-observer variations of PB contouring was mandatory in order to quantify its impact on PB dose-volume parameters by means of a dummy run exercise. Fifteen observers, from different Institutes, drew the PB on the planning CT images of ten patients; inter-observer variations were analysed in terms of PB volume variation and cranial/caudal limits. 3 DCRT treatment plans were simulated to evaluate the impact of PB contouring inter-variability on dose-volume statistics parameters. For DVH analysis the values of PB mean dose and the volume of PB receiving more than 50 Gy and 70 Gy (V 50 and V 70, respectively) were considered. Systematic differences from the average values were assessed by the Wilcoxon test. Seven observers systematically overestimated or underestimated the PB volume with deviations from the average volumes ranging between - 48 % and + 34 % (p Inter-observer contouring variability strongly impacts on DVH parameters, although standard deviations of inter-patient differences were larger than inter-observer variations: 14. 5 Gy versus 6. 8 Gy for mean PB dose, 23. 0 % versus 11. 0 % and 16. 8 % versus 9. 3 % for V 50 and V 70 respectively. In conclusion, despite the large inter-observer variation in contouring PB, a large multi-centric study may have the possibility to detect a possible correlation between PB % dose-volume parameters and ED. The impact of contouring uncertainty could be reduced by "a posteriori" contouring from a single observer or by introducing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the planning procedures and/or in improving the skill of observers through post-dummy run tutoring of those observers showing large systematic deviations from the mean. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{volumetric}} modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique, in {{the form}} of RapidArc, is widely used to treat prostate cancer. The full-single arc (f-SA) technique in RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment provides efficient treatment, but it also delivers a higher radiation dose to the rectum. This study aimed to compare the dosimetric results from the new partial-single arc (p-SA) technique with those from the f-SA technique in RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment. In this study, 10 patients with low-risk prostate cancer were selected. For each patient, two sets of RapidArc plans (f-SA and p-SA) were created in the Eclipse treatment planning system. The f-SA plan was created using one full arc, and the p-SA plan was created using planning parameters identical to those of the f-SA plan but with anterior and posterior avoidance sectors. Various dosimetric parameters of the f-SA and p-SA plans were evaluated and compared for the same target coverage and identical plan optimization parameters. The f-SA and p-SA plans showed an average difference of +/- 1 % for the doses to the planning target volume (PTV), and there were no clear differences in dose homogeneity or plan conformity. In comparison to the f-SA technique, the p-SA technique reduced the doses to the rectum by approximately 6. 1 % to 21. 2 %, to the bladder by approximately 10. 3 % to 29. 5 %, and to the <b>penile</b> <b>bulb</b> by approximately 2. 2 %. In contrast, the dose to the femoral heads, the integral dose, and the number of monitor units were higher in the p-SA plans by approximately 34. 4 %, 7. 7 %, and 9. 2 %, respectively. In conclusion, it is feasible to use the p-SA technique for RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment. For the same PTV coverage and identical plan optimization parameters, the p-SA technique is better in sparing the rectum and bladder without compromising plan conformity or target homogeneity when compared to the f-SA technique...|$|E
