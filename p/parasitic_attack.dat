Once the plant’s receptors recognizes the parasite, the plant localizes the defensive compounds to that area creating a hypersensitive response.

Furthermore, a specific response against <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> prevents the plants from wasting its energy by increasing defenses where it is not needed. [...] However, specific defensive responses only target specific parasites. If the plant lacks the ability to recognize a parasite, specific defense responses are not activated. Nonspecific defensive responses work against all parasites. These responses are active over time and are systematic, meaning that the responses are not confined to an area of the plant, but rather spread throughout the entirety of the organism.

The difficulty is not that there are too few theories of sex, the difficulty is that there are too many and none stand out.

A successful theory should confer an advantage to biparental sex over asexual reproduction without conferring an even greater advantage to triparental sex. We pose our question in the context of two leading theories of sex, the (deterministic) mutational hypothesis that sex reduces the rate at which harmful mutations accumulate, and the red queen hypothesis that sex reduces the impact of <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> by increasing genotypic variability. We show that the mutational hypothesis fails to provide an answer to the question because it implies that triparental sex dominates biparental sex, so the latter should never be observed.

Introduction: Plants like animals {{seem to be}} more subject to disease and <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> when they appear in large numbers than when found singly, and these attacks seem to increase in proportion to the increase in numbers of the plant grown. For many hundreds of years they were considered to be inevitable that they were uncontrollable as far as the hand of man was concerned. But within the last half century, beginning about the time when Paris green was found to successfully combat the Colorado potato beetle (Doryphora decemlineata Say) in America, and a few years later when a mixture of copper sulfate, milk and water was accidentally found in France to prevent downy mildew on the grape, (Peronspora viticola B. & C.), men began to believe that it might be possible, at least in a measure, to control them. Having come to this supposition they at once began experimenting that they might determine with some degree of definiteness to what extent their theory would hold good. As a result of this movement, they not only arrived at the positive conclusion that many of our most injurious insect and plant diseases may be controlled if properly treated, but also many different spraying mixtures were discovered...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{computer}} systems continue to execute malicious software that degrades the systemsâ performance and consumes network capacity by generating high volumes of unwanted traffic. Network-based detectors can effectively identify machines {{participating in the}} ongoing attacks by monitoring the traffic {{to and from the}} systems. But, network detection alone is not enough; it does not improve the operation of the Internet or the health of other machines connected to the network. We must identify malicious code running on infected systems, participating in global attack networks. This dissertation describes a robust and secure approach that identifies malware present on infected systems based on its undesirable use of network. Our approach, using virtualization, attributes malicious traffic to host-level processes responsible for the traffic. The attribution identifies on-host processes, but malware instances often exhibit parasitic behaviors to subvert the execution of benign processes. We then augment the attribution software with a host-level monitor that detects parasitic behaviors occurring at the user- and kernel-level. User-level <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> detection happens via the system-call interface because it is a non-bypassable interface for user-level processes. Due to the unavailability of one such interface inside the kernel for drivers, we create a new driver monitoring interface inside the kernel to detect parasitic attacks occurring through this interface. Our attribution software relies on a guest kernelâ s data to identify on-host processes. To allow secure attribution, we prevent illegal modifications of critical kernel data from kernel-level malware. Together, our contributions produce a unified research outcome [...] an improved malicious code identification system for user- and kernel-level malware. Ph. D.

The mechanistic basis of tolerance, which involve defensive mechanisms minimizing parasite damage after a successful <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack,</b> remains poorly explored {{in the study}} of cuckoo-host interactions. Here, we experimentally explore the possibility that the risk of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius parasitism may induce tolerance defences in magpie Pica pica hosts through plasticity in life-history traits. We predict that magpies exposed to auditory cues indicating high parasitism risk will more likely exhibit resistance and/or modify their life-history traits to minimize parasitism costs (i. e. tolerance) compared to magpies under low parasitism risk. We found that manipulating the perceived parasitism risk did not affect host resistance (i. e. rejection of parasitic eggs) nor host life-history traits. Unexpectedly, host's egg volume increased over the season in nests exposed to auditory cues of control non-harmful hoopoes Upupa epops. Our results do not provide support for inducible defences (either based on resistance or tolerance) in response to risk of parasitism in magpie hosts.

We evaluated the incidence of two mutations in the HFE gene, H 63 D and C 282 Y, in two study groups: a control blood donor group, with no indication of malaria infection, and a group constituted of malaria patients of four states of the Amazonian region. The hemoglobin polymorphisms were obtained by HPLC and classical laboratory methodologies, and the two mutations in the HFE gene were assayed by PCR-RFLP. We found a high frequency of alpha thalassemia, but {{there were no significant differences}} between blood donors and malaria patients. There were also no significant differences in the frequencies of HbA(2); however, the frequency of HbF was significantly different in individuals with malaria from Para and Rondonia. The mean number of reticulocytes was significantly reduced in the blood donors from the northern region, suggesting an adaptive strategy of these populations to <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> by Plasmodium. Most individuals were heterozygous for the H 63 D allele of the HFE gene in both study groups. In the blood donors group, the greatest frequency of the H 63 D allele was found in Caucasians of all the states. In the malaria patients group in Rondonia, there was a high frequency of the H 63 D allele among the non-Caucasians. In the other states, and in the malaria patients group, the H 63 D allele was the most frequent among the Caucasians. Based on our results, we suggest that the maintenance of polymorphism of the mutations in the gene HFE can be explained by selective factors other than malaria, or it is due to simple allelic oscillation and by the constant gene flow among the populations in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Although proteases play {{essential}} {{roles in}} the lives of all organisms, they are also important agents of disease and pathogenesis in metazoans. Most notably, proteases are essential virulence factors for a broad array of prokaryote and eukaryote parasites. One strategy used by the immune system of metazoans to defend against <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> is to neutralize the toxins and essential virulence factors that allow the parasite to gain entry to the host and to survive and proliferate in the internal environment of the metazoan host. The particular defense system of interest to the present review is the system of endogenous protease inhibitors that operate to inactivate the secreted proteases utilized by invading parasites during the infection cycle within the host. Protease inhibitors are of two broad classes, active-site inhibitors that bind to and inactivate the active sites of target proteases and the α 2 -macroglobulin class of inhibitors that operate as opsonins to bind and mark proteases in a manner that allows the subsequent endocytosis and intracellular proteolytic degradation of the α 2 -macroglobulin-protease complex. Members of the α 2 -macroglobulin class of inhibitors interact with target proteases by the novel process of enfolding the protease into a pocket within the interior of the α 2 -macroglobulin molecule, which is followed by binding of the complex to the α 2 -macroglobulin receptor at the surfaces of macrophages and other endocytotic cells and its endocytosis and degradation. In contrast to the active-site protease inhibitors, each of which is specialized to interact with a small subset of all endopeptidases, the α 2 -macroglobulin inhibitors are remarkably promiscuous, binding proteases of all enzymatic classes and origins. This characteristic allows α 2 -macroglobulin {{to play an important role}} in immune defense because this one protein is capable of binding and neutralizing the diverse array of proteases that function as virulence factors of the diverse array of parasites out there in the environment of metazoa...|$|E
40|$|Dinoflagellates {{are among}} the most {{important}} primary producers in the ocean and represent highly diverse life forms. This group practices a wide variety of alternative nutritional modes; there are phototrophic and heterotrophic, as well as mixotrophic, free-living forms, and the obligated symbiotic and parasitic members. Two major lineages of dinoflagellates have been defined - the core and basal groups, the latter including the obligated parasitic syndinean dinoflagellates. Several dinoflagellates belonging to the core dinoflagellates produce dangerous toxins. Among these, Alexandrium fundyense {{is one of the most}} prominent harmful algal bloom-forming genera with its negative impact on the ecosystem, aquaculture seafood and causing serious hazard to human health. Increasing evidence shows that Alexandrium populations can be affected by <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack</b> by the basal syndinean dinoflagellate Amoebophrya. However, regulatory mechanisms of the infection of core dinoflagellates by their parasites are largely unknown. The aim of the thesis was to provide insights into the infection dynamics among Alexandrium and its parasite Amoebophrya, and to better understand the infection processes with implications for host-parasite coevolution. To investigate the susceptibility of the dinoflagellate to infection by the parasite on an intra-specific level, different populations of the host Alexandrium from very distant geographical origins (Alaska, the Gulf of Maine and the North Sea) were provided to the parasite Amoebophrya. There was a strong negative effect of parasitism on the development of host populations, but no apparent adaptation of the host Alexandrium was observed. Cellular toxin contents were examined, showing that neither toxin concentration nor composition changed within each geographical population. Therefore, the results indicated that the host Alexandrium likely does not use toxins as a potential defense strategy against the parasite. In this thesis, a whole genome sequencing of the parasite Amoebophrya was performed for the first time and a transcriptomic dataset from the infection cycle of this parasite-host system was generated. The basal dinoflagellate Amoebophrya has a relatively small genome in size around 90 Mbp. Besides the reduction of genome size, several parasitic features were observed in the genome including loss of duplicated genes and function loss (e. g. inability to generate certain amino acids) that indicates the parasite dependent on the host. Notably, the genome also exhibits novel features. The shikimate and tryptophan synthesis pathways are physically linked that may constitute an unknown mechanism of pathway regulation. Mitochondria are observed, but the mitochondrial genome is completely lost in Amoebophrya. The established cDNA library (> 900, 000 reads/ 313 Mbp) consists of 14, 455 ESTs. Differentially expressed genes point to general mechanisms in host-parasite recognition and infection. Particular surface lectins are expressed in the parasite Amoebophrya at early infection processes, and these lectins likely mediate the attachment to the host cell, followed by processes involved in host recognition, adhesion, and invasion. During maturation, cell division and proliferation related genes reflect fast cell growth of the parasite. These findings indicate the presence of fundamental processes that have remained stable throughout evolution. By contrast, the host Alexandrium reacts differently towards parasite infection and respective parasitic waterborne cues, but both treatments exhibited significant changes in gene expression associated with specific metabolic pathways. A total of 14, 882 Alexandrium genes were differentially expressed over the whole-parasite infection cycle at three different time points (0, 6 and 96 h). The results from RNA sequencing analyses indicate that parasite infection increases the energy demand of the host, as a large amount of genes involved in photosynthesis, ATP synthesis through glycolysis and fatty acid production were upregulated. The stimulation of signal transduction chains by waterborne cues from the parasite alone could prime the hostâ s defense or induce hostâ s adaptive responses to the parasite activity...|$|E
40|$|Summary Using the facultative root hemiparasite Rhinanthus {{minor and}} Hordeum vulgare as a host, {{several aspects of}} water relations, the flows and {{partitioning}} of mineral nutrients, the flows, depositions and metabolism of abscisic acid (ABA) and zeatin type cytokinins (zeatin Z, zeatin riboside ZR, zeatin nucleotide ZN) within the host, the parasite and between host and parasite and the flows and partitioning of the transport metabolites mannitol in the parasite, and of sucrose in the host, have been studied {{during the study period}} 41 to 54 days after planting, i. e about 30 to 43 days after successful attachment of the parasite to the host. Water relations Extraction of xylem sap by the parasite from the host’s roots is facilitated by considerably higher transpiration per leaf area in the parasite than in the host and by the fact that stomata of attached Rhinanthus were wide open all day and night despite extremely high ABA concentrations in the leaves. By comparison, another related root hemiparasite, Melampyrum arvense, parasitising on various grasses in the field (botanic garden), showed normal diurnal stomatal behaviour. The abnormal behaviour of Rhinanthus stomata was not due to anatomical reasons as closure could be induced by applying high external ABA concentrations. Remarkable differences have been detected between the hydraulic conductance of barley seminal roots showing relatively low values, and that of Rhinanthus the seminal root showing very high values. The latter could be related to the observed high ABA concentrations in these roots. Whole plant water uptake, transpirational losses, growth-dependent deposition and the flows of water within the plants have been measured in singly growing Rhinanthus and Hordeum plants and in the parasitic association between the two. Water uptake, deposition and transpiration in Rhinanthus were dramatically increased after attachment to the barley host; most of the water used by the parasite was extracted as xylem sap from the host, thereby scavenging 20 % of the total water taken up by the host’s roots. This water uptake by the parasitised host, however, due to a parasite induced reduction in the hosts growth, was decreased by 22 % as compared to non- parasitised barley. The overall changes in growth-related water deposition in host and parasite pointed to decreased shoot and relatively favoured root growth in the host and to strongly favoured shoot growth and less strongly increased root growth only in the parasite. These changes in the host became more severe, when more than one Rhinanthus was parasitising one barley plant. Mineral nutrients relations 5 mM NO 3 - supply In parasitising Rhinanthus shoot growth was 12 -fold, but root growth only twofold increased compared to the non-parasitising (very small) plants. On the other hand, in the Hordeum host, shoot dry matter growth was clearly reduced, by 33 % in leaf laminae and by 52 % in leaf sheaths, whereas root growth was only slightly reduced as a consequence of parasitism. Growth-dependent increments of total N and P and of K, Ca and Mg in parasitising Rhinanthus shoot were strongly increased, particularly increments of total N and P, which were 18 and 42 times, respectively, higher than in the small solitary Rhinanthus. On the other hand, increments of the above mineral nutrients in leaf sheaths of parasitised Hordeum vulgare were more strongly decreased than in leaf laminae in response to <b>parasitic</b> <b>attack.</b> Estimation of the flows of nutrients revealed that Rhinanthus withdrew from the host xylem sap about the same percentage of each nutrients: 18 % of total N, 22 % of P and 20 % of K. Within the host almost all net flows of nutrient ions were decreased due to parasitism, but retranslocation from shoot to root-as related to xylem flow-was somewhat increased for all nutrients. Quantitative information is provided to show that the substantially increased growth in the shoot of attached Rhinanthus and the observed decrease in Hordeum shoot growth after infection were related to strongly elevated supply of nitrogen and phosphorus in the parasite and to incipient deficiency of these nutrients in the parasitised host. The flows of nutrients between host and parasite are discussed in terms of low selectivity of nutrient abstraction from the host xylem by the hemiparasite Rhinanthus minor. 1 mM NO 3 - or 1 mM NH 4 + supply Rhinanthus shoot growth as measured by dry matter increase, was 19 -fold (1 mM NO 3 -) and 15 -fold (1 mM NH 4 +), but root growth only twofold (1 mM NO 3 -) and 2. 9 -fold (1 mM NH 4 +) increased-relative to singly growing Rhinanthus-when parasitising on host barley. In the Hordeum host, shoot dry matter growth was clearly reduced, whereas root growth was only slightly affected. Growth-dependent increments of total N and P and of K, Ca and Mg in parasitising Rhinanthus shoot were strongly increased, particularly increments of total N or of P, which were 20 or 53 times (1 mM NO 3 -) and 18 or 51 times (1 mM NH 4 +), respectively, higher than those in solitary Rhinanthus. Within the host almost all net flows of nutrient ions were decreased due to parasitism. Flows of mannitol in parasite and sucrose flows in host barley When the plants were supplied with 5 mM NO 3 -, the biosynthesis of mannitol in Rhinanthus shoots increased 16 -fold by parasitism, resulting in a 15 -fold higher mannitol flow in the phloem and a 10 -fold higher deposition in the shoot. Also the backward transport of mannitol in the xylem were increased 10 -fold after attachment. Lower level nitrogen supply increased the deposition of mannitol in both single and attached Rhinanthus shoot and root. No mannitol was found in barley roots even in the direct vicinity of the haustoria. This indicates there are no backward transport of xylem sap from parasite to host. Compared to unparasitised barley, the net biosynthesis and deposition of sucrose in the shoot and the phloem flow was decreased substantially when plants were supplied with 5 mM NO 3 - or 1 mM NO 3 -. No sucrose has been detected in barley xylem sap and consequently there was no indication of a sucrose transfer from the host to the parasite. A possible involvement of mannitol in the abscisic acid relations of the parasite is discussed. ABA relations When the plants were supplied with 5 mM NO 3 -, there were weak or no effects of parasitism on ABA flows, biosynthesis and ABA degradation in barley. However, ABA growth-dependent deposition was significantly increased in the leaf laminae (3 fold) and in leaf sheath (2. 4 fold), but not in roots. Dramatic changes in ABA flows, metabolism and deposition on a per plant basis, however, have been observed in Rhinanthus. Biosynthesis in the roots was 12 -fold higher after attachment resulting in 14 -fold higher ABA flows in the xylem. A large portion of this ABA was metabolised, a small portion was deposited. Phloem flows of ABA were increased 13 -fold after attachment. The concentrations of ABA in tissues and xylem sap were higher in attached Rhinanthus by an order of magnitude than in host tissues and xylem sap. Similar dramatic difference existed when comparing the high concentrations in the xylem sap of single Rhinanthus with unparasitised barley. As compared to 5 mM NO 3 -, lower NO 3 - or 1 mM NH 4 + supply doubled the ABA concentrations in barley leaf laminae, while having only small or no significant effects in the other organs. The possible special functions of ABA for the parasite are discussed. Zeatin type cytokinins relations Parasitism decreased, in the case of zeatin (Z), the synthesis (by 57 %) in the root, xylem flows (by 56 %) and metabolism (by 71 %) in leaf laminae, however, increased the phloem flows of zeatin massively (3 -fold) in host barley. The deposition of zeatin in the root of Rhinanthus and the flowing in xylem and phloem were 24, 12, 29 -fold, respectively, increased after successfully attaching to the host barley. However, net biosynthesis of zeatin in Rhinanthus roots decreased by 39 % after attachment. This indicates that a large portion (70 %) of xylem flow of zeatin in attached Rhinanthus was extracted from the host. In singly growing Rhinanthus plants, the balance of zeatin deposition in the shoot was negative, i. e. zeatin was metabolised and exported back to root in the phloem. The xylem flows of zeatin riboside (ZR) in barley decreased by 39 % after infected by Rhinanthus; phloem flow, which was 117 % relative to xylem flow was less decreased (by 13 %) after infection. Deposition of ZR has not been significantly affected in the leaf laminae, in leaf sheaths and roots. After parasitising on the host barley depositions in root, xylem flow and phloem flow increased 12, 18, 88 –fold respectively in Rhinanthus. A large portion (57 %) of xylem flow of ZR in attached Rhinanthus was extracted from the host. In single Rhinanthus increament of shoot zeatin riboside was negative and a substantial portion was degraded in shoot and the rest was retranslocated back to the root in the phloem. A significant depositions of Z and ZR were detected in the haustoria of the Rhinanthus/barley association. Flows and deposition of zeatin nucleotides also have been investigated. The possible physiological functions of the large quantities of Z and ZR derived from the host barley, for the improved growth and the stomatal opening in the parasitising Rhinanthus are discussed. Zusammenfassung An dem fakultativen Hemiparasiten Rhinanthus minor, einem Wurzelparasiten, und Gerste (Hordeum vulgare) als Wirtspflanze wurden verschiedene Aspekte des Wasserhaushaltes sowie die Flüsse von mineralischen Nährstoffen in den Leitbahnen von Wirt und Parasit, die Verteilung der Nährstoffe in den ganzen Pflanzen sowie deren Transport vom Wirt zum Parasiten untersucht. Auch für die pflanzlichen Hormone Abszisinsäure (ABA) und die Cytokinine vom Zeatintyp - Zeatin (Z), Zeatinribosid (ZR) und Zeatinnukleotid (ZN) - und die hauptsächlichen Transportmetabolite Mannit (im Parasiten) und Saccharose (in der Wirtspflanze) wurden deren Flüsse in den Leitbahnen der Pflanzen, ihre Verteilung in den Pflanzen, ihre metabolischen Umwandlungen und der mögliche Austausch zwischen Wirt und Parasit untersucht. Der Unersuchungszeitraum lag zwischen 41 und 54 Tagen nach der Aussaat und das war zugleich zwischen ca. 30 und 43 Tage nach dem erfolgreichen Befall des Wirtes durch den Parasiten. Wasserhaushalt. Ein Entzug von Xylemsaft durch die Haustorien des Parasiten aus den Wurzeln des Wirtes wird dadurch bewirkt, dass der Parasit eine wesentlich höhere Transpiration pro Blattfläche aufweist als die Wirtspflanze, sowie im speziellen Fall dadurch, dass bei parasitierenden Rhinanthus-Pflanzen trotz sehr hoher ABA-Konzentration in den Blättern die Stomata Tag und Nacht weit geöffnet sind. Bei einem verwandten Wurzel-Hemiparasiten, Melampyrum arvense, der im botanischen Garten auf verschiedenen Gräsern parasitierte, wurde anders als bei Rhinanthus im Freiland ein normales diurnales Öffnen und Schließen der Stomata beobachtet. Das anomale Spaltöffnungsverhalten bei Rhinanthus beruht freilich nicht auf anatomischen Besonderheiten, denn ein Schließen der Stomata ließ sich durch Applikation extrem hoher ABA – Konzentrationen induzieren. Bemerkenswerte Unterschiede zwischen der Wirtspflanze und dem Parasiten wurden hinsichtlich der hydraulischen Leitfähigkeit der Keimwurzeln von Gerste mit vergleichsweise niedrigen Werten und derjenigen der Keimwurzel von Rhinanthus mit sehr hohen Werten gemessen. Letzteres könnte mit den beobachteten hohen ABA Konzentrationen in den Wurzeln des Parasiten zusammenhängen. Die Wasseraufnahme durch die ganze Pflanze, die Transpiration, die Deposition von Zellwasser in den Organen und die Wasserflüsse in den Leitbahnen innerhalb der Pflanze wurden in unabhängig wachsenden Rhinanthus- und in Hordeum- Pflanzen sowie innerhalb der parasitischen Assoziation zwischen beiden gemessen. Die Aufnahme von Wasser, seine Einlagerung und die Transpiration waren bei Rhinanthus nach erfolgreichem Befall einer Gersten – Wirtspflanze drastisch erhöht, wobei der Hauptanteil des vom Parasiten genutzten Wassers vom Wirt stammte und wodurch 20 % der gesamten Wasseraufnahme der Gerstenwurzel entzogen wurde. In der vom Parasiten befallenen Gerste wurde dadurch jedoch die Wasseraufnahme im Vergleich zu einer unbefallenen Pflanze um 22 % erniedrigt und zugleich auch das Wachstum behindert. Insgesamt kam es in der Wirtspflanze Gerste zu vermindertem Spross- und relativ gefördertem Wurzelwachstum, während im Parasiten Rhinanthus besonders das Sprosswachstum und weniger das Wurzelwachstum gesteigert wurde. Diese Veränderungen in der Wirtspflanze wurden deutlich intensiviert, wenn die Gerste von mehr als einem Rhinanthus-Parasiten befallen wurde. Mineralstoffwechsel. Düngung mit 5 mM NO 3 - In parasitierenden Rhinanthus-Pflanzen war das Sprosswachstum 12 – fach, das der Wurzel aber nur zweifach im Vergleich zu selbstständig wachsenden (sehr kleinen) Pflanzen erhöht. Andererseits war in der vom Parasiten befallenen Gerste das Sprosswachstum – gemessen als Trockenmassezunahme – deutlich erniedrigt, und zwar um 33 % in Blattspreiten und um 52 % in Blattscheiden, während das Wurzelwachstum nur geringfügig im Vergleich zur unbefallenen Kontrolle vermindert war. Die mit dem Wachstum verbundenen Inkorporationen von N, von P, von K sowie von Ca und Mg waren im Spross von parasitisch ernährtem Rhinanthus beträchtlich erhöht, besonders die von N und von P, die 18 - oder sogar 42 -fach im Vergleich zu den selbständig wachsenden Pflänzchen erhöht waren. Andererseits waren in der Wirtspflanze infolge des Parasitenbefalles die Inkorporationen der genannten Mineralstoffe in den Blattscheiden stärker als in den Blattspreiten erniedrigt. Eine Berechnung der Nährstoffflüsse zeigte, dass Rhinanthus dem Xylemsaft des Wirtes jeweils ähnliche Anteile der Nährstoffe entzog: 18 % des insgesamt aufgenommenen N, 22 % des P und 20 % des K. Innerhalb der Wirtspflanze Gerste waren die Nettoflüsse fast aller mineralischen Nährstoff-Ionen in den Leitbahnen infolge des Parasitenbefalles erniedrigt, aber die Retranslokation im Phloem vom Spross zur Wurzel war für alle Nährstoffe – in Bezug auf den Xylemtransport - geringfügig erhöht. Quantitative Daten deuten an, dass das drastisch gesteigerte Sprosswachstum in parasitisch ernährtem Rhinanthus sowie das vermindere Sprosswachstum bei der Gerste nach dem Parasitenbefall kausal einerseits mit der beträchtlich erhöhten Zufuhr von gebundenem Stickstoff und Phosphor an den Parasiten und andererseits mit einem einsetzenden Mangel an diesen Nährstoffen in der befallenen Wirtspflanze verbunden ist. Insgesamt werden die Nährstoff-Flüsse von der Wirtspflanze zum Parasiten im Lichte einer nur geringfügigen Selektivität des Entzuges von Nährstoff-Ionen zusammen mit dem Xylemsaft aus dem Xylem des Wirtes durch die Haustorien des Wurzelparasiten Rhinanthus minor diskutiert. Düngung mit 1 mM NO 3 - oder 1 mM NH 4 + Das als Trockenmassezunahme gemessene Sprosswachstum von parasitisch ernährtem Rhinanthus war 19 -fach (1 mM NO 3 -) bzw. 15 -fach (1 mM NH 4 +), das Wurzelwachstum aber nur 2 -fach (1 mM NO 3 -) bzw. 2. 9 -fach (1 mM NH 4 +) im Vergleich zur selbständig wachsenden Kontrolle erhöht. In der Wirtspflanze Gerste war das Sprosswachstum deutlich vermindert, während das Wurzelwachstum nur wenig beeinflusst war. Die mit dem Wachstum verbunden Zunahme an gebundenem N und P sowie an K, Ca und Mg waren im Spross von parasitisch ernährtem Rhinanthus stark vermehrt, und zwar besonders die Zunahme an gebundenem N bzw. P, die 20 - bzw. 53 -fach (bei 1 mM NO 3 -) und 18 - bzw. 51 -fach (bei 1 mM NH 4 +) im Vergleich zu selbständig wachsenden Rhinanthus- Pflänzchen erhöht waren. Innerhalb der Wirtspflanze Gerste waren fast alle Nettoflüsse der verschiedenen Nährstoff-Ionen infolge des Parasitenbefalles erniedrigt. Flüsse von Mannit im Parasiten Rhinanthus und von Saccharose in der Wirtspflanze Gerste. Im Falle einer Stickstoffernährung mit 5 mM NO 3 - war die Biosynthese von Mannit in den Blättern von parasitisch ernährtem Rhinanthus 16 -fach im Vergleich zum selbständig wachsenden Pflänzchen erhöht und das führte zu einem 15 -fach gesteigerten Phloemtransport zur Wurzel und einer 10 -fach erhöhten Einlagerung von Mannit im Spross. Auch der Rücktransport von Mannit im Xylem von der Wurzel zum Spross war 10 -fach erhöht. Im Falle einer Stickstoffernährung mit geringerer Konzentration war die Einlagerung von Mannit im Spross und in der Wurzel sowohl bei selbständig wachsendem als auch bei parasitisch ernährtem Rhinanthus im Vergleich zu 5 mM NO 3 - erhöht. In der Wirtspflanze Gerste konnte kein Mannit detektiert werden, auch nicht in den Wurzeln von Rhinanthus-befallenen Pflanzen, selbst nicht in direkter Nachbarschaft zu den Haustorien des Parasiten; das bedeutet, es erfolgte kein Rücktransport von Xylemsaft vom Parasiten zur Wirtspflanze. In den Gerstenpflanzen – bei Ernährung mit 5 mM oder mit 1 mM NO 3 - – wurde die Nettosynthese von Saccharose sowie ihre Einlagerung im Spross und ihr Transport im Phloem zur Wurzel erheblich infolge eines Befalles mit Rhinanthus erniedrigt. Im Xylemsaft von Gerste war die Konzentration von Saccharose unterhalb der Nachweisgrenze und folglich gab es keinen Hinweis auf einen Transfer von Saccharose aus dem Wirt in den Parasiten. Eine mögliche Bedeutung von Mannit für die hohen ABA-Konzentrationen in Rhinanthus wird diskutiert. Konzentrationen und Flüsse von ABA. Bei einer Stickstoffernährung mit 5 mM NO 3 - hatte ein parasitischer Befall mit Rhinanthus nur geringen oder keinen Einfluss auf die Flüsse, die Biosynthese oder den metabolischen Abbau von ABA in der Gerstenpflanze. Wohl aber wurde die wachstumsbedingte Einlagerung von ABA in den Blattspreiten (3 -fach) und den Blattscheiden (2. 4 -fach) vermehrt, diejenige in der Wurzel blieb aber unverändert. In Rhinanthus dagegen führte der erfolgreiche Befall einer Wirtspflanze zu drastischen Veränderungen der Flüsse, des Metabolismus und der Einlagerung von ABA in die Gewebe, jeweils gemessen im Bezug auf eine ganze Pflanze. Auf dieser Basis war die ABA-Biosynthese in den Wurzeln nach erfolgreichem Befall eines Wirtes 12 -fach höher und dies führte zu 14 -fach höherem ABA-Transport im Xylem. Ein großer Anteil dieser ABA wurde im Spross metabolisiert, ein kleiner Anteil wurde in die Gewebe eingelagert. Auch die ABA-Flüsse im Phloem wurden 13 -fach erhöht. Gleichzeitig waren die ABA-Konzentrationen in den Geweben und im Xylemsaft der parasitierenden Rhinanthus-Pflanze um eine Größenordnung höher als in den Geweben und im Xylemsaft der Wirtspflanze. Dasselbe gilt auch für einen Vergleich zwischen den hohen ABA-Konzentrationen im Xylemsaft von selbstständig wachsendem Rhinanthus und den niedrigen in nicht vom Parasiten befallener Gerste. Im Vergleich zur Ernährung mit 5 mM NO 3 - führte 1 mM NO 3 - oder auch 1 mM NH 4 + zu einer Verdoppelung der ABA-Konzentrationen in den Blattspreiten von Gerste, hatte aber nur geringe oder keine Wirkung in den anderen Organen. Mögliche spezielle Funktionen von ABA für den Parasiten werden diskutiert. Cytokinine vom Zeatin-Typ Ein parasitischer Befall verminderte bei Zeatin (Z) seine Synthese in der Wurzel der Wirtspflanze Gerste (um 57 %), den Xylemtransport (um 56 %) und den metabolischen Umbau in den Blattspreiten (um 71 %), jedoch vergrößerte er zugleich substantiell (3 -fach) den Phloemtransport von Zeatin in der Gerste. In Rhinanthus wurde die Einlagerung von Zeatin in der Wurzel und seine auf eine ganze Pflanze bezogenen Flüsse im Xylem und im Phloem 24 -, 12 - bzw. 29 -fach nach erfolgreichem Befall von Gerste erhöht. Jedoch die Netto-Biosynthese von Zeatin in der Wurzel von Rhinanthus verminderte sich um 39 % nach erfolgreichem Befall des Wirtes. Das bedeutet, dass ein großer Anteil (70 %) des im Xylem von Rhinanthus transportierten Zeatin zuvor dem Xylem der Wirtspflanze Gerste entzogen wurde. Im Spross selbständig wachsender Rhinanthus-Pflänzchen war die Einlagerung von Zeatin in die Sprossgewebe in der Bilanz negativ, d. h. Zeatin wurde abgebaut bzw. im Phloem abtransportiert. Die Flüsse von Zeatinribosid (ZR) im Xylem von Gerste wurden nach einem Befall durch Rhinanthus um 39 % erniedrigt, aber seine Retranslokation vom Spross zur Wurzel im Phloem, die 117 % des Xylemtransportes betrug, wurde nur schwach (um 13 %) nach dem Befall erniedrigt. Die Einlagerung von ZR in die Gewebe wurde in den Blattspreiten, den Blattscheiden und den Wurzeln nicht signifikant beeinflusst. Andererseits waren nach einem erfolgreichen Befall von Gerste in Rhinanthus die Einlagerung von ZR in Wurzelgewebe und seine Flüsse im Xylem und im Phloem, alle im Bezug auf die ganze Rhinanthus-Pflanze, 12 -, 18 - bzw. 88 -fach erhöht. Ein beträchtlicher Anteil (57 %) des im Xylem von Rhinanthus transportierten ZR entstammte freilich wiederum dem Xylem der Wurzel der Wirtspflanze Gerste. Im Spross selbständig wachsender Rhinanthus-Pflänzchen nahm die Menge an ZR (wie die von Zeatin) im Laufe des Untersuchungs-Intervalles ab, wobei ein beträchtlicher Anteil im Spross metabolisiert wurde und der Rest mit dem Phloem in die Wurzel transportiert. In die an den Gerstenwurzeln sitzenden Haustorien des Parasiten Rhinanthus wurden beträchtliche Mengen an Zeatin und an ZR eingelagert. Auch die Flüsse und die Einlagerung der Zeatinnukleotide in die Gewebe sind untersucht worden. Eine mögliche physiologische Funktion der aus dem Wirt stammenden großen Mengen an Zeatin und an ZR für das gesteigerte Wachstum und die Stomata-Öffnung im parasitierenden Rhinanthus wird diskutiert...|$|E
