50|$|On wired {{broadcast}} LANs, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI networks, {{depending on}} the network structure (hub or switch), one can capture traffic on all or parts of the network from a single machine on the network. However, some methods avoid traffic narrowing by switches {{to gain access to}} traffic from other systems on the network (e.g., ARP spoofing). For network monitoring purposes, it may also be desirable to monitor all data packets in a LAN by using a network switch with a so-called monitoring <b>port</b> that <b>mirrors</b> all packets that pass through all ports of the switch when systems are connected to a switch port. To use a network tap is an even more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port, since taps are less likely to drop packets during high traffic load.|$|R
50|$|Unless <b>port</b> <b>mirroring</b> {{or other}} {{methods such as}} RMON, SMON or sFlow are {{implemented}} in a switch, {{it is difficult to}} monitor traffic that is bridged using a switch because only the sending and receiving ports can see the traffic.

50|$|In other cases, {{the switch}} {{is used to}} create a mirror image of data that can go to an {{external}} device.

In many cases it is desirable to monitor the data traffic flowing between two points in a copper or fiber based Operational or Onboard Network System (ONS) for Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) purposes because these ONS systems may carry important data {{which can be used}} without duplicating/installing a specific FTI data acquisition system to receive this data. The two types of network taps that can be used are Inline Network Taps and network end-point taps. This paper examines the usage of Inline Network Taps for FTI applications and how they can support network access strategies and objectives. An Inline Network Tap is a hardware device which allows access to data flowing across a network. These devices are typically active/powered and have a number of ports: a first tap port, a second tap port, and one or more <b>mirror</b> <b>ports.</b> An in-line network tap inserted {{between the first and second}} tap port passes all data traffic through unimpeded but also copies that same data to one or more <b>mirror</b> <b>ports.</b> Some Inline Network Tap devices may also pass packets when the tap is not powered or a malfunction is detected on the device via an integrated by-pass function. If the Inline Network Tap device goes offline the unit automatically bypasses the tap connection and data traffic is directed through the bypass directly to network devices. This capability is crucial for inline usage on mission critical network segments that cannot afford the risk of losing the network connection. An in-line network tap can either be based on copper or fiber technology and as a "filterable" network tap can also provide advanced packet filtering capabilities. These filterable network taps can selectively pass data, e. g., based on VLAN ID or other parameters, to a <b>mirror</b> <b>port</b> for deep analysis, monitoring and recording. Another advanced tap function that is presented in this paper is the support for inserting time stamps at the tap level in monitored packets which provides a reference time when the data content of a given packet was generated at a data source. This capability is a significant feature for FTI applications as most ONS systems do not provide time stamped data...|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} methods for getting {{access to the}} network. Many tapping methods can be used, {{according}} to the network technology and the monitoring objective.The first method, when a monitoring device is installed in-line. When a monitoring device is installed in-line, the network will stop every time the device updated or rebooted. Similarly, if the device failed, the network would break down as well.Another method to monitor networks is by enabling Promiscuous Mode on the host that {{is used for the}} monitoring and attaching it to a network switch. This method works well with old LAN technologies. However, modern network are usually switched based networks, meaning the devices are communicated using Point-To-Point links. If the monitoring device is connected to such a network, it will only see its own traffic, so it is hard for other devices to see the traffic. Some of the traditional methods for gaining access to the network traffic use a SPAN port, also known as MIRROR port, in the switch. This is a software method for network tapping and places less load on the network switch. This is a low cost alternative to traditional network tap methods. However, not all routers and switches support <b>port</b> <b>mirroring</b> and, on those that do, using <b>port</b> <b>mirroring</b> can affect the performance of the router or the switch.|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} frontier for astronomical {{adaptive optics}} (AO) involves {{methods such as}} Multi-Object AO and Multi-Conjugate AO that {{have the potential to}} give a significantly larger field of view than conventional AO techniques. A second key emphasis over the next decade will be to push astronomical AO to visible wavelengths. We have conducted the first laboratory simulations of wide-field, laser guide star adaptive optics at visible wavelengths on a 10 -meter-class telescope. These experiments, utilizing the UCO/Lick Observatory's Multi-Object / Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics (MOAO/LTAO) testbed, demonstrate new techniques in wavefront sensing and control that are crucial to future on-sky MOAO systems. We (1) test and confirm the feasibility of highly accurate atmospheric tomography with laser guide stars, (2) demonstrate key innovations allowing open-loop operation of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (with errors of ~ 30 nm) as will be needed for MOAO, and (3) build a complete error budget model describing system performance. The AO system maintains a performance of 32. 4 % Strehl on-axis, with 24. 5 % and 22. 6 % at 10 " and 15 ", respectively, at a science wavelength of 710 nm (R-band) over the equivalent of 0. 8 seconds of simulation. The MOAO-corrected field of view is ~ 25 times larger in area than that limited by anisoplanatism at R-band. Our error budget is composed of terms verified through independent, empirical experiments. Error terms arising from calibration inaccuracies and optical drift are comparable in magnitude to traditional terms like fitting error and tomographic error. This makes a strong case for implementing additional calibration facilities in future AO systems, including accelerometers on powered optics, 3 D turbulators, telescope and LGS simulators, and external calibration <b>ports</b> for deformable <b>mirrors.</b> Comment: 29 pages, 11 figures, submitted to PAS...|$|R
50|$|The {{network data}} that a packet capture {{appliance}} captures {{depends on where}} and how the appliance is installed on a network.

Passive monitoring is usually an agentless appliance implemented using network <b>port</b> <b>mirroring.</b> A key feature to consider in this solution is the ability to support multiple protocol analytics (e.g., XML, SQL, PHP) since most companies have more than just web-based applications to support.

Active monitoring is a good complement to passive monitoring; together, these two components help provide visibility into application health during off peak hours when transaction volume is low.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Port-mirroring {{techniques}} {{are supported by}} many of today’s medium and high-end Ethernet switches. The ubiquity and low-cost of <b>port</b> <b>mirroring</b> has made it a popular method for collecting packet traces. Despite its wide-spread use little work has been reported on the impacts of this monitoring method upon the measured network traffic. In particular, we focus upon each of delay and jitter (timing difference), packet-reordering, and packet-loss statistics. We compare the port-mirroring method with inserting a passive TAP (Test Access Point), such as a fibre splitter, into a monitored link. Despite a passive TAP being transparent to monitored traffic, port-mirroring popularity arises from its limited set-up disruption, and (potentially) easier management. This paper documents experimental comparison of traffic using the passive TAP and port-mirroring functionality, and shows that port-mirroring will introduce significant changes to the inter-packet timing, packet-reordering, and packet-loss — even at very low levels of utilisation.
