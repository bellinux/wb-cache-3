25|$|The video {{starts with}} Lightbody, {{who wears a}} dark coat, a grey polo neck sweater, and trousers. He sings as he pushes an old {{motorcycle}} across a farmer's field at dusk. As darkness falls, he abandons the bike and enters a wood. He walks through it, until he descends a short hill and stays in a stream. As the chorus begins, Lightbody lights a distress firelight, he moves it in circles as he sings. In a bridge behind him, two members from Snow <b>Patrol</b> <b>light</b> two flares and move them as well. When the chorus ends, Lighbody throws his flare to the water, in which it continues shining. Lightbody returns to the forest and he sings while he walks. Later, he ascends to a plain, where another two members ignite two distress firelights as the second verse ends. With the flares, they run and move them in circles, and then, they throw them to each other. Nathan Connolly, who wears a grey hoodie, appears riding the motorcycle Lightbody dumped. He drives it in zigzag with the other men. As the video ends, {{he goes to the}} stream, where the motorbike starts to throw smoke; Connolly gets off it, and it fires. The burning bike rolls downhill and it falls into the stream, where it sinks, with the fire being extinguished.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a real-time earthquake information system, which provides earthquake information {{just a few seconds}} after P-wave arrival at the nearest station from a hypocenter [Horiuchi et al., 2005]. This system determines hypocenter and magnitude immediately by using telemetry seismographs network operated by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED). Thus we get early warning for big ground motion before it begins in an area a little far from a hypocenter. Now we are conducting the actual proof experiment in collaboration with a local government and a private company, in order to verify the validity and practicality about the broadcasting and application of this information. The earthquake alarm information is automatically sent from NIED to the Fujisawa City Office, Kanagawa, Japan, having large earthquake occurrences. Data processing PCs at the office estimate seismic intensity and S-wave arrival time and display them. The PC has a function to control an eight-channel electric relay automatically according to the information, so we can control patrol lights, some instruments, etc. We started the system in July 2002, and now 13 public halls; two municipal schools and a city hospital have this system. Tokio Marine and Nichido Risk Consulting Co., Ltd., a risk-consulting subsidiary of one of the major casualty insurance companies in Japan, introduced this system in June 2003. The earthquake alarm information is mainly used for the employee’s safety. Data processing PCs transmit information on seismic intensity and S-wave arrival time to the monitor unit (a display, speakers and a four-color <b>patrol</b> <b>light)</b> and employee’s cellular phones. We are also using it for the business of the company. The earthquake information triggers “Payment insurance calculation system ” to estimates the payment insurance and to call members for the damage assessment automatically...|$|E
