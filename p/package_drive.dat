Outboard drives are mounted to the transom and are mechanically turned {{to the left or}} right to steer the craft, either directly with a tiller, or through a remote steering system leading to a steering wheel mounted on the boat's console.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of microwave integrated circuits requires several tests {{to be carried}} out on wafer in order to check the effectiveness of the process. That is accomplished by measuring some param­eters {{of a small group of}} test devices named PCM (Process Control Monitor), located on the same wafer and fabricated with the same process. In this paper a system is presented which integrates in a single workstation the experimental procedures, and the data processing which allow to carry out on line the more significant parameters of microwave GaAs FET. In order to achieve significant results in MMIC device modeling, a proper design of the PCM layout is required. This is accomplished by using special metallized patterns on GaAs, for the network analyzer calibration, which allow to define the reference planes very close to the active area of the device. A software <b>package</b> <b>drives</b> the user through all the operations up to the development of a small signal MESFET model, so that the procedure overcomes the peculiarity of laboratory experiment and gains the characteristic of a more general and operative tool, useful for recurrent application...|$|R

40|$|Popcorning in {{electronic}} <b>packages</b> is <b>driven</b> by evaporated steam generated within defect during solder reflow process. Generated steam is confined in sealed defect volume creating a blister. Steam escapes when the blister is popped. The condition for popping {{is governed by}} the steam pressure and defect fracture resistance, the critical strain energy released rate, The quantity of steam generated within the defect {{is a function of}} the reflow condition as well as defect size. Analysis revealed that steam pressure is inversely proportional to defect size at fixed renew conditions. The resulting critical defect size is an exponential function of steam generation and critical strain energy released rate.

40|$|The {{packaging}} of double-stranded genomic DNA {{into some}} viral and all bacteriophage capsids {{is driven by}} powerful molecular motors. In bacteriophage T 4, the motor consists of the portal protein assembly composed of twelve copies of gene product 20 (gp 20, 61 kDa) and an oligomeric terminase complex composed of gp 16 (18 kDa) and gp 17 (70 kDa). The <b>packaging</b> motor <b>drives</b> the 171 -kbp T 4 DNA into the capsid utilizing the free energy of ATP hydrolysis. Evidence suggests that gp 17 is the key component of the motor; it exhibits ATPase, nuclease, and in vitro DNA-packaging activities. The N- and C-terminal halves of gp 17 were expressed and purified to homogeneity and found to have ATPase and nuclease activities, respectively.
