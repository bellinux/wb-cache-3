30|$|Introduction: COPD {{patients}} have often <b>polyglobulia</b> because of associated hypoxemia especially in {{patients at the}} stage of chronic respiratory failure. We recently reported that anemia was present in 36 % of patients with severe AECOPD admitted to ICU without impact on short-term prognosis. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the long-term impact of haemoglobin (Hb) levels on outcomes of AECOPD patients.|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} endothelin system, the {{functional}} counterpart of NO, in the pathophysiology of <b>polyglobulia</b> remains still elusive. Therefore a novel erythropoietin overexpressing mouse was generated, with hematocrit levels of about 80 %. Hence, we analyzed vascular contractions to ET- 1 and big endothelin- 1 (big ET- 1), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) promoter activity, ET- 1 immunochemistry, endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) -protein tissue levels, ETA/B-receptor mRNA expression in this novel transgenic model of severe <b>polyglobulia.</b> For analysis of ET- 1 promotor activity, EPO transgenic mice were mated with homozygous transgenic mice expressing the lacZ gene under control of the human ET- 1 promoter and immunochistochemistry for gal blue was performed in lacZ transgenic animals. Notwithstanding markedly increased eNOS expression, NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation and circulating and vascular tissue NO levels indicating enhanced bioavailability of NO, ET- 1 tissue levels were also augmented in heart, kidney, liver and aorta (2. 2 ± 0. 3 vs. 0. 5 ± 0. 1 pg/mg tissue; P< 0. 01) of transgenic polyglobulic animals. Accordingly, immunohistochemistry demonstrated enhanced expression of ET- 1 protein in the vascular wall of polyglobulic animals as compared to controls (p< 0. 05), while increase of ET- 1 promoter activity was confined to the perivascular tissue (P< 0. 05). NOS inhibition with L-NAME unmasked increased vascular reactivity to ET- 1 and bigET- 1 and aortic ETA/B receptor mRNA gene expression was enhanced (p< 0. 05 vs. controls). Administration of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME led to acute vasoconstriction of peripheral resistance vessels, hypertension and death of transgenic mice within 2 days, while wildtypes did not show increased mortality. Treatment with the ETA antagonist darusentan doubled survival time of transgenic polyglobulic mice after NO synthase inhibition (p< 0. 01 vs placebo). In conclusion, {{in this study we}} provide first evidence that the tissue endothelin system is activated by <b>polyglobulia.</b> Together with a stimulated NO system it contributes to cardiovascular regulation in pathophysiological conditions associated with increased hematocri...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) induces vasodilatatory, antiaggregatory, and {{antiproliferative}} {{effects in}} vitro. To delineate potential beneficial effects of NO in preventing vascular disease in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human erythropoietin. These animals induce <b>polyglobulia</b> {{known to be}} associated with a high incidence of vascular disease. Despite hematocrit levels of 80 %, adult transgenic mice did not develop hypertension or thromboembolism. Endothelial NO synthase levels, NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation and circulating and vascular tissue NO levels were markedly increased. Administration of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) led to vasoconstriction of peripheral resistance vessels, hypertension, and death of transgenic mice, whereas wild-type siblings developed hypertension but did not show increased mortality. L-NAME-treated polyglobulic mice revealed acute left ventricular dilatation and vascular engorgement associated with pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage. In conclusion, we here unequivocally demonstrate that endothelial NO maintains normotension, prevents cardiovascular dysfunction, and critically determines survival in vivo under conditions of increased hematocrit...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Haemoglobinopathies are {{hereditary}} {{conditions in}} which the fundamental lesion affects the synthesis rate or {{the structure of the}} globin in normal hemoglobin. The synthesis of the polypeptide chains in globin is genetically coded. Clinically, haemoglobinopathies manifest most commonly in the form of hemolytic anemia and, more rarely, cyanosis and <b>polyglobulia.</b> They differ from “acquired haemoglobinopathies”, such as methemoglobinemia, in which hemoglobin is usually compromised due to the action of toxic substances. The clinical aspects are in close relationship to the nature and level of the structural anomaly of the Hb molecule. The heterozygous form of the Lepore syndrome is hematologically characterized by a similar pattern to minor β-thalassemia and electrophoretically by abnormal Hb D fractions at a rate of 5 - 10 % and a decreased percentage of HbA. In homozygous forms, Lepore Hb represents 10 - 20 % on electrophoresis, the rest consisting of HbF; HbA and HbA 2 are completely absent. From a clinical point of view, Hb Lepore heterozygotes are similar to those with minor β – thalassemia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} syndrome “coronary insufficiency {{with normal}} coronary arteriogram” {{is found in}} approximately 10 % to 20 % of patients with exercise-induced coronary insufficiency. In most of these cases, disturbances of the coronary microcirculation are present. They can appear in vascular diseases (arterial hypertension, systemic immunopathies, immune complex vasculitis), in rheologic diseases (paraproteinemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, <b>polyglobulia)</b> and in disturbances of transport and diffusion of oxygen (carbon monoxide intoxication, methemoglobinemia). The clinical diagnosis {{is based on the}} usual diagnostic procedures (electrocardiogram, exercise electrocardiogram, responsiveness to nitroglycerin), as well as on newer functionally oriented diagnostic procedures (determinations of coronary blood flow and coronary vascular reserve, production of lactate, serologic findings, histology and histology of peripheral arteries, measurements of viscosities in both plasma and blood). Many clinically relevant disturbances in the coronary microcirculation can thus be detected and treated on a rational basis by management of the underlying main disease, that is, by treatment of the vascular, rheologic and metabolic disorders. Persistent angina pectoris {{in the presence of a}} normal coronary arteriogram does not represent an end to coronary diagnostic procedures, but introduces the clinical task of using all diagnostic possibilities to enable functional and therapeutic assessment of the coronary microcirculation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fetal growth {{restriction}} (FGR) {{is associated}} with increased risk of perinatal morbidity or death. Nationwide implementation of new fetal growth charts, requires a lower fetal weight for the diagnosis of FGR, compared to previous ones. This may lead to an under diagnosis of FGR in {{a large proportion of}} neonates. Aim: To compare the morbidity, mortality and anthropometry of neonates with FGR, diagnosed by MINSAL and Juez curves, with normal weight newborns in the same period (2000 - 2004). Material and methods: Revision of medical records of all births occurring in a maternity hospital between 2000 and 2004. The number of neonatal deaths, and the presence of hyperbilirubinemia, <b>polyglobulia,</b> hypoglycemia and hypothermia, were compared among children classified to be below percentile 10 of fetal growth according to both growth charts. Results: FGR was diagnosed in 4, 4 % (502 / 11. 289) and 9 % (1. 029 / 11. 289) of newborns by MINSAL and Juez curves respectively. Compared to normal weight controls, the 527 newborns without FGR according to MINSAL curves, but below percentile 10 of Juez curves, had an odds ratio (OR) for polyglobulina of 8. 14 (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 01 - 65. 34), an OR for neonatal hypoglycemia of 5. 10 (95 % CI: 1. 11 - 23. 39) and an OR for a ponderal index below 10 th percentile of 10. 98 (95 % CI: 6. 84 - 17. 64). Conclusions: Newborns without a diagnosis of FGR by MINSAL curves but below 10 th percentile by Juez curves, have neonatal outcomes suggesting a true FGR. Juez curves should be maintained as a standard for the evaluation of fetal growth in our populatio...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} called: "The importance {{and methods of}} measuring hematocrit and hemoglobin in pre-hospital emergency care". There has been recent progress in technologies which allows to measure various laboratory values by small portable systems. These values can be Hb and Ht, measuring of these values is not standard in pre-hospital medical care in Czech Republic. It {{is the reason why}} this thesis deals with possibility of its implementation. The theoretical part deals with composition and physiology of hemoglobin and associated diseases such as anemia and <b>polyglobulia.</b> It also contains the issue of diagnostics, guidelines of physical examination procedures as well as description of what should be focus on when one is gathering case history. There are also provided facts and information about portable measuring systems, their measuring methods and overview of systems which are available in Czech Republic. There was conducted a qualitative research and was presented in practical part of this bachelor thesis. Collection of data was based on technique of standardized anonymous questionnaire which included only structured answers. The paramedics of Emergency medical services of South Bohemia region were the respondents. The research took place in March 2014 and 54 respondents anticipated in it. There were stated two aims in this bachelor thesis. The heart of first aim was to find out whether the paramedics are able to use values of hematocrit and hemoglobin to diagnose a patient. The second aim was to map paramedics' attitude to measuring values of hematocrit and hemoglobin within emergency medical service. There were also stated hypothesis which expressed the expectations that paramedic are able to use values of hematocrit and hemoglobin and they are interested in and enthusiastic about measuring hematocrit and hemoglobin within pre-hospital emergency care. From data, which were collected and analyzed in the practical part, it is obvious, that paramedics do have satisfactory amount of skills and knowledge which are absolutely necessary for diagnosing a patient by using values of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Contrary to the fact that paramedics have certain knowledge about benefits which would measuring values of hemoglobin and hematocrit brought they do not believe that portable measuring systems would be efficient in pre-hospital emergency care and they are not interested in using them...|$|E
