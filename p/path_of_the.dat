Uru: The <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell, extended the story of Uru {{in the present and}} added multiple never-before-seen Ages. Unlike the first expansion pack, Uru: The <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell was not free, but was boxed and sold in stores. Uru, To Dni, and The <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell were also packaged together and sold as Uru: The Complete Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|The motions as {{described}} above are simplifications. Due to the movement of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the apparent <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun wobbles slightly, with {{a period of about}} one month. Due to further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion. The ecliptic is actually the apparent <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun throughout the course of a year.|$|E
5|$|A zigzag {{with seven}} stars is {{sometimes}} displayed, representing the Big Dipper (or the Bushel, the Chinese equivalent).

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple {{is thought to have}} been an astronomical observatory.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the walls}} {{a series of}} semicircular defense lines were {{constructed}} in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about sixteen kilometers (10 miles) {{from the city and}} an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanking's city walls. There were also two key high points of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese within one to two kilometers (1.2 miles) of the city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within sixteen kilometers (10 miles) of the city.|$|E

In a further effort to {{distract}} Sauron from the approach of Frodo and Sam, Gandalf advises that Aragorn and the remaining army marches to the Gates of Mordor as a direct challenge to Sauron, who will send out a vast army to meet them, thus keeping his attention away from Mount Doom. Upon arriving at the Gate, the party are confronted by the Mouth of Sauron (Roger L. Jackson), who tells them that Frodo is dead. They kill him and must then face a massive army of orcs, before fighting the remaining Nazgûl. Not believing Frodo to be dead, they plan to fight {{as long as they}} can, ultimately sacrificing themselves so as to give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring.|$|E
5|$|The Telugu {{version of}} the Yogatattva Upanishad has 142 verses, while the {{shortest}} surviving manuscript in Sanskrit is just 15 verses.

5|$|Tornado myths are {{incorrect}} {{beliefs about}} tornadoes, {{which can be}} attributed to many factors, including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes, sensationalism by news media, and the presentation of incorrect information in popular entertainment.
