25|$|Under {{the current}} system, {{immediate}} family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have <b>priority</b> <b>status</b> for green cards and generally wait 6 {{months to a}} year to have their green card application approved. For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years. Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{looked at}} the {{relationships}} among posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status (SES) in a newly formed PTSD program at the Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, VA. METHODS: We reviewed 265 records and then selected only black and white male veterans (n= 252) for study. Variables were: 1) age, 2) decade of life, 3) height, 4) weight, 5) sex, 6) race, and 7) SES (estimated using <b>priority</b> group <b>status).</b> Low income is an important variable determining <b>priority</b> group <b>status.</b> RESULTS: About two-thirds of the veterans were in the age range of 50 - 59 years (Vietnam veterans). Their mean BMI was 30. 2 +/- 5. 6 kg/m 2, and this value did not separate by race. Far exceeding national numbers, 84. 1 % of our veterans were either overweight or obese. Veterans in the lower priority groups had greater (p= 0. 029) BMIs {{than their counterparts in}} higher priority groups. CONCLUSIONS: The pervasiveness of overweight and obesity in our PTSD population was profound. Our observations suggest that low SES is a likely contributor to veterans in lower priority groups having greater BMIs than veterans in higher priority groups...|$|R
