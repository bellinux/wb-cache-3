Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of <b>pigtails</b> and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side <b>pigtails,</b> and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveVarious {{types and}} {{materials}} of stents {{have been used}} for urinary diversion in hypospadias surgery. We evaluated whether double <b>pigtail</b> stents are superior to straight silicone stents. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent hypospadias surgery with straight silicone or double <b>pigtail</b> stents between November 1997 and October 2005. Comparisons were made between the two groups specifically with regard to the complication rates. ResultsA total of 86 patients were included. The complication rates in patients who received double <b>pigtail</b> stents were significantly reduced as compared with those who received straight silicon stents. There was less wound disruption associated with early stent dislodgement in the double <b>pigtail</b> group compared with the straight silicone group (3. 2 % vs. 17. 4 %, p< 0. 05). The rate of urethrocutaneous fistula was also lower in the double <b>pigtail</b> stent group (12. 7 % vs. 30. 4 %). Subjectively, there was also improved patient comfort and parent anxiety in the double <b>pigtail</b> stent group. ConclusionDouble <b>pigtail</b> stent is a suitable material for urinary diversion in hypospadias surgery. It not only reduces patient discomfort, but also decreases complication rates in hypospadias surgery...|$|R

5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept <b>pigtails</b> on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tube thoracostomy {{remains the}} {{standard}} of care {{for the treatment of}} pneumothoraces and simple effusions. This report describes a favorable experience with the 8. 3 French <b>pigtail</b> catheter as a less invasive alternative to traditional chest tube insertion. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 109 consecutive <b>pigtail</b> catheter placements. Catheters were inserted under local anesthesia at the bedside without radiographie guidance. Pre- and post-insertion chest radiographs were reviewed to determine efficacy of drainage. Results: Fifty-one of 109 patients (47 %) were mechanically ventilated and 26 patients (24 %) had a coagulopathy. There were no complications related to <b>pigtail</b> catheter insertion. Seventy-seven <b>pigtail</b> catheters were placed for pleural effusion and 32 for pneumothorax. Mean effusion volume decreased from 43 to 9 percent, and drainage averaged 2899 ml over 97 hours. Mean pneumothorax size diminished from 38 to 1 percent during an average 71 -hour placement. Clinical success rates in the effusion and pneumothorax groups were 86 and 81 percent, respectively. Conclusion: The <b>pigtail</b> catheter offers reliable treatment of pneumothoraces and simple effusions and is a safe and less invasive alternative to tube thoracostomy...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Robotic {{assisted}} pyeloplasty (RAP) {{is rapidly}} adopted by surgeons around the world. We present a unique complication of the technique, consisting of <b>pigtail</b> misplacement, which was endoscopically resolved. We discuss the clinical findings, differential diagnosis {{and principles of}} endoscopic treatment. Materials and Methods: A 41 years old female patients underwent transperitoneal right side RAP with the Hynes-Anderson technique for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. <b>Pigtail</b> was placed intraoperatively in an antegrade fashion. Post operative course appeared normal but Kidney-Ureterer-Bladder(KUB) X-ray, revealed a misplaced <b>pigtail.</b> Patient underwent a semirigid ureterorenoscopy demonstrating that the <b>pigtail</b> was exiting the collecting system in the rear line of suturing between continuous sutures. <b>Pigtail</b> was retrieved with a stone retrieval forceps with short upward motions in the renal pelvis under fluoroscopy and then removed from patient, {{in order to avoid}} stressing the anastomosis. No leakage was noted in fluoroscopy, a <b>pigtail</b> was correctly placed and patient recovery was uneventful. Results: Retrograde pyelography was the key to accurate diagnosis and endoscopic treatment, because the exact point of exit and anastomosis integrity were established. Retrieval of the <b>pigtail</b> was the most challenging part. Lack of proper visualization and mobilization of the rear part of the anastomosis during surgery, combined with lack of tactile feedback, because of robotic instrumentation, were of critical importance in the manifestation of such a mishap. Endoscopy facilitated case resolve, but proper handling is required to protect the anastomosis. Conclusions: The introduction of novel techniques can carry the burden of novel complications. A surgeon must always keep in mind the complications inherent to the technique {{and at the same time}} the limitations of the equipment used, especially the lack of tactile feedback in robotic instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|Pneumothorax is more {{frequent}} in the neonatal period, especially among premature infants. <b>Pigtail</b> catheters {{have been shown}} to be as effective as and less invasive than traditional chest tubes in adults; however, data regarding premature infants are limited. We aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and complications associated with the placement of traditional chest tubes versus <b>pigtail</b> catheters in premature infants with pneumothoraces. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of premature infants with pneumothorax seen in the neonatal intensive care unit of a single medical center over a period of 11 years, who were treated with either traditional chest tubes or <b>pigtail</b> catheters. Changes in the vital signs before and after the procedures were recorded in both groups. Data on age, sex, clinical presentation, procedure time, subsequent therapies, hospital days to discharge, success rate, and complications of the procedures were collected from medical records and compared between the two methods of intervention. Results: Eighty-six thoracostomies, including 60 <b>pigtail</b> catheters and 26 traditional chest tubes, were performed in 66 premature infants. The success rate, demographics, days of tube insertion, length of hospital stay, days of mechanical ventilation, type of oxygen supply, and insertion-related complications were not significantly different between the two groups. <b>Pigtail</b> catheter insertion required a shorter procedure time than the traditional chest tube insertion (14. 92 minutes vs. 25. 31 minutes, respectively, p <  0. 001). Conclusion: <b>Pigtail</b> catheters are a safe and effective alternative to traditional chest tubes for premature infants receiving treatment for pneumothoraces in a neonatal intensive care unit. Placement of <b>pigtail</b> catheters is an easy and quick bedside procedure and is particularly useful for premature infants who require immediate air drainage...|$|R

MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children with parapneumonic effusion {{during the period of}} July 2001 through December 2003. Patients who received thoracostomy with either chest tube or <b>pigtail</b> catheter were enrolled into this study. Medical records, such as age, sex, clinical presentation, subsequent therapies, hospital stay, laboratory data, and complications, were collected and compared between these two methods of intervention. ResultsA total of 32 patients (17 boys and 15 girls; age range, 2 – 17 years; mean age, 14 years) were enrolled into the study. Twenty patients were treated with traditional chest tubes, whereas 12 patients were treated with <b>pigtail</b> catheters.

40|$|Two {{juvenile}} <b>pigtailed</b> macaques (animals 1 and 2) received {{total body}} irradiation (TBI) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, by a procedure known to be well tolerated by baboons. In this procedure, the TBI consisted of treatment on two consecutive days with 255 cGy on one side, followed after 1 – 2 min by a similar dose on the other side. The two <b>pigtailed</b> macaques showed rapid haematopoietic engraftment, but succumbed either to systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and necrotising colitis or to haemorrhagic cystitis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. For four further <b>pigtailed</b> macaques (animals 3 – 6) the radiation procedure was changed to four equal doses of 255 cGy, given 6 – 12 h apart. Animals 4 – 6 all showed engraftment and survived for long periods (> 218 days), with no, or only minor treatable, complications. Animal 3 failed to show engraftment and succumbed to radiation-induced vascular lesions and severe multiorgan haemorrhages. The results suggest that <b>pigtailed</b> macaques have a lower tolerance threshold than baboons, rhesus macaques or human beings to TBI, the adverse effects of TBI being indistinguishable from those seen in human patients. The results also suggest that a hyperfractionated radiation procedure can prevent radiation-induced morbidity and mortality in <b>pigtailed</b> macaques...|$|R
