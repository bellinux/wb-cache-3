The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections.

2500|$|Preparing the Rebreather: The rebreather {{may require}} some {{assembly}} before use, {{and should be}} tested for correct function according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The scrubber canister must be filled with the correct amount of absorbent material, and the unit tested for leaks. Two leak tests are usually conducted. These are generally known as {{the positive and negative}} pressure tests, and test that the breathing loop is airtight for internal pressure lower and higher than the outside. The positive <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> ensures that the unit will not lose gas while in use, and the negative <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> ensures that water will not leak into the breathing loop where it can degrade the scrubber medium or the oxygen sensors.|$|E

30|$|Formation testing while {{drilling}} is {{an innovative}} technique that is replacing conventional <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> {{in which the}} fluid sampling is conducted {{in a relatively short}} time following the drilling. At this time, mud invasion has just started, mudcake has not formed entirely and the formation pressure is not stable. Therefore, it is important to study the influence of the downhole dynamic environment on <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> and fluid sampling. This paper applies an oil-water two phase finite element model to study the influence of mudcake quality and mud filtrate invasion on supercharge pressure, pretest and sampling in the reservoirs of different permeability. However, the study is only for the cases with water based mud in the wellbore. The results illustrate that the mudcake quality has a significant influence on the supercharge pressure and fluid sampling, while the level of mud filtrate invasion has a strong impact on <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> and sampling. In addition, in-situ formation <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> is more difficult in low permeability reservoirs as the mud filtrate invasion is deeper and therefore degrades the quality of fluid sampling. Finally, a field example from an oil field on the Alaskan North Slope is presented to validate the numerical studies of the effects of downhole dynamic conditions on formation testing while drilling.|$|R
