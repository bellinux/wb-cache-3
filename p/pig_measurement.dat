The viability test demonstrated a lethal effect on normal and immune mouse macrophages but not on those of the rabbit or guinea <b>pig.</b> <b>Measurement</b> of glycolsis indicated a significant degree of cytotoxicity in normal mouse macrophages ingesting lipid, a nonsignificant depression of activity in cells from immune mice, and no alteration {{in the activities of}} rabbit and guinea pig macrophages. Electron microscopy demonstrated that C. ovis surface lipid caused acute lethal injury in normal and immune mouse macrophages. The early stages of degeneration were typified by dilatation of the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi lamellae, and nuclear envelope, proceeding to focal disruption of various cell membranes, particularly those of the lipidcontaining phagolysosomes and nucleus. In contrast, over the 3 -h period of study, no cytotoxic change was evident in rabbit or guinea pig macrophages.

Hemorrhagic shock (HS) followed by volume resuscitation represents a similar scenario, whereby a whole organism is vulnerable to reperfusion injury. Design: We subjected male farm-bred landrace pigs (similar to 30 kg) to HS by withdrawing blood to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg for 60 minutes. Pigs were then resuscitated with shed blood and crystalloids for 60 minutes, and at this time, FX 06 (2. 4 mg/kg, n = 8) or vehicle control (phosphate buffered saline; 2. 4 mg/kg, n = 7) was injected as an intravenous bolus. Setting:  University hospital laboratory. Subjects:  Anesthetized male farm-bred landrace <b>pigs.</b> <b>Measurements</b> and Main Results:  Data are presented as mean +/- So. Five hours after resuscitation, controls presented acute lung injury (Pao(2) /Fio(2) -ratio * 400 mm Hg; extra-vascular lung water index: * 5. 2 +/- 2. 1 mL/kg, cardiac index: * 6. 3 +/- 1. 4 L/min/m(2); stroke volume index: * 51 +/- 11 mL/m(2); cardiac TnT levels: * 0. 11 +/- 0. 09 ng/mL; *p < 0. 05). Also, tissue oxygenation (tp 0 (2); mm Hg) was significantly improved during reperfusion in FX 06 -treated pigs when compared with controls (liver 51 +/- 4 vs. * 65 +/- 4; serosa 44 +/- 5 vs. * 55 +/- 7; mucosa 14 +/- 4 vs. * 26 4).

40|$|Induction of hepatic microsomal hydroxylative enzymes is an {{important}} aspect of detoxication of fat-soluble toxicants. The magnitude of induction depends on numerous factors, such as the nature and dose of toxicant as well as dietary factors. Research was conducted on (1) endrin tolerance in rats, (2) preliminary comparisons of inductive effects of various organochlorine pesticides in rats to select compounds for further study in guinea pigs, (3) general effects of various dietary factors on induction, and (4) effects of ascorbic acid deficiency on induction of hepatic microsomal hydroxylative enzymes by organochlorine pesticides in guinea <b>pigs.</b> <b>Measurements</b> were made of body weight gain, feed consumption, liver weight, in vivo and in vitroenzyme activities, and body levels of pesticides and vitamins. Tolerance developed in rats fed 25 ppm endrin in the diet. There was severe intoxication during the first week but complete recovery of rate of body weight gain and feed consumption occurred during the second week, in spite of continued ingestion of the endrin-containing diet. Induction of endrin-degrading microsomal enzymes was proposed as the mechanism for tolerance. Pretreatment with the potent inducer, dieldrin, diminished the severity of endrin intoxication. However, pretreatment with another inducer, phenobarbital, afforded less protection in proportion to the extent of microsomal enzyme induction. Organochlorine pesticides, tested for their inductive capacity in rats, in decreasing order of effectiveness then fed as 25 ppm of the diet for 15 days, were heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endrin, 1, 1 -Bis-(p-chlorophenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -Trichloroethane (DDT), Ovex, gamma-chlordane, and lindane. Of these, DDT and dieldrin were compared over the range of 1 to 50 ppm of the diet. Dieldrin was a more potent inducer at all dietary levels. At low doses both compounds produced greater induction when measured by hexobarbital sleep time than by the in vitro enzyme procedures. At high doses, the in vitro 0 -ethyl 0 -p-nitrophenyl phenyl-phosphonothioate (EPN) detoxication was a more responsive measure. Dieldrin, DDT, and lindane were fed to guinea pigs at 25 ppm of the diet for 15 days, but only dieldrin stimulated a significant level of induction. DDT antagonism of dieldrin storage seen in rats by Street (Sci. 146 : 1580, 1964) did not occur in guinea pigs, but rather dieldrin antagonized DDT storage. Some general dietary factors affecting induction in rats were observed. A semipurified diet lowered the baseline microsomal enzyme activity but supported induction as effectively as a conventional diet. Vitamin A at very high dietary levels induced enzyme activity; this induction was apparently additive to that produced by 1 ppm dieldrin. Other fat-soluble Vitamins produced inconsistent responses. Ascorbic acid deficiency in guinea pigs impaired induction by dieldrin. Impairment was seen by the second day on the deficient diet. However, dieldrin was able to produce a small amount of induction at all stages of deficiency. In frank scurvy, induction by DDT and lindane was completely blocked, but there was a moderate level of induction by dieldrin. Maintenance of maximum induction was related to dietary rather than liver levels of ascorbic acid; 50 ppm ascorbic acid in the diet was grossly inadequate while 200 ppm supported about 80 % of the induction produced by feeding 2000 ppm. It was concluded that (1) microsomal enzyme induction is important in resistance to organochlorine intoxication, (2) factors found in the normal diet can induce microsomal enzyme activity, (3) high dietary levels of ascorbic acid are necessary to support maximum induction, and (4) dieldrin is an inducer of such high potency that it can stimulate a limited amount of induction in spite of ascorbic acid deficiency...|$|R

Adhesiveness of samples on the non-stick base: PLGA, 0, 5 D and 1 D were approximately the same, 2 D was of lower value. The numbers of on the <b>pig</b> ear base <b>measurement</b> were multiple lower. There was a decrease of viscosity of the adhesive polymers in the order: PLGA, 0, 5 D, 1 D, 2 D...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Late {{asthmatic}} {{response is}} observed following antigen challenge in actively, but not passively, sensitized guinea pigs. Although cough reflex sensitivity is increased after antigen challenge in actively sensitized guinea pigs, {{it is unknown}} whether the antigen-induced increase in cough reflex sensitivity develops in passively sensitized animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin after an inhaled antigen challenge between actively and passively sensitized guinea <b>pigs.</b> Methods <b>Measurement</b> of number of coughs elicited by increasing concentrations of capsaicin (10 - 6 and 10 - 4 M) and bronchial responsiveness to ascending concentrations of methacholine, and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were separately performed 24 h after an antigen challenge in actively and passively sensitized guinea pigs. Results Percentage of eosinophils in BALF and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were increased 24 h after the antigen challenge in both actively and passively sensitized animals compared with saline-challenged actively and passively sensitized animals, respectively. Absolute number of eosinophils in BALF from actively sensitized and antigen-challenged guinea pigs was significantly greater than that from passively sensitized and antigen-challenged animals. Cough response to capsaicin and concentration of substance P in BALF were increased 24 h after the antigen challenge in actively sensitized guinea pigs, but not in passively sensitized guinea pigs. Bronchial responsiveness, cough reflex sensitivity and substance P concentration and total cells in BALF were increased in actively sensitized and saline challenged guinea pigs compared with passively sensitized and saline challenged animals. Conclusion The results suggest that active sensitization per se increases cough reflex sensitivity accompanied by increased inflammatory cells and substance P level in BALF, and antigen challenge further increases them, while simple IgE- and/or IgG-mediated allergic reaction per se or the low intensity of eosinophil infiltration in the airway itself may not affect cough reflex sensitivity in guinea pigs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{measurements}} of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations, including cortisol and corticosterone, serve as reliable indicators of adrenocortical activities and physiological stress loads {{in a variety}} of species. As an alternative to invasive analyses based on plasma, GC concentrations in saliva still represent single-point-of-time measurements, suitable for studying short-term or acute stress responses, whereas fecal GC metabolites (FGMs) reflect overall stress loads and stress responses after a species-specific time frame in the long-term. In our study species, the domestic guinea <b>pig,</b> GC <b>measurements</b> are commonly used to indicate stress responses to different environmental conditions, but the biological relevance of non-invasive measurements is widely unknown. We therefore established an experimental protocol based on the animals’ natural stress responses to different environmental conditions and compared GC levels in plasma, saliva, and fecal samples during non-stressful social isolations and stressful two-hour social confrontations with unfamiliar individuals. Plasma and saliva cortisol concentrations were significantly increased directly after the social confrontations, and plasma and saliva cortisol levels were strongly correlated. This demonstrates a high biological relevance of GC measurements in saliva. FGM levels measured 20 h afterwards, representing the reported mean gut passage time based on physiological validations, revealed that the overall stress load was not affected by the confrontations, but also no relations to plasma cortisol levels were detected. We therefore measured FGMs in two-hour intervals for 24 h after another social confrontation and detected significantly increased levels after four to twelve hours, reaching peak concentrations already after six hours. Our findings confirm that non-invasive GC <b>measurements</b> in guinea <b>pigs</b> are highly biologically relevant in indicating physiological stress responses compared to circulating levels in plasma in the short- and long-term. Our approach also underlines the importance of detailed investigations on how to use and interpret non-invasive measurements, including the determination of appropriate time points for sample collections...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate sources of errors in <b>pig</b> weight <b>measurements.</b> Three studies were conducted using data from one commercial New Zealand pig farm. In XChapter 4 X, finisher pigs fed ad libitum or via a computerized liquid feeding system were weighed four times a day over a fourday period. Results showed that standardization of weighing time reduced diurnal fluctuations in pig weight. However, multivariate analysis showed that there was a significant interaction between day and time of day, which indicates that diurnal fluctuations in live weight are not consistent between days, particularly in ad libitum fed pigs. Hence, XChapter 5 X investigated whether overnight feed withdrawal for 11 hours (weaners) or 17 hours (growers and finishers) is effective in reducing between-pig variation in live weight and growth rate. For grower and finisher pigs, feed withdrawal was associated with a reduction in variability in live weight and growth rate by up to 11. 5 %, whilst the effect was inconsistent in weaner pigs. It is recommended to repeat the investigation on other farms to assess long-term effects on pig performance before general recommendations can be made. XChapter 6 X compared the magnitude of sampling error when sampling pens from batches of pigs, using different sample sizes and sampling methods. Increasing the portion of randomly selected pens reduced the sampling error, but in a diminishing manner. Purposive selection of two pens reduced sampling error by more than 64 % compared with random sampling. However, purposive sampling introduces the risk of obtaining biased estimates. Thus, it is recommended to select pens from batches at random. These results may be used as an educational tool to demonstrate how to minimize errors in pig weights. Collecting more accurate weight records is likely to lead to improved interpretability of pig weights, and may promote better use of production data...|$|R
40|$|Ribs from sheep, goat and pig {{are rarely}} assessed  to species {{due to the}} fact that they are very similar in their {{morphology}} and size. The ribs are instead considered unidentifiable although it is possible to see what kind of bone it is. If these ribs would be identified to species not only would species assessment degree of archaeological source material   increase, the relationship between meat-rich and meat poor regions would change. To find out whether there are morphologically measurable differences between sheep, goat and <b>pig</b> ribs, three <b>measurement</b> points on each rib has been defined and measured. At each measurement point two measurements were measured, one medial-lateral measurement and one cranial-caudal measurement. The ratio between the medial- lateral measurement and the cranial-caudal measurement was calculated for each point. In this way, it is not the size variation between species that are studied, but its morphology. There are statistically differences between the species. Sheep and pig   have significant differences in 11 pairs of ribs. Goat and pig also have significant differences in 11 pairs of ribs. Sheep and goat are significantly different in five pairs of ribs. The results of this study could be used to develop a method for the assessment of sheep, goat and pig based on ribs...|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of sensitive structures (e. g., nerves) from iatrogenic damage is of major importance when performing laser surgical procedures. Especially {{in the head}} and neck area both function and esthetics can be affected to a great extent. Despite its many benefits, the surgical utilization of a laser is therefore still limited to superficial tissue ablation. A remote feedback system which guides the laser in a tissue-specific way would provide a remedy. In this context, it has been shown that nerval structures can be specifically recognized by their optical diffuse reflectance spectra both before and after laser ablation. However, for a translation of these findings to the actual laser ablation process, a nerve protection within the laser pulse is of utmost significance. Thus, it was the aim of the study to evaluate, if the process of Er:YAG laser surgery—which comes with spray water cooling, angulation of the probe (60 °) and optical process emissions—interferes with optical tissue differentiation. For the first time, no stable conditions but the ongoing process of laser tissue ablation was examined. Therefore, six different tissue types (nerve, skin, muscle, fat, cortical and cancellous bone) were acquired from 15 <b>pig</b> heads. <b>Measurements</b> were performed during Er:YAG laser ablation. Diffuse reflectance spectra (4500, wavelength range: 350 – 650 nm) where acquired. Principal component analysis (PCA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) were calculated for classification purposes. The clinical highly relevant differentiation between nerve and bone was performed correctly with an AUC of 95. 3 % (cortial bone) respectively 92. 4 % (cancellous bone). The identification of nerve tissue against the biological very similar fat tissue yielded good results with an AUC value of 83. 4 % (sensitivity: 72. 3 %, specificity: of 82. 3 %). This clearly demonstrates that nerve identification by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy works reliably in the ongoing process of laser ablation in spite of the laser beam, spray water cooling and the tissue alterations entailed by tissue laser ablation. This is an essential step towards a clinical utilization...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess baroreflex {{intervention}} during {{increase in}} left ventricular afterload, {{we compared the}} effects of aortic banding on the intact cardiovascular system and under hexamethonium infusion. Methods: Six open-chest <b>pigs,</b> instrumented for <b>measurement</b> of aortic pressure and flow, left ventricular pressure and volume, were studied under pentobarbital-sufentanil anesthesia. Vascular arterial properties were estimated with a four-element windkessel model. Left ventricular contractility was assessed by the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship. Results: The effects of aortic banding on mechanical aortic properties were unaffected by autonomic nervous system inhibition. However, increase in peripheral arterial vascular resistance and in heart rate were prevented by hexamethonium. Aortic banding increased left ventricular contractility and stroke work. Left ventricular-arterial coupling remained unchanged, but mechanical efficiency was impaired. These ventricular changes were independent of baroreflex integrity. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that an augmentation in afterload has a composite effect on left ventricular function. Left ventricular performance is increased, as demonstrated by increase in contractility and stroke work, but mechanical efficiency is decreased. These changes are observed independently of baroreflex integrity. Such mechanisms of autoregulation, independent of the autonomic nervous system, are of paramount importance in heart transplant patients. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All fights reserved.
