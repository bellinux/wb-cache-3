Therefore, the laboratory operated by CERN is commonly referred to as the European laboratory for particle physics (Laboratoire européen pour la physique des <b>particules),</b> which better describes the research being performed there.|$|E
2500|$|A popular {{misconception}} is {{that the}} particule De- included in the name always indicates membership of the nobility, {{that is to say}} an original separated de that was linked to the name during the French revolution as De-. That is sometimes true. Almost all nobility titles are of the form [...] : for instance, Louis, duc d'Orléans ("Louis, duke of Orléans"), or simply Louis d'Orléans. However, many non-noble people also have <b>particules</b> in their names, simply because they indicate some geographic origin or property. An example from current political life is Dominique de Villepin. Former president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's father had his surname legally changed from [...] "Giscard" [...] to [...] "Giscard d'Estaing" [...] in 1922, claiming the name of a family line extinct since the French Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{names with}} <b>particules</b> {{are made of}} a normal family name {{and the name of}} an estate (or even of several estates). Thus, Dominique de Villepin is Dominique Galouzeau de Villepin; Hélie de Saint Marc is Hélie Denoix de Saint Marc (in both cases, omitting second or other given names). As in these examples, most people with such long family names shorten their name for common use by keeping only the first estate name (such as Viscount Philippe Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon, {{assuming}} in everyday life the name of Philippe de Villiers) or, in some cases, only the family name. Whether the family name or the estate name is used for the shortened form depends on a variety of factors: how people feel bearing a particule (people may for instance dislike the connotations of nobility that the particule entails; on the other hand, they may enjoy the impression of nobility), tradition, etc. For instance, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is never referred to as [...] "d'Estaing", probably because his particule is a recent addition to the family surname by his father. On the contrary, he is often simply referred to in the press as [...] "Giscard".|$|E
2500|$|Pierre Pigneau {{was born}} in Origny-en-Thiérache (later Aisne, France), where the family of his mother lived.

2500|$|Some French {{last names}} include the word De- ("of") or Du- (contraction for de + le = [...] "of the"), {{when it is}} {{masculine}} and De la- when it is feminine, but there are regional variations : in the North of France Du- is often rendered by Dele- and in the South of France Del-. When de is separated it {{is known as a}} particle. A particle de should not be alphabetized in name lists, whereas a <b>particule</b> du should be because it results from the contraction of an article. The <b>particule</b> generally indicates some land or feudal origin, but this is not always the case. The name de Gaulle, for example, is not a traditional French name with a <b>particule,</b> but a Flemish Dutch name evolved from a form of [...] "De Walle" [...] meaning [...] "the wall".|$|R
