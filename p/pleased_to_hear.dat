5|$|When Bart is sent by {{his captors}} into town {{to buy a}} case of antifreeze, he sees a gendarme and tries to ask for help, but the gendarme does not {{understand}} English and only gives Bart a piece of candy. Bart walks away, despairing over his own stupidity, then suddenly begins speaking French to himself. Realizing he has become fluent in the language, he runs back to the gendarme and tells him about the winemakers, who are swiftly arrested and Bart finishes his stay in France being hailed as a hero. He is awarded a medal for his bravery and he is kissed by a French beauty queen. Back in Springfield, Adil is caught by the FBI, forcing him to be deported back to Albania {{in exchange for their}} own child spy. Bart returns to his family, bringing them gifts from France. Back at home trying out the gifts, Homer has difficulty opening a wine bottle, but is <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Bart speak French, oblivious that Bart has just called him a buffoon.|$|E

Moyer warned WFM organizer Thomas Strizich on March 25, 1913, against calling a strike prematurely:I was much <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of the progress being made {{in the way of}} organizing in Michigan and sincerely trust that the men there will realize the importance, in fact the absolute necessity, of deferring action that may precipitate a conflict with the employers until they have practically a thorough organization.|$|E

Campbell had a short spell at West Ham United, beginning {{his career as a}} striker. He left the Youth programme at Upton Park after a coach joked to him that Campbell would be <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that the West Indies were beating England at cricket; Campbell took this to be a racial slur.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of 1538, when the troops were {{exhausted}} after almost two years in foreign terrain, the soldiers asked what was their payment for the conquest they had done. De Quesada divided the conquered treasures over his men; 40,000 pieces of fine gold, 562 emeralds and tumbaga (gold-copper-silver alloys). Foot soldiers received 520 pieces each, horse riders the double amount, captains 2080 pieces, generals 3640 and some pieces were given as prizes for the most distinguished soldiers. Masses were organised to honour the many dead soldiers during the campaign {{and part of the}} treasure was given to Juan de las Casas. De Quesada was not <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about the advancement of another group of conquistadors in the east, led by Nikolaus Federmann, coming from later Venezuela across the Llanos Orientales. Another team of conquerors, commanded by Sebastián de Belalcázar, was coming from the south, originating from Quito. Gonzalo sent Hernán to meet the southern group who had traveled through the hot valley of Neiva.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Peter and Walter {{discover}} the parasite has slowly worked its roots into Loeb's circulatory system and extended through the IV into the IV drip; they estimate Loeb has {{a day to}} live. After meeting with old friend Lucas Vogel (Billy Burke), Olivia is able to secure a meeting with Jones, who knows the cure to the parasite slowly killing Loeb. Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) finds a sheet of code in Loeb's briefcase listing agents from their field office. They suspect another mole with access to high level security clearances and tie it to a Joseph Smith, previously mentioned by Loeb as a suspected mole after the truck mission failure. Although she {{is not able to}} talk with Jones at first, he arranges for Olivia to be given a piece of paper with instructions demanding he first speak to Smith, a colleague of his, before he helps her. Smith is unfortunately killed soon after in a raid set up by Broyles. Walter, however, devises a way to wire Peter into the dead man's brain, enabling Peter to speak on his behalf without Jones knowing Smith is dead. Smith's [...] "response" [...] is [...] "little hill," [...] which is an answer Jones seems <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Jones duly tells Olivia a formula for the parasite, and the subsequent procedure is successful. The parasite is removed, but the team does not realize that the entire incident was orchestrated by Loeb and his wife to get the information Peter extracted from Smith. The final scene shows Samantha Loeb whispering [...] "little hill" [...] into her husband's ear at the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there is}} no further record of Salazar coming to England, these {{instructions}} may have seemed genuine, as the Imperial ambassador to France in 1549, Jean de Saint Mauris, had reported that the French court were <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of Thomas Seymour's arrest, and hoped a [...] "pernicious struggle" [...] in England would help conclude their Scottish undertaking. Saint Mauris wrote that the House of Guise helped military preparations to this end. Protector Somerset was informed that a messenger sent to France in January 1549 by Henry Cornysshe, Captain of Jersey, saw the Duke of Guise's preparations in Brittany, which Cornysshe judged were for Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was not an}} idle encomium on Mancini’s part when {{he spoke}} that Antonio ‘mostrò gran segni di dover venir grande’. All the same, {{it was easy for}} his {{identity}} to be subsumed to that of elder Carracci. Because he shared the same initials as his father and uncle, and because the Carracci often collaborated, paintings by them were often confused. When Padre Resta gave the drawing of the Deluge, which he had had from Bellori, to Max Emmanuel of Bavaria, he was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that the Elector treasured the gift and kept it on a table at his bedside; but ‘lo teneva per pittura d’Annibale’.|$|E

60|$|Just {{opposite}} my abode in Rurúkan was the schoolhouse. The schoolmaster was a native, educated by the Missionary at Tomohón. School {{was held}} every morning {{for about three}} hours, and twice {{a week in the}} evening there was catechising and preaching. There was also a service on Sunday morning. The children were all taught in Malay, and I often heard them repeating the multiplication-table, up to twenty times twenty, very glibly. They always wound up with singing, and it was very <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> many of our old psalm-tunes in these remote mountains, sung with Malay words. Singing is one of the real blessings which Missionaries introduce among savage nations, whose native chants are almost always monotonous and melancholy.|$|R

You will remember the period when these orders were issued, namely, the period at which the act passed for the better direction of the servants of the Company. By this act Mr. Hastings was appointed to be Governor-General, and the Court of Directors was required by that act to prepare orders and instructions, which Mr. Hastings was required by the same act to comply with.

2500|$|His {{increasing}} {{reputation as}} both performer and improviser {{continued to make}} Franck much in demand for inaugural or dedicatory recitals of new or rebuilt Cavaillé-Coll organs: Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély's new instrument at Saint-Sulpice (1862) and later for organs at Notre-Dame, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, and La Trinité; {{for some of these}} instruments, Franck had acted (by himself or with Camille Saint-Saëns) as consultant. [...] At his own church, people began to come to hear the improvisations for the Mass and the Office. [...] In addition, Franck began to give [...] "organ-concerts" [...] or recitals at Sainte-Clotilde of his own works and those of other composers. [...] Perhaps his most notable concert arose from the attendance at a Sunday Mass in April 1866 of Franz Liszt, who sat in the choir to listen to Franck's improvisations and afterward said [...] "How could I ever forget the man who wrote those trios?" [...] To which Franck is supposed to have murmured a little sadly, [...] "I fancy I have done rather better things since then.". [...] Liszt organized a concert at Sainte-Clotilde to promote Franck's organ works later that month, which was well received by its listeners and well reported in the musical journals. [...] Despite his comment about the trios, Franck was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that not only Liszt but Hans von Bülow was including them in concerts in Germany on a regular basis. [...] Franck reinforced his understanding of German organ music and how it should be played by hearing Anton Bruckner at Notre-Dame in 1869. [...] He began to have a regular circle of pupils, who were there ostensibly for organ study but showed increasing interest in Franck's compositional techniques.|$|E
2500|$|The churchyard {{was already}} nearly full by 1850, when it {{acquired}} local fame after influential theologian, sermon writer and well-known preacher Rev. Frederick William Robertson started visiting and walking there. [...] He remarked [...] "I was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{not a single}} human soul far or near ... above {{there were a few}} dense clouds, edged with light, sailing across a marvellous blue ... I heard nothing but the sea, falling with a most dissonant, heavy, endless clang upon the shore". [...] At the time the area was much more extensive: graves ran beyond the present south wall on the site of Church Road. [...] The churchyard gained another [...] in 1858, but even this was filled soon afterwards. [...] Further burials were prohibited from 1883, by which time Hove Cemetery was open. [...] With the churchyard's importance diminished, a controversial plan to reduce its size at the southern end and extend Church Road through it was announced in 1895. [...] Work began in July of that year, and more than 300 bodies were dug up and moved to Hove Cemetery. [...] Many of the gravestones and memorials were destroyed during this work. [...] The northern section became overgrown and unsafe, and in 1972 [...] were dug up and built over when a new school was built. [...] As before, many gravestones were destroyed, although the family tomb of Charles Brownlow, 2nd Baron Lurgan and four relatives was saved and re-erected in Hove Cemetery. [...] During the 1980s, a new parish hall was built near the church, and more land was taken from the churchyard. [...] In 2002, a section alongside the north wall was created for the burial of cremated remains.|$|E
2500|$|Victor Entertainment {{contacted}} Shōnen Gahōsha about adapting Excel Saga into an anime, and the {{two companies}} approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was [...] "conveyed just as words", and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the [...] "swirling, talking cosmos". He also increased Pedro's role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that [...] "Pedro's situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan". The anime production staff was given the freedom to do anything they wanted {{as long as they}} kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga. The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto. Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen {{to play the role of}} Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi's rapid delivery of her lines, saying that [...] "she really pushed herself to the limit and beyond". He also says, [...] "at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match the lip-synch". In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib. At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting [...] "amazing" [...] and was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> his favourite voice actors read lines from his work.|$|E
