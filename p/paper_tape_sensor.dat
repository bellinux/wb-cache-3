5000|$|In {{the middle}} era, various <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> [...] "operating systems" [...] were developed. Many utility {{programs}} became available on <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> PAL-8 assembly language source code was often stored on <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> read into memory, and saved to <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> PAL assembled from <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> into memory. <b>Paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{versions of a}} number of programming languages were available, including DEC's FOCAL interpreter and a 4K FORTRAN compiler and runtime.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>tapes</b> {{constructed}} from punched cards were widely {{used throughout the}} 19th century for controlling looms. Perforated <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> were first used by Basile Bouchon in 1725 to control looms. However, the <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801 Joseph Marie Jacquard had developed machines to create <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> by tying punched cards in a sequence. The resulting <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> also called a [...] "chain of cards", was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair. (See Jacquard loom).|$|R
50|$|The BRPE tape punches {{operate at}} 110 {{characters}} per second, with two adjustable-level versions for reading either 5 or 8-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or 6, 7 or 8-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> A fixed-level 6-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch was also available. All BRPE version <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punches were packaged for table-top use {{and have a}} parallel contact interface which is wired directly to the punch electromagnetic coils.|$|R
50|$|The {{system used}} both a 512-word mercury delay line and {{magnetic}} tape for memory, and for data input, {{the system was}} equipped to process Flexowriter <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (at a rate of 1 word/second), magnetic wire (40 words/second), Raytheon magnetic tape (250 words/second), and <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (150 characters/second). The system could output to Flexowriter <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (at a rate of 1 word/second), magnetic wire (20 words/second), or <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (180 characters/second).|$|R
5000|$|Optionally, the AN-1 [...] "Universal Code Accessory" [...] {{included}} the [...] "35-4" [...] Friden Flexowriter and HSR-8 <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader and HSP-8 <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch. The mechanical reader and punch can process <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> {{up to eight}} channels wide at 110 characters per second.|$|R
50|$|Programs {{had to be}} {{walked to}} NC controls, {{generally}} on <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> NC controls had <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers precisely for this purpose. Many companies were still punching programs on <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> well into the 1980s, more than twenty-five years after its elimination in the computer industry.|$|R

50|$|A <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader, the IBM 2671, was {{introduced}} in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader and <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch from an earlier era, available only as RPQs (Request Price Quotation). The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 Teleprocessing System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.|$|R
5000|$|Punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{was used}} by the {{newspaper}} industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices such as a linotype. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> rather than the linotype operator having to retype all the incoming wire stories, the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> could be put into a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader on the linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the Friden Flexowriter, to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of the Linotype/hot lead, many early [...] "offset" [...] devices had <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers on them to produce the news-story copy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>tape</b> input at 200 {{characters}} {{per second}} (cps), <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> output at about 50 cps or teleprinter output at 10 cps. Four magnetic tape units added in 1958 ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, {{computer-aided}} manufacturing equipment often used <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{was a very}} important storage medium for computer-controlled wire-wrap machines, for example. A <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader was smaller and much less expensive than hollerith card or magnetic tape readers. Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and Mylar film tape were invented so that production tapes for these machines would last longer.|$|R
50|$|The DX <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers {{operate at}} any speed up to 360 {{characters}} per second via external timing, except EIA. EIA tape readers operate at 120 {{characters per second}} if internal timing is used, and up to 314 characters per second if external timing is used. All of the DX <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or chadless <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> The DX series of <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.|$|R
50|$|Vernam ciphers {{were invented}} in 1917 to encrypt {{teleprinter}} communications using a key stored on <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> During {{the last third}} of the 20th century, the National Security Agency used punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> to distribute cryptographic keys. The eight-level <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a fill device, such as the hand held KOI-18, that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system (EKMS), but as of 2016, <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> is apparently still being employed.|$|R
50|$|The only input was a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{reader and}} the only outputs were the console printer and <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch. As the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch was much faster than the printer, most output was punched, and then listed on an {{off-line}} printer. This Iowa State machine {{should not be confused}} with the Atanasoff-Berry Computer of the late 1930s- Neither John Vincent Atanasoff nor Clifford Berry worked on this machine.|$|R
50|$|TELCOMP {{programs}} were normally input via a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader on a Teletype Model 33, {{which would be}} connected to a PDP via a modem and acoustic telephone line. Data could be read from the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader or from the Teletype keyboard. Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch. Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, Western Union {{introduced}} Plan 55-A, {{the first}} automatic electromechanical {{store and forward}} message switching system. All message storage was performed by <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punches paired with <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers, with a bin in between.|$|R
50|$|At {{various times}} and in various configurations, flexos came with 5, 6, 7 or 8 channel <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader/punches, could have several {{auxiliary}} <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> units attached, and could also attach to IBM punched card equipment.|$|R
50|$|The 4100 <b>Paper</b> <b>Tape</b> Equipment {{consists}} of the 4110 series of synchronous <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers (CX), 4120 series of synchronous punches (BRPE), 4130 series of asynchronous readers (DX) and the 4140 series of asynchronous punches (DRPE).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{mechanism}} {{consisted of}} two reels which passed a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> across a reading device that actuated a set of contacts which changed state dependent on {{the presence or absence}} of hole punches in the tape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>tape</b> (device 20).|$|R
50|$|Backing {{store was}} {{magnetic}} drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column punched cards and optionally 160-column punched cards and punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> Output was to 80-column punched cards, line printer, and optionally to punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{high-speed}} photoelectric <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader (250 hexadecimal digits {{per second}} on five-channel <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> for the PR-1; 400 characters from 5-8 channel tape for the PR-2) read programs (and occasionally saved data) from tapes that were often mounted in cartridges for easy loading and unloading. Not unlike magnetic <b>tape,</b> the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> data are blocked into runs of 108 words or less since {{that is the}} maximum read size. A cartridge can contain many multiple blocks, up to 2500 words (~10 kilobytes).|$|R
50|$|A related {{example is}} based on a loader for a Nicolet Instrument Corporation {{minicomputer}} of the 1970s, using the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader-punch unit on a Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter. The bytes of its second-stage loader are read from <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> in reverse order.|$|R
5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used fanfold <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> rather than rolled <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> format.|$|R
40|$|PDPGENER~enables {{the user}} to {{generate}} original program listings and source decks from machine readable PDP- 9 /L computer object code in either card or <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> form. The reconstructed listings contain alphanumeric labelling and complete cross reference tables. PDPGENER may {{also be used to}} update and punch new card object decks from card or <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> input, thus eliminating slow <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> input to the PDP- 9 /L. Users of other small computers may also edit object decks by specifying the object card format to PDPGENER...|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Model 28 RT Set is {{punched tape}} message and data relay set that receives, punches, prints, stores, reads and transmits five-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> The {{receiving}} unit accepts incoming electrical signals and punches and prints the intelligence on five-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> The sending unit reads and translates the taped intelligence into electrical impulses for transmission either cross-office or cross-country. The <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers and punches can be geared at {{speeds up to}} 200 words-per-minute. Gears are also available for slower speed operation at 60, 75 or 100 words-per-minute. Optional three-speed gear-shift mechanisms are also available for manual speed change operation at speeds of 60, 75 and 100 words-per-minute. The tape handling unit contains a large capacity tape supply reel capable of storing up to 3000 feet of <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> an intermediate tape storage bin that handles approximately 100 feet of <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> and a tape winder reel that will store 1000 feet of <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> The Model 28 RT Set, less cabinet, is 35 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 20 inches deep and weighs 110 pounds. The Model 20 RT Set cabinet, which houses up to two RT Sets, is 60 inches high, 28 inches wide and 27 inches deep and weighs 300 pounds. The RT Set cabinets may be side mounted.|$|R
40|$|Device {{automatically}} bench tests <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punches {{and readers}} in a simulated operating environment following routine maintenance.

50|$|The {{ability to}} support diverse {{encodings}} meant that adapting Flexowriters {{to generate the}} <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> used to drive CNC machine tool equipment was a relatively simple affair, and many Flexowriters found homes in machine shops into the 1970s, when magnetic media displaced <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> in the industry.|$|R
50|$|TRASK is a fully {{transistorized}} mainframe {{intended for}} scientific calculations. It consists of central units in cabinets, two Facit ECM-64 carousel memories, Ampex memory unit (in a 19-inch rack, standing {{on top of}} the cabinets), <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers, <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> puncher, typewriter, maneuver panel and a desk.|$|R
5000|$|Ease of destruction. In {{the case}} of {{cryptographic}} keys, the inherent flammability (sometimes enhanced by using flash <b>paper)</b> of <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> was an asset. Once the key had been loaded into the device, the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> could simply be burned, preventing the key from falling into enemy hands.|$|R
5000|$|Hugh V. Hayes, the inventor, wrote [...] Every <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{canister}} is unique. This uniqueness {{is accomplished}} during the manufacturing process, the plastic {{flowing into the}} mold creates unique flow patterns throughout the entire <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> canister thereby {{making it impossible to}} duplicate eliminating the possibility of substitution.|$|R
5000|$|The ICT 1900 series Algol I/O version allowed {{input from}} <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or punched card. <b>Paper</b> <b>tape</b> 'full' mode allowed lower case.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the three Americans' system for telegraphy, which {{was first used}} in about 1844, was {{designed}} to make indentations on a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> when electric currents were received. Morse's original telegraph receiver used a mechanical clockwork to move a <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> When an electrical current was received, an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> making an indentation on the tape. When the current was interrupted, a spring retracted the stylus, and {{that portion of the}} moving tape remained unmarked.|$|R
