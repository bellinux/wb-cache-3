50|$|Climate policy, as it {{has been}} {{understood}} and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto <b>Protocol</b> <b>approach,</b> has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years. The underlying {{reason for this is that}} the UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009. However, the currently dominant approach has acquiredimmense political momentum because of the quantities of political capital sunk into it. But in any case the UNFCCC/Kyoto model of climate policy cannot continue because it crashed in late 2009.

50|$|RTI is {{a general}} {{education}} process that is used in schools to ensure students receive the supports {{they need to be}} successful and excel in school. In the educational literature, RTI {{is often referred to as}} a Standard <b>Protocol</b> <b>Approach,</b> as a Problem Solving Model., or as a hybrid of the two. However, some have challenged a dichotomous view of RTI because both models incorporate problem solving to identify the academic or social-emotional difficulty the student is having and both use a systematic, universal screening procedure during Tier 1 to determine which students are having difficulties meeting age or grade level benchmarks for a specific skill. Typically, Curriculum Based Measurement (CBM) or other predictive data are used to flag the students who are not meeting expected levels of performance. In the problem-solving model approach, the teacher typically refers the student to a problem-solving team to ascertain the challenges a student is having within the classroom. Using information collected from the classroom teacher and others, observations, etc., the team determines what additional supports the student might need to address the learning gap. Standard-protocol approaches tend to rely more on grade-level teams and professional learning communities to make intervention decisions, but both approaches use a problem-solving procedure to make decisions, which makes the distinction somewhat meaningless. Many schools rely on grade-level teams to make intervention decision and use a standardized intervention for tier 2, but then rely on a problem-solving team to develop individualized interventions for tier 3.|$|E

Video streams are delay sensitive and require seamless flow for continuous visualization. Properly designed buffers offer a solution to queuing delay. The diagonally opposite QoS metrics associated with video traffic poses an optimization problem, {{in the design of}} buffers. This paper is a continuation of our previous work [1] and deals with the design of buffers. It aims at finding the optimum buffer size for enhancing QoS offered to video traffic. Network-centric QoS provisioning approach, along with hybrid transport layer <b>protocol</b> <b>approach</b> is adopted, to arrive at an optimum size which is independent of RTT. In this combinational approach, buffers of routers and end devices are designed to satisfy the various QoS parameters at the transport layer.

Such an all-encompassing approach well serves to bolster both the normative and policy framework for effecting anti-pollution marine law in the region. ...|$|R

A metaobject protocol provides a framework for CLOS implementations by specifying the hierarchy of these classes and the order and contents of the communication among their instances.

40|$|A methodological {{approach}} to process intensification (PI) {{has been developed}} {{to aid in the}} design of intensified chemical processes. Current process development procedures fail to consider if, and how, a chemical process can be intensified, resulting in limited application of PI in the chemicals industry. The PI methodology has been developed to meet these needs, focusing upon the chemical reaction stages of a process. The PI methodology is a paper-based tool, based around a flowsheet known as the framework. Throughout development, the methodology was applied to industrial case studies which revealed considerations that {{should be included in the}} methodology and aided in determining its format. Each section of the framework contains checklists and procedures detailing the information required and the decisions to be made by the participants, who should be in a multi-disciplinary team. Examination of chemical reaction kinetics and the effects of mixing upon the reaction are key aspects of the methodology that are normally not examined during process development. Incorporated within the methodology is a PI experimental protocol designed to model PI operation in the laboratory. Mixing theory was reviewed to identify that the <b>protocol</b> <b>approach</b> should be based upon recreating the mixing conditions experienced in a full scale plant within a small scale laboratory stirred vessel. The developed laboratory protocol utilises semi-batch operation in a highly-mixed stirred vessel of 10 cm diameter and height with twin pitched-blade turbine impellers. Turbulent energy dissipation rates of 150 W/kg can be achieved in the vessel.
