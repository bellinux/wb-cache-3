50|$|A {{post box}} (British English; also written postbox), {{also known as}} a {{collection}} box, mailbox, letter box or drop box (American English) is a physical box into which members of the public can deposit outgoing mail intended for collection by the agents of a country's postal service. The term post box can also refer to a <b>private</b> <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> for incoming mail.|$|E
50|$|The {{front wing}} of the Post Office section was {{originally}} divided into rooms for the savings bank and money order office, delivery room and the <b>private</b> <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> office by partitions of cedar with embossed panels. The delivery room of the new Post Office introduced an innovation in customer service by installing a counter in order to hand correspondence to the public {{instead of the usual}} method of serving through a small window.|$|E
5000|$|As {{viewed from}} Ellen Street, the Port Pirie Post Office is a double-storey, {{symmetrical}} composition of rendered brick construction {{with a central}} pediment break front. The central bay is flanked {{by a pair of}} arched entrances, and the ground floor dado is defined by heavily rusticated banding and voussoirs to each of the three arched openings at that level. The central bay has since been opened to the flanking porches to provide a continuous ‘loggia’ in front of <b>private</b> <b>letter</b> <b>box</b> bays. The northern porch provides the main entrance to the present post shop, a conversion of the former mail room, which is defined by a roof lantern. The southern porch has been screened by a covered walkway on the south side, linking the front loggia with a 1960s wing to the south of the main building which is also fronted by private box bays. The original private entrance is located at the junction of these wings.|$|E

5000|$|Following the Federation of Australia, Postmaster General's Department was {{established}} in 1901, after which {{the responsibility for the}} Fortitude Valley Post Office was transferred to the Australian Government. Minor alterations were made to the ground floor interior in 1909 and again in 1925. It was around this time that the post office took on the ancillary responsibility of social security payments. A report prepared by the Acting District Inspector in November 1929 stated that 1,205 pensions were being paid weekly from the Fortitude Valley Post Office and it was understood that this was, with one exception, the heaviest pensions paying centre in Australia at the time. Documentation of the removal of the mansard roofs and cast concrete capitals from the Fortitude Valley Post Office has not been found; however, it is believed to have occurred prior to 1949. Pressure from the Australian Government to expand facilities eventually led to the vacation of the postmaster from the first floor [...] It was proposed that the rooms be used for a Telegraph and Despatch room and staff facilities; however the area was used minimally thereafter. In 1958 major alterations were carried out on the entire building. Amongst these changes was the introduction of a stairwell in the main entrance vestibule, <b>private</b> <b>letter</b> <b>boxes</b> in the smaller vestibule off Ann Street, removal of all interior walls on the first floor and the partial rebuilding of the service wing at the rear. Further alterations, carried in 1970, caused the rear wing to be completely demolished and replaced with a larger two-storey wing that abuts Ballow Street. Substantial reorganisation of the original post office's interior was also carried out at this time. Suspended ceilings were introduced in some areas of the ground floor at this time.|$|R

The controlling authority of regulations and revenue rulings allows taxpayers to rely on them. A <b>private</b> <b>letter</b> ruling {{is good for the}} taxpayer to whom it is issued, and gives some explanation of the Service's position on a particular tax issue. [...] Additionally, a <b>private</b> <b>letter</b> ruling reasonably relied upon by a taxpayer allows for the waiver of penalties for underpayment of tax.|$|R
