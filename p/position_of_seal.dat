40|$|Development in {{foraging}} behaviour {{and dietary}} intake of many vertebrates are age-structured. Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource utilization. Such life-history traits {{have important implications}} in interpreting tropho-dynamic linkages. Stable isotope ratios in the whiskers of sub-yearling southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; n = 12) were used, in conjunction with satellite telemetry and environmental data, to examine their foraging habitat and diet during their first foraging migration. The trophic <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> from Macquarie Island (54 ° 30 'S, 158 ° 57;E) was estimated using stable carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) ratios {{along the length of}} the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake. Satellite-relayed data loggers provided details on seal movement patterns, which were related to isotopic concentrations along the whisker. Animals fed in waters south of the Polar Front (> 60 °S) or within Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Statistical Subareas 88. 1 and 88. 2, as indicated by both their depleted δ¹³C (<- 20 %) values, and tracking data. They predominantly exploited varying proportions of mesopelagic fish and squid, and crustaceans, such as euphausiids, which have not been reported as a prey item for this species. Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class <b>of</b> <b>seals.</b> Isotopic assessment and concurrent tracking <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> are successfully used here to identify ontogenetic shifts in broad-scale foraging habitat use and diet preferences in a highly migratory predator. 17 page(s...|$|R

Includes bibliographical references. order to determine the flow characteristics and leakage resistance properties <b>of</b> advanced labyrinth <b>seals.</b> A unique water test facility is used to acquire leakage resistance measurements for two-dimensional, planar models <b>of</b> multi-cavity, stepped <b>seal</b> geometries. The test-section includes a series of 100 : I scale, acrylic models of actual rotor and stator elements. Adjustable external controls allow individual <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seal</b> elements to the desired radial and axial position. Flow-visualization techniques are also used to assist in identification and understanding of the turbulence generating flow patterns which promote improved leakage resistance. Seal geometries are examined over a range of flow Reynolds numbers, and axial rotor positions, for fixed restrictor clearance and stator step height values. Four separate flow path regions of interest, within the seal cavity, are identified. Each region of interest is comprised of a series of acrylic components which can be interchanged to construct a wide range <b>of</b> advanced <b>seal</b> geometries. The effects of isolated, geometric alterations in each region of interest are investigated and used in conjunction with flow-visuahzation studies to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} labyrinth flow field and seal performance. Additionally, complicated coupling mechanisms goveming the relationship between seal leakage resistance and seal geometry are identified and the influence of axial distance-tocontact is addressed. Experimental results imply that leakage resistance can be improved through the development of opposing flow recirculation zones in the upsmm portion <b>of</b> the <b>seal</b> cavity. Also, contoured surfaces and restrictor leading-edge extensions of proper dimensions can be introduced in the seal cavity to reduce ovemu <b>seal</b> leakage. Addition <b>of</b> annular grooves to the geometries provided no improvement in leakage resistance, and in some instances proved detrimental to seal performance. The leakage resistance coefficient for a given geometry improves considerably when the distance-to-contact value approaches that <b>of</b> the <b>seal</b> restrictor clearance. The relationship between seal distance-tocontact, cavity penetration and mainstream flow path length plays a significant role in determining seal performance...|$|R

In this dissertation, I investigated the foraging ecology and plasticity of an ice-adapted marine predator, the ringed seal (Pusa hispida), inhabiting the Arctic marine environment – a dynamic seascape undergoing rapid climatic changes – across age, space and time using stable isotope analysis and animal satellite telemetry. I used a long-term dataset (1990 – 2013) <b>of</b> ringed <b>seal</b> muscle (n = 630) and liver (n = 558) samples, as well as satellite telemetry data (1999 - 2013; n= 132) collected from seven locations across the Arctic of varying latitude (56 ºN – 76 ºN) and longitude (- 117 ºW – - 61 ºW). I first quantified the general increase in δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of three tissues from eight arctic marine mammal species after chemical lipid extraction with results varying across species, developed species- and tissue-specific lipid normalization models, and a species-tissue-specific decision framework for the best lipid correction approach. I then quantified spatial and temporal variation <b>of</b> ringed <b>seal</b> dietary prey contributions, isotopic niche size and trophic position during ontogeny across the Arctic. I found a general latitudinal trend where the level of fish consumption and trophic <b>position</b> <b>of</b> ringed <b>seals</b> decreased due to increased prevalence of sub-arctic fish species and less trophic complexity in the zooplankton community at lower latitudes. As well, isotopic niche size for ringed seals and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) increased at lower latitudes and level of individual specialization in ringed seals increased at lower latitudes {{as a response to}} large-scale spatial variation in ecological opportunity (i. e. prey species richness) which is higher at lower latitudes. Using satellite telemetry, I found that individuals from higher latitudes, which undergo shorter ice-free seasons, spend more time traveling and less time foraging than individuals from lower latitudes where the ice-free season is longer. Also, smaller individuals spent more time transiting between habitat patches than their larger conspecifics due to competitive exclusion. Overall, these findings highlight the foraging plasticity <b>of</b> ringed <b>seals</b> to changing environmental conditions and resource availability...|$|R

Current engines employ scheduled cooling of the outer case flanges to reduce high pressure turbine tip clearances during cruise conditions.

In an effort to improve upon current thermal methods, a first generation mechanically-actuated active clearance control (ACC) system has been designed and fabricated. The system utilizes independent actuators, a segmented shroud structure, and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. Ambient temperature performance tests of this first generation ACC system assessed individual seal component leakage rates and both static and dynamic overall system leakage rates.
