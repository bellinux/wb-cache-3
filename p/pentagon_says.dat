2500|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} and former military personnel contend that the United States carried out Black operations against Iranian military targets during the war. Lt. Col. Roger Charles, {{who worked in the}} Office of the Secretary of Defense at the <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>says</b> the Navy used specially equipped Mark III patrol boats during the night, with the intent of luring Iranian gunboats away from territorial waters, where they could be fired upon and destroyed. [...] "They took off at night and rigged up false running lights so that from a distance it would appear there was a merchant ship, which the Iranians would want to inspect." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Pentagon {{estimated}} that 26,000 service members experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2012, up from 19,000 in 2010. Of those cases, the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>says,</b> most involved attacks on men, mostly by other men. Recent {{statistics show that}} in terms of number of assaults, “the majority of the victims are men.” It also states that although rare, women have previously aided men in sexually assaulting other women. According to statistics released by the Department of Defense, in fiscal 2012, more men were victims of sexual abuse than women. Turchik and Wilson found that “one problem that may be unique for men is confusion concerning sexual identity, masculinity, and sexual orientation after an assault, especially if the perpetrator is a man,” and that “homosexual victims may…feel that the assault was a punishment for being gay, whereas heterosexual victims may feel confused about sexuality and masculinity, especially if their body sexually responded during the assault.” Studies of male sexual assault victims have shown that they become more prone to emotional, physical, and social difficulties after being assaulted, which is comparable to women. This shows that “regardless of the victim’s gender…the consequences of sexual assault are both far reaching and acute.” However, “U.S. military rape law applies only to female victims and male perpetrators,” which “promotes the rape myths that men cannot be raped, and that women cannot be perpetrators.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On January 11, 2007, {{while being}} interviewed on WFED's morning program The Federal Drive, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs Charles [...] "Cully" [...] Stimson criticized some major U.S. law firms for {{representing}} detainees at Guantanamo Bay free of charge. Stimson further suggested that U.S. corporations who retained these same U.S. law firms should reconsider their associations with those firms. His comments drew immediate criticism from legal scholars, professional legal associations and the ACLU, {{and even the}} Pentagon itself sought to distance itself and the Bush administration from Stimson's comments. Although he apologized a few days later, on February 2, 2007 Stimson resigned his position with the <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>saying</b> he believed the flap would prevent him from effectively doing his job. The controversy broadened the reputation of Federal News Radio, however, as the station's morning hosts and reporters were interviewed by news organizations around the world about the controversy.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Pentagon</b> report <b>says</b> the {{chemical}} formulas are not {{defined in the}} CWC lists their [...] "Schedules". Schedule I contains a listing of substances assumed to be for chemical warfare. Therefore, Novichok weapons technically are not banned under the treaty. The administration counters that they are banned [...] "in spirit," [...] but as with all its arms control agreements, Moscow has been banking on the technicality and the camouflage.|$|R
5000|$|Army {{planners}} have privately acknowledged they are examining projections that {{could see the}} number of Americans hovering between 30,000 and 50,000, but may {{be as high as}} 70,000, for a substantial time beyond 2011. <b>Pentagon</b> planners <b>say</b> those currently counted as combat troops could be [...] "re-missioned" [...] and that their efforts could be redefined as training and support for the Iraqis. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen has also said [...] "three years is a long time. Conditions could change in that period of time".|$|R
25|$|Chinese hackers are {{understood}} to have compromised research at QinetiQ in North America. The Pentagon still entrusts QinetiQ with sensitive defence technology. It {{was reported that}} between 2007 and 2010, QinetiQ's North American business {{was the subject of}} a cyber-attack. At the time of the incidents, the company said it disclosed all of its breaches to the responsible government agencies and these were resolved to their satisfaction. Cyber security continues to be an issue with a recent <b>Pentagon</b> report <b>saying</b> that government agencies had been victims of attacks.|$|R
5000|$|South Korean {{investigators}} {{disagreed with}} <b>Pentagon</b> findings, <b>saying</b> they believed 7th Cavalry troops {{were ordered to}} fire on the refugees. The survivors’ group called the U.S. report a [...] "whitewash." [...] Additional archival documents later emerged showing U.S. commanders ordering the shooting of refugees during this period, declassified documents found but not disclosed by Pentagon investigators. Among them was {{a report by the}} U.S. ambassador in South Korea in July 1950 that the U.S. military had adopted a theater-wide policy of firing on approaching refugee groups. Despite demands, the U.S. investigation was not reopened.|$|R
5000|$|The August 4, 2008, {{issue of}} The New Yorker {{magazine}} published a lengthy profile of Rogers, {{and the larger}} issues surrounding the DADT debate spurred on by his death. The story quotes Colonel Mike Hardy, who worked with Major Rogers at the <b>Pentagon,</b> as <b>saying,</b> [...] "He did not make any moves {{to be remembered as}} a gay soldier. Nowhere in those phone calls home did he say, 'let everyone know that I died a proud gay officer.'" [...] Ben McGrath, the author of the article, then comments, [...] "Of course, being a proud gay officer is tantamount, under the current military policy, to being a retired gay officer with no pension." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet Union was {{critical}} of Saddam Hussein's 2 August 1990 occupation of Kuwait, and supported a United Nations resolution authorizing {{the use of military}} force, if necessary, to enforce an arms embargo against Iraq. But the Soviet Union's military support for Hussein also drew substantial criticism from the United States and other Western countries. In Washington, D.C., Heritage Foundation foreign policy experts Jay P. Kosminsky and Michael Johns wrote on 30 August 1990 that, [...] "While condemning the Iraqi invasion, Gorbachev continues to assist Saddam militarily. By Moscow's own admission, in a 22 August official press conference with Red Army Colonel Valentin Ogurtsov, 193 Soviet military advisors still are training and assisting Iraq's one million-man armed forces. Privately, <b>Pentagon</b> sources <b>say</b> that between 3,000 and 4,000 Soviet military advisors may be in Iraq." ...|$|R
500|$|It is {{customary}} for the Air Force {{to impound}} radar trackings involving possible litigation {{in cases of}} aviation accidents. In the civil litigation for damages, the United States Department of Justice explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska pertinent to KAL007's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, {{he said he had}} [...] "misspoken" [...] and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A <b>Pentagon</b> spokesman concurred, <b>saying</b> that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24–30 hours afterwards; the fate of KAL007 was known inside this timeframe.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} only address the {{technical}} aspects of the ELF system. There are other aspects outside the scope of this paper which are also important [...] including but not limited to human health and environmental hazards, economic priorities, and morality. Neither does this paper delve into the history of ELF communications, which are covered in another PLRC paper. 1 ELF radio signals are considered useful for one-way communication to submarines because they penetrate seawater to depths of several hundred feet. 2 ELF is th only available system which, according to the US Navy, will allow continuous contact with submarines while they are at patrol depth and cruising speed. That statement will be discussed later. First, let us look at how ELF operates. A. HOW ELF OPERATES Project ELF has antennas in northern Wisconsin and in the upper peninsula of Michigan because the underlying layers of low-electrical-conductivity rock [...] the hard Precambrian granite called the Laurentian Shield [...] provides the optimum substructure for ELF transmission. In northern Wisconsin the ELF antenna is in the Chequamegon National Forest south of Clam Lake. It consists of 28 miles of antenna cable strung above ground on poles. This antenna is in two segments of 14 miles each which are laid out {{in the form of a}} cross to provide bidirectional transmission. Michigan has 56 miles of cable, in the Escanaba State Forest [...] exactly double the length of the Wisconsin facility. It is also above ground and terminates at K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. <b>Pentagon</b> officials <b>say</b> the Wisconsin and Michigan transmitters are connected by "secure data links. " 3 Each transmitter could work independently but the signal strength would be lower...|$|R
5000|$|The Cape Newenham and Cape Romanzoff radars {{monitored}} at the NORAD Regional Operations Command Center {{were but}} two of twelve comprising the United States Alaskan Distant Early Warning / Aircraft Control and Warning (DEW/ACW) System. These United States Air Force radar stations at Cape Newenham and Cape Romanzoff in Alaska had the capability to track all aircraft heading toward the Russian Buffer Zone, {{though it is not}} known if the radar results of such [...] "outgoing" [...] tracking would have been monitored in [...] "real-time" [...] at the facility at Elmendorf Air Force base. These tapes remain unavailable to the public for national security reasons. However, there was another location at which KAL 007 could well have been tracked in its deviation. This was at the installation at King Salmon, Alaska. It is customary for the Air Force to impound radar trackings involving possible litigation in cases of aviation accidents.
