5|$|The {{appellant}} further highlighted {{that section}} 6 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act ("RSIA"), which was enacted shortly after Singapore's independence from Malaysia, <b>provides</b> <b>that</b> Part IV of the Constitution of Malaysia ceased to have effect in Singapore.

5|$|The fifth Article {{similarly}} {{defines the}} structure and powers of the executive branch.

5|$|The {{validity}} of such measures to promote free discussion may be negated by Article 87 of the Constitution, which <b>provides</b> <b>that</b> any Minister, Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary specially {{authorized by the}} Prime Minister may attend these private meetings.

The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration {{of which has been}} cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 <b>provides</b> <b>that</b> {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of Singapore {{respectively}} guarantee {{freedom of}} speech and expression and freedom of assembly to Singapore citizens. However, the PEMA and POA, which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held, were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights. Article 14(2)(a) <b>provides</b> <b>that</b> Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect, among other things, Singapore's security and public order, and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence. Under Article 14(2)(b), the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons. As Speakers' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech, the pieces of subsidiary legislation regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the subsidiary legislation are complied with. Speakers' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture, though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the political space in Singapore.|$|E
