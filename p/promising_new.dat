5|$|NBC {{ordered a}} full season of Homicide: Life on the Street before a pilot episode was even produced. Planned as a mid-season replacement, the network ordered six episodes for their 1993 winter season, and then ordered another three after {{watching}} the completed pilot episode. The network had been consistently placing third behind their competitor networks ABC and CBS, and was suffering due {{to the loss of}} several successful shows in 1992, including The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls and Matlock, as well as the upcoming end of Cheers in 1993. NBC had tried appealing to audiences in their 20s through several comedies, but those efforts proved unsuccessful and the network decided to focus on high-quality dramas like Homicide. NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield considered it the most <b>promising</b> <b>new</b> series of the season.|$|E
5|$|When the Hugo awards were {{begun in}} 1953, each Worldcon {{organizing}} committee decided what awards they would give. Several awards were presented {{over the next}} few years which were not repeated in later conventions, unlike the primary categories which are still presented—such as Best Novel. These awards were the Best Cover Artist, Best Interior Illustrator, Excellence in Fact Articles, Best New SF Author or Artist, and #1 Fan Personality Hugos at the initial 1953 awards ceremony, the Best Feature Writer, Best Book Reviewer, and Most <b>Promising</b> <b>New</b> Author awards in 1956, the Outstanding Actifan award in 1958, and the Best New Author of 1958 award in 1959.|$|E

5|$|After the 2002 World Cup, {{the team}} {{weakened}} {{with the loss}} of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a <b>promising</b> <b>new</b> generation was maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium's squad qualified for the following year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009. After Georges Leekens' second stint as national manager, his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012.|$|E

50|$|There is {{abundant}} irrefutable physiological, experimental, pharmacological, and clinical evidence {{that in many}} migraine sufferers the pain originates in painfully dilated extracranial terminal branches of the external carotid artery.

Furthermore, to date all migraine-provoking agents have had vasodilating properties.|$|R

25|$|Beagle Aircraft Ltd (British Executive & General Aviation Ltd) {{was formed}} at Shoreham on 7 October 1960 and design {{drawings}} were begun {{a few weeks}} later for a new prototype twin-engine light transport aircraft. Built as the Beagle B.206X at Beagle's Rearsby factory near Leicester, this <b>promising</b> <b>new</b> type was completed at Shoreham and first flown by John Nicolson on 15 August 1961. Beagle Aircraft Ltd was nationalised in late 1966 and taken over by the British Motor Corporation but later entered receivership in late 1969 and soon closed down.|$|E
25|$|The DH.9 was {{designed}} by de Havilland for the Aircraft Manufacturing Company in 1916 as a successor to the DH.4. It used the wings and tail unit of the DH.4 but featured a modified fuselage which moved the pilot closer to the gunner/observer {{and away from the}} engine and fuel tank, which facilitated communication and was a more optimal fighting configuration. The other major change from the DH.4 was the choice of the <b>promising</b> <b>new</b> BHP/Galloway Adriatic engine, which was predicted to produce 300hp (224kW) to provide adequate performance to match enemy fighters.|$|E

25|$|As {{the feature}} size of flash memory cells reaches the 15-16 nm minimum limit, further flash density {{increases}} will {{be driven by}} TLC (3bits/cell) combined with vertical stacking of NAND memory planes. The decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable bit error rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms. Even with these advances, it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller and smaller dimensions {{as the number of}} electron holding capacity reduces. Many <b>promising</b> <b>new</b> technologies (such as FeRAM, MRAM, PMC, PCM, ReRAM, and others) are under investigation and development as possible more scalable replacements for flash.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, the British engineering company, Vickers Limited, entered into an agreement with the Hart Engine Company of Leeds to fund development of an air-cooled radial engine, planned to generate 150hp (112kW). Vickers planned several aircraft around the <b>promising</b> <b>new</b> engine, including a tractor configuration single-seat fighter designed by Rex Pierson, the F.B.16. Pierson's new fighter, also known as the Hart Scout was a single-bay biplane with heavily staggered wings of unequal span. It had a volumous, ellipical section fuselage, with the pilot sitting in an open cockpit above the lower wing and the Hart engine enclosed in a cowling. Armament was a single synchronised Vickers machine gun.|$|E
