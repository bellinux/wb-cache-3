5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a <b>papyrus</b> <b>roll.</b> The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E
5|$|In the Bibliotheca, the Arcadian genealogies are {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror {{the structure of the}} Catalogue because other fragments of the <b>papyrus</b> <b>roll</b> that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with Demeter. Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, who bore Amphion and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, but it is possible that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.|$|E
500|$|Sometime in 1856, {{when the}} Joseph Smith Papyri were {{on display in}} the St. Louis Museum, Gustav Seyffarth, a then-visiting {{professor}} at Concordia Seminary, viewed them and made the statement: [...] "The <b>papyrus</b> <b>roll</b> is not a record but an invocation to the Deity Osirus , in which occurs the name of the person, and a picture of the attendant spirits, introducing the dead to the Judge, Osiris." [...] Later that same year, a pamphlet containing the Book of Abraham's facsimiles made its way to the Louvre. Here, Theodule Deveria, an Egyptologist at the museum, had the opportunity to examine the facsimiles published as part of the Book of Abraham. He recognized them as [...] "common Egyptian funerary documents, of which he had examined hundreds." [...] With that being said, he argued that many of the hieroglyphic characters had been poorly transcribed and that several areas in the facsimiles seemed to have been reconstructed based on guess work. Consequently, Deveria concluded that Joseph Smith's explanation was [...] "rambling nonsense." [...] Despite this condemnation, no deliberate effort to counter Deveria's arguments seems to have been made at the time. Then, in 1873, Deveria's interpretation, juxtaposed with Smith's interpretation, was published in T. B. H. Stenhouse's book , a work critical of the LDS Church. [...] This time, the LDS Church responded by reiterating that the Book of Mormon was divinely inspired, and that it was likely that the Book of Abraham's source papyri held two meanings (one accessible to a lay audience, and another accessible to the priesthood). In 1880, the book was officially canonized by the Church.|$|E

40|$|After {{the first}} recent {{attempts}} at virtually opening and reading Herculaneum papyri, a new enhanced method for virtual unfolding and peeling of ancient unopened <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls</b> has been developed. This new algorithms-based and semi-automatic procedure allowed to investigate with high resolution the 3 D internal structure of two ancient <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls</b> formerly analysed by X-ray phase-contrast tomography. Through a new rendering procedure, selected regions inside the rolls {{could be identified}} and isolated and the different sheets could be peeled one by one virtually, all without damaging these very precious manuscripts. Subsequently, traces of possible text were identified on the single sheets. Finally, by applying an additional flattening procedure we restored {{for the first time}} several extensive textual portions of Greek, the largest ever detected so far in unopened Herculaneum <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls,</b> with different degrees of resolution and contras...|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} used {{at this stage}} consisted of wax tablets (tabulae) which would be written on with a stick (stili) with a pointed end for writing and a flat end for rubbing the wax back {{so it could be}} written on again. Also, <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls</b> and quills with black and red ink could be used, almost an equivalent to paper and pens but <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls</b> were much rougher. As well as that, the ink was more durable as it was made of soot and resin. This was thinned by adding water to the thick substance. Some of the more durable and costly inks have been known to survive years buried under the ground.|$|R
2500|$|Innis {{divides the}} history of the empires and civilizations he will examine into two periods, one for writing and the other for printing. [...] "In the writing period we can note the {{importance}} of various media such as the clay tablet of Mesopotamia, the <b>papyrus</b> <b>roll</b> in the Egyptian and in the Graeco-Roman world, parchment codex in the late Graeco-Roman world and the early Middle Ages, and paper after its introduction in the Western world from China." [...] Innis notes that he will concentrate on paper as a medium in the printing period along with the introduction of paper-making machinery {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century and the use of wood pulp in the manufacture of paper after 1850.|$|E

5000|$|Papyrus {{was first}} {{manufactured}} in Egypt {{as far back}} as the fourth millennium BCE. The earliest archaeological evidence of papyrus was excavated in 2012 and 2013 at Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor located on the Red Sea coast. These documents date from c. 2560-2550 BCE (end of the reign of Khufu). The <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls</b> describe the last years of building the Great Pyramid of Giza. [...] In the first centuries BCE and CE, papyrus scrolls gained a rival as a writing surface in the form of parchment, which was prepared from animal skins. Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which book-form codices were fashioned. Early Christian writers soon adopted the codex form, and in the Græco-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from <b>papyrus</b> <b>rolls</b> to form codices.|$|R
60|$|This {{elegant and}} pleasantly exaggerated exordium preceded some very {{practical}} demonstrations. 'The apron is {{the banner of}} the future!' exclaimed the lecturer, and he took his coat off and put his apron on. He spoke a little about old bindings for the <b>papyrus</b> <b>roll,</b> about the ivory or cedar cylinders round which old manuscripts were wound, about the stained covers and the elaborate strings, till binding in the modern sense began with literature in a folded form, with literature in pages. A binding, he pointed out, consists of two boards, originally of wood, now of mill-board, covered with leather, silk or velvet. The use of these boards {{is to protect the}} 'world's written wealth.' The best material is leather, decorated with gold. The old binders used to be given forests that they might always have a supply of the skins of wild animals; the modern binder has to content himself with importing morocco, which is far the best leather there is, and is very much to be preferred to calf.|$|E
