An alteration layer < 1 um thick on feldspar surfaces had short-range order and was termed protocrystalline. Relative to the parent feldspars the protocrystalline layer was depleted in Ca, Na, K, and Si and significantly enriched in Fe. On plagioclase, the protoerystalline material was replaced by Ca-Fe-K-smectite, another <b>protocrystalline</b> <b>material,</b> and spherical halloysite. Abundant tubular haUoysite on the corroded surface apparently formed by reprecipitation of components released by plagioclase dissolution. The K-feldspar was markedly more resistant to weathering than the plagioclase. Recrystallization f the patchily developed protocrystalline rind produced Fe-bearing, aluminous smec-rite, which was ultimately replaced by spherical halloysite and laths of kaolinite. Muscovite laths within plagioclase crystals were converted initially to illite by loss of K, then to randomly interstratified illite/ smectite, and then to srnectite that contained Mg, little K and Fe, and was more aluminous and contained less Ca than the smectite that originally replaced the plagioclase. Smectite was replaced epitaetically by kaolinite. Kaolinite was the stable weathering product of the feldspars and muscovite in the profiles. It probably formed in equilibrium with a solution whose composition was no longer controlled by the microenvironment within the feldspar, but approached that of meteoric water.
