40|$|Abstract The study {{investigated}} the students’ strategies in increasing intercultural communicative competence (ICC) model. The researchers employed qualitative research method by applying grounded theory design. The participants of this research were four students from different grade levels of English study program of STKIP Yapis Dompu-NTB. There were five data collection techniques used: interview, observation, field note, audio recording, and documentation. The result of this research indicated that the <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> different strategies to improve ICC model. The A. M. <b>participant</b> <b>has</b> sixteen strategies, the Y. A. <b>participant</b> <b>has</b> nine strategies, A. S. <b>participant</b> <b>has</b> seven strategies, and E. D <b>participant</b> <b>has</b> ten strategies...|$|R

5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> a more {{negative}} opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{exhibitions}} and performances were also permitted {{to be held}} at Speakers' Corner. The conditions that organizers and <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> to adhere to were broadly similar to those applying to speeches. In addition, the organizer or an authorized agent had to be present at all times during the exhibition or performance, the event could not contain violent, lewd or obscene messages, no banners or placards could be carried by participants, and the event could not be an assembly or procession for which a permit was required under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
30|$|So, {{the rest}} of 210 (51.09 %) <b>participants,</b> who <b>had</b> publications, it asked for them to further fill out the {{information}} regarding the type of publications, they had. In response to this query 32.3 % of the <b>participants</b> did not <b>have</b> any publication in internationally proclaimed Journals and 21.9 % of the <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> only one publication in internationality accredited Journals. Whereas, 13.8 % of the <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> two publications in international scientific Journals. Similarly, 41.9 % of the <b>participants</b> did not <b>have</b> any publication in national impact factor journals somehow 20.9 % of the <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> only one publication and 12.3 % of the <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> two publications. At the same time, 93.8 % of the participants haven’t published any book and 80.5 % of the <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> not written any chapter at all, in any book. Finding of this section somehow strengthens believe that women faculty member has published less. Some other studies also indicated that Jones et al. (2012) women faculty members found themselves more overburdened and they concentrate less on research. Another study revealed that in general faculties tend to publish less {{in recent years to}} highly competitive and specialized work. They tend to put more work in teachings as compared to research and publication unless they are appointed solely for research (Jones et al. 2012; Rajiv, Chu, and Jiang 2015).|$|R

5|$|CMLL held a 15-woman torneo cibernetico {{elimination}} {{match on}} June 5, 1992 {{to determine the}} two women who would fight for the newly created CMLL World Women's champion the following week. La Diabólica was originally scheduled to work the match, but did not appear {{which led to the}} uneven sides in the elimination match. Several of the <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> recently joined CMLL, leaving the Universal Wrestling Association to join CMLL and its recently restarted women's division. Zuleyma was the reigning UWA World Women's Championship going into the match and CMLL allowed her to keep and defend the UWA championship in the years following Zuleyma's jump to CMLL. The finals came down to Lola Gonzales, a pioneer for women's wrestling in Mexico, and Bull Nakano, a Japanese wrestler that worked regularly for CMLL. The following week, on June 12, 1993 Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion by virtue of her victory over Lola Gonzales.|$|E
5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it.

5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> left or were preparing to leave. The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E
