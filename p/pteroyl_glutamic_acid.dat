40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the article is to highlight various roles of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> like endogenic anticancer agent, conjugates to anticancer agents, and derivatives of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> as possible anticancer agents. Besides these emphases are given especially for two endogenous derivatives of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> such as glutamine and glutamate. Glutamine is a derivative of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and is formed in the body from <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and ammonia in an energy requiring reaction catalyzed by glutamine synthase. It also possesses anticancer activity. So the transportation and metabolism of glutamine are also discussed for better understanding the role of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid.</b> Glutamates are the carboxylate anions and salts of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid.</b> Here the roles of various enzymes required for the metabolism of glutamates are also discussed...|$|R

Chromatographic examination of an enzymatic digest of protein labeled with <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> shows only labeled <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and pyroglutamic acid; hydrolysis of protein from cells labeled with glutamine, however, yields substantial amounts of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> in addition to glutamine and pyroglutamic acid.

40|$|SUMMARY: Using the {{corresponding}} amino-acid decarboxylases, the six amino-acids arginine, <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine {{were found to}} be free inside the cells of yeast. They are present when growth takes place in the absence of amino-acids, but their concentration may be increased by growing the organisms in media rich in amino-acids. Uptake of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> from the external medium is dependent on a source of energy which can be provided by the simultaneous fermenta-tion of glucose. The presence of an ammonium salt in the medium decreases both the rate a t which <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> enters the cells and the amount of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> which can be taken up. Certain other amino-acids exert a similar sparing action on the assimilation of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can be related to their efficiency as nitrogen sources for growth. The free <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> content of cells remains practically constant when the cells are suspended in salt solutions without amino-acids, but if glucose is also present then the concentration of free <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> inside the cells decreases steadily. When ammonia is also present the concentration of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> remains constant, suggesting that <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> is synthesized by the cells unde...|$|R

Bacteriol. 91 : 1848 – 1853. 1966. —Saliva contains an antimicrobial system which inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as a number of other organisms, in complete growth medium. This antimicrobial system consists of the salivary peroxidase (lactoperoxidase) and thiocyanate ions, and requires the presence of H 2 O 2. Saliva inhibits the accumulation of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and certain other amino acids by resting cells. This effect of saliva is decreased by dialysis, and thiocyanate ions restore the inhibitory effect of dialyzed saliva. The inhibitory effect of saliva is decreased by heat (100 C, 10 min), and lactoperoxidase restores the inhibitory effect of heated saliva. Thus, the inhibition of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation by saliva appears to be due in part to the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate antimicrobial system. H 2 O 2 increases the inhibitory effect of both saliva and the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate system on <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation.

The mutant differed from the wild-type strain in that glutamic decarboxylase activity was absent from the mutant under conditions of growth which supported the formation of this enzyme in the parent strain. Evidence is presented which suggests that loss of the decarboxylase activity results in the acquisition of the ability to utilize <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> as sole source of carbon; a pathway of glutamate utilization via transamination is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Though <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{well known}} as a working {{excitatory}} in the CNS, {{its impact on the}} modulation of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and withdrawal fits are not yet clear. The study has been undertaken to examine the levels of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> in chronic alcohol-dependent patients at different stages of alcohol withdrawal and weaning and to examine any existence of any differences according to Cloninger's and Lesch's typologies. Patients and methods: One hundred and fifty-nine alcohol-dependent patients were assessed according to Cloninger's and Lesch's typologies and related to abstinence duration, age, and gender. Blood samples were taken for mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> in order to find primarily any differences in <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> according to the typologies, age, abstinence duration, and liver damage. Results: There was no significant association between Cloninger's and Lesch's typologies. Cloninger's types 1 and 2 had an equal distribution of GGT and duration of abstinence, while Lesch's type I had more patients with high GGT, and more patients who were sober for a maximum of 2 days. Unlike in Lesch's types, <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> levels did not differ according to Cloninger's types, as significantly higher <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> values were found in Lesch's types I and IV. <b>Glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> values did not differ significantly in different age groups. Conclusions: Our study findings of varying <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> levels seen in Lesch's typology, higher in types I and IV than in types II and III, are of significant clinical value and can be interpreted differently, as in type I high levels of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> is seen as a kindling phenomenon, while in type IV elevated levels might be related to either compulsivity of frequent repetition of drinking or withdrawal...|$|R
40|$|The author {{measured}} quantitatively <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid in the rat brain homogenate by paperchromatography, {{and obtained}} the following results. 1) When the brain homogenate of normal rat is incubated at 38 ℃ for 60 minutes under anaerobic conditions, {{the quantity of}} <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> decreases slightly while the quantities of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and γ-aminobutyric <b>acid</b> increase. When <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> is loaded to the brain homogenate as substrate, the <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> so loaded decreases markedly whereas γ-aminobutyric acid increases markedly. 2) In {{the case of the}} homogenate subjected to repeated electro-shocks, such increase in γ-aminobutyric acid is lessened. 3) In the case which received repeated insulin shocks, the increase in γ-aminobutyric acid likewise tends to be reduced. 4) These facts seem to indicate that the glutamic decarboxylase acitivity in the brain in the cases (2 and 3) mentioned above might have been slackened...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes of}} the amount of free amino-nitrogen and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> were {{investigated}} in the rabbits brain with repeated convulsions caused by hexogen. The free amino-nitrogen was measured by Van-Slyke-Neil gasmetric apparatus, and the <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> was measured by Warburg gasmetric apparatus with <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> decarboxylase. The results were as follows. Normal Rabbits Brain During Repeated Convulsions 20 - 24 Hours after Repeated Convulsions Free Amino-nitrogen 0. 4553 mg/g 0. 3006 mg/g 0. 3324 mg/g <b>Glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> 1. 5501 mg/g 0. 9543 mg/g 1. 2425 mg/g The free amino-nitrogen as well as the <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> were the most in the normal brain and the least during the repeated convulsion, and they showed a certain increase at 20 - 24 hours after the repeated convulsions compared with those during the convulsions, but still apart from the normal. Glycolysis was depressed by sodium glutamate in the normal rabbits brain which had enough <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> but the glycolysis was rather accelerated by sodium glutamate in the rabbits brain which had repeated convulsions and thus scarce <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid,</b> when the sodium glutamate was added to the irrigating fluid of the vessels in the brain and then the glycolysis was measured in each irrigating fluid before and after irrigation. Therefore, it could be concluded that sodium glutamate has the effect of regulation to keep the normal and moderate glycolysis in the brain...|$|R
