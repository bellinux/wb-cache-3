40|$|Sirens used by police, {{fire and}} <b>paramedic</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been {{designed}} {{so that they can}} be heard over large distances, but unfortunately the siren noise enters the vehicle and corrupts intelligibility of voice communications from the emergency vehicle to the control room. Often the siren needs to be turned off to enable the control room to hear what is being said. This paper discusses a siren noise filter system that is capable of removing the siren noise picked up by the two-way radio microphone inside the vehicle. The removal of the siren noise improves the response time for emergency vehicles and thus save lives. To date, the system has been trialed within a fire tender in a non-emergency situation, with good results. ...|$|E
40|$|Sirens â€™ used by police, {{fire and}} <b>paramedic</b> <b>vehicles</b> gen-erate noise that propagates inside the vehicle cab that {{subsequently}} corrupts intelligibility of voice communi-cations from the emergency vehicle {{to the control}} room. It is even common for the siren to be turned off to enable the control room to hear what is being said. Both fixed filter and adaptive filter systems have previously been developed to help cancel the transmission of the siren noise over the radio. Previous cancellation systems have only concentrated on the traditional 2 -tone, wail and yelp sirens. This paper discusses an improvement to a previous adaptive filter system and presents the cancella-tion results to three new types of sirens; being chirp pul-sar and localiser. A siren noise filter system has the ca-pability to improve the response time for an emergency vehicle and thus help save lives. To date, this system has been tested using live recordings taken from a non-emergency situation with good results. 1...|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the tight}} filming schedule, Universal Studios {{decided to build}} the vehicle entirely from scratch {{according}} to the Los Angeles County Fire Department's specifications at that time. After the filming of Emergency!, Universal Studios donated Squad 51, and it {{was used as a}} reserve <b>paramedic</b> <b>vehicle</b> by the LACOFD. In 1999 the title was transferred, and Squad 51 was then donated to the Los Angeles County Fire Museum in Bellflower, California. In the same year it was thoroughly and completely restored by the museum, at a cost of approximately $10,000. Squad 51 is now residing with its co-star in Emergency!, Engine 51, which completed restoration in 2012.|$|R

50|$|In the Swedish medical system, a non-transporting vehicle (akutbil) can be {{equipped}} with a nurse specialized in anesthesia who is specialized in pain management, paired together with a <b>paramedic.</b> These <b>vehicles</b> can be staffed around the clock or during the busiest {{hours of the day}} and week in order to augment the capacity of the prehospital care provider and can respond both independently and in conjunction with one or more ambulances, air ambulance(s) and other emergency services. As a result of new (circa 2013) legislation requiring all ambulances to {{be equipped}} with at least one trained nurse, non-transporting vehicles have become less common.|$|R
50|$|The {{department}} has a First Responder Program. This program utilizes NYS Emergency Medical Technicians and <b>Paramedics</b> operating response <b>vehicles</b> {{to reach the}} patient faster and provide medical care before the ambulance arrives on scene. These first response vehicles carry the same life saving equipment and medication that ambulances carry. There are 3 first responders that are in service today. First Responder Unit #5297 is an Advanced Life Support (ALS) first responder that EMT-Critical Care and Paramedic members could sign out. First Responder Unit# 5298 is a Basic Life Support (BLS) first responder that EMT members could sign out. First Responder Unit #5299 is a first responder unit that department officers (Captain, Lt's) could sign out.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} fire fighters struck {{and killed by}} motor {{vehicles}} has dramatically increased within recent years. During the 5 -year period between 1995 and 1999, 17 fire fighters were struck and killed by motorists. This represents an 89 % {{increase in the number}} of line-of-duty deaths over the previous 5 -year period (between 1990 and 1994), when 9 fire fighters were struck and killed by motor vehicles [NFPA 2000]. Under the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, NIOSH investigated two separate incidents involving fire fighters who were struck and killed while providing emergency services along roadways during 1999 [NIOSH 1999, 2000]. These incidents and data demonstrate that hazards to the fire service are not limited to structural or wildland fires. Motorists accustomed to a clear, unobstructed roadway may not recognize and avoid closed lanes or emergency workers on or near the roadway. In some cases, conditions can reduce a motorist's ability to see and avoid fire fighters and apparatus. Some examples include weather, time of day, scene lighting (i. e., area lighting and optical warning devices), traffic speed and volume, and road configuration (i. e., hills, curves, and other obstructions that limit visibility). These hazards are not limited to the fire service alone. Other emergency service providers such as law enforcement officers, <b>paramedics,</b> and <b>vehicle</b> recovery personnel are also exposed to these hazards. On August 5, 1999, one fire fighter died, and a second fire fighter and another person were severely injured when they were struck by a motor vehicle that lost control on a wet and busy interstate highway [NIOSH 1999]. A heavy-rescue squad and a ladder truck had been dispatched to a single motor vehicle crash on an interstate highway. Approximately 2 minutes after they arrived on the scene and took a position to the rear of the rescue squad (protecting the initial vehicle crash scene), another car collided with the back of the ladder truck (Figure 1). While attending to the injuries of the driver who struck the ladder truck, two fire fighters and the injured driver were struck by a third car, causing one fire fighter to be fatally injured and the second fire fighter and the driver (who had collided with the back of the ladder truck) to be severely injured. On September 27, 1999, a fire fighter died after being struck by a tractor trailer truck while directing traffic along a four-lane highway [NIOSH 2000]. The victim was standing in front of an apparatus that was parked (facing north) in the outer emergency lane for the southbound traffic. The emergency lights of the apparatus were on and functioning properly at the time of the incident. He was called out to provide assistance for a neighboring fire department that had responded to a tractor-trailer crash. The initial tractor-trailer crash and subsequent fire fighter fatality occurred during a heavy rainstorm along a 1 -mile stretch of a four-lane highway. Thirty-nine collisions have occurred on this 1 -mile stretch of road since 1994. Any fire fighter working along any type of roadway runs the risk of being struck by a motorist. To prevent such incidents, NIOSH recommends that fire departments and fire fighters take the following actions: Fire departments: Develop, implement, and enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding emergency operations for roadway incidents; Implement an incident management system to manage all emergency incidents; Establish a unified command for incidents that occur where multiple agencies have jurisdiction; Ensure that a separate incident safety officer (independent of the incident commander) is appointed; Develop pre-incident plans for areas that have a high rate of motor vehicle crashes; Establish pre-incident agreements with law enforcement and other agencies such as the highway department; Ensure that fire fighters are trained in safe procedures for operating in or near moving traffic; Ensure that fire fighters wear suitable high-visibility apparel such as a strong yellow-green or orange reflecting flagger vest when operating at an emergency scene. Fire fighters: Ensure that the fire apparatus is positioned to take advantage of topography and weather conditions (uphill and upwind) and to protect fire fighters from traffic; Park or stage unneeded vehicles off the roadway whenever possible; If police have not yet arrived at a scene involving a highway incident or fire, first control the oncoming vehicles before safely turning your attention to the emergency; Position yourself and any victim(s) in a secure area that maximizes your visibility to motorists when it is impossible to protect the incident scene from immediate danger; Use a traffic control device that maximizes your visibility to motorists when controlling traffic.
