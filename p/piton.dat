However, this conflicts with the national park's vocation of preserving the natural and cultural landscape. , pilot {{studies were carried out}} for two 5MW geothermal power plants, {{at the foot of the}} <b>Piton</b> des neiges and on the , on which a project had already been considered and later abandoned.

5|$|Sea {{levels were}} lower during the Pleistocene, {{so it was}} {{possible}} for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano <b>Piton</b> des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it would {{have been one of the}} few survivors of this extinction event.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as <b>Piton</b> de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, {{he bought}} a {{second-hand}} coal-fired forge, and started making hardened steel <b>pitons</b> for use in Yosemite Valley. Between time spent surfing and climbing, he sold <b>pitons</b> {{out of the back}} of his car to support himself.

5000|$|<b>Pitons</b> {{were the}} {{original}} form of protection {{and are still}} used {{where there is no}} alternative. Repeated hammering and extraction of <b>pitons</b> damages the rock, and climbers who subscribe to the clean climbing ethic avoid their use as much as possible. With the popularization of clean climbing in the 1970s, <b>pitons</b> were largely replaced by faster and easier-to-use clean protection, such as nuts and camming devices. <b>Pitons</b> are still found in place (as [...] "fixed" [...] <b>pitons)</b> on some established free climbing routes, as fixed belay station anchors, in places where nuts or cams do not work; and are used on some hard aid climbs.|$|R

Once they lost their first wicket, the team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals; the second-highest partnership of the innings was the 17 runs made for the tenth, or last, wicket. George Glover {{was the best of}} the bowlers, collecting six wickets. Glover and Albert Rose-Innes bowled the majority of the overs, and took nine of the wickets between them. Bowden's score of 63 was substantially the best by any batsman in the innings, only John <b>Piton,</b> Spranger Harrison and Hickson scored more than 10 runs, and none managed as many as 20.|$|E

50|$|During {{climbing}} {{exploration of}} the hard granite in Yosemite Valley in the 1950s and 1960s, {{it was found that}} soft <b>pitons</b> did not work very well. The long routes developed in Yosemite made it impractical and costly to fix routes, and the soft <b>pitons</b> were not durable enough to be placed and removed more than a few times. <b>Pitons</b> needed to be removed and used again on subsequent pitches, sometimes many times. Leaving gear in place went against the ethics of many climbers. John Salathé pioneered designs using hardened steel which were much tougher than the European <b>pitons.</b> Salathé's pins, which he developed for a climb of the Lost Arrow, resisted deformation and were easier to remove and reuse, and were durable enough to be reused indefinitely.|$|R

In the first innings of the same match, George Glover took 6/50 for Kimberley.

5000|$|Around 1970, {{he became}} aware {{that the use of}} steel <b>pitons</b> made by his company was causing {{significant}} damage to the cracks of Yosemite. These <b>pitons</b> comprised 70 percent of his income. In 1971 and 1972, Chouinard and Frost introduced new aluminum chockstones, called Hexentrics and Stoppers, along with the less successful steel Crack-n-Ups, and committed the company to the advocacy of the new tools and a new style of climbing called [...] "clean climbing". This concept revolutionized rock climbing and led to further success of the company, despite destroying the sales of <b>pitons,</b> formerly his most important product.|$|R
50|$|When {{he began}} {{climbing}} in 1945, {{he found that}} traditional <b>pitons</b> used for climbing in the Alps were too soft to be driven into narrow cracks without buckling. In his San Mateo business, Peninsula Wrought Iron Works, Salathé used high-carbon chrome-vanadium steel, {{similar to that used}} to make Ford axles, to forge extremely strong <b>pitons</b> which could be hammered into the hard Yosemite granite without buckling, as well as removed without getting mangled, thus rendering them reusable. These thin <b>pitons</b> became known as Lost Arrows, and are still manufactured under that name by Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd.|$|R
