40|$|Complementary to the Swift effect, {{namely the}} {{elongation}} of specimens during large strain elastic-plastic torsion with free ends, the inverse Swift effect {{refers to the}} free twisting of specimens during uniaxial tension after a previous large strain twisting history. In this paper, this intriguing phenomenon in solid cylindrical bars or wires is studied numerically using special purpose finite elements that allow for an accurate and efficient analysis of large strain torsion and simultaneous tension problems.

40|$|Warp in lumber is {{a serious}} problem for the {{building}} industry. In particular, material from small-diameter logs experiences excessive twist. This paper presents a new sawing technique to minimize the problem of twist in material from small-diameter logs. Almost all the studs sawn from small-diameter logs twist in the same positive direction. By rotating the logs during sawing, it is possible to produce studs with a small negative <b>pre-twist.</b> The studs will twist as normal as a result of drying, but, due to the negative <b>pre-twist,</b> the studs will become straighter after drying. To test this new method of sawing, two studs (50 by 100 mm) were sawn from each log. One of the studs was sawn with a small negative <b>pre-twist</b> and the other was sawn to be straight. A total of 100 logs were sawn, resulting in 200 studs. Directly after sawing, the <b>pre-twisted</b> material had a mean twist of - 6 mm/ 100 mm/ 2 m, while the material that was sawn straight had a twist of 0. 1 mm/ 100 mm/ 2 m. After kiln-drying to 18 percent moisture content, the twist in the <b>pre-twisted</b> material was 3. 4 mm/ 100 mm/ 2 m, while the material that had been sawn straight had a mean twist of 7. 3 mm/ 100 mm/ 2 m.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the static bending of <b>pre-twisted</b> {{cantilever}} blading is examined. The blading is <b>pre-twisted</b> linearly about the centroid of its cross-section to a maximum angle of n/ 2 radians and {{is considered to be}} mounted encastr 6 at the root. The behaviour of such blading, particularly when bending under a distributed load, is of considerable practical importance. By the application of variational calculus, static equilibrium equations are derived from expressions for the total potential energy of blades subject to either concentrated or uniformly distributed bending loads. Solution of the equilibrium equations yields expressions for the static deflexions. Over a range of <b>pre-twist</b> angles between 0 and n/ 2 radians deflexions are calculated for blades of (1) narrow rectangular cross-section when subjected to either method of loading, (2) narrow aerofoil cross-section when subjected to a uniformly distributed load. Sets of steel cantilever blades of MITOW rectangular cross-section are loaded laterally at their free ends and the deflexions determined by measurement. The experimental values of deflexion compare reasonably with the relevant calculated ones. Small discrepancies bemeen the two sets of results are not yet fully explained and further investigation of the problem is under consideration. For blades where the <b>pre-twist</b> angles do not exceed 7 r/ 2 radians, the agreement obtained between the two sets of deflexions for the concentrated load system is such that the validity of the theory, when it is applied to other loading systems, can safely be assumed without further recourse to experiment...|$|R
40|$|Twist is {{currently}} {{one of the}} main quality problems affecting softwood timber for construction. Several methods to minimise this problem were investigated in an EU project. The results for one method, drying boards in a pre-twisted position, are presented in this paper. It has generally been found that boards (Norway spruce) can be deformed towards straightness using this method. The tendency of a board to twist during drying is primarily dependent on the grain angle of the board. Laboratory tests have shown how much a board should be pre-twisted during drying to achieve a straight result. In practice, almost all studs tend to twist in the same direction. <b>Pre-twisting</b> an entire kiln stack equally gives a better average result than the conventional process. By measuring the grain angle for each board (“tracheid effect” with a laser beam), boards can be grouped and then treated “individually”. The force exerted by a board on its holders during drying in a pre-twisted position has been measured. The force decreases considerably during the heating phase, remains constant during the drying phase and decreases during cooling. When the variation in torsional stiffness as a function of temperature and moisture content is accounted for, it is found that creep deformation of the board occurs both during the drying phase and the cooling phase. Deformation due to changes in temperature seems therefore to take place in addition to mechano-sorptive creep. This has been proved by heat treating boards (wet or dry) wrapped in plastic to avoid changes in moisture content. Boards that still show excess twist after drying can therefore be “corrected” using a heat treatment process. It was also shown that boards exhibit a certain degree of memory effect. The wood material seems to remember processes which the board was exposed to at earlier stages. This memory fades over time. The results obtained in the laboratory have been verified by a series of industrial tests, including the testing effect of pre-twist on an entire kiln stack. Recommendations for industrial implementation and an economic assessment are finally presented.

First order shear deformation theory (Timoshenko beam theory) {{is used for the}} analysis of the beams. The shape functions for the beam element are established from the differential equation of static equilibrium. Floquet’s theory is used to establish the stability boundaries. A steel-alumina functionally graded ordinary (FGO) beam with steel-rich bottom is considered for the analysis. For the analysis of functionally graded sandwich (FGSW) beam, alumina and steel are chosen as top and bottom skin respectively and the core is FGM with steel and alumina as constituent phases. The material properties in the direction of thickness of FGM are assumed to vary as per power law and exponential law. The effect of property distribution laws on critical buckling load, natural frequencies and parametric instability of the beams is investigated. Also, the effect of variation of power law index on the critical buckling load, natural frequencies and {{dynamic stability}} of beams is determined. It is found that the property variation as per exponential law ensures better dynamic stability than property variation as per power law. Increase in the value of power law index is found to have detrimental effect on the dynamic stability of the beams. Influence of the elastic foundations on the dynamic stability of the beams is studied. Pasternak elastic foundation is found to have more enhancing effect on the dynamic stability of the beam than Winkler elastic foundation. The dynamic stability of FGO and FGSW beams used in high temperature environment is investigated. It is observed that increase in environmental temperature has an enhancing effect on the instability of the beams.

The method is presented in a generality encompassing a large body of useful linear vibration theories of beams. The basic and refined element models are introduced, and the convergence properties of each model studied. A rigorous proof of the convergence of the Finite Element solutions to the exact values is included in the case of torsional vibrations. The use of refined models is advantageous, especially in cases where the modal curves are of some complexity, e. g., vibrations at higher modes and beams with certain boundary conditions. The general non-dimensional forms of element dynamic-stiffness matrices for linearly <b>pre-twisted</b> beams are given. numerical results obtained with polynomial approximation in bending-bending and bending-bending-torsion vibrations of beams, where the effects of shear and rotatory inertia may not be negligible and linear taper may be present, show good convergence characteristics. Satisfactory results are obtained with the use of only a few, number of elements. The application of the method to vibrations of beams carrying concentrated masses and supported on elastic springs is briefly demonstrated. Representative results show good agreement with the exact values. The Finite Element Method provides strong and stable convergence characteristics. It is simple to apply and ideally suited to digital computers.

Indigenously available piezo-electric crystals are used both to excite and sense resonant frequencies of test blades under rotation up to 10, 000 rpm. The output signals are acquired by means of slipring unit and the data is analyzed to identify the natural frequencies of test blades. Pretwist, taper and speed of rotation are shown to have considerable influence on the frequencies whereas <b>pre-twist</b> and decreasing width taper together will aid in one plane and counteract in another to cause changes in resonant frequencies of the rotating blades...|$|R
40|$|The TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} test the standard model at high precision in the purely leptonic decay of polarized muons. A general four-fermion interaction model is {{used to describe the}} muon decay. TWIST measures three of the four muon decay parameters of this model, ρ, δ and P_μ^πξ, from the shape of the momentum-angle spectrum. The results of this model independent approach are compared to the standard model predictions and used to constrain new physics. Our collaboration has finalized the blind analysis of the final experimental data taken in 2006 and 2007. This analysis mostly reached our goal of a precision of an order of magnitude improvement over the <b>pre-TWIST</b> measurements.

40|$|Normally, {{breakage}} is {{the main}} cause of failure of a micro drilling system, of which coupling effect of lateral and torsional displacements plays the most important role. This research developed a modified transfer matrix method to investigate the dynamics of a micro drilling system focusing on displacements induced by not only lateral, shear, torsional deformations, but also the coupling effect between lateral and torsional vibrations. The micro drilling system is modeled as <b>pre-twisted</b> rotating Timoshenko beam elements with a continuous-system concept. Each element includes components of linear bearings, axial drilling force, gyroscopic moments, and eccentricity. The overall transfer matrix of the system is developed to determine the state vector of the system including displacements and forces. Finally, a numerical example was presented, where the lateral and torsional displacements and critical speed of the micro drilling system at the micro drill’s tip were presented...|$|R
