40|$|An LED driver {{requiring}} no {{electrolytic capacitor}} {{in the whole}} power conversion process is presented. It consists of two power conversion stages. The first stage is a buck converter operating in discontinuous capacitor voltage mode, so that the input current is continuous. It is used to deliver a regulated current for the second stage. The second stage is a current-fed inverter, in which the semiconductor switches are operated at constant switching frequency and constant duty cycle of 0. 5. The power supplying to the LED string is regulated by controlling the duty cycle of the main switch in the front-stage buck converter. The two stages are interconnected by an LC filter, {{which is designed to}} attenuate harmonics at double of the line frequency. Instead of using an electrolytic capacitor for the filter, a <b>polyester</b> <b>capacitor</b> of better lifetime expectancy is used. An 18 W experimental prototype has been built and tested. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|R

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{have become}} much smaller {{since the beginning}} of the technology. Through development of thinner plastic films, for example, the dimensions of metallized <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> were decreased by a factor of approximately 3 to 4.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{feature of}} film {{capacitors}} {{is the possibility}} of choosing different film materials for the dielectric layer to select for desirable electrical characteristics, such as stability, wide temperature range, or ability to withstand very high voltages. Polypropylene film capacitors are specified because of their low electrical losses and their nearly linear behavior over a very wide frequency range, for stability Class 1 applications in resonant circuits, comparable only with ceramic capacitors. For simple high frequency filter circuits, <b>polyester</b> <b>capacitors</b> offer low-cost solutions with excellent long-term stability, allowing replacement of more expensive tantalum electrolytic capacitors. [...] The film/foil variants of plastic film capacitors are especially capable of handling high and very high current surges.|$|R
25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, film capacitors with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film capacitors {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|R
25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as sample and hold circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic <b>capacitors,</b> <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|R
2500|$|Polystyrene film capacitors, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "Styroflex Capacitors", were {{well known for}} many years as inexpensive film capacitors for general purpose applications, in which high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor and low leakage currents were needed. But because the film thickness could be not made thinner than 10nbsp&µm, and the maximum temperature ratings reached only 85nbsp&°C, the PS film capacitors have mostly been replaced by <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> as of 2012. However, some manufacturers may still offer PS film capacitors in their production program, backed by large amounts of polystyrene film stocked in their warehouse.|$|R
2500|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{made with}} lower-cost plastics {{are used for}} non-critical applications which do not require ultra-stable characteristics over a wide temperature range, such as for smoothing or AC signal coupling. [...] <b>Polyester</b> film (KT) <b>capacitors</b> of the [...] "stacked" [...] type are often used now instead of polystyrene capacitors (KS), which have become less available.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitor</b> used for PFC.|$|R
5000|$|Type - the {{dielectric}} {{used in the}} <b>capacitor.</b> <b>Polyester</b> and polypropylene are most common, with ceramic capacitors also being popular, especially in lower-end instruments. Reissues of vintage instruments often use reproductions of vintage paper capacitors, which are also popular aftermarket replacements. Finally, audiophile-grade polypropylene film and foil capacitors are sometimes used in custom instruments, although their size can prove problematic as they're designed for use in audio amplifiers and consequently have working voltages in excess of 500 V, far higher than anything encountered inside an electric guitar.|$|R
2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} film {{capacitors}} were the cellulose acetate film capacitors, also called MKU capacitors.

[...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time.

2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a film capacitor depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available film thickness of <b>polyester</b> film <b>capacitors</b> (about 0.7µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased film thickness. [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{continuous}} miniaturization {{of electronic}} boards and packages requires replacing surface mounted passive devices with embedded components in printed circuit boards. Dielectric materials {{have to be}} optimized {{in order to improve}} the performances of buried passive components in terms of dielectric behavior and reliability. Barium titanate/polymer hybrid materials present a great interest as embedded capacitor materials because they combine the low-temperature processability from the polymers with the desirable dielectric properties of the barium titanate (BaTiO 3) such as high dielectric constant. Furthermore, nanoparticles core/shell hybrid structure, inorganic BaTiO 3 core/organic polymer shell, reduces the formation of inorganic particles aggregates. In this work, hybrid nanoparticles were synthesized by functionalizing the BaTiO 3 nanopowders with hyperbranched polyesters. The resulting material, with average particle sizes of 750 nm and a BaTiO 3 volume fraction of 26 %, was spin-coated on a copper substrate acting as the first electrode of the capacitor. The final device was realized by covering the deposited film with a second opposite copper electrode. The thickness of the dielectric film was characterized using surface profilometry and cross-sectional optical microscopy. Dielectric properties of the hybrid material were studied with an impedance analyzer. The first results revealed that a capacitance density of 655 pF/cm² at 1 kHz can be achieved with 45 µm-thick BaTiO 3 /polymer films. Moreover, a dielectric constant of approximately 33 (at 1 kHz) was attained while the dielectric constant of currently available commercial embedded capacitors rarely exceeds 30. These results suggest that the BaTiO 3 / hyperbranched <b>polyesters</b> thin-film <b>capacitors</b> are promising candidates to be developed as buried capacitor...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Development of High Temperature Capacitor Technology and Manufacturing Capability {{program was}} to mature a production-ready supply chain for {{reliable}} 250 °C FPE (fluorinated <b>polyester)</b> film <b>capacitors</b> by 2011. These high-temperature film capacitors enable both the down hole drilling and aerospace industries by enabling a variety of benefits including: − Deeper oil exploration in higher temperature and pressure environments − Enabling power electronic and control equipment to operate in higher temperature environments − Enabling reduced cooling requirements of electronics − Increasing reliability and life of capacitors operating below rated temperature − Enabling capacitors to handle higher electrical losses without overheating. The key challenges to bringing the FPE film capacitors to market have been manufacturing challenges including: − FPE Film is difficult to handle and wind, resulting in poor yields − Voltage breakdown strength decreases when the film is wound into capacitors (~ 70 % decrease) − Encapsulation technologies must be improved to enable higher temperature operation − Manufacturing and test cycle time is very long As {{a direct result of}} this program most of the manufacturing challenges have been met. The FPE film production metalization and winding yield has increased to over 82 % from 70 %, and the voltage breakdown strength of the wound capacitors has increased 270 % to 189 V/μm. The high temperature packaging concepts are showing significant progress including promising results for lead attachments and hermetic packages at 200 °C and non-hermetic packages at 250 °C. Manufacturing and test cycle time will decrease as the market for FPE capacitors develops...|$|R
