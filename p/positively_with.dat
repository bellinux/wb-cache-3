5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate <b>positively</b> <b>with</b> the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

25|$|The {{validity}} {{and importance of}} c-command for the theory of syntax is a debated issue. In most cases, c-command correlates <b>positively</b> <b>with</b> precedence (linear order), that is, when node A c-commands node B, {{it is usually the}} case that node A also precedes node B. Furthermore, basic S(V)O (subject-verb-object) word order in English correlates <b>positively</b> <b>with</b> a hierarchy of syntactic functions, subjects outranking objects. Subjects typically precede objects in declarative sentences in English and related languages. These two insights suggest that theories of syntax that build on c-command have misconstrued the importance of precedence and/or the hierarchy of syntactic functions. What c-command is intended to address is arguably more accurately analyzed in terms of precedence and the syntactic functions. Further, the c-command concept was developed primarily with its ability to address syntactic phenomena of English, a language with relatively strict word order. When confronted with the much freer word order of many other languages, the insights provided by c-command are less compelling, since linear order becomes less important.|$|E
