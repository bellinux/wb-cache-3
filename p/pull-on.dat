25|$|Traditional Australian ugg {{boots are}} made from sheepskins with fleece attached. The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is {{assembled}} with the fleece on the inside. Some ugg boots have a synthetic sole, commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The stitching is often prominent {{on the outside of}} the boot. The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives isothermal properties to the boots: the thick fleecy fibres on the inner part of the boots wick moisture and allow air to circulate, keeping the feet at body temperature and allowing the boots to keep feet warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. Produced by a number of manufacturers, they come in a variety of colours, including black, pink, blue, chestnut, and fuchsia. They are available in both <b>pull-on</b> and lace-up varieties and their height can range from just above the ankle to above the knee.|$|E

This is a probable source of the name. Wesco's boots were immediately popular with welders in Portland, Oregon-area shipyards, who needed looser fitting shoes that they could quickly remove in the event embers landed in the shafts.

40|$|While {{graphic design}} as a {{profession}} is still relatively new, {{for most of its}} existence, practitioners have been criticised for their role in damaging the environment and society through the outputs they produce and the organisations for which they communicate. In 1964, Ken Garland’s First Things First Manifesto condemned an industry wasting talents on “trivial purposes, which contribute little or nothing to our national prosperity”. He proposed “a reversal of priorities” and challenged designers to stop congratulating themselves for work done to sell “slimming diets, fattening diets, deodorants, fizzy water, cigarettes, roll-ons, <b>pull-ons</b> and slip-ons ” and focus more on “more useful and more lasting forms of communication ” (1964, n. p.). Victor Papanek (1985, 68) also criticised the emphasis the industry placed on consumerism and proposed that 10 percent of a studio output be devoted to activities in contemporary social, environmental, financial, and ethical spheres. This criticism has continued through to this millennium, with an updated First Things First Manifesto published in 1999, and with authors, such as David Berman (2009), who repeat Papanek’s 10 percent output proposal. This scrutiny has increased as the broader population realises that the current state of being is one of unsustainable growth—as indicated by numerous reports, from Our Commo...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the preceding decade, the 1980s saw {{a sharp decline in}} the popularity of high-legged boots. Instead, ankle boots in a variety of styles were particularly popular, as were low-heeled, calf-length, <b>pull-on</b> styles. Knee length boots, if worn at all, tended to be low-heeled, <b>pull-on</b> styles, sometimes referred to as “riding boots,” that were combined with long skirts. In the late 1980s, over-the-knee boots made a reappearance; these were loose-fitting, low-heeled styles in suede, often brightly colored or decorated with brocade. In 1990, Karl Lagerfeld included thigh-length satin boots in his Fall/Winter Couture collection for Chanel, using the boots as an alternative to leggings, but it wasn’t until the following decade that the inherent elegance of classic dress boot styles was rediscovered.|$|E
50|$|Riggers, as {{they are}} {{commonly}} nicknamed, are usually tan in colour and go approximately {{third of the way}} up the leg and feature a steel toe cap for safety.

Many are constructed with zippers, but some are designed as <b>pull-on</b> boots. Heel heights vary, but most styles are either flat or with heels greater than 3 inches (7.5 cm). Heel styles vary from metal spikes to chunky. Like other boots, they can also have platform soles.|$|E
5000|$|From the mid-1910s {{into the}} early '20s, as hemlines rose from ankle length to mid-calf, high-heeled Russian boots with pointe or rounded toes, were {{increasingly}} popular. [...] They were available {{in a variety of}} styles, calf- or knee-length, with a Cuban or Louis heel, which could be <b>pull-on,</b> or zip-fastened for a closer fit. Worn with calf-length and finally knee-length skirts, they often featured decorative features such as elaborate stitching or fur trim. Russian boots were stylish throughout the 1920s as the fashionable alternative to galoshes in winter. They also somehow acquired a racy reputation, as the sort of footwear worn by girls who frequented saloon bars and speakeasies.|$|E
50|$|The calf-high <b>pull-on</b> jackboot {{had been}} the {{traditional}} footwear of the German soldier for generations. The Wehrmacht boot was little {{different from that of}} World War I: made of brown pebbled leather (blackened with polish), with hobnailed leather soles and heel-irons. Trousers were worn tucked inside. Originally 35-39 cm tall, the boots were shortened to 32-35 cm in 1939 in order to save leather. By 1940 leather was becoming more scarce and issue was restricted to combat branches, and in 1941 jackboots were no longer issued to new recruits. By late 1943 production of jackboots had ceased altogether. However, as late as fall 1944 depots were encouraged to issue Marschstiefel to infantry and artillery, to the extent they were available.|$|E

Finally, button-fastened boots were common at the beginning of the last century but are rarely seen today. If present, buttons are usually employed as design accents on boots; other decorative features include straps, buckles, studs, and decorative stitching.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a Molecular Dynamics method {{to model the}} {{frictionless}} adhesive interaction force between two fine cohesive polymer grains. The model consists of three main steps: firstly, we build a simple model of the bulk material for these grains, using only two microscopic internal parameters (the bond energy and the equilibrium distance between atoms in an amorphous lattice). To have big enough specimens, an inhomogeneous distribution of the atoms size prepared in layers has been implemented. Atoms with minimum size belong {{to the area of}} contact, giving in this manner a higher resolution near the contact area. Secondly, the cohesion strength (i. e., the work of adhesion) is derived from the interaction potential of the atoms of the grain with the wall. Finally, we simplify the computational problem, solving the equivalent contact problem of sphere-plane interaction. The contact zone is essentially given by the asperity size, therefore the adhesion between the asperity and the plane is calculated as a sum of interactions between atoms of the asperity and the plane. A computational experiment of <b>pull-on</b> is carried out to study the influence of the adhesion on the formation of the contact area and forces between two polymer-based toner particles of 10 microns with asperities of the order of 0. 2 micron. Finally, the numerical results are compared with theoretical predictions, and a good agreement is observed. ...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{removal of}} natural organic matter (NOM) during {{drinking}} water treatment {{is important in}} order to minimize the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). The research presented in this thesis investigates modification of iron oxide-coated sand (IOCS) with organic cations as a means to improve NOM removal by adsorption. Several types of IOCS prepared with different methods were compared and one type of IOCS prepared by the “sludge coating” method was found to possess relative better physical/chemical stability and NOM adsorption capacity and was selected. Modifying the selected IOCS with three quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), including tetrapropylammonium chloride (TPA), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) and hexadecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride (HDBDMA) was examined under different conditions. Modification of IOCS with HDTMA at high pH with an addition of 0. 2 % H 2 O 2 appears to be the best condition for producing modified IOCS with most significantly enhanced NOM adsorption. Evaluation of NOM adsorption on this HDTMA-modified IOCS was extensively conducted in both laboratory batch and column adsorption tests. The HDTMA-modified IOCS displayed faster initial NOM adsorption rate and substantially higher NOM adsorption capacity than the unmodified IOCS at a wide pH range, with the enhancement being more pronounced at higher pH conditions. The modification also decreased the interference from common anions (e. g., phosphate ions) in water on NOM adsorption onto IOCS. Compared to the unmodified IOCS, the HDTMA-modified IOCS preferentially removed the more hydrophobic and larger size fractions of NOM molecules and resulted in enhanced reduction of trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). The longer contact time at a lower filtration rate in the column operation increased the breakthrough capacity of the HDTMA-modified IOCS. The exhausted NOM adsorption capacity of the modified IOCS can be recovered (with slight decreases) through in-situ regeneration with NaOH solution and/or through ex-situ re-modification with HDTMA solution. The mechanisms contributing to the enhanced NOM adsorption on the HDTMA-modified IOCS were explored with surface characterization techniques, in combination with the adsorption test results. The electrostatic interactions that were thought to be brought from the positively-charged, surface-coated HDTMA seemed to be unimportant, likely because the outwards-pointing tail groups of the surface-coated HDTMA hindered the interaction. Improved hydrophobic interactions followed by ligand exchange are believed to be the dominant mechanisms governing the enhanced NOM adsorption on the HDTMA-modified IOCS. Force analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM) was first successfully applied to explore the functioning mechanisms between NOM and IOCS. It provided direct evidence to demonstrate the <b>pull-on</b> force changes and the enhanced hydrophobic interactions brought from the modification of IOCS with HDTMA...|$|E
