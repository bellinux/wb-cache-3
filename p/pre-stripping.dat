40|$|ABSTRACT: Waste {{stripping}} {{involves the}} most costly processes {{for any given}} open cut coal mining operation, As such, it is fundamentally important to optimise material scheduling and the sequences involved in excavating and hauling waste material. In situations constrained by fleet capacity and productivity. The only viable option to potentially yield further cost gains is to modify current mining methods. In the case of many Australian coal mines, truck-shovel systems excavate the initial overlying waste, known as <b>pre-strip,</b> down to a predetermined level known as the <b>pre-strip</b> horizon. This paper provides and analyses a simulation model to derive the optimal strip width for <b>pre-strip</b> activities. Case study data obtained from an established leading coal producer in the Bowen Basin was implemented into a pit simulation model to assess the effect of <b>pre-strip</b> width on the overall pit economics. <b>Pre-strip</b> widths of 60 to 120 m in 10 m increments were assessed whilst keeping dragline and coal stripping widths constant at 60 m. The simulation revealed the potential for cost reductions to be significant when a 90 m <b>pre-strip</b> case is adopted {{as opposed to the}} base case of 60 m. The paper presents the simulation findings for each case and discusses the key drivers behind the cost variations for each case...|$|R

40|$|As {{open cut}} mines become {{progressively}} deeper, mining operations face increased operating costs and technical challenges. In-Pit Crusher Conveyor (IPCC) systems offer advantages {{in the form}} of continuous operation, reduced labour requirements and decreased energy consumption resulting in lower cost per bank cubic metre. Nevertheless, IPCC systems are associated with high capital costs, lack of flexibility to adapt to changing mine plans and low effective system utilisation.

It demonstrates that system redundancy {{in the form of}} introducing parallel conveyor lines with spreaders is capable of improving IPCC productivity by 9 · 4 – 12 · 6 %. Parallel conveying systems have higher Equivalent Unit Costs (EUCs) than do single conveyor IPCC configurations. Nevertheless, introducing redundancy into IPCC systems enables higher production and associated coal revenue. Using an indicative metallurgical coal price and stripping ratio, it was demonstrated that parallel conveyor IPCC systems can provide higher profit than single conveyor line IPCC alternatives...|$|E
30|$|The VQS can {{simultaneously}} realize quick {{oil and gas}} separation, quick oil and gas extraction and quick <b>pre-stripping</b> of catalysts {{at the end of}} the riser. The pressure distribution is reasonable and pressure drop is low, which can prevent gas from gathering and jamming at the outlet. The solid catalyst particles are quickly and efficiently separated; hence, the gas residence time is shortened and the separation efficiency is enhanced. The total gas–solid separation efficiency at ambient temperature exceeds 98.5  %. The application of the VQS in the Sinopec Branch Jiujiang Company Refinery has achieved satisfying results. Their feedstocks have high viscosity and high carbon content. In September 1999, Sinopec Branch Jiujiang Company Refinery replaced the single rotation rough cyclone with a VQS to improve heavy oil processing capacity, reduce coking formation, prolong operating period and increase light liquid yield, and received great economic returns. From the data collected in the refinery, it is found that the products distribution is improved: The dry gas yield is reduced by 0.5 percentage points, and liquid yield increases by 1.2 percentage points.|$|E
30|$|The riser reactor is the {{key unit}} in the fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) process. As the FCC feedstocks become heavier, the product mixture of oil, gas and catalysts must be separated immediately at the outlet of the riser to avoid excessive coking. The quick separation system is the core equipment in the FCC unit. China University of Petroleum (Beijing) has developed many kinds of separation system including the fender-stripping cyclone and circulating-stripping cyclone systems, which can increase the separation efficiency and reduce the pressure drop remarkably. For the inner riser system, a vortex quick separation system has been developed. It contains a vortex quick separator and an isolated shell. In {{order to reduce the}} separation time, a new type of separator called the short residence time separator system was developed. It can further reduce the separation time to less than 1  s. In this paper, the corresponding design principles, structure and industrial application of these different kinds of separation systems are reviewed. A system that can simultaneously realize quick oil gas separation, quick oil gas extraction and quick <b>pre-stripping</b> of catalysts {{at the end of the}} riser is the trend in the future.|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} that set mining apart from most industries {{is the level of}} capital intensity. Mining requires high levels of capital investment at both mine construction and operation stages. As the world economic climate continues to show patterns of uncertainty the manner in which capital is deployed comes into question. Isibonelo Colliery an open cast operation of Anglo American Thermal Coal has asked the question of how capital should be deployed until the end of its life of mine. Isibonelo Colliery like most mining operations has an ageing ore body and therefore mineral extraction {{is becoming more and more}} difficult. The amount of overburden (sand) needed to be moved in order to gain access to the coal has more than doubled in the past four years and continues to increase. The colliery has therefore brought in a new process that of <b>pre-strip</b> removal by truck and shovel to assist the primary equipment already working on overburden removal (dragline). This document serves to show how the colliery should purchase one of its key production equipment, the Hitachi haul trucks without a lot of historical data on haul truck and shovel utilisation. Simulation modelling is the most appropriate technique to use for this study due to its ability to accurately forecast based on actual data. The model should determine the number of trucks needed to meet contractual sales until the end of the life of mine. It would take also into account variability associated with open cast mining such as weather, hauling distance, equipment availability and utilisation as well as the changing geology. The application software chosen was Simio Simulation Software which is perfect for this kind of use. The results of this simulation showed that three haul trucks are required to be procured to ensure that 3 000 000 bank cubic metres of <b>pre-strip</b> is removed annually in order for the colliery to fulfil its contractual requirements. This goes to show the value that can be attained when simulation modelling is applied with a full understanding of the problem. Thesis (B Eng.

40|$|We {{present the}} highest-resolution study to {{date of the}} ISM in galaxies {{undergoing}} ram pressure stripping, using HST BVI imaging of NGC 4522 and NGC 4402, Virgo Cluster spirals that are well-known to be experiencing ICM ram pressure. We find that throughout most of both galaxies, the main dust lane has a fairly well-defined edge, {{with a population of}} GMC-sized (tens- to hundreds-of-pc scale), isolated, highly extincting dust clouds located up to ~ 1. 5 kpc radially beyond it. Outside of these dense clouds, the area has little or no diffuse dust extinction, indicating that the clouds have decoupled from the lower-density ISM material that has already been stripped. Several of the dust clouds have elongated morphologies that indicate active ram pressure, including two large (kpc-scale) filaments in NGC 4402 that are elongated in the projected ICM wind direction. We calculate a lower limit on the HI + H_ 2 masses of these clouds based on their dust extinctions and find that a correction factor of ~ 10 gives cloud masses consistent with those measured in CO for clouds of similar diameters, probably due to the complicating factors of foreground light, cloud substructure, and resolution limitations. Assuming that the clouds' actual masses are consistent with those of GMCs of similar diameters (~ 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 M_sun), we estimate that only a small fraction (~ 1 - 10 %) of the original HI + H_ 2 remains in the parts of the disks with decoupled clouds. Based on H-alpha images, a similar fraction of star formation persists in these regions, 2 - 3 % of the estimated <b>pre-stripping</b> star formation rate. We find that the decoupled cloud lifetimes may be up to 150 - 200 Myr. Comment: 20 pages, 22 figure...|$|E
40|$|The Weather loach (Misgurnus fossilis) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} disappearing species in Europe. This is the reason for finding a {{solution}} for support of natural populations. The possible solution is artificial stripping under controlled conditions and stocking of offspring into appropriate habitats. Carp pituitary extract (CPE) has been used for controlled stimulation of oocyte maturation until now. The usage of CPE in fishery is decreasing because of health risks. The aim of this thesis was the comparison of different hormonal stimulants on selected aspects of artificial spawning of Weather loach. Stimulants were injected intramusculatury in two doses. Females were taken from experimental pond in Vodňany FROV (individual body weight 31 - 59 g). Temperature was kept at 17. 9 +/- 0. 13 °C. The lowest percentage of ovulating females (80 %) was achieved after stimulation by Dagin (dose: one ampula per 40 kg). With use of the other stimulants, all females were ovulating. The highest relative amount of stripped eggs in relation to <b>pre-stripping</b> weight of female was reached after application of Ovaprim in dose 1 ml×kg- 1 (170 +/- 19 ks×g- 1). The smallest amount of stripped eggs was obtained after application of Pregnyl in dose 1500 IU×kg- 1 (85 +/- 38 ks×g- 1), Pregnyl in dose 3000 IU (97 +/- 24 ks×g- 1) Chorulon 1500 IU (86 +/- 32 ks×g- 1) respectively. The shortest latency interval was observed after stimulation by CPE (18 hours) and by Ovaprim in dose 2 ml×kg- 1 (23 hours) respectively. Interval of latency was longer than 31 hours in females stimulated with lower doses (1500 IU) of a stimulant without dopaminergic inhibitor. The best synchronization of ovulation was observed after stimulation by CPE (1 hour) and Chorulon in dose 3000 IU and 1500 IU (2 hours) respectively. The egg of weather loach contained 53 % of carbon, 21 % of oxygen, 12 % of nitrogen, 8 % of hydrogen and 0. 3 % of sulfur. Chemical composition was significantly different only in oxygen concentration between females stimulated by CPE and 2 ml×kg- 1 Ovaprim. In general, worse results of artifficial spawning aspects were observed after stimulation by stimulants without dopaminergic inhibitor. The results in this thesis show which accessible commercial hormonal stimulants used in stimulation of other fish species are useable for controlled reproduction of weather loach. Ovopel and Ovaprim can be recommended for stimuation of ovulation or spermiation of weather loach...|$|E
40|$|The exotic orebodies {{related to}} cal-alkaline {{porphyry}} copper deposits. are sub-horizontal lenticular bodies of secondary copper minerals that impregnate Tertiary gravels and bedrock of different ages. They lie immediately downslope of the porphyry copper deposits, {{that is to}} say. they {{are related to the}} propylitic halo of the main deposits, and are considered to have originated with the deposition of copper minerals from solutions that overflowed during the secondary enrichment process. Supergene alteration took place between the late Oligocene and Miocene, by which time both orehodies (exotic and porphyry copper) were established. The paucity of tile denudation since the Miocene in the Andean segment from 21 º to 26 º latitude S. due to the dominance of a hyperarid climate explains the remarkable preservation of the shallow porphyry copper systems, supergene enriched blankets and associated deposits. This is reflected in the limonites, where the typical boxworks have been partially or totally destroyed on surface by the superleaching. As a result of the lateral migration of the copper-bearing solutions, the exotic deposits show a zonation. alteration and mineralization whose characteristics depend among other factors. on the reactivity of the bedrocks and the Cu/S ratio of the mother deposit. In these deposits three zones can be recognized: Proximal (0 to 2 km Intermediate (2 to 3) and Distal (3 to 8 - 14 km) with palaeodrainage control. The associations and mineralogical abundance are related to the climate (rain. temperature). In some deposits two important units are detected and they are the Cu-phosphates and Cu-lixiviable (to sulphuric acid) units. The size of tile Chilean exotic deposits varies between 100 and 3. 500. 000 tons of copper, with a total known resource of 8 M tons of copper. The large exotic deposits are comparable to the resources of a medium-sized porphyry copper- type deposit. The discovery of the exotic deposits is related to the exploration of porphyry copper deposits, where a mass balance of the leached column must be done. Moreover the lithology and alteration of the propylitic halo. permeability, structures, geophysics and geochemistry should be considered. The diorite model is not compatible with a supergene enrichment process, expressed by the absence of colour anomalies, exotic deposits and in the presence of secondary minerals like jarosite, which is coherent with the pyrite deficiency of the system. The projects are for exploitation of reserves by open pit methods. The projects plan to extract and to crush copper oxide ore which will he pre-treated with concentrated sulphuric acid prior to heap leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning. The copper output varies between 10, 000 and 50, 000 ton per year of catilode copper. The total investment varies between 20 and 100 millions dollars. For project calculations, estimation of 65 % - 82 % copper recovery and 37 - 40 kg/ton net acid consumption can be used {{due to the nature of}} ore. The leaching time is estimated as 30 to 180 days for heaps of 4, 5 to 30 metres high. As a result of this, the plant capacity is determined by an annual equivalent of 10, 000 to 25, 000 ton Cu per year. Pit planning has heen carried out using diverse software on the basis of 5 x 5 x 5 m and 10 x 10 x 10 m block models, evaluated using a kriging package built into the program, giving an overall waste/ore ratio (induding <b>pre-stripping)</b> of 0 : I (in an outcrop) to 3 : I. The location of the mine and plant sites are associated with the porphyry copper in production, for this the already installed facilities can be used. So there is no need to build a new mine camp or access. The environmental impact is summarized relating to the characterization of the physical, biological and socio-cuitural effects, using the framework of the Base Line study and the Impact evaluation derived from the construction and project operation phases.
