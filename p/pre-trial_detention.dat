The decision upon a general-security women's corrective labor colony (the most common type of prison in Russia) in the Republic of Mordovia, approximately 400 kilometers from Moscow, was later confirmed by Tolokonnikova's husband.

40|$|The main {{argument}} of this thesis {{is that the}} penitentiary crisis in Venezuela is brought about an inept criminal justice system whose functioning (or lack thereof) further exacerbates overcrowding in penitentiary facilities as well as violates the most basic human rights. More elaborately, I argue that the unintentional (mis) use of <b>pre-trial</b> preventive <b>detention,</b> one {{of the consequences of}} the inept criminal justice system, further exacerbates the overcrowding in prisons and creates serious human rights implications. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a connection between the penitentiary crisis in Venezuela, with a focus on <b>pre-trial</b> preventive <b>detention,</b> and the larger criminal justice system failure in the country. The data source and data gathering technique for the thesis consists of a content analysis and a secondary literature review. Since the theoretical framework of the project is international human rights, instruments from the United Nations and the Organization of American States are used. Reports from non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones provide the data to conduct the analysis which is specific to <b>pre-trial</b> preventive <b>detention</b> in Venezuela. These reports are produced on a yearly basis and will help to compliment the data obtained from government sources, mainly the Venezuelan Ombudsman 2 ̆ 7 s office. The findings of the thesis support the argument that contrary to common belief, the (mis) use of <b>pre-trial</b> preventive <b>detention</b> in Venezuela is in fact mainly accidental, it is not systematic in the sense that it is not targeting a particular group of people due to their political affiliation and/or beliefs. Furthermore, I prove that Venezuelan penitentiary facilities are overcrowded due to the (mis) use of <b>pre-trial</b> preventive <b>detention.</b> Immediate recommendations for the Venezuelan state include re-categorizing the penal population in Venezuela as well as diminishing the use of deprivation of liberty, specifically <b>pre-trial</b> preventive <b>detention...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1964 {{the prison}} became the {{facility}} used mostly for <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detentions.</b> It was greatly overcrowded: {{in the mid-1990s}} the prison held more than 12,500 inmates. That is more than ten times the design capacity of the prison (1150 inmates). Often in a cell originally designed for solitary confinement during the Tsarist period {{and according to the}} Soviet rules suitable for only 6 inmates would actually hold more than 20 inmates taking their turns to sleep on the three-level bunk bed and on the floor. Detention for months or even years in those conditions, often manipulated by the investigators, was often a method to press the suspects. In 1983 the prison was rendered unsuitable for women and minors.|$|R

Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint.

5000|$|Prisons in Latin America {{are among}} the most {{dangerous}} in the world, and the ones in Bolivia are the second most overcrowded at 233% overcapacity (just behind El Salvador, with 299%). The driving factors in overcrowding are <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detentions</b> and judicial backlogs. At least 85% of the inmates in the country have pending trials/convictions. Many are imprisoned for minor drug offenses under Law 1008, a controversial legislation created in 1988 that places heavy penalties on drug offenders. In addition, prisons in Latin America are often run by inmates affiliated with a criminal group. The gang leaders, known as [...] "delegates", may charge fees to other inmates in exchange for certain benefits, such as occupying personal cells, enjoying family visits, or having televisions. Prisons in Bolivia may have so-called [...] "life insurance" [...] fees, mandatory extortion payments among inmates that range from $100 to $500. The fees are controlled by prison gangs, and those who fail to pay may face torture or death. Egregious as these abuses are, as of 2013, organized crime activities in Bolivia's penitentiary system are not at the levels of influence observed in most prisons of Central America, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, where a significant proportion of outside organized crime is commanded from inside prisons.|$|R

40|$|Background: Some say 'prison works', {{others say}} that it only harms. Overall, {{longitudinal}} studies of prisoners suggest some positive impact on mental state, but post-release recidivism is high. How do men {{at high risk for}} repeated imprisonment experience it? Aim: To explore prison (gaol) experience among men awaiting trial in custody. Methods: In a prospective longitudinal study, 170 men were interviewed just after reception about their social context and mental state and again three weeks later, when each was asked to describe his current prison experience; 75 % had been in prison before. Data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: Each man had views on his imprisonment. Data were saturated after 20 interviews. The core concern was its overall emotional impact, in full negative to positive range, with recognition that this could and did change in either direction, both passively and through active processes. Underpinning themes were along the dimensions of missing people to asylum from the outside world; in-prison bullying to positive staff and/or inmate relationships; boredom to relief in routine; and 'doing my head in' to salvation from drug-induced decline. Testing the model in the whole sample confirmed no association between prison impact and pre-prison factors. Negative experience was associated with severe depression within but not before this imprisonment. More positive experience related to good in-prison relationships. Conclusions: During <b>pre-trial</b> custodial <b>detention,</b> there is a greater range of experience than generally previously reported. The simple expedients of prison staff developing good relationships with prisoners, and facilitating these between prisoners, could be life-saving. Highly positive experiences may be more an indictment on community services than an endorsement of imprisonment...|$|R

25|$|New York's use of remand (<b>pre-trial</b> <b>detention)</b> and bail {{procedures}} have been criticized. For example, New York {{is one of}} only four states that does not allow judges to consider public safety when making a bail determination. And almost without exception, New York judges only set two kinds of bail at arraignment, straight cash or commercial bail bond, while other options exist such as partially secured bonds, which only require a tenth of the full amount as a down payment, and unsecured bonds, which don't require any up front payment. The Court of Appeals ruled in 1991 that most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours, and in 2013, {{for the first time since}} 2001, the average time it took to arraign defendants fell below 24 hours in all five boroughs of New York City. But there have been accusations of systematic trial delays, especially with regards to the New York City stop-and-frisk program. There have also been allegations that excessive <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detention</b> and systematic trial delays are used to pressure defendants to accept plea bargains.|$|E

In all, some 1000 people were detained in two nights of rioting. 156 were injured, including some two dozen police officers, and numerous stores, offices and homes were damaged. As there had been too many arrests for the normal <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detention</b> centers, many suspects were taken to a hastily set up holding area in the Terminal D of the Tallinn Seaport.|$|E

Several foreign journalists were also briefly detained, including a group of journalists from the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza, French Libération, and British The Guardian. Many foreign journalists were exposed to pressure from the security forces and materials were confiscated from TV crews ZDF and ARD (Germany), AP Television News (USA), and Rustavi 2 (Georgia). The crew of Rustavi 2 was arrested; the Georgian Minister of Health said that the correspondent Nana Lezhava, who had been kept for five days in the Russian <b>pre-trial</b> <b>detention</b> centers, had been poisoned with dangerous psychotropic drugs (like Politkovskaya, Lezhava had passed out after being given a cup of tea).

The main suspect admitted to causing the deaths and injuries, but denied that they constituted murder with terrorist intent. The motive of the attack was still unclear according to NBI. Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared him from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects, as well as trying to locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. The suspects' ages range from 18 to 28.
