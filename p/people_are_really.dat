On August 10, 2010, Evancho performed the aria [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] in the show's quarter-final round. The judges' reactions were effusive. Afterwards, commentators queried whether her performance had been lip-synched.

[...] Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary. The Monster Ball sold out shows in Toronto, Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city. In Los Angeles, to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets, a second performance was announced prior to the onsale of the first shows, and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out. Billboard estimated that by the time the tour wraps up in 2011, it would have grossed close to US$200million worldwide.|$|E

It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode.

[...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

2500|$|An anti-Zionist {{interpretation}} of Tanya was offered by Abraham Yehudah Khein, a prominent Ukrainian Chabad rabbi, who supported anarchist communism and considered Peter Kropotkin a great Tzaddik.

By this logic, he claimed that Vladimir Solovyov and Rabindranath Tagore probably have Jewish souls, while Leon Trotsky and other totalitarians do not, and many Zionists, whom he compared to apes, are merely [...] "Jewish by birth certificate".|$|E

He refused to fill an exit interview form for Fairchild and wrote only one line (exact quote): [...] "I want to be RICH!"

That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.

2500|$|Tiana {{is notable}} for being Disney's first black princess. The studio's {{decision}} {{to create a}} black heroine was met with mixed reception. While some critics, such as Richard Watson, praised the film for offering a long-awaited [...] "break in tradition", others received it with much criticism and speculation. Rachel Bertsche of O, The Oprah Magazine called {{the arrival of a}} black Disney princess [...] "barrier-breaking" [...] and [...] "long overdue". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote, [...] "these avowedly black people spend an awful lot of the movie being adorable, unthreatening little green creatures. Disney may wish to reach out to people of colour – but the colour green wasn't what we had in mind." [...] Bidisha of The Observer was fairly mixed in her review, calling Tiana a [...] "one-dimensional" [...] but [...] "clever, strong woman", while criticizing the film's light-hearted plot and lack of emphasis on racial issues. Patricia Williams of The Guardian, who conceded harboring a general dislike of Disney animated films and the characters featured in them, including the princesses, accused Disney of being [...] "unforgivably late" [...] in their creation of a black heroine. Williams did, however, find Tiana to be [...] "spunkier than most princesses", comparing her to Princess Fiona of the Shrek franchise, and reacted positively to Tiana's portrayal as a tireless feminist restaurant tycoon. Writer Brooks Barnes from The New York Times highlights the two different issues for Princess Tiana, in her article [...] "Her Prince Has Come. Critics, Too" [...] that shows Disney with a good standing than with a negative standpoint, with the help of other writers expressing how, [...] "Disney should be ashamed", said William Blackburn, a former columnist at The Charlotte Observer. [...] "This princess story is set in New Orleans, the setting {{of one of the most}} devastating tragedies to beset a black community." [...] From a rumor that surfaced online giving off that Disney was originally going to call Maddy (short for Madeleine) giving the idea that it was too close to the racist word Mammy, giving the aspect for her being a slave to her friend Charlotte La Bouff. Harvard teacher Michael D. Baran, a cognitive psychologist and anthropologist, expressed how children learn about race, and [...] how Disney has a stereotyping history, [...] "Because of Disney’s history of stereotyping, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> excited to see how Disney will handle her language, her culture, her physical attributes" [...] said Michael D.
