40|$|Figure 1 : Utah’s seven <b>planning</b> <b>districts</b> As {{our populations}} increase, {{and more and}} more develop-ment takes place, {{critical}} lands and waters are threatened or even lost in the ensuing rush for economic progress. At the same time, greater value is being placed on the natural resource amenities of clean air and water, scenic beauty, wildlife, and opportunities for outdoor recreation. Critical to these valued amenities is the need to retain and protect open space. There are a number of initiatives and projects addressing recreational and open space needs in Utah. One such project is Utah’s Great Outdoors Open Space Project, which focused on involving key stakeholders by directly seeking their input in the assessment of outdoor recreational and open space needs, priorities, and initiatives for each of the seven, governmental <b>Planning</b> <b>Districts</b> in Utah (Figure 1). By focusing stakeholders on issues related to outdoor recreation, amenity values (such as scenic beauty), and ecological services (such as clean water, wetlands, and wildlife habitat), the ultimate goal of the project was to identify action strategies for addressing open space needs throughout the state.
