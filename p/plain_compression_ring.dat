40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The losses in an internal combustion engine are dominated by thermal and parasitic sources. The latter arises from mechanical inefficiencies inherent within the system, particularly friction in load bearing conjunctions such as the piston assembly. During idle and at low engine speeds, frictional losses are the major contributor to the overall engine losses {{as opposed to the}} dominant contribution of thermal losses under other driving conditions. Given the relatively small size and simple structure of the top <b>compression</b> <b>ring,</b> it has a disproportionate contribution to the total frictional losses. This suggests further analysis would be required to understand the underlying causes of <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> behaviour throughout the engine cycle. The available literature on tribological analyses of <b>compression</b> <b>rings</b> does not account for the transient ring elastodynamics. They usually assume a rigid ring for film thickness and power loss predictions, which is not representative of the ring’s dynamic response.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The piston ring pack {{accounts}} for a disproportionate amount of the total engine frictional losses. The frictional behaviour of piston rings is significantly affected and governed by its flexible dynamics. The dynamically changing shape of the ring determines its contact geometry with the cylinder liner and hence affects the frictional losses. The <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> undergoes a multitude of complex motions during the engine cycle prescribed by the gas pressure, contact reaction, ring tension, friction between the ring and its groove and inertial forces that excite a plethora of the ring’s modal responses. This adversely compromises the functionality of the ring {{through a number of}} undesired phenomena such as ring flutter, twist, rotation and jump. Therefore, a prerequisite for improving the prediction of tribological conditions is an accurate determination of the ring’s elastodynamic response. This paper presents a methodology to directly solve the governing differential equations of motion for different forms of beam cross-section, where the shear and mass centres are not coincident, typical of the complex cross-sections of a variety of different piston <b>compression</b> <b>rings.</b> Combined numerical and experimental investigations are undertaken to determine the dynamic behaviour of the <b>compression</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

Surface texturing has emerged as a method palliating these losses in instances where thin lubricant films lead to mixed or boundary regimes of lubrication.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} (IC) engines {{have been}} the predominant technology for sourcing or generating power for over 100 years. The fundamental function of engines has not changed since there first introduction. By combusting fuel within the chamber causes a pressure build from the expanding gasses pushing the piston assembly through the cylinder, this linear action is then translated to rotation through the crankshaft to generate work. During combustion the gasses will try to move past the piston and into the crankcase, to deter this from occurring piston rings are introduced. Thus rings {{are designed to be}} in tight contact to the cylinder wall, and is subject to friction and wear as it travels up and down the cylinder wall. When a new ring pack is introduced, a running-in process is required. This involves running the engine at a variation of speeds for set times, typically defined by the manufacturer. While this procedure is executed the <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> will undergo a series of thermodynamic morphological stages, the material will change shape due to the heat from the combustion process and suffer material loss due to the friction wear between cylinder wall and ring face.
