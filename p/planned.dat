40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} <b>plan</b> {{execution}} on agents/robots in highly dy-namic environments. Besides a formal semantics of <b>plan</b> execution and a repre-sentation of <b>plans</b> as programs, we introduce {{the concept of}} <b>plan</b> invariants. <b>Plan</b> invariants are similar to loop invariants in imperative programs in {{that they have to}} be true during the whole <b>plan</b> execution cycle. Once a <b>plan</b> invariant fails the <b>plan</b> execution is stopped and other <b>plans</b> that are more appropriate in the current context are considered for execution instead. The use of <b>plan</b> invariants allows for an early detection of problems. <b>Plan</b> assumptions that are required for a <b>plan</b> to succeed are explicitly represented by <b>plan</b> invariants. ...|$|R

40|$|Real world {{large scale}} {{applications}} require <b>planning</b> systems that combine different <b>planning</b> techniques (like <b>planning</b> ahead, deferred <b>planning</b> and reactive <b>planning).</b> In this paper {{we present a}} system (called MRG) that provides this capability.

Thus, a MRG <b>plan</b> can describe whether, when and how to perform these activities. As a consequence of this ability (that we call introspective <b>planning),</b> MRG can be used uniformly and flexibly to combine different <b>planning</b> techniques in one system according to the application requirements. 1 Motivations A variety of approaches to <b>planning</b> have been proposed so far in the AI literature, for instance classical <b>planning</b> [3, 18], case-based <b>planning</b> [8], conditional <b>planning</b> [11], deferred <b>planning</b> [2], reactive systems [1, 5].

40|$|Mixed {{initiative}} <b>planning</b> {{envisions a}} {{framework in which}} automated and human planners interact to jointly construct <b>plans</b> that satisfy specific objectives. In this paper, we report on our work engineering a robust mixed initiative <b>planning</b> system. Human planners rely strongly on past <b>planning</b> experience to generate new <b>plans.</b> ForMAT is a casebased system that supports human <b>planning</b> through the accumulation of userbuilt <b>plans,</b> querydriven browsing of past <b>plans,</b> and several <b>plan</b> functionality analysis primitives. Prodigy/Analogy is an automated AI planner that combines generative and casebased <b>planning.</b> Stored <b>plans</b> are annotated with <b>plan</b> rationale and reuse involves adaptation driven by this rationale. Our system, MICBP, integrates ForMAT and Prodigy/Analogy into a realtime message passing mixed initiative <b>planning</b> system. The main technical approach consists of allowing the user to specify and link objectives that enable the system to capture and reuse <b>plan</b> rationale. We present MICBP and its concrete application to the domain of military force deployment <b>planning.</b> This synergistic system increases the <b>planning</b> efficiency of human planners through automated suggestion of similar past <b>plans</b> and plausible <b>plan</b> modifications...|$|R
