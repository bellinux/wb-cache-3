The V-notch rail shear configuration was used for characterizing the in-plane shear behavior of Newport NB 321 / 3 k 70 <b>plain</b> weave <b>carbon</b> fabric/epoxy, NCT/ 321 /G 150 Carbon Fiber Unitape/epoxy, NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy, Cytec PWC/T 300 / 3 KNT <b>plain</b> weave <b>carbon</b> fabric/epoxy and Fibercote 3 KPW/E 365 <b>plain</b> weave <b>carbon</b> fabric/epoxy systems. The testing was conducted using a servo hydraulic testing machine at nominal stroke rates ranging between 0. 00083 in/sec to 500 in/sec. A maximum average shear strain rate of 654 rad/sec was achieved up to shear strain levels of 0. 08 radians, during the tests. The stress-strain behavior of all material systems exhibited contrasting behavior with increasing stroke rates. The stress-strain curves for all materials exhibited an asymptotic behavior for stroke rates approaching 10 in/sec and were material dependent for stroke rates exceeding 250 in/sec. For Newport NB 321 / 3 k 70 and NB 321 / 7781 systems at the highest test rate, the shear strengths increased {{by a factor of}} three relative to that of the quasi-static rate, and were independent of the reinforcement type. The shear strength for Cytec PWC/T 300 / 3 KNT, Fibercote 3 KPW/E 365 and Newport NCT/ 321 /G 150 increased until a stroke rate of 100 in/sec and later decreased with increasing stroke rate. The failure modes for Cytec PWC/T 300 / 3 KNT, Fibercote 3 KPW/E 365 and Newport NCT/ 321 /G 150 were at the minimum section of the shear coupons, while for Newport NB 321 / 3 k 70 and NB 321 / 7781, failure was observed to change from a shear mode across the minimum section to a complex failure mode away from the minimum section...|$|R

Twelve different combinations of MFC and rubber nanoparticles were tested. Their influences on the quasi-static mechanical properties of the composites were measured performing tensile and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests.

On the other hand, the Young’s modulus can be considered unaffected. The SEM images showed that the matrix deformability became evident with increasing the MFC and NBR contents.

50|$|Alonizing is a {{diffusion}} metallizing {{process in}} that it is a thermochemical treatment that involves enriching the surface layer of an object with one or more metallic elements.

This process results in an alloy with the surface properties of aluminum while retaining the base metal’s inherent strength and rigidity.
