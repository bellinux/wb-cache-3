50|$|The {{commission}} gathered as {{much information}} as possible of victims of psychiatric terror in the Soviet Union and published this information in their <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins.</b> For the four years of its existence, the Commission published more than 1,500 pages of documentation including 22 <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> in which over 400 cases of the political abuse of psychiatry were documented in great detail. Summaries of the <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were published in the key samizdat publication, A Chronicle of Current Events. The <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were sent to the Soviet officials, with request to verify the data and notify the Commission if mistakes were found, and to the West, where human rights defenders used them {{in the course of their}} campaigns. The <b>Information</b> <b>Bulletins</b> were also used to provide the dissident movement with information about Western protests against the political abuse. The Working Commission also gathered information about relevant international events and published reports on the Honolulu Congress of the World Psychiatric Association, including the texts of the key resolutions, and printed translations of long letters by Professor Peter Berner about the course of establishing the Review Committee on abuse.|$|R
