We made a detailed classification of the errors in a word and sentence dictation task made by 100 students with dyslexia and 100 matched control students. All participants were {{in the first year}} of their bachelor’s studies and had Dutch as mother tongue. Three main error categories were distinguished: <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> and grammatical errors (on the basis of morphology and language-specific spelling rules). The results indicated that higher-education students with dyslexia made on average twice as many spelling errors as the controls, with effect sizes of d ≥ 2. When the errors were classified as <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> or grammatical, we found a slight dominance of phonological errors in students with dyslexia.

40|$|Morphological {{decomposition}} is {{an important}} part of complex word processing and the left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG) has been shown to be a key brain area involved in morphological processing in alphabetic languages. Chinese morphological processing requires a comprehensive consideration of <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic</b> and morphemic information. But it had been unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying morphological processing in alphabetic languages would also be found for Chinese. To answer this question, an explicit auditory morphological judgment task was used in an fMRI experiment to investigate the neural basis of morphological processing in Chinese compound words. Results demonstrated that the L-IFG to be a core area, consistent with research in alphabetic languages. More importantly, a broad network consisting of the L-MTG, the bilateral STG and the L-FG that taps <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> and semantic information was found to be involved in Chinese morphological processing.

A processing approach to memory systems suggests that the organisation of memory storage is related to type of memory processing as well.

Studies of single word learning suggest that new words {{are more likely to}} be learnt when both their oral and written forms are provided, compared to when only one form is given. This study explores children’s learning of <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic</b> and semantic information about words encountered in a story context. Seventy-one children (8 - 9 years) were exposed to a story containing novel words in one of three conditions: 1) listening, 2) reading, or 3) simultaneous listening and reading (‘combined condition’). Half of the novel words were presented with a definition and half without. <b>Phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> learning were assessed through recognition tasks. Semantic learning was measured using three tasks assessing recognition of the word’s category, sub-category and definition. Phonological learning was observed in all conditions, showing that phonological recoding supported the acquisition of phonological forms when children were not exposed to phonology (the reading condition). In contrast, children showed orthographic learning of the novel words only when they were exposed to orthographic forms, indicating that exposure to phonological forms alone did not prompt the establishment of orthographic representations. Semantic learning was greater in the combined condition than in the listening and reading conditions. The presence of the definition was associated with better performance on the semantic sub-category and definition post-tests but not the <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic</b> or category post-tests. Findings are discussed in relation to the lexical quality hypothesis and the availability of attentional resources...|$|R

The goals of the present paper are two-fold: (1) to introduce CLEARPOND (Cross-Linguistic Easy-Access Resource for <b>Phonological</b> and <b>Orthographic</b> Neighborhood Densities), a centralized database of <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> neighborhood information, both within and between languages, for five commonly-studied languages: Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish; and (2) to show how CLEARPOND {{can be used to}} compare general properties of <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> neighborhoods across languages. CLEARPOND allows researchers to input a word or list of words and obtain <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> neighbors, neighborhood densities, mean neighborhood frequencies, word lengths by number of phonemes and graphemes, and spoken-word frequencies. Neighbors can be defined by substitution, deletion, and/or addition, and the database can be queried separately along each metric or summed across all three.

40|$|Learning {{to spell}} {{requires}} integration of <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> and morphological knowledge. Historically, spelling {{development has been}} characterized by linear stages in which children learn to use these knowledge bases in succession. A more recent view challenges the linearity of this approach and proposes that spelling development from the beginning {{is characterized by the}} simultaneous interaction of all three linguistic factors. Minimal research exists that qualitatively investigates the integration of these three factors, especially as noted in derivational morphology. The study 2 ̆ 7 s purpose was to investigate spelling accuracy and qualitatively analyze the morphological error patterns of typically developing children, ages 8 - 15 years, for a future comparison to children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Twenty-nine typically-developing children were age- and gender-matched to children with ASD from a companion study (Wiggins, 2009) to conduct quantitative comparisons. After inclusion measures were administered, the children completed a spelling test that analyzed various morphological aspects of spelling, including homonyms, inflections, and derivations. Results of the quantitative analyses revealed that children in the ASD group made significantly more errors than children in the typically developing group on the spelling test. Nevertheless, performances across the morphological categories tested were similar across groups and followed the pattern described in previous research (Carlisle, 1988, 2000). Qualitative analysis used a unique coding system, the <b>Phonological,</b> <b>Orthographic,</b> and Morphological Analysis of Spelling (POMAS; Silliman, Bahr, 2 ̆ 6 Peters, 2006), which allowed for analysis by linguistic category (e. g., <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> morphological) and specific error features (e. g., letter-sound correspondences, consonant errors, vowel digraphs, etc.). Overall, the typically developing children produced the most errors in orthography, followed by phonology, with the fewest errors being attributed to morphology. Four major linguistic feature error patterns emerged involving vowel errors, letter doubling confusion, misspelled derivational suffixes, and sonorant cluster reduction. Spelling performance on the experimental spelling measure was correlated with age, but was not correlated with parents 2 ̆ 7 educational level or language-related subtests. Younger children made more errors than older children in all morphological categories.

40|$|Spelling {{development}} is a linguistic process which involves the interaction of <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> and morphological knowledge (Bahr, Silliman, 2 ̆ 6 Berninger, in press). It is also clear these linguistic factors are influenced by a person 2 ̆ 7 s dialect. Previous {{research has indicated that}} use of African American English (AAE) does influence spelling performance (Kohler, Bahr, Silliman, Bryant, Apel, 2 ̆ 6 Wilkinson, 2007); however, few studies have considered how dialect use influences spelling as a function of spelling task (i. e., real vs. non-word tasks), error category (<b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> or morphological) or grade. A secondary goal was to note if dialectal or developmental errors predominated in the noted misspellings. The <b>Phonological,</b> <b>Orthographic,</b> and Morphological Assessment of Spelling (POMAS, Silliman, Bahr, 2 ̆ 6 Peters, 2006) was used to provide a fine-grained analysis of the spelling errors of 80 typically developing African American children in grades 1 (n = 39) and 3 (n = 41). These children were screened for language ability and they were determined to be AAE speakers by observing their use of phonological and/or morphosyntactic dialect features when retelling a story. Age-appropriate real word and non-word spelling tasks were developed which incorporated common features of AAE. A three-way ANOVA revealed that differences in error frequency were dependent upon word type, error type and grade. On the real word spelling task, children in both grades made more <b>orthographic</b> errors than <b>phonological</b> or morphological errors. On the non-word spelling task, students in both grades made fewer orthographic errors and students in grade 3 made significantly more phonological errors, while the number of phonological errors noted remained fairly constant across tasks for the children in grade 1. Common misspelling patterns revealed developmental errors, as well as errors attributed to AAE. A closer look at the occurrence of AAE features revealed that first graders were more likely to reflect dialectal patterns in their spelling than the third graders. This is possibly due to differences in exposure to the academic register and experience in code-switching. Finally, the real words elicited more AAE features than non-words suggesting that phonetic and linguistic contexts might influence the occurrence and use of AAE...|$|R

In all the tasks, signs of reliance on phonological processing were found even when indicators of reliance on orthographic processing appeared. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine which early skills predict later reading achievement. Pseudoword and irregular word scores were used as measures for <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> skills, respectively. Only middle of Grade 1 phonological reading skills accounted for independent variance in end of Grade 4 orthographic skills.

Study 1 investigated the contribution of Spanish <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> processing skills to English reading and spelling in 89 Spanish-English bilingual children in grades 2 (n = 42) and 3 (n = 47). Comparable measures in English and Spanish tapping <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> processing were administered to the bilingual children and to 53 monolingual English-speaking children in grades 2 (n = 32) and 3 (n = 21) as a comparison group. We found that cross language <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> transfer occurs from Spanish to English for real word and pseudoword reading. However, Spanish orthographic processing only predicted reading, not spelling. Study 2 examined spelling errors committed on specific linguistic units - vowels that are spelled differently in the two languages (i. e., contrastive vowels) - to determine whether Spanish-speaking children spell these vowels using Spanish spelling rules. Participants for Study 2 were carefully recruited; these Spanish-speaking students had received about 2. 2 years of literacy instruction in their native language, ensuring {{that they would have}} adequate orthographic knowledge to read and spell in Spanish. Error analyses indicated that the 27 native Spanish-speaking children who received prior literacy instruction in Spanish did indeed spell these contrastive vowels using Spanish orthography; therefore, these errors were influenced by their L 1 orthographic knowledge. Taken together, these two studies highlight the importance of taking into consideration bilingual children's L 1 <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> knowledge in understanding L 2 reading and spelling acquisition. The results of the two studies enhance the theoretical frameworks by providing empirical evidence to support the notion that bilingual children are indeed both positively and negatively affected by the differences in orthographic depths of the languages...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of phonological treatment approaches for anomia in individuals with aphasia. The role of phonology in language processing, as well as the impact of phonological impairment on communication is initially discussed. Then, traditional phonologically-based treatment approaches, including <b>phonological,</b> <b>orthographic,</b> indirect, guided, and mixed cueing methods are described. Collectively, these cueing treatment approaches aim to facilitate word retrieval by stimulating residual phonological abilities. An alternative treatment approach, phonomotor treatment, is also examined. Phonomotor treatment aims to rebuild sub-lexical, phonological sequence knowledge and phonological awareness as a means to strengthen lexical processing and whole-word naming. This treatment is supported by a parallel-distributed processing model of phonology and therefore promotes multi-modal training of individual phonemes and phoneme sequences in an effort to enhance the neural connectivity supporting underlying phonological processing mechanisms. The paper concludes with suggestions for clinical application and implementation. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs[URL] Pathology and Audiolog...|$|R

All participants had word-retrieval deficits in conversation and picture naming. Both effects of a single application and of multiple applications of cues and pictures (short-training phase: three sessions) were assessed. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the relationship between the effects of <b>phonological</b> and <b>orthographic</b> cues and the underlying functional impairments in the patients and to interpret the underlying mechanisms of effectiveness of the different types of prompts in a neurolinguistic word-processing model (Patterson & Shewell, 1987). Research plan and methodology Prior to the start of the treatment study, the language processing abilities of each participant were assessed in detail (using, for example selected assessments from PALPA, Kay et al., 1992) so that specific cue-effects could be interpreted with regard to underlying functional deficit(s) (cf. Best et al., 2002). Pre-assessment of spoken picture namin...|$|R
