5|$|In the 17thcentury Civil Wars, townspeople of Poulton {{fought on}} both sides, {{although}} more {{men from the}} Fylde were {{on the side of}} the Royalists. No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> resulted from the wars. In 1643 interest was stirred in the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall. The ship made no movement for several days but fired its guns occasionally. Locals initially feared an invasion, but eventually realised that the crew was in distress and had been signalling for help. The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble. The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble. He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free.|$|E
5|$|Though Henry Beecher's Lawrenceburg church {{declared}} {{its independence from}} the Synod to retain him as its pastor, the <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> followed the Panic of 1837 caused him {{to look for a}} new position. Banker Samuel Merrill invited Beecher to visit Indianapolis in 1839, and he was offered the ministry of the Second Presbyterian Church there on May 13, 1839. Unusually for a speaker of his era, Beecher would use humor and informal language including dialect and slang as he preached. His preaching was a major success, building Second Presbyterian into the largest church in the city, and he also led a successful revival meeting in nearby Terre Haute. However, mounting debt led to Beecher again seeking a new position in 1847, and he accepted the invitation of businessman Henry Bowen to head a new Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. Beecher's national fame continued to grow, and he took to the lecture circuit, becoming {{one of the most popular}} speakers in the country and charging correspondingly high fees.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{time in the}} Isles is {{confirmed}} by several Icelandic sources which recount how, in 1202, Guðmundr Arason attempted to sail from Iceland to Norway to become consecrated as the Bishop of Hólar. These saga accounts relate how the Icelanders encountered a severe storm and were blown far off course before being forced to make landfall in the Hebrides. The island they landed upon was almost certainly Sanday, a tiny tidal island linked to its larger neighbour Canna, the westernmost of the Small Isles. According to the saga the Icelanders were pressured numerous times to pay a landing-tax to a king named Óláfr. The king encountered by the Icelanders is considered to have been Óláfr, although {{at this point in}} history the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles is not known to have encompassed the Small Isles. One possibility is that Óláfr, like the Icelanders, may have been temporarily stranded on the tidal island, and that he may have taken advantage of the storm-stricken churchmen to offset the <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> is assigned to him by the chronicle.|$|E

The Trujillo regime responded with greater repression. The Military Intelligence Service (SIM) secret police, led by Johnny Abbes, remained as ubiquitous as before.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} two {{commonly held}} {{views on the}} relationship existing between old age and poverty in developing countries: <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> is less pronounced among the old; and <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> reduction programmes focused on the old have lower social payoffs than programmes aimed at the young. The paper argues that standard measures underestimate old age <b>poverty,</b> and <b>that</b> the evaluation of poverty programmes needs {{to take account of}} the economic contribution of the old and of positive externalities in old age support. It concludes that the low priority given to old age support in developing countries needs to be reconsidered. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

25|$|The South African {{government}} has introduced the Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP) {{to overcome the}} extremely high unemployment and accompanying poverty in that country. The programs run against the full employability tide because they recognise that the solution to joblessness and the <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> this brings is {{in the provision of}} employment opportunities rather than a focus on the victims. They also recognise that the state (whether at the level of national or local government) has a major role to play in providing for employment guarantees.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 2010s {{the reports of}} theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.

Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.|$|E
25|$|Myles Keogh {{was born}} in Orchard House, Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland on 25 March 1840. The farming carried out at Keogh's home place in Leighlinbridge was arable, barley being the main crop. This meant that the Keogh family were largely {{unaffected}} by the hunger and <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> accompanied the Irish Potato Famine and ravaged the country between 1845 and 1850 – Keogh's childhood days. However, two, or possibly three, of Keogh's siblings did die young, apparently from typhoid – a disease associated with the famine and an illness that Myles also suffered as a boy.|$|E
25|$|By 1970, the 130,000-resident {{population}} of Brownsville was 77% black and 19% Puerto Rican. Despite {{the activities of}} black civil rights {{organizations such as the}} NAACP and Urban League whose Brooklyn chapters were based in nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant, they were, overall, less concerned with the issues of the lower-income blacks who had moved into Brownsville, thus further isolating Brownsville's population. These changes corresponded to overall increases in segregation and inequality in New York City, {{as well as to the}} replacement of blue-collar with white-collar jobs. The area gained a reputation for violence and <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> was similar to the South Bronx's, a reputation that persisted through the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Census Bureau {{introduced}} a new supplemental poverty measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States. The SPM extends the official poverty measure by taking account {{of many of the}} government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals that are not included in the current official poverty measure. According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%.

25|$|The {{situation}} was dramatically altered, however, when Trujillo {{was assassinated in}} May 1961. Trujillo's son, Ramfis, initially inherited power with Balaguer as his puppet. They initially took steps to liberalize the regime, granting some civil liberties and easing Trujillo's tight censorship of the press. Meanwhile, he revoked the nonaggression pact made with Cuba in January 1961. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a populace who had no memory of the instability and <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> preceded Trujillo, and wanted more freedom and a more equitable distribution of wealth. At the same time, Ramfis' reforms went too far for the hard-line trujillistas led by his own uncles, Héctor and José Arismendi Trujillo. As the OAS continued economic sanctions imposed for Trujillo's attempted murder of Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt, Ramfis warned that the country could descend into civil war between left and right.|$|E
