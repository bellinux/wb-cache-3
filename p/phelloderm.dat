The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes <b>phelloderm</b> cells internally.

5000|$|Procambium: {{lies just}} {{inside of the}} protoderm and {{develops}} into primary xylem and primary phloem. It also produces the vascular cambium, and cork cambium, secondary meristems. The cork cambium further differentiates into the <b>phelloderm</b> (to the inside) and the phellem, or cork (to the outside). All three of these layers (cork cambium, phellem and <b>phelloderm)</b> constitute the periderm.

50|$|What is {{commonly}} called bark includes {{a number of}} different tissues. Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the phellem. The cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The cork cambium, which is also called the phellogen, is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The <b>phelloderm,</b> which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium. Together, the phellem (cork), phellogen (cork cambium) and <b>phelloderm</b> constitute the periderm.|$|E
5000|$|Synonyms for {{cork cambium}} are bark cambium, pericambium and phellogen. Phellogen {{is defined as}} the meristematic cell layer {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} periderm.

50|$|Often a {{secondary}} covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which {{is composed of}} cork (phellem), the cork cambium (phellogen), and the <b>phelloderm.</b> The periderm forms from the phellogen {{which serves as a}} lateral meristem. The periderm replaces the epidermis, and acts as a protective covering like the epidermis. Mature phellem cells have suberin in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, {{as is the case with}} woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm.|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} 60 samples of mature bark {{representing}} 12 southern African species of Eugenia s. str. was studied. Bark surface patterns are correlated with internal {{structure and the}} taxonomic significance of the bark features is explored. Two bark categories are distinguished. Bark type X [E. capensis (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Sond., E. natalitia Sond., E. simii Duemmer and E. umtamvunensis Van Wyk] is characterized principally by a smooth or weakly dippled-scaly surface, abundant dilatation tissue (pseudocortex) in the inner bark, phellem with one type of phelloid cell and a well-defined <b>phelloderm.</b> Bark anatomy {{was found to be}} useful to separate species. Bark type Y [E. erythrophylla Strey, E. verdoorniae Van Wyk, E. woodii Duemmer, E. zeyheri (Harv.)

Samples were {{collected}} from local areas in Canterbury, Buller and Northland, and examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In Libocedrus species, the sclerenchyma consists of thin and thick-walled fibres. In all other species, the sclerenchyma comprises fibres and sclereids. However, sclerenchyma is quite rare or sometimes absent in Dacrydium laxifolium. Crystals occur in the lumina {{and also in the}} wall (in the region of the middle lamella) of some phloem cells. Resin canals are present in the phloem, primary cortex and <b>phelloderm</b> of Agathis australis and in the primary cortex of all the three species of Phyllocladus. L and T-shaped parenchyma cells were found to be common in the phloem of Dacrydium cupressinum. These cells lie partly in the ray system and partly in the axial system, and are filled with tannin. Trabeculae were very common in the phloem in Libocedrus bidwillii. Phellem cells in Libocedrus species are very thin-walled and appear flimsy. In Agathis australis, the phellem cells are mostly thin-walled, with the outer 1 - 3 layers being thick-walled. Those in Dacrydium cupressinum, Phyllocladus glaucus and Phy. trichomanoides are all thin-walled. Phellem of the other six Dacrydium species consists of thin-walled cells and also cells with an inner tangential wall that is thicker than the outer tangential wall. In three species, this inner tangential wall is sclerified and in the other three species, it is non-polylamellate but possesses cone-shaped structures, protruding into the lumina. This latter feature is also shared by phellem cells in Phyllocladus alpinus.

40|$|The {{leaf and}} stem {{anthracnose}} of Paulownia tomentosa, due to Gl. Kawakamii MIYABE, prevails {{almost all of}} the poulownia planting regions in Japan. The symptom of the disease has been described. The infection hyphae of the fungus produced from appressoria pass through the cuticlar layers of the host plants, and within 24 hours they may occupy their possession in the host epidermal cells. After three days, the fungal mycelia may spread extensively through the host tissues, causing necrosis of the attacked cells. If the attacked parts of the host plants be young and feeble, they will be severely damaged owing to the violent invasion of the causal fungus and to the delayed formation of the wound <b>phelloderm</b> within the host tissues. On the contrary, in the grown-up plants, the <b>phelloderm</b> has been already formed before the intrusion of the fungus or will soon be produced around the diseased portion, therefore, these plants may be resistant to the invasion of the fungus or they may easily escape from the disease by the formation of the cork layers. Paulownia coreana UYEKI are found to be resistant to the fungus. When the spores of the fungus may be sown on the younger parts of the plants, they will produce the infection hyphae and enter into the host cells {{as in the case of}} P. tomentosa. But the intruded hyphae are not only slow to attack the host cells, but also become undergrown gradually. This phenomenon seems to be due to the strength of the host tissue and to some offensive functioh against the fungus of the affected parts of the host tissue. 桐の炭疽病は, Gl.

In Q. suber the successive formation of phellem following removal at periodic intervals (every 9 years) allows for exploitation of cork oak on a sustainable basis. The main component of cork (45 - 50 %) is suberin, a complex polymer comprising both aliphatic and aromatic domains and associated waxes [1, 2]. Despite the physiological importance of suberin, its biosynthetic pathway as well as its deposition remains largely unknown. Since cork oak is a unique species among terrestrial plants due to its remarkable capacity for cork production, it is expected that suberin biosynthesis and deposition are tightly controlled mechanisms. As a first step to start unraveling these control mechanisms we intend to identify and characterize genes coding for the acyltransferases of the GPAT (glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase) family, involved in suberin and cutin synthesis in cork oak. Two ESTs highly similar to GPAT 5 (EE 743864 and EE 743865) and one EST (EE 743668) highly similar to GPAT 4 shown to be strongly up-regulated in the suberin-rich phellem of cork oak tree (Q. suber) were first identified by Soler et al.

40|$|Cork oak (Quercus suber) is a long-living {{species of}} the Fagaceae family that highly {{contributes}} for the economy of several countries such as Portugal. It is the only plant species with a phellogen capable of a sustainable production of cork with properties suited for industry applications. Phellogen, or cork cambium, usually initiates in the subepidermis and differentiates {{during the first year}} of growth [1]. Its meristematic activity gives rise to phellem (cork) cells to the outside and to <b>phelloderm</b> to the inside. It is likely that genes involved in the regulation of other plant meristems such as shoot apical meristem and vascular cambium are also involved in the regulation of phellogen. Based on its role in other meristems, and on specific expression patterns in poplar stems, we hypothesize that SHORT-ROOT (SHR), a transcription factor from the GRAS family, may be involved in the regulation of phellogen. This gene has been well described in the Arabidopsis root where it plays a key role in the radial patterning and in regulating the specification of the root stem cell niche [2 - 4]. Recently, its involvement in the root vascular system to control patterning processes [5] and in the control of proliferative cell division in developing leaves [6]has also been reported. In this work we report the cloning of SHR from cork oak transcriptome and the characterization of SHR expression patterns in the stem with the aim of investigating its putative function in the phellogen. Materials and methods Through a search in public databases we have retrieved putative orthologs of ArabidopsisSHR gene from specie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Conifers {{have very}} large genomes (13 to 30 Gigabases) that are mostly uncharacterized {{although}} extensive cDNA resources have recently become available. This report presents a global overview of transcriptome variation in a conifer tree and documents conservation {{and diversity of}} gene expression patterns among major vegetative tissues. Results An oligonucleotide microarray was developed from Picea glauca and P. sitchensis cDNA datasets. It represents 23, 853 unique genes and was shown to be suitable for transcriptome profiling in several species. A comparison of secondary xylem and <b>phelloderm</b> tissues showed that preferential expression in these vascular tissues was highly conserved among Picea spp. RNA-Sequencing strongly confirmed tissue preferential expression and provided a robust validation of the microarray design. A small database of transcription profiles called PiceaGenExpress was developed from over 150 hybridizations spanning eight major tissue types. In total, transcripts were detected for 92 % of the genes on the microarray, {{in at least one}} tissue. Non-annotated genes were predominantly expressed at low levels in fewer tissues than genes of known or predicted function. Diversity of expression within gene families may be rapidly assessed from PiceaGenExpress. In conifer trees, dehydrins and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) osmotic regulation proteins occur in large gene families compared to angiosperms. Strong contrasts and low diversity was observed in the dehydrin family, while diverse patterns suggested a greater degree of diversification among LEAs. Conclusion Together, the oligonucleotide microarray and the PiceaGenExpress database represent the first resource of this kind for gymnosperm plants. The spruce transcriptome analysis reported here is expected to accelerate genetic studies in the large and important group comprised of conifer trees. </p...|$|E
40|$|Anatomical {{investigation}} {{has been made}} on the stem of lignosus bean (Dipogon lignosus (L.) Verde.) {{at different stages of}} growth. The epidermis is single layered consisting of small and large cells. The epidermis bears multicellular hair and glandular trichomes. Beneath the epidermis there are 5 - 6 layers of cortical cells in the stem. The primary vascular tissue appears after the elongation of the first internode of the stem of lignosus bean. The internode between cotyledonary node and first leaf is considered as the first internode of the stem. The vascular bundles are collateral and arranged in a ring. The secretory cells devoid of tanniniferous contents have been observed in the phloem region of the younger stem but not in older ones. The cambium initiates in the primary vascular bundle between xylem and phloem at the basal part of the stem of 7 days old plant. The cambium is at first confined to the fascicular region. Subsequently it extends into the interfascicular region forming a complete cambial ring. After the formation of fascicular cambium it gives rise to secondary xylem adaxially and secondary phloem abaxially. Some vessel members are paired while the others are solitary. Most of the paired vessels are radially arranged. The paired vessel members are more in number in the mature stem compared to that of the younger stem. The parenchyma covers the major area of the secondary xylem. The sclerenchymatous band abaxial to all large and small vascular bundles is discontinuous. The pith resembles a typical dicotyledonous stem. The phellogen appears in the deeper cortex and gives rise to 4 - 5 layers of cork cells abaxially and 3 - 4 layers of <b>phelloderm</b> adaxiall...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the structure and topography of endogenous secretory tissues of Inula helenium L. By using light and electron microscopy, morphological and anatomical observations of stems, leaves and rhizomes were made. It was shown that in the stems secretory cavities were situated in the vicinity of phloem and xylem bundles. The number of the reservoirs reached its maximum value (34) at shoot flowerig termination, whereas the cavities with the largest diameter were observed at full flowering stage (44. 6 µm). In the leaf petioles and midribs, the reservoirs also accompanied the vascular bundles, and their number and size increased along with the growth of the assimilation organs. Observations of the cross sections of the rhizomes revealed the presence of several rings of secretory reservoirs. The measurements of the cavities showed that as a rule the reservoirs with a larger dimension were located in the <b>phelloderm,</b> whereas the smallest ones in the xylem area. The secretory cavities located in the stems and leaves developed by schizogenesis, whereas the rhizome reservoirs were probably formed schizolisygenously. The cells lining the reservoirs formed a one - four-layered epithelium. Observed in TEM, the secretory cells of the mature cavities located in the rhizomes were characterised by the presence of a large central vacuole, whereas the protoplast was largely degraded. Fibrous elements of osmophilic secretion and numerous different coloured vesicles could be distinguished in it. The cell walls formed, from the side of the reservoir lumen, ingrowths into the interior of the epithelial cells. Between the cell wall and the plasmalemma of the glandular cells, a brighter periplasmatic zone with secretory vesicles was observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the pharmacognostic characters of Limonia acidissima L. (L. acidissima) leaf and stem, an important traditional medicinal plant. MethodsThe present study provides pharmacognostic, physicochemical and phytochemical details of leaf and stem of L. acidissima. Micro and macroscopic characters were analyzed. WHO recommended parameters were {{followed in the}} entire study. ResultsThe macroscopic study showed that the leaf was alternate, imparipinnately compound leaf with entire margin, long petiole, apex obtuse and base decurrent, with surface appearance and txture glabrous. The inflorescence was lateral and terminal panicles. The microscopic study of leaf revealed the presence of actinocytic stomata, multicellular trichome, prismatic calcium oxalate crystals, vascular bundles, etc. The powder microscopy also revealed prism like calcium oxalate crystals, multicellular trichome and actinocytic stomata. Physiochemical analysis of dried leaf powder showed total ash, water soluble ash and acid insoluble ash as 9. 33 %, 1. 83 % and 1. 16 % w/w respectively. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of maximum amount of flavonoids and tannins. The main microscopic characteristic of stem was 2 - 3 layers of phellem, phellogen 2 - 3 layered followed by 7 - 8 layered <b>phelloderm.</b> Among other microscopic components were presence of xylem parenchyma, xylem vessels, xylem fibres and tracheids. The powder microscopy also revealed presence of annular, spiral vessel, prism crystals and multicellular trichome. Physiochemical analysis of dried stem powder showed total ash, water soluble ash and acid insoluble ash as 3. 16 %, 0. 66 % and 0. 66 % w/w respectively. Preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of maximum amount of only flavonoids. ConclusionsVarious pharmacognostical characters observed in this study will help in botanical identification and standardization of leaf and stem of L. acidissima and will also help in quality control and formulation development...|$|E
40|$|Anatomical {{investigation}} {{has been made}} on the stem of country bean (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) {{at different stages of}} growth following the standard paraffin method of microtechnique. The epidermis is single layered with multicellular hairs and glandular trichomes. Beneath the epidermis there are 5 - 10 layers of cortical cells. The primary vascular tissue appears after the elongation of the first internode of the stem. The vascular bundles are collateral and arranged in a ring. There are two types of vascular bundles, large and small. There are one or more small vascular bundles in between two large bundles. The large vascular bundle contains xylem and phloem but small bundle may or may not contain both xylem and phloem. There are several poles of primary phloem outside the primary xylem. The pericycle is discontinuous. Two adjacent groups of sclerenchyma are connected by one or two layers of sclerenchymatous cells. The cambium initiates in the primary vascular bundle between xylem and phloem at the basal part of the stem of 4 days old plant. Gradually it extends towards the upper part. The cambium is at first confined to the fascicular region. Subsequently it extends into the interfascicular region forming a complete cambial ring. After the formation of the fascicular cambium it gives rise to the secondary xylem adaxially and secondary phloem abaxially. In the mature stem, most of the vessels are multiple, some are paired while the others are solitary. Most of the fibre cells in the phloem region are found in groups.

30|$|Oven-dried (70 [*]°C) stem wood, stem bark, branch, cone and needle {{samples for}} carbon {{analysis}} {{were obtained from}} existing and new radiata pine and Douglas-fir biomass studies in New Zealand. Dead needles intercepted by branches in the lower crown were collected separately from live needles. Biomass studies in radiata pine stands were undertaken in 5 - and 15 -year-old stands at Kinleith, 5 -, 16 - and 26 -year-old stands at Tarawera, 5 - and 28 -year-old stands at Woodhill and a 5 -year-old stand at Nelson. Carbon data from the 15 - and 16 -year-old stands at Kinleith and Tarawera, respectively, were published by Oliver et al. (2011). Biomass samples were also acquired at eight Genotype × Environment (G × E) trial sites established in the North and South Island of New Zealand, each planted with 40 clonally propagated genotypes. At these sites, stem wood, stem bark, and needle biomass samples were obtained from 96 trees (one tree {{from each of the}} 12 genotypes per site) in 2017 in 12 - to 15 -year-old stands. In addition, branch and root samples (10 to ≤[*] 50 mm diameter over bark) were acquired from recently harvested stands at nine sites located within New Zealand commercial plantations as part of woody debris decay studies (Garrett et al. 2008, 2010, 2012). Finally, outer bark (cork) from disc samples taken at fixed intervals along the entire stem length of 19 trees (stands aged 22 / 23 [*]years old) at Puruki Forest was separated from inner bark (phloem and <b>phelloderm)</b> using a chisel, which was only feasible from discs in {{the lower part of the}} stem. This corky bark was bulked into a single sample per tree and labelled “outer bark”. The inner bark and bark from upper discs that could not be separated from the inner bark was bulked by tree and labelled “inner bark”. One 10 -year-old Douglas-fir stand was sampled at Gowan Hill, Southland, which provided needle, branch and stem wood and bark samples for comparison purposes. The oven-dried (70 [*]°C) samples were processed as follows.|$|E
