5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the success of}} {{infantry}} tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, {{the role of the}} war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} <b>probably</b> declining <b>because</b> <b>of</b> habitat loss but is fairly {{adaptable}} and is probably still common.|$|R
50|$|By default, WASTE {{listens to}} {{incoming}} connections on port 1337. This was <b>probably</b> chosen <b>because</b> <b>of</b> 1337's leet connotations.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{species have}} become extinct {{since the last}} ice age, <b>probably</b> largely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> human interaction. Of the survivors: ...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Bernard appears dead, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a {{heart attack}} but Monk cannot {{guarantee}} it. He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom. However, the flight attendant, Leigh Harrison (Brooke Adams), is alerted to Monk's use of a lighter on board, and confiscates both the lighter and the glass, dumping the liquid down the sink.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies S. a. mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory owl is absent from Ireland (<b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{competition from the}} long-eared owl), and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing {{is visible}} through modern {{technical}} analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends {{far to the left}} of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.|$|E
50|$|A well in {{the area}} {{was known as the}} sword well by the late 18th century, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> {{artefacts}} <b>of</b> the battle were discovered near to there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind Neil," [...] said Eric lightly. [...] "He is <b>probably</b> sulky <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{some things}} I {{said to him}} when I found he had spied on us." ...|$|R
50|$|Hagelschloss is <b>probably</b> named <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its {{position}} dominating the Hagelthal valley. In the 19th century, {{it was known}} as Waldberg and is mentioned as such in certain historic documents.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. <b>Probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the threat of}} a pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued to own the castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor of the town of Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Walmer Castle {{became the}} {{official}} {{residence of the}} Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden was originally a medieval title linked to five key ports {{along the coast of}} England; the position's prominence had faded, but it still retained important judicial and military functions. When Lionel Sackville, the Duke of Dorset, was appointed to the post in 1708 he decided that the existing residence in Dover Castle was unsatisfactory, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the semi-ruinous state of the castle, and moved into Walmer Castle instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Calshot was held by Parliamentary forces against King Charles I, and protected with a 15-strong garrison at an annual cost of £107. Parliament considered the fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition; unlike several other local forts, Parliament kept the castle operational, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its ongoing role in defending Southampton Water. During the early 18th-century War of Spanish Succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns.|$|E
50|$|Ch. braunii {{has been}} placed on a “red” list of {{endangered}} algae in Poland in the category “indeterminate”, but <b>probably</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>of</b> poor investigation of the species in Poland.|$|R
30|$|Now, we {{announce}} {{our first}} result (<b>probably</b> new <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{using the new}} lemma, Lemma  2.1 with the comparison function). It generalizes several known results in the literature [9 – 12].|$|R
5000|$|... (appears in Men at Arms; <b>probably</b> since disbanded <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{death of}} leader) ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when the first}} fortification at Longtown was built. The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman, or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains uncertain. If Roman defences were constructed at the site, it was <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a Roman road that may have run nearby, and the defences may well have then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose earthworks have square, angular corners, similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, {{it was broken}} in two parts {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E
50|$|Prithviraja <b>probably</b> died heirless, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{which he}} was succeeded by his uncle Someshvara.|$|R
50|$|A Volcanic {{eruption}} {{took place}} in 1222 at a volcanic field in Northern Syria near Killis (also Kilis), Turkey. The volcano <b>probably</b> formed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a regional Graben. The Volcano is Andesitic-Basaltic in composition.|$|R
5000|$|Wells' {{subsequent}} {{career was}} undermined {{both by the}} increasingly unaffordable ethos of the Arts and Crafts movement after 1918, but <b>probably</b> also <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his perceived role in {{the failure of the}} Nobles' marriage.|$|R
5|$|Survivals {{from late}} Medieval church {{fittings}} and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. It {{is often difficult to}} decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E
5|$|The {{animal was}} once {{widespread}} from Assam and Bengal (where their range would have overlapped {{with both the}} Sumatran and Indian rhinos) eastward to Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southwards to the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra, Java, and possibly Borneo. The Javan rhino primarily inhabits dense, lowland rain forests, grasslands, and reed beds with abundant rivers, large floodplains, or wet areas with many mud wallows. Although it historically preferred low-lying areas, the subspecies in Vietnam was pushed onto much higher ground (up to 2,000m or 6,561ft), <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> human encroachment and poaching.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Jojalladeva <b>probably</b> died heirless, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{which he}} was succeeded by his younger brother Asharaja.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a locally}} common species, but the {{population}} is <b>probably</b> declining <b>because</b> <b>of</b> habitat loss and degradation caused by open cast mining, conversion of land for agriculture, and logging. It occurs in several protected areas.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Jack, while {{never as}} popular as Little Jimmy, <b>probably</b> also <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its erratic appearances, still had a {{considerable}} influence. One clear derivative was Mr. George by Harold Knerr, the second author of the Katzenjammer Kids.|$|R
5|$|Cimon {{then moved}} to pre-emptively attack the Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing {{into the mouth of}} the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet {{gathered}} there. Most of the Persian fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E
5|$|Dalyngrigge's licence from Richard II {{permitted}} him to refortify his existing manor house, {{but instead}} he chose a fresh site to build a castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, {{and most of the}} castle is in the same architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for {{the first years of the}} castle's construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} success, or <b>probably</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, fear spread of Caesar, now the primary {{figure of the}} Roman state, becoming an autocratic ruler and ending the Roman Republic. This fear drove a group of senators naming themselves The Liberators to assassinate him in 44 BC. Further civil war followed between those loyal to Caesar and those who supported {{the actions of the}} Liberators. Caesar's supporter Mark Antony condemned Caesar's assassins and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Octavian was entrusted with the command of the war against him. In the Battle of Forum Gallorum Antony, besieging Caesar's assassin Decimus Brutus in Mutina, defeated the forces of the consul Pansa, who was killed, but Antony was then immediately defeated by the army of the other consul, Hirtius. At the Battle of Mutina Antony was again defeated in battle by Hirtius, who was killed. Although Antony failed to capture Mutina, Decimus Brutus was murdered shortly thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Curry Seku - a {{very dry}} curry {{prepared}} in a wok. Seku means [...] "bottom" [...] in Papia Kristang, and the wok was <b>probably</b> so-named <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the roundness of its shape that resembled the human bottom.|$|R
50|$|By {{definition}} of an idiopathic epilepsy, all tests other than the EEG are normal. However, high resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging is <b>probably</b> mandatory <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the high incidence of}} symptomatic occipital epilepsies with the same clinico-EEG manifestations.|$|R
50|$|The goods yard {{has several}} tracks and a building, {{and is still}} partly used. In future, goods {{movements}} at the station will <b>probably</b> increase, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a recent decision to dispose of old wooden sleepers by transporting them north to Sweden.|$|R
