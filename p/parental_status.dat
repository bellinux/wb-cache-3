40|$|Background: A {{link between}} low <b>parental</b> {{socioeconomic}} <b>status</b> {{and mental health}} problems in offspring is well established in previous research. The mechanisms that explain this link are largely unknown. The present study investigated whether school performance was a mediating and/or moderating factor in the path between <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> {{and the risk of}} hospital admission for non-fatal suicidal behaviour. Methods: A national cohort of 447 929 children born during 1973 - 1977 was followed prospectively in the National Patient Discharge Register from the end of their ninth and final year of compulsory school until 2001. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and linear regression analyses were performed to test whether the association between <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and non-fatal suicidal behaviour was mediated or moderated by school performance. Results: The results of a series of multiple regression analyses, adjusted for demographic variables, revealed that school performance was as an important mediator in the relationship between <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and risk of non-fatal suicidal behaviour, accounting for 60 % of the variance. The hypothesized moderation of <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> [...] non-fatal suicidal behaviour relationship by school performance was not supported. Conclusions: School performance is an important mediator through which <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> translates into a risk for non-fatal suicidal behaviour. Prevention efforts aimed to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in non-fatal suicidal behaviour among young people will need to consider socioeconomic inequalities in school performance...|$|R

2500|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Catalyst, a nonprofit {{that works to}} expand {{opportunities}} for women in business, {{of male and female}} MBA graduates found that after controlling for career aspirations, <b>parental</b> <b>status,</b> years of experience, industry, and other variables, male graduates {{are more likely to be}} assigned jobs of higher rank and responsibility and earn, on average, $4,600 more than women in their first post-MBA jobs.This affects women’s ability to pay off student loan debt since college isn’t cheaper for a woman even though she can expect to make less after she earns a degree than her male peers. This results in women being in disproportionately more debt than men. This extra debt makes having less income even more debilitating as women have a harder time paying off student loan debt.|$|E
30|$|The {{preceding}} analyses {{suggest that}} parents {{make decisions about}} children’s school entry based on children’s birth month relative to the cutoff date. However, breaking the age rule specified by the law may incur costly consequences, such as paying extra fees, changing the birthdate record, or using personal ties. We expect that families from better backgrounds have more resources with which to manipulate the timing of their child’s school entry. We test this hypothesis by adding interaction terms of <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and being born after the cutoff date to Model 1.2. The measures of <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> used for constructing the interaction terms are mother’s years of schooling (Model 1.3) and father’s occupation (Model 1.4). As Models 1.3 and 1.4 in Table 1 show, if a September–December-born child had a mother with more years of schooling or a father with a nonagricultural occupation, {{he or she was}} less likely to follow the cutoff date and more likely to start school earlier. We also construct interactive models based on Model 2.2 to test the interactive effect of <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and being born just before the cutoff date on delayed school entry. The interaction terms in Models 2.3 and 2.4 in Table 2 show that high <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> facilitated the delay of school entry for May–August-born children.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of child temperament {{in the relationship between}} <b>parental</b> risk <b>status</b> and cognitive competence. Three main questions were addressed: (1) Does <b>parental</b> risk <b>status</b> predict child temperament? (2) Does child temperament act as a mediating variable between <b>parental</b> risk <b>status</b> and cognitive functioning? Importantly, does temperament operate as a risk or protective factor? and (3) What {{is the nature of the}} relationship between child temperament and cognitive functioning? These questions were explored within a subsample of high-risk mothers and their infant and preschool-age offspring from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project. This longitudinal investigation, which started in 1977, identified lower SES individuals as being highly aggressive and/or withdrawn in childhood. Many of these individuals now have children of their own, which provides a unique opportunity to investigate the trajectories of risk and resilience across generations. Contrary to expectations, <b>parental</b> risk <b>status</b> was not a significant predictor of child temperament in either infants or preschoolers. In the infant subsample, child temperament operated as a risk factor for lower cognitive performance and worked directly to influence IQ, even after controlling for current psychosocial variables. In the preschool subsample, child temperament operated indirectly, through the home environment and parental social support, in predicting children's intelligence scores. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for taking a developmental approach when studying child outcomes, and the processes by which children's cognitive competence is placed at risk...|$|R
2500|$|Stanford University {{professor}} Shelley Correll {{and colleagues}} (2007) sent {{out more than}} 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were {{significantly less likely to}} get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This {{despite the fact that the}} qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their <b>parental</b> <b>status</b> varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural understandings of the [...] "ideal worker" [...] role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as understandings of what it means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with understandings of what it means to be a good worker.|$|E

With respect to the total sample, the overall model of five factors pertinent to student achievement outcomes in mathematics was significant (sibling numbers, length of residence in urban areas, preschool attendance, <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and school type). While these factors figure prominently as significant academic predictors for the migrant school sample, the only significant predictor of mathematics achievement for the public school sample is <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status.</b> In the light of these findings the paper concludes with suggestions for the intervention that inform and characterize {{the education}} of migrant children in urban schools...|$|R

40|$|Several {{factors may}} {{influence}} children’s lifestyle. The {{main purpose of}} this study is to introduce a children’s lifestyle index framework and model it based on structural equation modeling (SEM) with Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian predictors. This framework includes <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status,</b> household food security, parental lifestyle, and children’s lifestyle. The sample for this study involves 452 volunteer Chinese families with children 7 – 12 years old. The experimental results are compared in terms of root mean square error, coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error metrics. An analysis of the proposed causal model suggests there are multiple significant interconnections among the variables of interest. According to both Bayesian and ML techniques, the proposed framework illustrates that <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and <b>parental</b> lifestyle strongly impact children’s lifestyle. The impact of household food security on children’s lifestyle is rejected. However, there is a strong relationship between household food security and both <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> and <b>parental</b> lifestyle.

40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} {{is associated with}} health and a normal weight status and is therefore recommended in childhood obesity treatment. To produce more effective treatment for obese children, {{there is a need}} to investigate how social factors affect the outcome of these treatments. Children with low <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> (SES) are particularly at high risk for being obese and having a sedentary lifestyle. The impact of socioeconomic status in the treatment of obese children in general, and particular regarding physical activity, is however not known. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> on change in physical activity among obese children during participation in a familybased treatment program at St. Olav University Hospital. Material and method: This intervention study included 58 children with obesity (BMI ≥ 2 SDS). The treatment program promoted physical activity and a healthy diet for the participating families. Children were classified into high- or low <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status</b> based on their parents’ occupation. Physical activity was assessed by accelerometer at baseline and after two years. Results: Similar to the normal weigh population of children, all participants reduced their level of physical activity over the two years of observation. A high level of physical activity at baseline was strongly associated with a greater reduction in physical activity after two years, and the reduction was significantly more pronounced in children with high <b>parental</b> socioeconomic <b>status.</b> Conclusions: The intervention was more successful in maintaining the physical activity level in children with low parental SES compared to children with high parental SES. This result emphasizes the need for more individualized treatment for obese children. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to fully explore the relationship between change in physical activity and parental SES...|$|R
