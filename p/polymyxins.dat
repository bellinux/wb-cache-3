25|$|Due to {{widespread}} resistance to many common first-line antibiotics, carbapenems, <b>polymyxins,</b> {{and more recently}} tigecycline {{were considered to be}} the drugs of choice; however, resistance to these drugs has also been reported. Despite this, they are still being used in areas where resistance has not yet been reported. Use of β-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam has been advised in combination with antibiotics to enhance antimicrobial action even {{in the presence of a}} certain level of resistance. Combination therapy after rigorous antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been found to be the best course of action in the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Some next-generation antibiotics that are reported as being active against P. aeruginosa include doripenem, ceftobiprole, and ceftaroline. However, these require more clinical trials for standardization. Therefore, research for the discovery of new antibiotics and drugs against P. aeruginosa is very much needed.|$|E

2500|$|The serendipitous {{discovery}} and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce anti-infective natural products.

40|$|<b>Polymyxin</b> B, a {{relatively}} toxic antibiotic, has potent endotoxin-neutralizing properties {{that may be}} beneficial as adjunctive therapy in gram-negative sepsis. <b>Polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide (deacylated <b>polymyxin</b> B) is devoid of antibiotic activity but retains the capacity to disorganize the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. To evaluate the potential therapeutic usefulness of this derivative, we produced purified <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide, tested its in vivo toxicity in animals, and evaluated its in vitro antiendotoxin activity. Effectiveness as an antiendotoxin agent was assessed by examining the ability of <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide to block the enhanced release of toxic oxygen radicals induced by lipopolysaccharide in human neutrophils (priming). In vivo, at doses of 1. 5 and 3. 0 mg/kg, <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide did not exhibit the neuromuscular blocking, neurotoxic, or nephrotoxic effects that were observed with <b>polymyxin</b> B sulfate. Both <b>polymyxin</b> B and <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neutrophil priming in a concentration-dependent manner, but the parent compound, <b>polymyxin</b> B, was 63 times more effective on a weight basis. The inhibitory activity of both compounds, however, diminished rapidly when they were added {{after the start of}} the lipopolysaccharide-neutrophil incubation. We conclude that <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide is less toxic than <b>polymyxin</b> B and, at the doses tested, lacks the neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of the parent compound. <b>Polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide retains the antiendotoxin activity of <b>polymyxin</b> B but is much less potent. The findings suggest that these compounds block an early step in the neutrophil priming process, possibly lipopolysaccharide attachment to or insertion into the neutrophil membrane...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{unrelated}} clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates {{resistant to}} all commonly used antibiotics {{were subjected to}} three-dimensional checkerboard microtiter plate dilution and time-kill studies at one-fourth of their MICs of <b>polymyxin</b> B, imipenem, and rifampin. Synergy was demonstrated with combinations of <b>polymyxin</b> B and imipenem, <b>polymyxin</b> B and rifampin, and <b>polymyxin</b> B, imipenem, and rifampin. Double combinations of <b>polymyxin</b> B and imipenem and of <b>polymyxin</b> B and rifampin were bactericidal for seven of eight isolates, and triple combinations were bactericidal for all isolates within 24 h. Future clinical studies using double and triple therapy with these antibacterials may provide an effective option against potentially lethal infection due to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii...|$|R

50|$|<b>Polymyxins</b> are antibiotics. <b>Polymyxins</b> B and E (also {{known as}} colistin) {{are used in}} the {{treatment}} of Gram-negative bacterial infections. They work mostly by breaking up the bacteria's cell membrane. They are part of a broader class of molecules called nonribosomal peptides.|$|E
5000|$|Polymyxin B is an {{antibiotic}} primarily used for resistant Gram-negative infections. It {{is derived from}} the bacterium Bacillus polymyxa. Polymyxin B is composed of a number of related compounds (see [...] "Mixture composition"). It has a bactericidal action against almost all Gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus and Neisseria genera. <b>Polymyxins</b> bind to the cell membrane and alter its structure, making it more permeable. The resulting water uptake leads to cell death. <b>Polymyxins</b> are cationic, basic peptides that act like detergents (surfactants).

40|$|<b>Polymyxin</b> E, {{produced}} by Paenibacillus polymyxa, {{is an important}} antibiotic normally against Gram-negative pathogens. In this study, we found that <b>polymyxin</b> E can kill its producer P. polymyxa, a Gram-positive bacterium, by disrupting its cell membrane. Membrane damage was clearly revealed by detecting the leakage of intracellular molecules. The observation using scanning electron microscopy also supported that <b>polymyxin</b> E can destroy the cell membrane and cause an extensive cell surface alteration. On the other hand, divalent cations can give protection against <b>polymyxin</b> E. Compared with Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + can more effectively alleviate <b>polymyxin</b> E-induced damage to the cell membrane, thus remarkably increasing the P. polymyxa survival. Our findings would shed light on a not yet described bactericidal mechanism of <b>polymyxin</b> E against Gram-positive bacteria and more importantly the nature of limited fermentation output of <b>polymyxin</b> E from P. polymyxa...|$|R
40|$|The limulus {{gelation}} assay {{was utilized}} to investigate endotoxin inactivation {{by a number}} of antibiotics in vitro. Endotoxin activity was sharply reduced by <b>polymyxin</b> B and sodium colistimethate. The effect of the <b>polymyxin</b> was not significantly inhibited by 0. 001 M calcium or 90 % serum. Crude endotoxins from a variety of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, including several not previously studied, could be inactivated 1 or more logs by as little as 1 μg of <b>polymyxin</b> B per ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis endotoxin was poorly detoxified. A 10, 000 -fold range in the relative susceptibility of different endotoxins to inactivation by <b>polymyxin</b> B was found.

5000|$|<b>Polymyxins</b> are a {{group of}} non-ribosomal {{polypeptide}} (NRPs) cyclic natural products biosynthesized from bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus, more specifically the subgenus Paenibacillus. <b>Polymyxins</b> consist of 10 residues, six of which are L-α, γ-diaminobutyric acid (L-DAB). The DAB residues cause <b>polymyxins</b> to have multiple positively charged groups at physiological pH. Seven residues form the main cyclic component, while the other three extend {{from one of the}} cyclic residues as a linear chain terminating in either 6-methyloctanoic acid or 6-methylheptanoic acid at the N-terminus. During cyclization, residue 10 is ligated to the bridging residue 4. [...] The amino acid residues and DAB monomers are generally L (levo) configuration, however certain strains such as P. polymyxa PKB1 have been observed to incorporate DAB with D (dextro) configuration at position 3 producing variations of polymyxin B.|$|E
40|$|Since carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains {{were first}} {{reported}} in North Carolina, these highly resistant organisms have been isolated with increasing frequency, {{especially in the}} New York City area. <b>Polymyxin</b> B {{is one of the}} few antimicrobials that retain reliable activity against these organisms. However, <b>polymyxin</b> B MICs are elevated against K. pneumoniae isolates with increasing frequency, leaving clinicians with few therapeutic options. We investigated several antimicrobial agents for potential synergy with <b>polymyxin</b> B against 12 clinical strains of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae. A broth microdilution assay using a 96 -well plate was developed in which graded dilutions of <b>polymyxin</b> B and the study drug were incubated with resistant isolates in a checkerboard pattern. <b>Polymyxin</b> B was studied in combination with cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, imipenem, gentamicin, tigecycline, doxycycline, and rifampin. All K. pneumoniae strains tested positive for K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) genes by real-time PCR and had elevated <b>polymyxin</b> B MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 μg/ml. Synergy was observed with the combination of <b>polymyxin</b> B and rifampin as well as with <b>polymyxin</b> B and doxycycline, resulting in at least a 4 -fold decrease in the <b>polymyxin</b> B MIC. For both combinations, this effect occurred at physiologically achievable concentrations. Less pronounced synergy was noted with tigecycline and <b>polymyxin</b> B. No synergy was observed at physiologic concentrations with the other antimicrobials studied. These results suggest that rifampin, doxycycline, and tigecycline may be useful additions to <b>polymyxin</b> B in the treatment of infections caused by highly resistant carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae. Further studies are warranted to determine if these in vitro findings translate into clinical efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Resistance {{rates to}} <b>polymyxin</b> B in {{surveillance}} {{studies have been}} very low despite its increasing use worldwide as the last resort therapy for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. However, two other resistance phenotypes, hetero- and adaptive resistance, {{have been reported to}} <b>polymyxin.</b> We aimed to investigate the presence of <b>polymyxin</b> B hetero- and adaptive resistance and evaluate its stability in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) clinical isolates. Methods: CRAB isolates were recovered from hospitalized patients at three Brazilian hospitals. Hetero-resistance was determined by population analysis profile (PAP). Adaptive resistance was evaluated after serial daily passages of isolates in Luria-Bertani broth containing increasing <b>polymyxin</b> B concentrations. MICs of <b>polymyxin</b> B of colonies growing at the highest <b>polymyxin</b> B concentration were further determined after daily sub-cultured in antibiotic-free medium and after storage at − 80 °C, in some selected isolates. Results: Eighty OXA- 23 -producing CRAB isolates were typed resulting in 15 distinct clones. Twenty-nine randomly selected isolates (at least one from each clone) were selected for hetero- resistance evaluation: 26 (90 %) presented growth of subpopulations with higher <b>polymyxin</b> B MIC than the original one in PAP. No isolate has grown at <b>polymyxin</b> B concentrations higher than 2 mg/L. <b>Polymyxin</b> B MICs of subpopulations remained higher than th...|$|R

50|$|After binding to {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) in {{the outer}} membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, <b>polymyxins</b> disrupt both the outer and inner membranes. The hydrophobic tail is important in causing membrane damage, suggesting a detergent-like mode of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polymyxins</b> {{are used}} to {{neutralize}} or absorb LPS, which contaminates samples intended for use in, e.g., immunological experiments. Minimization of LPS contamination can be important because LPS can evoke strong reactions from immune cells and, therefore, distort experimental results.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{can develop}} {{resistance}} to <b>polymyxin</b> and other cationic antimicrobial peptides. Previous work {{has shown that}} mutations in the PmrAB and PhoPQ regulatory systems can confer low to moderate levels of <b>polymyxin</b> resistance (MICs of 8 to 64 mg/liter) in laboratory and clinical strains of this organism. To explore the role of PhoPQ in high-level clinical <b>polymyxin</b> resistance, P. aeruginosa strains with colistin MICs > 512 mg/liter that had been isolated from cystic fibrosis patients treated with inhaled colistin (<b>polymyxin</b> E) were analyzed. Probable loss-of-function phoQ alleles found in these cystic fibrosis strains conferred resistance to <b>polymyxin.</b> Partial and complete suppressor mutations in phoP were identified in some cystic fibrosis strains with resistance-conferring phoQ mutations, suggesting that additional loci can be involved in <b>polymyxin</b> resistance in P. aeruginosa. Disruption of chromosomal phoQ {{in the presence of}} an intact phoP allele stimulated 4 -amino-l-arabinose addition to lipid A and induced transcription from the promoter of the pmrH (arnB) operon, consistent with the known role of this lipid A modification in <b>polymyxin</b> resistance. These results indicate that phoQ loss-of-function mutations can contribute to high-level <b>polymyxin</b> resistance in clinical strains of P. aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>polymyxin</b> B and <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide (PMBN) on the {{permeability}} of the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane were investigated.

Although PMBN mediated loss of low molecular weight substances from E. coli, it was not bactericidal. In contrast, <b>polymyxin</b> B treated E. coli lysed and rapidly lost viability. We suggest that the bactericidal activity of <b>polymyxin</b> B may be related to its previously reported ability to release cytoplasmic proteins from bacteria...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{resistance of the}} MCR gene is a phosphatidylethanolamine transferase.

50|$|India {{reported}} the first detailed colistin-resistance study which mapped 13 colistin-resistant cases recorded over 18 months. It concluded that pan-drug resistant infections, {{particularly those in}} the blood stream, have a higher mortality. Multiple other cases were reported from other Indian hospitals. Although resistance to <b>polymyxins</b> is generally less than 10%, it is more frequent in the Mediterranean and South-East Asia (Korea and Singapore), where colistin resistance rates are continually increasing.

50|$|They are {{produced}} by nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems in Gram-positive bacteria such as Paenibacillus polymyxa. Like other NRPs, <b>polymyxins</b> are assembled via synthetases comprising multiple modules, each containing a set of enzyme domains that sequentially operate on the growing chain by adding the next residue and extending the chain through peptide-bond formation and condensation reactions. The final steps involve a thioesterase domain at the C-terminal of the last module to cyclize the molecule and liberate the chain from the enzyme.|$|E

40|$|The PmrA/PmrB {{regulatory}} system of Salmonella enterica controls the modification of lipid A with aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine. The aminoarabinose modification {{is required for}} resistance to the antibiotic <b>polymyxin</b> B, as mutations of the PmrA-activated pbg operon or ugd gene result in strains that lack aminoarabinose in their lipid A molecules and {{are more susceptible to}} <b>polymyxin</b> B. Additional PmrA-regulated genes appear to participate in <b>polymyxin</b> B resistance, as pbgP and ugd mutants are not as sensitive to <b>polymyxin</b> B as a pmrA mutant. Moreover, the role that the phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A plays in the resistance to <b>polymyxin</b> B has remained unknown. Here we address both of these questions by establishing that the PmrA-activated pmrC gene encodes an inner membrane protein that is required for the incorporation of phosphoethanolamine into lipid A and for <b>polymyxin</b> B resistance. The PmrC protein consists of an N-terminal region with five transmembrane domains followed by a large periplasmic region harboring the putative enzymatic domain. A pbgP pmrC double mutant resembled a pmrA mutant both in its lipid A profile and in its susceptibility to <b>polymyxin</b> B, indicating that the PmrA-dependent modification of lipid A with aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine is responsible for PmrA-regulated <b>polymyxin</b> B resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>polymyxin</b> B and <b>polymyxin</b> B nonapeptide (PMBN) on cell {{envelope}} integrity in Escherichia coli were compared. Both compounds caused loss of proteins from E. coli K- 12 3300 (pBR 322), although PMBN released less protein than did <b>polymyxin</b> B. The {{origin of the}} released protein was determined both by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by using specific enzyme markers (beta-lactamase in periplasm, beta-galactosidase in cytoplasm). The proteins released by both compounds were derived principally from the periplasm, accompanied {{in the case of}} <b>polymyxin</b> B by a low level of cytoplasmic proteins. Although <b>polymyxin</b> B and PMBN both caused release of periplasmic proteins, the individual proteins released by the compounds differed. The periplasmic fraction contained six principal polypeptides with molecular weights between 62, 000 (polypeptide 1) and 29, 000 (polypeptide 6). Polypeptide 6 was identified as the pBR 322 -encoded beta-lactamase, but the other proteins were not specifically identified. <b>Polymyxin</b> B caused considerable release of polypeptides 1, 2, and 5 with some release of polypeptides 4 and 6.
