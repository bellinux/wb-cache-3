40|$|Abstract—A {{common mode}} of limb {{suspension}} for transtibial amputees is the pin liner/shuttle lock system. Despite its popu-larity, some clinicians question its use because of observed daily and chronic {{changes to the}} residual limb. For this study, we measured limb interface pressures during ambulation with pin and suction suspension systems. No pressure differences were seen between the modes of suspension during stance phase. However, during swing phase, pin suspension main-tained an average occlusive compressive pressure of 6. 7 kPa on the proximal tissues, {{as compared to the}} subocclusive pressure of 1. 1 kPa with suction suspension. Simultaneously, pin sus-pension elevated the peak magnitude of suction to – 39. 5 kPa at the distal residual limb, compared to – 26. 1 kPa with suction suspension. During swing phase, the pin liner squeezes proxi-mally while creating a large suction distally on the residual limb and is the likely cause of daily and chronic skin changes observed in pin users.

Channel Angular Extrusion(CAE) {{processes}} are characterised by imposing {{high level of}} strain into deformable materials using simple tools where the material is contained within a specific path.

In this paper, the applications of CAE have been extended to include the construction of Universal Re-useable Energy Absorption Devices (UREAD) using equal channels. An investigation is carried out into the distribution of contact stresses at the tool/material interface. The model employs the slab method of analysis and splits the material inside the channels, which intersects at 90, into two zones; one causes the deformation while the other remains rigid. Normal stresses that may develop at the contact surface between the deformable material and the tools are analysed for various cases of CAE and are compared with those obtained by the Finite Element Analysis.

40|$|In {{metal forming}} operations, the {{intensity}} and distribution of stresses at the tool/material interface have great influence on the pattern and mode of deformation. This {{is due to the}} effect of frictional forces, being resistive to material movements and hence affects material flow and the directionality of volume distribution of material inside die cavities. This paper explores the use of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pin</b> technique for the measurement of tool stresses at the interface between the tool and the deforming workpiece material. It also introduces a new experimental methodology for the measurement of stresses where the measuring device is concealed inside the tool and not subjected to the severe conditions at the interface surface. Such an arrangement prohibits the severe conditions at the interface from influencing or distorting the experimental readings and facilitates repeatability of results. Each tool containing measuring devices is split into two parts, one that includes the shape to be formed and house the pin heads (industrial die), while the second part includes the rest of the measuring column including the load cells. Using thermal insulation the second part can be protected from any thermal conditions at the interface when the tools are used in hot forming operations. Theoretical investigation of tool stresses is carried out using stress analysis. Experimental measurements of axial and radial stresses at different positions along the radius of an axi-symmetric billet are presented and compared with the theoretical results. Friction resistance and friction coefficient are also evaluated across billet surface and at different height reductions. Such an investigation gives better understanding of the interface conditions and parameters, which are among the essential input to the sophisticated modelling technology applied to metal forming processes.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} grain growth dynamics complemented with Vertex simulations {{is presented in}} this work. This {{has been done by}} including the effect of the two main drag forces in grain growth dynamics: those described by the Zener <b>pressure</b> (<b>pinning</b> particles) and Chan theory (solute drag force). The grain growth dynamics is usually addressed through fitting of the experimental measurements to a parabolic growth law, which is the solution of the mean grain size of a system free of drag forces, and the corresponding n-exponent derived. In our analysis, by contrast, analytical solutions of the grain growth dynamical equations explain and characterise the exponent variation with respect to the parameters that defines both drag forces. The Vertex simulation method completes the description of the grain size distribution, not only its mean, and allows us to characterise the evolution of the microstructure. In order to understand the results of the simulation, an analysis on the most commonly used statistical distributions describing the grain size has been carried out. It has been possible to conclude that the Weibull distribution, among all the others distributions, describes the nature of the simulated grain growth and its size distribution. As a consequence, the shape parameter k of Weibull distribution has been related with the pinning forces, being it itself a quantitative indicator of such forces. The results have been compared with experimental results with remarkable agreement, where the analytical solution and statistical relationship observed by simulation have been very useful describing and characterising the microstructure evolution. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of sole and joint Zr and Mn additions on the recrystallization behaviour of an AA 2198 -base alloy {{has been compared}} during extended annealing at 535 °C, following hot rolling to sheet. With a constant Zr level recrystallization resistance was seen to diminish {{with the addition of}} Mn and became progressively worse with a decrease in Zr content, as more Mn was added. It has been found that this behaviour arises because the additional <b>pinning</b> <b>pressure</b> of Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 dispersoids does not adequately compensate for the expansion in width of the Al 3 Zr-free bands that occurs on the addition of Mn to the base alloy, even with the same Zr level. The lower potency of Mn, relative to Zr, in inhibiting recrystallization has been attributed to the poorer coherency and higher aspect ratio of the Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 dispersoids, which reduces their Zener <b>pinning</b> <b>pressure</b> by a factor of four relative to that of the Al 3 Zr phase. In addition, the presence of the coarser Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 dispersoids was found to increase the stored energy after hot rolling. The recrystallization mechanism was dependent on the dispersoid type. The addition of Zr led to the dominance of broad front strain-induced boundary migration (SIBM), whereas the addition of Mn-containing dispersoids favoured particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN). Texture measurements have verified this observation, with SIBM favouring the growth of recrystallized grains of orientations typical of the deformation texture and PSN promoting the growth of randomly orientated grains during recrystallization...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{individual}} and combined zirconium and manganese additions have been compared for an AA 2198 6 mm thick sheet in T 351 temper regarding their influence primarily on recrystallisation resistance and secondly on fracture toughness and overageing resistance. A complete characterisation of the dispersoid distributions was carried out for {{a deeper understanding of}} the effects of the Al 3 Zr and Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 particles, involving studying their formation from the as-cast and homogenised stage. The most important finding in this work was the lower recrystallisation resistance in the alloy containing 0. 1 wt%Zr + 0. 3 wt%Mn compared to that containing only 0. 1 wt%Zr. This result was rather unexpected, if one considers the opposite microsegregation patterns of Zr and Mn during casting, which leads to dispersoids occupying the majority of the grains’ volume and minimising dispersoid-free zones that could be potential sites for nucleation of recrystallisation. The other two alloys with dispersoid additions 0. 05 wt%Zr + 0. 3 wt%Mn and 0. 4 wt%Mn, were partially and fully recrystallised respectively in the rolled T 351 condition. Equally important in this work, was the observation that the opposite microsegregation trend of Zr and Mn sufficed to restrict grain growth in unrecrystallised areas. The 0. 1 Zr- 0. 3 Mn alloy exhibited the lowest grain size of all alloys, both in the T 351 temper and after annealing at 535 oC for up to 144 hours. The reason for this was the combined action of Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 dispersoids and Mn solute in the regions where the Zr concentration was low (i. e. near the grain boundaries), which offered additional <b>pinning</b> <b>pressure</b> to those areas compared to the 0. 1 Zr alloy. The lower recrystallisation resistance of the 0. 1 Zr- 0. 3 Mn alloy was explained on the grounds of two main factors. The first was the lower subgrain size and hence stored energy within bands of Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 dispersoids, which increased the driving force for recrystallisation in these regions. The second was the interaction between Zr and Mn that led to a decrease in the Al 3 Zr number density and <b>pinning</b> <b>pressure.</b> Since Zr was the dominant dispersoid family in terms of inhibiting recrystallisation, inevitably this alloy became more prone to recrystallisation. The Al 3 Zr <b>pinning</b> <b>pressure</b> was found to be much lower especially within bands of Al 20 Cu 2 Mn 3 dispersoids. The detrimental effect of the Mn addition on the Al 3 Zr distribution was proven not to result from the dissolution of Zr within Mn-containing phases, and several other phases, at the grain interior and also in grain boundaries. The observed effect could not be precisely explained at this stage. Concerning mechanical properties, the 0. 1 Zr alloy exhibited the best combination of properties in the Kahn tear tests for fracture toughness. Further, it had a higher overageing resistance compared to the 0. 1 Zr- 0. 3 Mn alloy. As an overall conclusion from this work, considering all the studied properties here that are essential for damage tolerant applications, the addition of 0. 1 wt%Zr to the AA 2198 6 mm thick sheet was found to be superior to that of the combined addition of 0. 1 wt%Zr + 0. 3 wt%Mn.

In order to gain the best advantage of this possibility of tailoring the laminate, {{it is necessary to}} understand the influence of laminate parameters on the behaviour of joints in composites. Most of the earlier studies in this direction were based on simplified assumptions regarding load transfer at the pin-plate intelface and such studies were only carried 13; out on orthotropic and quasi-isotropic laminates. In the present study, a more rigorous analysis is carried out to study pin joints in laminates with anisotropic properties. Two types of laminates with (0 / + a 4 / 90) s and (0 /:t a 2 / 90) s layups made out of graphite epoxy T 300 / 5208 material system 13; are considered. The analysis mainly concentrates on clearance fit in which the pin is of smaller diameter compared to the hole. The main aspect of the analysis of pin joints is the changing contact between the pin and the plate with increasing load levels. The analysis is carried out by an iterative finite element technique and a computationally efficient routine is developed for this purpose. Numerical studies indicate that the location and magnitude of the peak stresses along the hole boundary arefunctions of fibre angle and the overall anisotropic properties. It is also shown that the con ventional assumption of cosine distribution for the contact <b>pressure</b> between <b>pin</b> and the plate in the analysis lead to underestimation of bearing failure load and overestimation of shear and tensile failure loads in typical (0 / 905 / cross-ply laminates...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to measure the {{pulmonary}} inertance (IL) in ponies and to analyze its potential influence on the mechanics of breathing and on their aptitude to increase ventilation during exercise. Five healthy ponies 2. 4 - 4 yr old [mean wt 255 +/- 15 (SE) kg] were used. On the one hand, inertance of the respiratory system (Irs) was computed from the value of the resonant frequency (fr) measured by the forced oscillation technique. On the other hand, respiratory airflow, tidal volume (VT), and transpulmonary pressure (PL) changes were recorded while the ponies were performing a light treadmill exercise, and IL was calculated as the ratio of the associated differences in inertial <b>pressure</b> (delta <b>Pin)</b> to volume acceleration (delta V). Respiratory airflow and VT were measured with a Fleisch pneumotachograph (no. 5) and PL with an intraesophageal balloon catheter. First, the protocol was carried out with the ponies breathing air and He-O 2, second, while the ponies breathed through two additional tubes (100 cm long, 3 cm ID), then one, and finally none, fixed on the Fleisch pneumotachograph. Finally, the contribution of the extra- vs. the intrathoracic airways to IL was estimated by measuring the lateral midtracheal pressure recorded simultaneously with the aforementioned parameters. The values of Irs calculated with fr and of IL calculated {{on the basis of the}} delta Pin-delta V ratio were 29. 8 +/- 0. 4 and 19. 8 +/- 1. 0. 10 (- 4) kPa. l- 1. s- 2, respectively. During He-O 2 breathing IL decreased about three times; this result was similar to the predicted decrease based on gas density only. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|R
