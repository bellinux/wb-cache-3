In this study, we observed the slip bands of the metal surface of specimen by optical microscope after test for a given repeated impact tension.

40|$|In flows around ships, the {{bow wave}} can entrain a {{significant}} amount of air as it breaks continuously on the free surface. The resulting air bubbles persist in the ship wake affecting its radar cross section as well as acting as cavitation nuclei in the flow entering the ship's propeller. In the present investigation, the formation of a bow wave on a ship was simulated in the laboratory using a deflecting plate in a supercritical free surface flow. The experiments were conducted at two scales. The present paper focuses on how the bow wave changes with the angles and flow parameters, information which is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the air entrainment process. Flow visualization studies were performed and an electronic <b>point</b> <b>gage</b> was used to study the three-dimensional shape of the bow waves {{and the manner in which}} they break...|$|E
500|$|When General Amherst left North America in 1763, {{it was on}} a {{leave of}} absence from his {{position}} as commander-in-chief. In 1764, Amherst announced that {{he had no intention of}} returning to North America, at which <b>point</b> <b>Gage's</b> appointment to that post was made permanent. (Amherst retained posts as governor of Virginia and colonel of the 60th Foot, positions he only gave up in 1768 when he was required to actually go to Virginia or give up the post.) [...] Intrigues of other high-ranking officers, especially Robert Monckton and his supporters, for his offices, continued throughout his tenure as commander-in-chief. Gage was promoted to lieutenant general in 1771. [...] In 1767 Gage ordered the arrest of Major Robert Rogers, the former leader of Rogers' Rangers who Gage had come to dislike and distrust during the war. The arrest was based on flimsy evidence that Rogers might have been engaging in a treasonous relationship with the French; he was acquitted in a 1768 court martial.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Oregon State University {{conducted}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments to measure and quantify the near-field wave effects caused within arrays of Wave Energy Converters (WEC). As the waves and WECs interact, the WECs generate radiated waves; these effects vary with the location within the array. Analyzing the near-field waves will help determine the relative importance of radiation {{as a function of the}} incident wave conditions and device performance. It is imperative to fully understand the near-field waves before full-scale WEC farms can be installed. The prototype device, Columbia Power Technologies' Manta, was tested in regular wave heights ranging from 6 cm to 15 cm. Three wave gages measured the water surface elevation in the near-field surrounding and within the WEC arrays. While these gages give a good overall picture of the water surface elevation behavior, it is difficult to resolve the complicated wave field within the WEC array using <b>point</b> <b>gages.</b> Here two image processing techniques were applied to the video data to analyze the near-field in high resolution. First, stereo video methods were applied to extract the incident wave 3 D water surface elevations to reconstruct the multi-directional wave field. This method accurately resolved the incident waves within 10...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a scheme is {{proposed}} {{to use a}} point raingage to compare contemporaneous measurements of rain rate from a single-field-of-view (FOV) estimate based on a satellite remote sensor such as a microwave radiometer. Even in the ideal case the measurements are different because one is at a point {{and the other is}} an area average over the field of view. Also the <b>point</b> <b>gage</b> will be located randomly inside the field of view on different overpasses. A space-time spectral formalism is combined with a simple stochastic rain field to find the mean-square deviations between the two systems. It is found that by combining about 60 visits of the satellite to the ground-truth site, the expected error can be reduced to about 10 % of the standard deviation of the fluctuations of the systems alone. This seems to be a useful level of tolerance in terms of isolating and evaluating typical biases that might be contaminating retrieval algorithms...|$|E

However, rarely are rain gage networks dense {{enough to provide}} accurate assessments of the very storms these networks are intended to monitor. Furthermore, rainfall topologies interpolated from point data may be {{quite different from the}} actual storm shapes. For the past decade, large scale databases of radar rainfall estimates have been created and archived providing a rich store of information that has never existed before. These databases can be mined for detailed information regarding the spatial characteristics of storms. This paper will present findings on the spatial structure of storms from Florida and other locations in the United States. Example frequency distributions of storm parameters will be presented.

50|$|Also in {{the example}} above, ideally the {{calibration}} value of 100 units {{would be the best}} <b>point</b> in the <b>gage's</b> range to perform a single-point calibration. It may be the manufacturer's recommendation or it may be the way similar devices are already being calibrated. Multiple point calibrations are also used. Depending on the device, a zero unit state, the absence of the phenomenon being measured, may also be a calibration point. Or zero may be resettable by the user-there are several variations possible. Again, the points to use during calibration should be recorded.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. More than 4, 0, 0 global Geosat {{altimeter}} observations, taken {{mostly in}} 1986 - 87, have been analyzed for the M, tide at overlapping {{points in the}} satellite's exact repeat mission (ERM). The results are compatible with the Schwiderski (1983) tide model {{at a level of}} 5. 5 cm (rms discrepancy). The principal features of that model (amphidromes and highs) are unchanged. The altimeter solutions use independent time series for more than 1, 900 4 " by 4 " areas of the deep oceans. They have been calibrated through nine roughly equal and independent subset analyses employing different arcs of the ERM coonfiguration. Results show that 1, 652 of the full set M, solutions have calibrated errors of less than 5 cm. Fairly good agreement exists between the 4 " altimeter solutions and the few (<b>point)</b> tide <b>gage</b> results reported by Schwiderski. INTRODUCITON With the launch of the U. S.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{continuing}} investigation to develop methods for measuring local transient surface heat flux. A method is presented for simultaneous measurements of dual heat fluxes at a surface location by considering the heat flux as a separate function of heat stored and heat conducted within a heat flux gage. Surface heat flux information is obtained from transient temperature measurements taken at <b>points</b> within the <b>gage.</b> Heat flux was determined over a range of 4 to 22 MW/sq m. It was concluded that the method is feasible. Possible applications are for heat flux measurements on the turbine blade surfaces of space shuttle main engine turbopumps and on the component surfaces of rocket and advanced gas turbine engines and for testing sensors in heat flux gage calibrators...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{uniformity}} {{in a high}} enthalpy {{facility is}} investigated. The scramjet research facility is composed of a rectangular combustor duct connected to a 100 MW electric arc air heater. The Mach 3. 3 flow is accelerated through a two-dimensional contoured nozzle. Instream measurements were made with water-cooled Pitot probes and stagnation <b>point</b> heat flux <b>gages</b> at stream enthalpy levels ranging from 4 to 7 Mj/kg. Flow surveys were made on the flow centerline and off centerline {{in order to measure}} the three dimensional uniformity of the flow in the rectangular duct. Measurements indicated that although the flow in the aspect ratio 6 : 1 duct was relatively uniform on the centerline, three dimensional viscous effects were apparent near the corners. Flow through the nozzle and constant area duct was modeled computationally using a two dimensional, Navier-Stokes, reacting gas code. The computations predict that the flow in the test section is in vibrational equilibrium. The computed and measured Pitot pressure and heat flux profiles are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Tropical Storm Allison dropped {{more than}} 30 {{inches of rain}} over {{metropolitan}} Houston in June 2001, causing unprecedented flooding and more than $ 5 billion dollars of damage. Over {{parts of the city}} and Harris County, rainfall rates exceeded 3 inches per hour for eight consecutive hours. Rainfall distributions from rain gages are typically estimated by assuming a spatial geometry tied to <b>point</b> rain <b>gage</b> observations using, for example, Thiessen polygons, inverse distance squared weighting, or statistical Kriging techniques. Unfortunately, the spatial distributions inferred by these approaches have little connection with how rain actually falls. Since the release of the WSR- 88 D (NEXRAD) radar in the early 1990 s, many hydrologists and engineers have begun using gage-adjusted radar rainfall estimates for hydrologic and water resource modeling. However, due to the extreme nature of the event, traditional radar rainfall estimation methods using uniform bias adjustment techniques severely underestimated the rainfall rates in the heaviest regions of the storm. NEXRAIN created a gage-adjusted radar rainfall dataset using over 150 rain gages and incorporated a spatial adjustment technique developed by Edward Brandes at the National Severe Storms Lab in the mid- 1970 s. The radar-rainfall data set used in this project was a mosaic of several WSR- 88 D radars that cover the Houston area. Slight performance characteristics between the radars caused visible discontinuities {{at the edges of the}} individual coverage areas. In addition, an area of underestimation due to the use of higher scan elevations in the immediate vicinity of the Houston radar was noted. A GIS approach was used to reduce or eliminate these spatial discontinuities. Use of these two techniques greatly improved gage-adjusted radar rainfall estimates of the extreme rainfall while preserving the spatial signature of the radar rainfall distribution...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{coordinate}} measuring {{machines in}} foundries {{has historically been}} somewhat different than in other industries. In the foundry layout room, the CMM is often used simply {{to see if there}} is enough material at specific <b>gage</b> <b>points</b> – measurement techniques such as establishing complex datum reference frames [1, 2] and considering the number and spacing of sample points are usually not an issue. However, as modern foundries develop better production techniques to make competitive thin wall and precision castings [3], the measuring methods must keep pace. This paper analyses measurement techniques used by various metrology shops with the goal of determining best measurement practice for reducing the variations in measurements. A set of 10 artifacts (castings) were sent to different metrology shops and the measurement techniques and thickness results were recorded for each shop. The thickness of the castings reported by each metrology shop is compared to other shops in a method similar to a Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (GR&R) study [4, 5]. We extend this analysis to consider the effects of different measurement techniques, and then propose a procedure to reduce the variation caused due to different measurement techniques...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework for representing spatial, thematic, and temporal dimensions of geographic features has been developed. This framework {{relies on the}} unifying concept of a geographic feature as a single, unique entity {{in the real world}} with multiple object representations such as raster and vector geometries, multiple resolutions and source scales, and multiple temporal sequences. The same geographic feature can be represented in the framework at one resolution as a point and at a higher resolution as an area. Similarly, linear features such as streams can be represented as single lines at a coarse resolution and as double lines and areas at higher resolutions. Changes in spatial configuration and thematic attribution through time are also supported in the framework. Although an earlier implementation of this framework used relational database technology, implementation now focuses on object-oriented approaches. The implementation logically follows the organization of category theory, with the feature forming the basic level of categorization. An implementation for a watershed modeling application is built to test the theory. The application requires multiple feature types, such as the linear structure of the stream network embedded within the areal structure of the watershed. The multiple representations required for the watershed application include <b>points</b> for rain <b>gage</b> and stream sampling stations, which are used with digital elevation data to define polygons representing subwatersheds, vector geometry for the streams, network topology for the interstream connections and flow models, and raster geometry for the elevation surface, land cover, and soils. These requirements provide a test of the basic theoretical structure for geographic features...|$|R
40|$|Concern over {{flooding}} along {{rivers in}} the Prairie Pothole Region has stimulated {{interest in developing}} spatially distributed hydrologic models to simulate the effects of wet¬land water storage on peak river flows. Such models require spatial data on the storage volume and interception area of existing and restorable wetlands in the watershed of interest. In most cases, information on these model inputs is lacking because resolution of existing topographic maps is inadequate to estimate volume and areas of existing and restorable wetlands. Consequently, most studies have relied on wetland area to volume or interception area relationships to estimate wetland basin storage characteristics by using available surface area data obtained as a product from remotely sensed data (e. g., National Wetlands Inventory). Though application of areal input data to estimate volume and interception areas is widely used, {{a drawback is that}} there is little information available to provide guidance regarding the application, limita¬tions, and biases associated with such approaches. Another limitation of previous modeling efforts is that water stored by wetlands within a watershed is treated as a simple lump storage component that is filled prior to routing overflow to a pour <b>point</b> or <b>gaging</b> station. This approach does not account for dynamic wetland processes that influence water stored in prairie wetlands. Further, most models have not considered the influence of human-induced hydrologic changes, such as land use, that greatly influence quantity of surface water inputs and, ultimately, the rate that a wetland basin fills and spills. The goals of this study were to (1) develop and improve methodologies for estimating and spatially depicting wet-land storage volumes and interceptions areas and (2) develop models and approaches for estimating/simulating the water storage capacity of potentially restorable and existing wetlands under various restoration, land use, and climatic scenarios. To address these goals, we developed models and approaches to spatially represent storage volumes and interception areas of existing and potentially restorable wetlands in the upper Mustinka subbasin within Grant County, Minn. We then developed and applied a model to simulate wetland water storage increases that would result from restoring 25 and 50 percent of the farmed and drained wetlands in the upper Mustinka subbasin. The model simulations were performed during the growing season (May–October) for relatively wet (1993; 0. 67 m of precipitation) and dry (1987; 0. 32 m of precipitation) years. Results from the simulations indicated that the 25 percent restoration scenario would increase water storage by 27 – 32 percent and that a 50 percent scenario would increase storage by 53 – 63 percent. Additionally, we estimated that wetlands in the subbasin have potential to store 11. 57 – 20. 98 percent of the total precipitation that fell over the entire subbasin area (52, 758 ha). Our simulation results indicated that there is considerable potential to enhance water storage in the subbasin; however, evaluation and calibration of the model is necessary before simulation results can be applied to management and planning decisions. In this report we present guidance for the development and application of models (e. g., surface area-volume predictive models, hydrology simulation model) to simulate wetland water storage to provide a basis from which to understand and predict the effects of natural or human-induced hydrologic alterations. In developing these approaches, we tried to use simple and widely available input data to simulate wetland hydrology and predict wetland water storage for a specific precipitation event or a series of events. Further, the hydrol¬ogy simulation model accounted for land use and soil type, which influence surface water inputs to wetlands. Although information presented in this report is specific to the Mustinka subbasin, the approaches and methods developed should be applicable to other regions in the Prairie Pothole Region...|$|R
