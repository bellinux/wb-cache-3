Monetary returns of camel husbandry are low but, {{on the other}} hand, it is an ecologically sound, long-term, sustainable strategy for arid land exploitation. Scientists have presented evidence that camel grazing is beneficial for range vegetation (Gauthier-Pilters, 1984) and it appears likely that camel husbandry might discard some of the ecologically destructive effects of monocropping in sensitive environments throughout Sudan.|$|E
25|$|In this <b>production</b> <b>technique,</b> {{which is}} still the major {{industrial}} route to citric acid used today, cultures of A. niger are fed on a sucrose or glucose-containing medium to produce citric acid. The source of sugar is corn steep liquor, molasses, hydrolyzed corn starch or other inexpensive sugary solutions. After the mold is filtered out of the resulting solution, citric acid is isolated by precipitating it with calcium hydroxide to yield calcium citrate salt, from which citric acid is regenerated by treatment with sulfuric acid, as in the direct extraction from citrus fruit juice.|$|E

An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalized designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using 3D Modelling Software.|$|E

25|$|From around 70 AD {{colourless}} glass becomes the predominant material for fine wares, and the cheaper glasses move towards pale shades of blue, green, and yellow. Debate continues whether {{this change in}} fashion indicates a change in attitude that placed glass as individual material of merit no longer required to imitate precious stones, ceramics, or metal, or whether the shift to {{colourless glass}} indicated an attempt to mimic highly prized rock crystal. Pliny's Natural History states that “the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, {{as closely as possible}} resembling rock crystal” (36, 192), which is thought to support this last position, as is evidence for the persistence of casting as a <b>production</b> <b>technique,</b> which produced the thickly walled vessels necessary to take the pressure of extensive cutting and polishing associated with crystal working.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his <b>production</b> <b>technique.</b> Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
500|$|Author Mark Brend writes that, with Revolver, the Beatles {{advanced}} Meek's {{strategy of}} employing {{the recording studio}} as a musical instrument and [...] "formalized this approach into what is now an accepted option for pop music making". A key <b>production</b> <b>technique</b> they used was automatic double tracking (ADT), which EMI technical engineer Ken Townsend invented on 6 April. This technique employed two linked tape recorders to automatically create a doubled vocal track. The standard method had been to double the vocal by singing the same piece twice onto a multitrack tape, a task Lennon particularly disliked. The Beatles were delighted with the invention, and used it extensively on Revolver. ADT soon became a standard pop <b>production</b> <b>technique,</b> and led to related developments such as the artificial chorus effect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze whether {{regional}} economic integration across U. S. states conditions local labor-market adjustment. We examine the mechanisms through which states absorb changes in labor supplies and whether industry <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> are similar across states. There are two main findings. First, states absorb changes in employment primarily through changes in <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> that are common across all states and through changes in the output of traded goods, with the former mechanism playing the larger role. In contrast, state-specific changes in <b>production</b> <b>techniques,</b> which are one indication of state-specific changes in relative factor prices, account for relatively little factor absorption. Second, industry <b>production</b> <b>techniques</b> are very similar across states, especially for neighboring states and states with similar relative labor supplies. Both sets of {{results are consistent with}} productivity-adjusted FPE across either all states or groupings of related states...|$|R

500|$|Vocal {{production}} in Peking opera is {{conceived of as}} being composed of [...] "four levels of song": songs with music, verse recitation, prose dialogue, and non-verbal vocalizations. The conception of a sliding scale of vocalization creates a sense of smooth continuity between songs and speech.

500|$|... "Let It Down" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released on}} his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs the latter's Wall of Sound <b>production</b> <b>technique</b> to lavish effect. Its brash opening and choruses contrast with the ethereal quality of the verses – a loud/soft approach that has been credited with influencing indie bands during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

The record expanded on their previous work's traditional R influences with live instrumentation and balladry. Music journalists have noted the album's incorporation of traditional and contemporary sensibilities, themes of love and romance, and witty, sensitive lyrics. Tony! Toni!

Whatever one thinks of the over-the-top bravado rapping, the tracks and beats Dre assembled are beyond reproach". The Chronic brought G-funk to the mainstream – a genre defined by slow bass beats and melodic synthesizers, topped by P-Funk samples, female vocals, and a laconic, laid-back lyrical delivery referred to as a [...] "lazy drawl". The album takes its name from a slang term for premium grade cannabis, chronic. The album cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. Robert Christgau said that, although he [...] "can't stand" [...] it, he respects The Chronic [...] "for its influence and iconicity".|$|E
