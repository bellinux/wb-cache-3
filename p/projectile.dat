It uses the same lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max <b>projectile</b> as the SS196SR, but it is loaded for a muzzle velocity roughly 30-m/s (100ft/s) higher. The <b>projectile</b> has a blue-colored polymer tip instead of the red color used in the SS196 <b>projectile</b> tip. The SS197 has been manufactured by Fiocchi, under contract for FN Herstal, since 2006 and it is distributed in the United States by Federal Cartridge Company.|$|E

5|$|The 5.7×28mm SS90 {{cartridge}} was discontinued, and replaced, in 1993, {{with the}} 5.7×28mm SS190. The SS190 uses a 2.7-mm (0.11in) shorter <b>projectile</b> with a weight of 2.0g (31grains), which has, when {{fired from the}} P90, a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350ft/s).

5|$|The 5.7×28mm <b>projectile</b> {{potentially}} poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the <b>projectile</b> design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight <b>projectile</b> also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 5.7×28mm cartridge, {{called the}} SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1990. It used a 1.5 gram (23grain) plastic-core <b>projectile,</b> which was propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s or Mach 2.5) when fired from the P90. A United States patent application for the <b>projectile</b> design used in the SS90 was filed by FN's Jean-Paul Denis and Marc Neuforge in 1989. U.S. Patent 5,012,743 ("High-Performance Projectile") was received in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a <b>projectile.</b> The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its <b>projectile</b> leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid <b>projectile</b> was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the <b>projectile.</b> The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a <b>projectile,</b> often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the <b>projectile</b> out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{projectiles}} also changed during the ironclad period. Initially, the best armor-piercing <b>projectile</b> was a solid cast-iron shot. Later, shot of chilled iron, a harder iron alloy, gave better armor-piercing qualities. Eventually the armor-piercing shell was developed.|$|E
5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} <b>projectile</b> usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes.

Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
50|$|Kinetic {{energy is}} a {{function}} of mass and the square of velocity. Generally speaking, it is the intention of the shooter to deliver an adequate amount of energy to the target via the <b>projectiles.</b> <b>Projectiles</b> such as rifle bullets, high velocity handgun bullets and shotgun slugs can over-penetrate. <b>Projectiles</b> such as handgun bullets and shot can under-penetrate. <b>Projectiles</b> that reach the target with too low a velocity or bird shot may not penetrate at all. All the above conditions affect energy transfer.|$|R
50|$|The brakes {{are changed}} {{depending}} on the recoil force of the rounds being fired. Lighter <b>projectiles</b> require less recoil reduction from the brake to allow the action to cycle. Therefore, the one-hole brake is used for firing high-explosive <b>projectiles,</b> which are much lighter than the armour-piercing variety. The AP <b>projectiles</b> require the 5-hole brake.|$|R
