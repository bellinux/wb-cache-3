5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Cardiac {{rehabilitation}} (CR) {{is widely}} underutilized because of multiple factors including physician referral practices. Previous {{research has shown}} CR referral varies by type of provider, with cardiologists more likely to refer than <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to compare factors affecting CR referral in <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> versus cardiac specialists. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of a stratified random sample of 510 <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> and cardiac specialists (cardiologists or cardiovascular surgeons) in Ontario identified through the Canadian Medical Directory Online was administered. One hundred four <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> and 81 cardiac specialists responded to the 26 - item investigator-generated survey examining medical, demographic, attitudinal, and health system factors affecting CR referral. RESULTS: <b>Primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> were more likely to endorse lack of familiarity with CR site locations (P<. 001), lack of standardized referral forms (P<. 001), inconvenience (P=. 04), program quality (P=. 004), and lack of discharge communication from CR (P=. 001) as factors negatively impacting CR referral practices than cardiac specialists. Cardiac specialists were significantly more likely to perceive that their colleagues and department would regularly refer patients to CR than <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> (P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Where differences emerged, <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> were more likely to perceive factors that would impede CR referral, some of which are modifiable. Marketing CR site locations, provision of standardized referral forms, and ensuring discharge summaries are communicated to <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> may improve their willingness to refer to CR.

25|$|A <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>{{physician}}</b> is {{a physician}} who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis.

We sought to determine rates of physician-reported {{communication between}} <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> and specialists, the clinical impact of communication or its absence, and patient- and practice system-level determinants of communication for a cohort of children referred to specialty care. METHODS: We enrolled 179 patients newly referred from general pediatricians in 30 community practices to 15 pediatric medical specialists in 5 specialties. <b>Primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> and specialists completed questionnaires at the first specialty visit and 6 months later.

25|$|A set {{of skills}} and scope of {{practice}} may define a <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician,</b> generally including basic {{diagnosis and treatment of}} common illnesses and medical conditions. Diagnostic techniques include interviewing the patient to collect information on the present symptoms, prior medical history and other health details, followed by a physical examination. Many PCPs are trained in basic medical testing, such as interpreting results of blood or other patient samples, electrocardiograms, or x-rays. More complex and time-intensive diagnostic procedures are usually obtained by referral to specialists, with special training with a technology or increased experience and patient volume that make a risky procedure safer for the patient. After collecting data, the PCP arrives at a differential diagnosis and, with the participation of the patient, formulates a plan including (if appropriate) components of further testing, specialist referral, medication, therapy, diet or life-style changes, patient education, and follow up results of treatment.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} HMOs—no matter {{whether a person}} is on Medicare or not—persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO cannot use certain {{specialist}} physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans—HMO or otherwise—the beneficiary must choose a <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> (PCP) who will provide the referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, {{this can be a}} problem {{for people who want to}} use out of network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while in the hospital. Enrolling in a Medicare Advantage PPO, if available, can help solve this dilemma, because many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense. By law, however, if a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialist that are not available or provided by any in-network facility or specialist's office, the Medicare Advantage plan will pay for the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charge in-network cost-sharing to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary should still make sure he or she has authorization however).|$|E
25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
