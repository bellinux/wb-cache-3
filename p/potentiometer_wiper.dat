40|$|The {{report by}} the Apollo 16 crew that the lunar roving vehicle rear {{steering}} was inoperative during the initial drive from the vehicle's deployment site was investigated. The malfunction, and the steering system are described. It is concluded that an open circuit occurred either in the hand controller potentiometer or between the <b>potentiometer</b> <b>wiper</b> and the summing node...|$|E
40|$|The {{inoperative}} {{condition of}} the rear steering system of the lunar roving vehicle (Apollo 16) during the initial drive to the modular equipment stowage assembly was investigated. The front and rear steering systems are described, and the failure analyzed. It is concluded that an open circuit must have occurred either in the hand controller potentiometer or between the <b>potentiometer</b> <b>wiper</b> and the summing node...|$|E
50|$|See drawing. Many {{inexpensive}} potentiometers {{are constructed}} with a resistive element (B) formed into an arc {{of a circle}} usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled. Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case. The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel <b>potentiometers,</b> the <b>wiper</b> is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn <b>potentiometers,</b> this <b>wiper</b> typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.|$|R
