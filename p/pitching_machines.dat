50|$|The use of <b>pitching</b> <b>machines</b> allows {{baseball}} and softball players {{the opportunity to}} get batting practice on their own. Most batting machines are set up in a batting cage, a netted area that will contain the balls after they are hit. By using a pitching machine and a batting cage, hitters can get a huge number of batting reps without having to drag other players out to a baseball field or wear out the arms of team pitchers or coaches. The cost of <b>pitching</b> <b>machines</b> varies greatly.|$|E
50|$|Consisting of four {{professional}} baseball fields and one practice infield, the quadrapelex also includes batting tunnels, pitching mounds, hitting tunnels, masters <b>pitching</b> <b>machines,</b> and ten bullpens. All fields are equipped for night play.|$|E
50|$|A batter {{stands at}} one end of the cage, with a <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> (or, less often, a human pitcher) at the {{opposing}} end. The pitcher or <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> <b>pitches</b> baseballs to the batter, who hits them. It is recommended to use a protective pitcher's L-screen to prevent batted balls from striking the pitcher or machine.|$|R

40|$|Many {{researches}} have debated {{that the}} current 2 -wire drop test method (AS/NZS 4499. 1 : 1997 and AS/NZS 2512. 3. 2 : 1997) for cricket helmets does not adequately represent the dynamics of a real ball-helmet impact for fast, elite and express bowlers. This paper presents a new <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> test method that was developed to measure the impact performance of cricket helmets. A series of accelerometers were positioned at the centre of gravity (CG) of the test headform to measure the linear accelerations in x-, y- and z-directions due to impact by a cricket ball. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) was calculated based on the resulting head acceleration (Hres), and impact duration. When compared with the bare headform impacts, the tested helmets were able to reduce the Hres by 25 % and 60 % for the 2 -wire drop test and <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> respectively. Similarly, the tested helmets reduced the HIC values by about 82 % and 83 % for the 2 -wire drop test and <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> respectively. However, the Hres and HIC values measured using the 2 -wire drop tests were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those measured using the <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> test. These differences were attributed largely to {{the differences in the}} masses of the test apparatus and the resultant impact energy, which was calculated based on the measured impact velocities and impactor mass. The repeatability of results obtained from the <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> may, however, be degraded at high velocity impacts due to the test set- up. For the time being, the developed <b>pitching</b> <b>machine</b> test is intended to supplement, but not to replace, the currently accepted cricket helmet standard test method...|$|R

50|$|Rickey {{continued}} to innovate {{in his time}} with Brooklyn. He {{was responsible for the}} first full-time spring training facility, in Vero Beach, Florida, and encouraged the use of now-commonplace tools such as the batting cage, <b>pitching</b> <b>machines,</b> and batting helmets. He also pioneered the use of statistical analysis in baseball (what is now known as sabermetrics), when he hired statistician Allan Roth as a full-time analyst for the Dodgers in 1947. After viewing Roth's evidence, Rickey promoted the idea that on-base percentage was a more important hitting statistic than batting average. While working under Rickey, Roth was also the first person to provide statistical evidence that platoon effects were real and quantifiable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pitching</b> <b>{{machines}}</b> come in {{a variety}} of styles. However, the two most popular machines are an arm action machine and a circular wheel machine. The arm action machine simulates the delivery of a pitcher and carries a ball at the end of a bracket, much like a hand would. The arm action machine then delivers the ball in an overhand motion. The circular wheel machine contains one, two or three wheels that spin much like a bike tire. The wheels on these machines are usually set in either a horizontal or vertical fashion. With a circular machine, a ball shoots out towards the hitter after it is fed into the wheel or wheels. Three wheel machines are more easily adjusted to be able to throw a variety of pitches and they can be used for a wide range of other practice scenarios, such as ground work or flyballs.|$|E
40|$|It is vey {{difficult}} to change simultaneously the pitching speeds and the course in the usual used <b>pitching</b> <b>machines</b> of the arm type and the two rollers type.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} <b>pitching</b> <b>machines</b> are the “two rpllers” type {{and also the}} “arm” type. There machines tend to have certain limitations. In particular {{it is very difficult}} to simultaneously change both ball speed and direction. Also some type of pitches, such as the curve or sinking ball, are not easily achieved. In this study, the hardware and software design of a new “intelligent” pitching machine which is able to pitch repeatably with selectable speed, direction and ball rotation, is presented. The machine had three rollers and the motion of each was independantly controlled by a heirarchical neural network. This network accepted ball speed, direction and rotation as inputs and produced detailed motion control of the three rollers as output...|$|E
40|$|Pitching {{machine is}} widely used in venues ranging from {{professional}} baseball stadiums to batting centers. However, the throw performance of the <b>pitching</b> <b>machines</b> {{that have been developed}} so far for use during batting practice is not very high. Pitches such as the fastball, curveball and screwball are easily achieved by the pitching machine with three rollers which were developed by the authors. In this study, the moving behavior and contact stress state of the ball pitched with the three rollers type pitching machine is analyzed using dynamic finite element analysis software (ANSYS/LSDYNA). The effect of the seam of a baseball to the throw accuracy is analyzed numerically. In the analysis, the finite element models of a detailed baseball with a seam and a pitching machine with three rollers are used. Additionally, convex and concave rollers are made and those are analyzed. From the analytical results, it is understood that the convex roller is higher than other rollers in throw accuracy. The convex roller geometry is optimized, and the optimum conditions (shapes and material properties) of the convex roller are decided. Moreover, the validity of the condition is confirmed by the throw experiment. 全文公開 20091...|$|E
