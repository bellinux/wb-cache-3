5|$|The {{architecture}} of Conwy has close to links to {{that found in}} the kingdom of Savoy in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of <b>putlog</b> holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. The links between Conwy and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Conwy project.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of <b>putlog</b> holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|E

25|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A bank of earth appears to have been erected some distance away {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or perhaps to obscure the castle from a former road that ran past it from that direction. The towers seem not to have had ground-floor entrances. <b>Putlog</b> holes suggest that they had upper floors. <b>Putlog</b> holes in the curtain walls suggest the presence of hoardings to protect defenders.

500|$|The barbican {{was built}} at the {{beginning}} of the 14th century and contained a guard-room on the first floor. The barbican contains numerous <b>putlog</b> holes from its construction, although these would have been masked by exterior plasterwork in the medieval period. A passageway led up from the barbican to the gatehouse, probably originally guarded by a drawbridge and containing the accommodation for the castle's constable.|$|E
500|$|Cow Tower is {{a three-story}} {{circular}} {{building with a}} protruding turret, the main building being [...] across and [...] tall, tapering towards the top. Its walls, [...] thick at the base, are made of a core of flint stone, faced {{on the inside and}} outside with brick, and various <b>putlog</b> holes can still be seen in the walls. The turret, which contained a spiral staircase, would originally have been higher than the parapets, forming a look-out position. The walls rest on a stone plinth and several layers of mortared flint.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the word is uncertain, but may have been {{borrowed}} attributively from the term used to describe a horizontal timber in a scaffolding, lying parallel to {{the face of the}} building and supporting the <b>putlogs.</b> There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French léger, meaning [...] "light" [...] or [...] "slight" [...] The Oxford online dictionary describes the {{origin of the}} [...] "leger" [...] spelling as a [...] "variant of ledger" [...] that first appeared in the 19th century [...]|$|R

50|$|This {{fortress}} {{consists of}} three concentric enclosures set on red sandstone outcrops (micaceous of buntsandstein), which were partially chopped and modified to improve the defense. This sandstone (Rodeno), as megaliths, as ashlar, or as masonry walls settled with lime mortars or gypsum, is the mainly used material {{in the construction of}} the walls on this fortress. The wood was used to a lesser extent and always in beams and <b>putlogs.</b> The natural and intricate terrain secured the defense of the east and north flanks, and for that reason is why the Keep Tower (Torre del Homenaje) is erected in this area. On the west and south sides of the castle two high and thick walls with battlement were built. In the first enclosure, still remain two central elements of the castle: a cistern and two towers. In the second square, enclosed by an imposing wall three meters thick built at right angles, with a side of 70 and another 40 meters, the Weapon Square was established.|$|R
500|$|The castle has a {{rectangular}} plan and {{is divided into}} an Inner and Outer Ward, separated by a cross-wall, with four large, [...] tall towers on each side; originally the castle would have been white-washed using a lime render. The outside of the towers still have the <b>putlog</b> holes from their original construction, where timbers were inserted to create a spiralling ramp for the builders. Although now somewhat decayed, the battlements originally sported triple finial designs and featured a sequence of square holes running along {{the outside of the}} walls. It is uncertain what these holes were used for – they may have been drainage holes, supports for defensive hoarding or for displaying ornamental shields.|$|E
500|$|Eynsford Castle {{originally}} comprised {{an inner}} and an outer bailey, overlooking the River Darwent. The outer bailey lay to the south-east {{of the surviving}} remains of the castle, but {{little is known about}} its shape or the buildings within it. The inner bailey survives as a low earth terrace, or mound, forming an irregular polygon up to [...] across, protected by a curtain wall and a moat. Its curtain wall is [...] high and almost [...] wide, made of coursed flint rubble reinforced with mural timbers, with ironstone slabs in the <b>putlog</b> and drawbar holes used in its construction. It was built in two phases, the first two thirds in the 11th century, and the upper [...] in [...] 1130, in part reusing Roman tiles, and it was equipped with three sets of garderobes. The north side of the wall collapsed in the 19th century, and the terrace edge is stabilised by a modern concrete wall.|$|E
500|$|Architectural {{research}} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries focused less on the military aspects of the fortifications, however, and more on their roles as luxurious palaces and symbols of royal power. Each of the castles {{was designed to be}} suitable to support the royal court, should it visit. In the late 13th century, this meant having several sets of private chambers, discreet service facilities and security arrangements, producing, in effect, a royal palace in miniature. Some of these survive largely intact; Conwy, for example, has what historian Jeremy Ashbee considers to be the [...] "best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales", including a private garden {{for the use of the}} queen. When built, the castles would have been more colourful than today, in keeping with the fashions of the 13th century. At Conwy, for example, the walls were white-washed with a lime render, and the <b>putlog</b> holes in the walls may have been used to display painted shields called targes from the walls.|$|E
5000|$|Duras {{is located}} about twenty {{kilometers}} south and {{it belonged to}} the Dukes {{of the same name}} belonging to the Durfort family. Gageac faced the Dordogne valley and Laforce another stronghold. There may have been animosity between the two Duchies. The original 12th-century fortress was only composed of a square tower - the keep (west side). The keep, which was the only stone building, was defended by wooden fortifications. The entrance is situated on the first floor which is reached by a ladder that was removed when attackers came. They sent carrier pigeons to deter Duras (there are traces of <b>putlogs</b> (nests) over the guard room). This keep is divided into two main parts: one is called the [...] "guard room" [...] located in the highest part, lighted by a window which can be seen on the north side. Its access is by a strange staircase, which was built in the thickness of the walls. The other room is barely lit (only by a basement window), with access from the first floor, and the ground level of the rock is the dungeon or oubliette. It was used as a store for food or weapons, and is entered using the ladder also used to access the tower.|$|R

At Gross-Enzersdorf the walls stand to about six metres with the crenellations still largely intact and the length of standing wall at is about [...] [...] The wall varies in thickness from 90 to 160 centimetres.There are two types of town wall in Austria. The first is the 'narrow' wall which could be used to mount wooden walkways or wehrgang at the back and wooden hords or hoardings at the front. The second is the 'wide' wall, which is on a wider foundation and there is a solid stone wall-walk behind the merlons of the battlement. The line of the supports for former wooden walkways can often be seen on narrow walls by a series of <b>Putlog</b> holes, as at Durnstein. [...] Initially the Merlons are not pierced by arrow or gunshots, but as the 14th century progresses, [...] with the increased use of light artillery, this becomes more usual.|$|E
2500|$|Gross-Enzersdorf(Vienna 22). Groß-Enzersdorf {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{complete}} walled circuits in Lower Austria, although the three gates were finally removed in 1886. The town was originally sited on the former Sachengang Island in the river Danube and is first mentioned in 870 as a 'Meierhof, – probably a royal manor – [...] that was held by the Engelschalk family. This passed to the Bishopric of Passau and in 1202 Groß-Enzersdorf came into the control of the Bishops of Freising. At this time a market is mentioned at Groß-Enzersdorf [...] A charter was granted to the town in 1396 and Bishop of Freising, Berthold of Wehningen, who was also at the time Chancellor of Austria, arranged for a wall to be built, completed in 1399. Builders who had previously been working on St Stephen’s cathedral in Vienna, were brought in and stone and building materials were transported from the Roman site at Carnuntum. During the assault on Vienna in 1529, the Turks conquered and devastated the town. [...] Subsequently, Croats were brought in to resettled the town. The town was again taken by the Turks at the second siege of Vienna in 1683. In the Thirty Years War Swedish cavalry looted and burned the town. In 1809 the town was taken by Napoleonic forces prior to the nearby battle of Aspern.The walls stand to about six metres with the crunulations still largely intact. The length of standing wall is about 2.2 kilometre and the wall varies in thickness from 90 to 160 centimetres. The walls have a row of <b>putlog</b> holes on the outside, below the crenellations, suggesting that a wood hoarding existed, The defences were surrounded by moat, which were partially waterfilled until the early 19th century. The layout of the defended area is irregular, suggesting that additional areas must have been taken in when the wall was built. [...] There is a round tower at the most northern point and the remains of a rectangular tower set into the wall on the NE. [...] The Vischer print of Groß-Enzersdorf of 1672 shows the town from the south looking towards the Wasser or Lobau gate-tower. There were also two other gatetowers, the Wittau on the E and the Raasdorf or Vienna gate on the NE.|$|E

50|$|A {{historically}} {{common type}} of scaffolding, <b>putlog</b> holes date from ancient Roman buildings. The term putlock and the newer term <b>putlog</b> date from the 17th century and are still used today. Putlogs may be supported on the outer ends by vertical poles (standards), cantilevered by one end being firmly embedded in the wall, or cantilevered by penetrating the wall to provide scaffolds on both sides. Putlogs may be sawn off flush with the wall if they cannot be removed, but exterior <b>putlog</b> holes are typically filled in as the scaffold is removed to prevent water from entering the walls. Interior <b>putlog</b> holes may be left open, particularly if not in a finished space.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>putlog</b> couplers (discussed above), there are also <b>putlog</b> tubes. These have a flattened end or have been fitted with a blade. This feature allows {{the end of the}} tube to be inserted into or rest upon the brickwork of the structure.|$|E
