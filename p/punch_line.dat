5|$|As {{the reigning}} most {{valuable}} player, Richard sought a pay raise {{prior to the}} 1947–48 season. General manager Frank Selke refused, even after Richard and team captain Émile Bouchard both sat out the Canadiens' preseason before capitulating and returning to the team when the season began. The <b>Punch</b> <b>line</b> was broken up after Blake suffered a career-ending leg injury. Richard's season also ended early as he missed the final {{games of the season}} due to a knee injury. He finished second in team scoring with 53 points in 53 games, but Montreal missed the playoffs. After recording only 38 points in 1948–49, Richard posted a 65-point campaign the next season and his 43 goals led the NHL for the third time. In 1950–51, Richard scored 42 goals, including his 271st career goal, making him Montreal's all-time goal leader.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{fulfilled}} {{his promise}} to Canadiens' fans as he led Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56. The season began {{with the arrival of}} his young brother Henri to the Canadiens roster. It also marked the return of his former <b>Punch</b> <b>line</b> teammate, Toe Blake, as head coach. Along with general manager Frank Selke, Blake worked with Richard on moderating his temper and responding to the provocation of his opponents by scoring goals rather than engaging in fisticuffs. Richard finished the season with 38 goals and 71 points, second on the team in both respects to Jean Béliveau's 47 goals and 88 points. Richard added 14 points in 10 playoff games as Montreal defeated Detroit to claim the Stanley Cup. He scored the second and ultimately Cup-clinching goal in the fifth and final game, a 3–1 victory.|$|E

25|$|Bisociation: This is a {{technical}} term coined by Arthur Koestler. He {{says that a}} funny text is situated in two different semantic levels. In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In the <b>punch</b> <b>line,</b> the second level comes up so suddenly that they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: I only want your best – your money.|$|E

30|$|Humor {{detection}} {{is critically}} dependent upon resolving incongruities between <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> and expectations {{shaped by the}} storyline (Sul [1972]). Consistent with this notion, frontal regions engaged during humor detection have been implicated in language tasks that encourage the retrieval and appraisal of relevant semantic knowledge (Binder et al. [1997], Price et al. [1999]). Recent studies have indicated further specialization within the left inferior frontal cortex for reconciling ambiguous semantic content with stored knowledge (Gold and Buckner [2002], Thompson-Schill et al. [1997]). Inferior frontal regions may resolve ambiguities between these expectations and <b>punch</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

500|$|As Richard {{approached}} 50 {{goals for}} the season, opposition players resorted to increasingly violent efforts {{to prevent him from}} scoring. He had to fight past slashes, hooks, and even players who draped themselves across his back. Richard went eight games without scoring and began Montreal's final regular season game, March 18, on the road against the Boston Bruins with 49 goals. He finally reached the milestone by scoring with 2:15 remaining in the game, a 4–2 Montreal win. He became the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games, a standard that {{remains one of the most}} celebrated achievements in NHL history.

40|$|According to Suls' (1972) incongruity {{model for}} the {{appreciation}} of jokes, humor with which recipients are familiar should not be perceived as funny because the ending is predictable. Suls (1975) later proposed that familiar humor is appreciated because {{of the sense of}} competence derived from adequately remembering the joke. This study examined Suls' theories by having subjects rate jokes on two occasions and supply their <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> on the second occasion. Statistical significance was determined through the use of the t test for correlated means.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] is an {{evisceration}} of a no-good adolescent male, and {{is directed}} towards an ex-boyfriend. About the song's theme, Sean Dooley of About.com commented, [...] "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest {{to make a}} former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." [...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: [...] "There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." [...] For the refrains, she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical <b>punch</b> <b>line,</b> [...] "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn".

[...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for {{a friend of mine who}} liked jokes".

500|$|Rand and {{her works}} have been {{referred}} to {{in a variety of}} media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as in movies and video games.

A 1997 documentary film, , was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature. The Passion of Ayn Rand, a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards.

In contrast, funny <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> evoke the smallest N 400 m during this initial lexical–semantic stage, consistent with their primed “surface congruity ” with the setup question.
