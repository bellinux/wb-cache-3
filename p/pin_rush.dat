40|$|Background & Objectives: Pediatric forearm bone {{fractures}} {{are common}} orthopedic injuries. Generally, these fractures can be successfully managed with closed reduction and casting however operative fixation may be required. Currently, {{the most common}} operative interventions are open reduction with plate fixation versus closed or open reduction with intramedullary fixation. Intramedullary fixation materials include Steinmann <b>pins,</b> Kirschner-wires, <b>Rush</b> <b>pins,</b> and elastic titanium nails. To demonstrate the outcome of Intramedullary Stainless steel <b>Rush</b> <b>pins</b> {{for the treatment of}} Pediatric diaphyseal forearm bone fracture. Materials & Methods: This study included thirty children with diaphyseal forearm bone fracture treated with intramedullary stainless steel <b>rush</b> <b>pin.</b> Patient’s age, sex, side, mode of injury, fracture type, fixation indication and method, time of clinical and radiological union, complication rate and final range of motion were evaluated at subsequent follow up­. Clinical evaluation was done as per Price’s criteria. Results: Among 30 patients there were 22 boys (73. 3 %)  and 8 girls (26. 6 %) {{with a mean age of}} 11. 8 years (Range, 5 to 14 years). Twenty (66. 6 %) patients had right forearm fracture, 10 (33. 3 %) patients had left forearm fracture. Union was obtained in a mean of 6. 5 ± 1. 0 weeks (range 6 to 9 weeks). According to the criteria of Price et al. an excellent result was achieved in 25 patients (83. 3 %) and a good result in five patients (16. 6 %). Out of total 30 patients six (20 %) had minor complications. Conclusion: Fixation with intramedullary stainless steel <b>rush</b> <b>pin</b> produces good to excellent results in diaphyseal forearm bone fractures in children. Based on our experience, <b>rush</b> <b>pins</b> are simple, safe, easily available and affordable to most of the patients in developing countries. JCMS Nepal. 2016; 12 (2) : 50 - 4 </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Both bone {{diaphysis}} {{fracture of}} forearm {{is common in}} children of hilly area in Nepal because the children climbs tree and cliff for playing and cutting grass. Close reduction and casting is the preferred method of treatment these fractures but the chances of re-displacement is very high.

30|$|Fractures of the {{clavicle}} {{account for}} 2.6 – 4  % of all adult fractures, 35  % of all injuries {{to the shoulder}} girdle, and 69 – 82  % of these fractures occur in the middle-third [1, 2]. Displacement occurs in about 73  % of all midshaft clavicle fractures [2]. The average age of patients sustaining a midshaft clavicular fracture is 33  years; 70  % of the patients are male [3]. A fall or a direct blow to the shoulder, giving an axial compressive force on the clavicle, {{is the most common}} trauma mechanism of injury for any clavicular fracture [4, 5]. Displaced midshaft fractures have traditionally been treated non-operatively because of early reports suggesting that clavicular nonunions were very rare and clavicular mal-union, being of radiographic interest only, was without clinical importance [6, 7]. However, recent studies have found higher rates of delayed union, nonunion, shoulder pain, and shoulder weakness and residual pain with non-operative treatment [8]. The indications for surgery include the need for earlier functional mobilization in the patient with an isolated injury, in addition to open fractures, floating shoulders and patients with polytrauma [9]. For operative treatment, the available methods of fixation are fixation with Kirschner wires, <b>pins</b> (<b>Rush</b> <b>pin,</b> Knowles pin, Rockwood pin), plates with screws and external fixation [10 – 12].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Femoral {{fractures}} {{are common}} in children between 2 and 12 years of age, and 75 % of the lesions affect the femoral shaft.

30|$|The best {{treatment}} {{strategy for}} displaced midshaft clavicle fractures remains {{a topic of}} debate. Conservative management of these fractures results in an approximately 5  % nonunion rate [4]. While non-operative management remains the mainstay of treatment for most midshaft clavicle fractures, the indications for surgery may be expanding. Recent studies have showed a poorer outcome in cases of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures that were treated non-operatively [8, 18, 19] in comparison to surgically treated patients [16, 20, 21]. Three types of fixation are available for middle-third clavicle fractures: intramedullary devices, plates, and external fixators. Intramedullary fixation {{can be done by}} smooth or threaded K- wires, Steinman pins, Knowles <b>pins,</b> Hagie <b>pins,</b> <b>Rush</b> <b>pins</b> or cannulated screws [22 – 24]. Plate fixation can be done with a 3.5 -mm dynamic compression plate (DCP), low-contact dynamic compression plates, reconstruction plates or locking compression plates with at least three screws (six cortices) in both the medial and lateral fragment each, and an interfragmentary lag screw whenever the fracture pattern allows it. Plating of acute clavicle fractures is advocated as the preferred fixation method by many authors [15, 25, 26]. Biomechanically, plate fixation is superior to intramedullary fixation because it better resists the bending and torsional forces that occur during elevation of the upper extremity above shoulder level [27]. Patients treated with plate fixation can be allowed full range of motion once their soft tissues have healed. Disadvantages of plate fixation include the necessity for increased exposure and soft-tissue stripping, increased risk of damage to the supraclavicular nerve, slightly higher infection rates, and the risk of refracture after plate removal [7]. Currently, open reduction and internal fixation with a 3.5 -mm dynamic compression plate [28, 29] is the standard method; however, intramedullary fixation [16, 30] is an equally effective alternative. In this study, both methods of fixation were compared in terms of outcomes and complications.|$|R

30|$|Operative {{treatment}} of displaced MSCFs {{can be achieved}} successfully using plates [1, 22] or intramedullary (IM) implants like <b>Rush</b> <b>pins</b> [7], Kirschner wires [19], or nails [20]. However, {{the use of the}} later rigid IM implants resulted in serious complications, such as intrathoracic migration and damage to the underlying structures [16, 21]. Recently, Jubel et al. [13] introduced a new IM nailing technique in which a single titanium elastic nail (TEN) is inserted in an antegrade manner from the sternal end of the clavicle to fix those fractures. He reported fewer complications and a higher rate of fracture healing than those previously reported with the use of rigid IM implants. Rehm et al. [24] treated 136 displaced MSCFs successfully using the same antegrade fixation technique with a single TEN. However, a risk of iatrogenic perforation of the lateral cortex in 5 patients was reported.|$|R
40|$|In general, clavicular midshaft {{fractures}} {{are treated}} nonoperatively with immobilization and closed reduction if necessary. Surgery is indicated for (1) completely displaced fractures, (2) potential skin perforation, (3) shortening of the clavicle {{by more than}} 2 cm, (4) neurovascular injury, and (5) floating shoulder. 3 - 5, 9, 10, 15, 17, 28 The gold standard for operative treatment is plate fixation, which involves open reduction of the fracture through a large skin incision. 4, 5, 31 Intramedullary nailing of the clavicle has existed for more than 50 years. 25, 30 A variety of pin fixation devices, such as Rockwood pins, 27 Kirschner wires, 28 Küntschner nails, 22 and <b>Rush</b> <b>pins,</b> have been used so far. 29 However, different implant-related problems have prevented their wide-spread use. 28 One main problem is the migration of pins, which {{have been found in}} the aorta, lung, spinal canal, and head. 8, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24 The titanium elastic nail (TEN) has been used successfully in treating pediatric fractures, applying a minimally invasive technique with excellent functional and cosmetic outcomes. 1, 6, 7 What makes the TEN unique {{is the fact that it}} can block itself in the bone and is therefore firmly anchored in the s-shaped clavicle.

30|$|In a {{retrospective}} study done by Wu et al. [37], comparison between plating and intramedullary nailing {{for the treatment}} of clavicular nonunion showed an 18.2  % nonunion rate with plating compared with 11.1  % for nailing, the difference being attributed to the nailʼs resistance to compressive stresses. The authors concluded that plating provides better rotational stability. Several other studies have found intramedullary fixation to be equally effective as plating, especially {{for the treatment of}} nonunion [38, 39]. Refracture after implant removal and major revision surgery just tended to prevail more often after plate fixation, while implant failure was more common in EIN groups. Major revision procedures were done in EIN groups due to implant failure, while in plating groups it was due to refracture after implant removal. Minor revision surgeries were common in EIN groups for problems like medial protrusion causing irritation or skin perforation. Major complications described in the literature for other modes of intramedullary fixation of clavicle fractures (Kirschner wire, <b>Rush</b> <b>pin</b> etc.), like injury to neurovascular structures and implant migration into the chest cavity [40, 41] were not observed in our study. No such complication has been described in the literature using TENs in clavicle fractures [16]. Implant removal in the plating group needed another surgery done under general anesthesia, and a large-sized incision was made, while in the EIN group the nail was removed as an outdoor procedure under local anesthesia and a small incision over the tip of the nail was made. This was another advantage of intramedullary flexible nailing over plating.|$|R

Volunteering to lead his squad up a hill, with meager cover against murderous fire from the enemy, Sergeant First Class BRITTIN ordered his squad to give him support and, in the face of withering fire and bursting shells, he tossed a grenade at the nearest enemy position. On returning to his squad, he was knocked down and wounded by an enemy grenade. Refusing medical attention, he replenished his supply of grenades and returned, hurling grenades into hostile positions and shooting the enemy as they fled. When his weapon jammed, he leaped without hesitation into a foxhole and killed the occupants with his bayonet and the butt of his rifle. He continued to wipe out foxholes and, noting that his squad had been <b>pinned</b> down, he <b>rushed</b> to the rear of a machinegun position, threw a grenade into the nest, and ran around to its front, where he killed all three occupants with his rifle. Less than 100 yards up the hill, his squad again came under vicious fire from another camouflaged, sandbagged, machinegun nest well-flanked by supporting riflemen. Sergeant First Class BRITTIN again charged this new position in an aggressive endeavor to silence this remaining obstacle and ran direct into a burst of automatic fire which killed him instantly. In his sustained and driving action, he had killed 20 enemy soldiers and destroyed four automatic weapons. The conspicuous courage, consummate valor, and noble self-sacrifice displayed by Sergeant First Class BRITTIN enabled his inspired company to attain its objective and reflect the highest glory on himself and the heroic traditions of the military service.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-2013, Rush {{once again}} began teasing a {{possible}} rudo turn {{as the crowd}} reaction to him grew more and more negative. Despite officially being a técnico, Rush was now referred to as [...] "the most hated wrestler in CMLL". On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, <b>Rush</b> <b>pinned</b> Negro Casas to win a six-man tag team match, while holding the ring ropes, a move commonly associated with rudos. On October 8, Rush and La Máscara defeated Atlantis and La Sombra in the finals of a tournament to become the number one contenders to the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. On October 18, Rush and La Máscara were awarded the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, when Rey Bucanero, {{one half of the}} previous champions, was unable to defend the title due to an injury. Rush then began feuding with one half of the previous champions, NJPW representative Tama Tonga. After losing to Tonga in a singles match on November 1, Rush and La Máscara successfully defended the CMLL World Tag Team Championship against Tonga and El Terrible on November 8, after Rush faked taking a low blow from Tonga. On November 12, Rush received another shot at the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, but once again failed in his attempt to dethrone longtime rival El Terrible. Rush then resumed his rivalry with Negro Casas, pinning him following a low blow in a six-man tag team match on November 15, after which he accepted Casas' challenge for a Hair vs. Hair match between the two. In January 2014, Rush returned to Japan {{to take part in the}} five-day Fantastica Mania 2014 tour. For the entire tour, Rush feuded with Shinsuke Nakamura, culminating in a singles rematch between the two at the fourth event on January 18, where Nakamura was victorious. Back in CMLL, Rush started another rivalry with Shocker, a longtime técnico, who turned rudo just so he could go up against Rush. On February 18, Rush, La Máscara and Titán lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to La Peste Negra (El Felino, Mr. Niebla and Negro Casas). Rush, Casas and Shocker had agreed to a three-way Lucha de Apuestas, but Casas was forced to pull out of the match, set for March 21, declaring that he would face the winner at a later date. On March 21 at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, Rush defeated Shocker for his fourth Lucha de Apuestas win.|$|R
