We predict that many incumbents, <b>particularly</b> <b>stronger</b> firms, {{will participate in}} alliances with other firms before their standalone entry. The alliances {{will be used to}} realize part of the value of specialized assets and to gain information about the emerging products and markets. We support the predictions with evidence from the U.

This study examines whether deficits are inflationary or not {{in the presence of}} dependent central bank and fragile financial markets. A panel dataset has been used for eleven Asian countries from 1981 to 2010.

We find that VC has a significantly positive effect onCEO compensation and the pay-performance relationship, such effect <b>particularly</b> <b>stronger</b> infirms needing more managerial efforts and discretions (higher growth opportunity or higherlevels of capital expenditure). In addition, we show that VC-backed firms with moremanagerial discretions {{are more likely to}} use stock options. The evidence suggests thatventure capital investors use more sensitive compensation contract for top executives inChinese when the need for managerial discretion is greater. Such compensation schemes byVCs enhance firm performance subsequently...|$|R

40|$|By easing {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} short-term contracts, the 30 / 2003 act represents contemporaneously the more extensive and the more radical policy aimed at introducing flexibility in the Italian labour market. By virtue of a difference-in-differences estimator, the paper provides an estimate {{of the impact of the}} 30 / 2003 reform on the wage gap across fixed-term and long-term employees. It will be given evidence that the policy has widened the wage differentials and the effect is <b>particularly</b> <b>stronger</b> to skilled workers compared with unskilled workers. These findings would suggest the existence of a possible brand-new form of wage inequality. Copyright 2010 CEIS, Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation {{is carried}} out to study the wakefield and stopping power for a hydrogen ion beam pulse with low drift velocity propagation in hydrogen plasmas. The plasma {{is assumed to be}} collisionless, uniform, non-magnetized, and in a steady state. Both the pulse ions and plasma particles are treated by the PIC method. The effects of the beam density on the wakefield and stopping power are then obtained and discussed. It is found that as the beam densities increase, the oscillation wakefield induced by the beam become stronger. Besides, the first oscillation wakefield behind the bunch is <b>particularly</b> <b>stronger</b> than others. Moreover, it is found that the stationary stopping power increases linearly with the increase of the beam density in the linear/semilinear region. </span...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effect of touch on consumers’ attitudes toward products being touched. Results of two studies show that allowing consumers to touch products increases their attitudes toward them through two alternative mechanisms, {{depending on the type}} of product. For instrumental products, i. e., those that might be touched for diagnostic reasons, touch increases the perceived ease of using them, and, in so doing improves attitude. For autotelic products, i. e., those that might be touched to experience pleasing sensations, touch increases sensory enjoyment, and thus attitude. These effects are <b>particularly</b> <b>stronger</b> for consumers with a chronically high instrumental and autotelic need for touch, respectively. In addition to adding to the growing literature on touch, this research has practical implications for marketers of these two types of products...|$|R

The Grail maidens become angels, there is a constant relationship between the knights and religious symbolism; most importantly, the Fisher King is replicated as a priest-like figure In the case of Sone de Nausay by Robert de Boron, Bron (the Fisher King) is part of a tale in which the story makes a constant correlation between the Gospel narrative and the history of the grail.|$|R

5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century.

The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{develop a}} dynamic model of {{intermediate}} goods trade {{in which the}} pattern {{and the extent of}} intermediate goods trade are endogenous. We consider a small open economy whose nal good production employs an endogenous array of intermediate goods, from low technology (high cost) to high technology (low cost). The underlying intermediate goods technology evolves over time. We allow for endogenous markups and consider the e¤ect of trade policy on both the intensive and extensive margins. We show that either domestic or foreign trade liberalization reduces the range of exports and the range of domestic intermediate goods production. Either type of trade liberalization reduces intermediate producer markups and increases 8 ̆ 5 nal good output and average productivity, with <b>particularly</b> <b>stronger</b> positive productivity e¤ects for newly imported intermediate inputs. However, domestic trade liberalization results in lower aggregate and average technology for domestic intermediate good producers...|$|R
