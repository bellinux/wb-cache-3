But the void clogging lessens its durable function. So in this paper appropriate clogging agent was choose, and seepage coefficients were tested by using asphalt mixture pavement surface permeameter to simulation multi-cycle drainage clogging test. The influence of asphalt mixture design parameter such as the porosity, the maximum sizes of the aggregate, gradation and asphalt on the drainage and counter-clogging ability of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalts</b> was researched. The tests indicated that the porosity has an obvious influence on both porous asphalts’ permeable ability and counter-clogging ability. Comparing the specimen of 21 % void to the ones of 16 % void, the drain ability is improved 49. 8 %, the counter-clogging ability is improved 55. 0 %. The maximum sizes of the aggregate has an obvious influence on porous asphalts’ counter-clogging ability, but no an obvious influence on the drain ability. Comparing the specimen of 16 mm to the 13 mm, the counterclogging ability is proved 48 %. PAC with the coarser graduation has a better performance on drain and counter-clogging ability.

The research evaluated the capacity of these fibres to reduce the fragility of the bituminous mixture, which is made more elastic and resistant to impacts, increasing resistance to fatigue and traffic abrasion. The experimentation was conducted using mechanical laboratory tests on samples obtained by two different compaction methods: Marshall and gyratory.

The test pavements in D were subjected to both optical 3 D measurements of surface texture parameters and the continuous close-proximity method monitoring of the noise emission. The test pavements had significant noise reduction and very low changes in acoustical properties over time, and when compared to other common types of surface layers they showed the highest noise-reducing capacity. On the basis of the research results and past experience, recommendation on the specification according to the relevant European standards was developed, thus contributing to the adoption of European specifications for noise-reducing asphalt pavements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} framework {{allowing for}} analyses on standard products, such as dense hot-mix asphalt, must be completed to analyse the behaviour of <b>porous</b> cold-mix <b>asphalts.</b> Such soft materials {{need time to}} stabilise its performances and short-term loading can drive to large deterioration of the applied layer. The effects of wheel tread turning and rubbing on asphalt surface have to be understood.

40|$|The Author {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for the verification of the fulfilment {{rate of the}} particle size distribution specifications of the prescriptions limit grading curves, which are commonly used for the definition of bituminous asphalts admixtures, with the SUPERPAVE conditions related to the control points and to the restricted zone boundary. The operative phases of such methodology provide for {{the determination of the}} maximum nominal size of the aggregate, referred to the average curve of the limit grading curves in the semi-logarithmic plane of the sieves opening d-% passing and in the d 0, 45 -% passing. Afterwards, once the referring SUPEPAVE chart where to put the prescriptions limit grading curves is found, the critical points can be characterised in this way: type “a” when the violation of control points occurs, and type “b” when violations of the restricted zone boundary are experienced. Actions modifying the limit grading curves are proposed for each of these typologies, {{in order to get to}} curves consistent with the SUPERPAVE specifications. The methodology used for the limit grading curves of the main Italian prescriptions shows that, referring to traditional asphalts, small changes can make the limit grading curves consistent with the SUPERPAVE specifications. On the contrary, the Author found a strong incompatibility with special conglomerates (<b>porous</b> <b>asphalts,</b> stone mastic asphalts, etc) ...|$|R
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or <b>porous</b> pavement (<b>asphalt)</b> while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|R
50|$|Although some porous paving {{materials}} appear nearly indistinguishable from nonporous materials, their environmental effects are qualitatively different. Whether it is pervious concrete, <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt,</b> paving stones or concrete or plastic-based pavers, all these pervious materials allow stormwater to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, traditionally {{impervious to the}} soil below. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the substrata layers.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{feature of}} the parking lot is its paved area, hence, by {{changing}} this surface to be more permeable to water the parking lot will drain better. Some surface options are open joint pavers, <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt,</b> pervious concrete, or a turf grid.

In addition to using a more porous surface, a more porous subsurface may be used to maximize drainage through the parking lot surface.

40|$|Road {{lighting}} {{is intended to}} improve the comfort and safety of road users at night by increasing visibility levels. This purpose is best achieved by ensuring certain luminance levels and uniformities on the pavement. The luminance distribution depends on the photometric properties of both the luminaries and the pavement. Hence, the reflection properties of the pavement {{must be taken into}} account when designing a road lighting installation (CIE 66 - 1984; CIE 140 - 2000). For road lighting purposes, pavement reflection properties are specified by means of the reduced luminance coefficient r, given in a two dimensional table for a number of standardized combinations of the lighting angle g and the reflection angle b. This so called r-table is difficult to determine, so standard tables have been introduced to facilitate lighting calculations, based on a classification of dry road surfaces with respect to their degree of lightness Q 0 and their degree of specularity S 1. The four-class system R is used in France; other countries may use different systems, but even the most recent dates from the late 70 s'. Thus the values contained in the standard tables are characteristic of materials that were used decades ago. Practices in road construction have changed since that time, and new pavement materials have been used. So whether the standard data still applies to current road surfaces is a relevant question (Brusque et al, 1997; Fotios et al, 2006). To investigate on that question, the LCPC organized a series of in situ measurements to gather up-to-date data on the reflection properties of typical pavement materials, and how these properties evolve over time. Samples were taken periodically over a period of up to three years, on road sections which had been re-surfaced for that purpose. Laboratory measurements were performed by the LRPC of Clermont-Ferrand, using a CIE-compliant goniophotometer (CIE 66 - 1984). The resulting photometric data was analysed in terms of lightness and specularity to estimate the influence of several factors: material type, aggregate size and colour, and age. Very thin bituminous concretes are most common in France. They have high specularity values (R 4) at the young age, which rapidly decrease in the first few months. After three years, they end up fairly or slightly specular (R 3 or R 2), and even diffuse for those with white aggregates (R 1). <b>Porous</b> <b>asphalts</b> evolve in a similar way (from R 1 to R 3 or R 2), only they stabilize faster, and they are much darker. Surface dressings on the other hand are quite diffuse at the start (R 1), but their specularity increases over time. They end up more or less specular (R 3 or R 2), depending on the size of the aggregates, after about two years. Measured r-tables were also graphically compared to the standard tables of the corresponding class. Two types of discrepancies were observed. In some cases, particularly for diffuse materials, the tables only differed by their lightness value. But in other cases, the shape of the r-body itself differed, even after scaling the standard r-table to match lightness values. As a conclusion, there is no doubt that the reflection properties of current pavement materials in France have diverged from the standard tables. The economic impact of this discrepancy has been demonstrated by the CERTU (Chain et al, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|In Trondheim, Norway, an {{increase}} in winter maintenance standard of bicycle roads has caused some damages, {{and it has become}} clear that the bicycle roads have a large variation in quality and use of material along short stretches. This rose a question, which was how the pavement texture affects winter maintenance actions, such as salting. The aim is {{of this study is to}} acquire data about how the need for salt is affected by difference in cross fall, type of asphalt and surface texture. Field studies have been carried out on a bicycle road, on three observation points with large difference in pavement texture. The method has been to measure surface water on days with different weather conditions, and to calculate a theoretical need for salt by using phase diagrams of freezing point depression for dissolved salt in water. The results were compared in a statistical analysis to see if there was a significant difference. The conclusion, from the results, has been that an old, <b>porous,</b> and dry <b>asphalt</b> type will have a lesser need for salt than a newer and more raw asphalt. Furthermore, it was concluded that the cross fall would have an impact on the need for salt...|$|R
5000|$|StreetPlanter: Bio-retention Cells are {{depressions}} {{that contain}} vegetation grown in an engineered soil mixture placed above a gravel drainage bed. They provide storage, infiltration and evaporation of both direct rainfall and runoff captured from surrounding areas. Street planters consist of concrete boxes {{filled with an}} engineered soil that supports vegetative growth. Beneath the soil is a gravel bed that provides additional storage. The walls of a planter extend 3 to 12 inches above the soil bed to allow for ponding within the unit. The thickness of the soil growing medium ranges from 6 to 24 inches while gravel beds are 6 to 18 inches in depth. The planter's capture ratio is the ratio of its area to the impervious area whoserunoff it captures. Raingarden:Rain Gardens are a type of bio-retention cell consisting of just the engineered soil layer with no gravel bed below it.Rain Gardens are shallow depressions filled with an engineered soil mix that supports vegetative growth. They are usually used on individual home lots to capture roof runoff. Typical soil depths range from 6 to 18 inches.The capture ratio is {{the ratio of the}} rain garden's area to the impervious area that drains onto it. GreenRoof: Green Roofs are another variation of a bio-retention cell that have a soil layer laying atop a special drainage mat material that conveys excess percolated rainfall off of the roof. Green Roofs (also known as Vegetated Roofs) are bio-retention systems placed on roof surfaces that capture and temporarily store rainwater in a soil growing medium. They consist of a layered system of roofing designed to support plant growth and retain water for plant uptake while preventing ponding on the roof surface.The thickness used for the growing medium typically ranges from 3 to 6 inches. InfilTrench: infiltration trenches are narrow ditches filled with gravel that intercept runoff from upslope impervious areas. They provide storage volume and additional time for captured runoff to infiltrate the native soil below. [...] PermPave or Permeable PavementsContinuous Permeable Pavement systems are excavated areas filled with gravel and paved over with a <b>porous</b> concrete or <b>asphalt</b> mix. Continuous Permeable Pavement systems are excavated areas filled with gravel and paved over with a <b>porous</b> concrete or <b>asphalt</b> mix. Modular Block systems are similar except that permeable block pavers are used instead. Normally all rainfall will immediately pass through the pavement into the gravel storage layer below it where it can infiltrate at natural rates into the site's native soil. Pavement layers are usually 4 to 6 inches in height while the gravel storage layer is typically 6 to 18 inches high. The Capture Ratio is the percent of the treated area (street or parking lot) that is replaced with permeable pavement. [...] Cistern: Rain Barrels (or Cisterns) are containers that collect roof runoff during storm events and can either release or re-use the rainwater during dry periods. Rain harvesting systems collect runoff from rooftops and convey it to a cistern tank where it can be used for non-potable water uses and on-site infiltration. The harvesting system is assumed to consist of a given number of fixed-sized cisterns per 1000 square feet of rooftop area captured. The water from each cistern is withdrawn at a constant rate and is assumed to be consumed or infiltrated entirely on-site. VegSwale: Vegetative swales are channels or depressed areas with sloping sides covered with grass and other vegetation. They slow down the conveyance of collected runoff and allow it more time to infiltrate the native soil beneath it. Infiltration basins are shallow depressions filled with grass or other natural vegetation that capture runoff from adjoining areas and allow it to infiltrate into the soil.|$|R

A special feature of the motorways is the use of <b>Porous</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Concrete, which allows water to be drained efficiently, and even in heavy rain, no water will splash up, in contrast with concrete or other pavement types. The Netherlands is the only country which uses PAC this extensively, and the goal is to cover 100% of the motorways with PAC. <b>Porous</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Concrete has some downsides, including the initial construction costs, PAC is two to three times more expensive than regular surface materials, and needs constant maintenance, especially with heavy traffic. Sometimes, the road surface has to be renewed within 7 years, especially on routes with heavy truck traffic causing widespread track formation.In 1979, the first traffic control center opened in Delft, where the A13 can be controlled with dynamic road signalization. These electronic signs can show a lower speed limit, as low as 50 km/h, to warn drivers for upcoming traffic jams and accidents. They usually also contain flashers to attract attention from drivers. The expansion of this system halted in the 1980s, but accelerated again in the 1990s. As of 2004, 980 kilometers of motorways are fitted with electronic traffic signalization. Besides this system, another system of Variable Message Signs (VMS) has been implemented, informing motorists about the driving times or traffic jam length to a certain point. It can also show the length of various traffic jams near large interchanges, so drivers can choose an alternative route. As of 2004, there were 102 VMS signs in the Netherlands. The number of passing motorised vehicles is counted every minute of the day at some 20,000 measuring stations on the Dutch motorway network.Another more common feature of Dutch motorways are peak, rushhour or plus lanes. These constructions allow motorists to use the hard shoulder in case of congestion, to improve the traffic flow. Numerous motorways have peak lanes, and plus lanes are extra lanes in the median, which can be opened to traffic in case of congestion. All these extra lanes are observed by CCTV cameras from a traffic control center. They improved traffic flow, breakdowns, there are fewer places to safely park your vehicle, leading to more congestion. It has been suggested that these peak lanes should eventually be replaced by a regular widening.|$|E

A <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement differs from traditional asphalt pavement designs in that the structure permits fluids to pass freely through it, reducing or controlling the amount of run-off from the surrounding area. By allowing precipitation and run-off to flow through the structure, this pavement type functions as an additional stormwater management technique. The overall benefits of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavements may include both environmental and safety benefits including improved stormwater management, improved skid resistance, reduction of spray to drivers and pedestrians, {{as well as a}} potential for noise reduction. With increasing environmental awareness and an evolving paradigm shift in stormwater management techniques, this research aims to provide guidance for Canadian engineers, contractors, and government agencies on the design of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement structures.

40|$|<b>Porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> shows {{excellent}} {{performance in}} both noise reduction and water drainage. Although <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> has these great qualities, its service life is much shorter (sometimes only half) compared to dense graded asphalt roads. Ravelling, {{which is the}} loss of aggregate particles from the surface layer, is the main damage mechanism of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> surface wearing courses. In this research, an induction healing approach (namely, activating the healing process of asphalt concrete through induction heating) was developed to enhance the durability of the <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> roads. Steel fibers are added to a <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture to make it electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating. When micro cracks are expected to occur in the asphalt mastic of the pavement, the temperature of the mastic can be increased locally by induction heating of the steel fibers so that <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete can repair itself and close the cracks through the high temperature healing of the bitumen (diffusion and flow). The closure of micro cracks will prevent the formation of macro cracks. In such a way, ravelling can be avoided or delayed in the end. To make asphalt mastic and <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating, steel (wool) fibers were incorporated into them. The electrical conductivity and induction heating speed of asphalt mastic and <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete were first studied in this research. Asphalt mastic and <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel fibers can be heated with induction energy. There is an optimal volume content of steel fiber in asphalt mastic or <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete to obtain the highest induction heating speed. Adding more steel fiber above this optimal volume content does not increase the induction heating speed anymore. Furthermore, the highest induction heating speed corresponds to the minimum electrical resistivity. However, <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete {{does not need to be}} fully conductive for induction heating. Every single steel wool is a heating unit. Nonconductive samples with steel fiber can still be heated with induction heating, but at a low heating speed. The diameter, length and content of steel wool fiber are important for the conductivity and heating speed of asphalt concrete matrix. It is proven that induction heating does not cause extra ageing to bitumen. Addition of steel wool also reduces the binder drainage problem in <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete. The mechanical properties of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber were studied in this research. Adding moderate percentage steel wool to <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete reinforce it by increasing its particle loss resistance, indirect tensile strength and fracture energy, water damage resistance, stiffness and fatigue resistance. The steel wool was optimized to obtain the best particle loss resistance in <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete. 8 % steel wool type 00 (volume fraction of bitumen) was considered as the optimal content. The healing potential of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber was also evaluated in this research with both cylinder and beam samples. Damaged <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber can greatly restore its stiffness, strength and fatigue life with induction heating, which proves that the healing capacity of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete with steel wool fiber is enhanced by induction heating. The optimal induction heating temperature is 85 ºC for <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete to obtain the best healing rate. Reheating does not decrease the healing rate of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete, which means that heating can be repeated when cracks appear again. To apply the induction healing technology in real <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> road, a trial section was constructed on Dutch motorway A 58 in December 2010. This trial section survived the past two winters perfectly. Experiments were done on the cores drilled from the trial section and the results coincided with those on the laboratory made samples. The field cores showed good particle loss resistance, high strength, good fatigue resistance and high induction healing capacity. Based on the laboratory experiments and field experiences, induction healing can be a very good approach to enhance the durability of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> pavement. Finally, some recommendations are given for further research. Steel fiber, mixing technology and induction generator need to be optimized. Modeling work is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms involved in induction healing. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Furthermore, cold climate conditions have a degenerating effect on stormwater systems and road constructions. <b>Porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{has been used}} as a wearing course on highways and in porous pavement constructions all around the world. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the function of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> in cold climates. Measurements of the draining function of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> were carried out in a climate room with adjustable temperature in the range - 10 C to + 20 C. At freezing point, the infiltration capacity of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> was approximately 50 % of the infiltration capacity at + 20 C. When the <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> was exposed to alternating melting and freezing during 2 days, conditions similar to the snowmelt period, the infiltration capacity was reduced by approximately 90 %. Based on the results of this study and previous studies, the infiltration capacity of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> was estimated to be 1 - 5 mm/min for snowmelt conditions.

40|$|<b>Porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> is a {{flexible}} pavement layer with highly interconnected air voids constructed using an opengraded type of aggregate. The aggregate shape and surface texture serve a vital function {{in determining the}} engineering properties and performance of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt.</b> The angular aggregates with clearly defined fracture faces and sharp edges encourage better interlocking between the aggregates' skeleton structures, which makes them preferable to use in asphalt mixtures. This study evaluates the effect of aggregate angularity on the engineering properties and performance of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> using both conventional and empirical particle index test methods. The term “engineering properties” refers to the experimental works determining resilient modulus and stability, whereas “performance” deals with the porosity and durability characteristics of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> caused by variations in the particle index number (Ia). A laboratory data analysis shows that angular particles provide a larger Ia number than non-angular particles. Furthermore, resilient modulus and stability properties significantly improve when angular aggregates are applied. The angular particles provide high mixture porosity but cause poor durability performance of <b>porous</b> <b>asphalt</b> against abrasion loss.
