Small and medium livestock farmers have between 10 and 30 cows or beef cattle.

Along with tanner grass, it is planted as a fodder grass in seasonally flooded or swampy habitats, and in ponds in pastures, but it can block irrigation ditches and drains. When used as forage for cattle it is usually controlled by the action of the animals, so it does not become too weedy. When it grows in other habitats, however, it can become noxious.

This native annual {{grass is}} {{displaced by the}} introduced pasture, <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (Brachiaria mutica (Forssk.) Nguyen). This study investigates whether the mechanism for this displacement is through effects on the germination of wild rice seed. Wild rice has a seed dormancy mechanism that prevents seeds germinating when they are first dispersed into the moist floodplain soil {{at the end of}} the annual wet season. The presence of <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> may prevent or change environmental cues that would otherwise break dormancy and stimulate germination of wild rice. Initially we found that, under wild rice cover, some 76 % of seeds had germinated, 17 % had died and 5 % remained ungerminated after two wet seasons. When wild rice seeds were sown into a well established <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> cover, almost no seed germinated, a large proportion remained alive but ungerminated, and a greater proportion died than under wild rice cover. We then investigated how <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> may prevent germination of wild rice, by (a) determining dormancy breaking cues for wild rice seeds and (b) comparing floodplain seed bed conditions under <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> and wild rice cover. In the laboratory, breaking of dormancy was dependent on the seeds being exposed to high temperatures. In the field, <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> produced much higher above ground biomass than wild rice, and modified the seedbed. Temperatures were lower at the soil surface under para-grass cover than under wild rice cover. This study showed wild rice has a dormancy mechanism, which prevents germination under significant canopy and litter cover. Thus, a weed species (<b>para</b> <b>grass)</b> can modify habitat conditions so that dormancy breaking and germination in a native species (wild rice) is prevented.

In this study I focused on an invasive African pasture grass Urochloa mutica <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> in the Mary River wetlands, located in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. I addressed the need to clarify research and weed management priorities by creating a habitat suitability model (HSM) for <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> and used the output from the HSM in a simple model of spread. Predictions from the spread model, based on habitat suitability and proximity to existing populations of <b>para</b> <b>grass,</b> were used to estimate the relative risk of invasion for different wetland habitats. Two habitat suitability modelling approaches (generalised linear modelling and Bayesian inference) were compared {{to provide a more}} robust insight into the effect of analytical approach on assessment of risk of invasion. Spread modelling was also used to explore the effect of alternative management responses to estimates of the relative susceptibility to <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> invasion. In adopting this approach I recognised that the models developed represented a trade-off between reality, generality and precision. In this study the trade-off is between ecological precision (e. g. patch scale effects of local variation in environmental variables) and the utility of landscape-scale models of habitat suitability. I contend that the benefits of being able to assess invasion risk and hence weed research and management priorities at the landscape scale, offsets the limitations associated with the precision of the predictions. Both the habitat suitability and spread modelling were implemented within a GIS to facilitate spatially explicit modelling at the landscape scale. Following the assessment of the relative susceptibility of wetlands habitats to <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> invasion, I quantified the current impact of <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> on wetland habitats using plot-based flora survey to assess changes in floristic composition in response to varying <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> density.

The comprehensive field surveys of terrestrial vertebrate fauna in the floodplain and savanna woodland habitats within the catchment provide the first quantitative evidence on the ecological effects of <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> and gamba grass. The findings of my research indicate that the conversion of native vegetation to communities dominated by dense <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> or gamba grass, {{could lead to a}} substantial loss of plant and animal biodiversity, as well as reductions in the size of some animal populations currently present in the catchment. In the floodplain habitat, 87 % of native plant and 66 % of native animal species were not recorded in areas where <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> cover was greater than 40 %. In the savanna woodland habitat, a similar although less pronounced result was observed, with 47 % of native plant, 18 % of native vertebrate species not recorded in either woodland areas with a dense gamba grass understorey (i. e. > 70 % of the total ground-level plant cover) or paddocks of gamba grass.

Efforts to contain these exotic pasture grasses on unreserved land, particularly pastoral properties bordering conservation reserves, need to be intensified.

Rice straw ad libitum and <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (Brachiaria mutica) at 1 % DM of BW comprised the basal diet. The study was arranged as a 4 × 4 double Latin square design, with cassava foliage contributing 0, 0. 8, 1. 6 or 2. 4 g CP/kg BW. The cassava foliage intake was lower than the planned levels. DM consumption was significantly affected by cassava foliage supplementation, with the largest intake observed at the two highest levels of cassava foliage supplementation. Rice straw intake showed the opposite pattern, with lower intake at higher cassava foliage supplementation. No refusals occurred for <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> in any of the treatments. Ca, P, Mg, K, S and Mn intake increased significantly with increasing intake of cassava foliage, but Na intake was not affected by treatment. Faecal excretion of Ca, Mg, S and Mn increased significantly with increasing cassava foliage intake. There were no differences between P, K and Na excretion in faeces. There was a significant diet effect on Mg, S and Mn digestibility. Mg and Mn digestibility increased with increasing cassava foliage supplementation, while S digestibility decreased. Ca, P, K and Na digestibility was not affected by diet. There was a significant effect of treatment on P retention, with the highest value observed for supplementation with 1. 6 g CP/kg BW cassava foliage. Ca and Mg showed similar trends, with the highest retention again for supplementation with 1. 6 g CP/kg BW cassava foliage. There were weak but significant positive correlations between nitrogen retention and the macro minerals Ca, P and Mg. Furthermore, retention of all these minerals was positively correlated. Mineral losses in urine were not affected by dietary treatment with the exception of P excretion, which was affected by treatment. In conclusion, cassava foliage is a good Ca source which compensates for the low Ca content in rice straw and <b>para</b> <b>grass,</b> but P deficiency appears to be exaggerated in cattle with higher cassava intake.

40|$|Wetlands are {{susceptible}} to invasion by both flora and fauna due to their availability of differing habitat. This induces the enactment of treatments either for prevention or management of introduced species. Many invasive management practices are done {{with a focus on}} single taxa, especially with concern to wetlands. Wetlands offer a dynamic habitat for several species, and being aware of how these habitats are used by all species can offer a beneficial knowledge base for those enacting management techniques to ensure minimal consequences. This thesis investigated the influence of invasive species on herpetofauna in a wetland. The majority of this study focused on habitat use and the effects of the <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> Urochloa mutica. By trapping along the ecotone gradient, abundance and location were used to determine primary habitat. It is concluded that the majority of herpetofauna species are more abundant in the woodland than in the margin or floodplain. This benefits the management treatments done to the floodplain by alleviating loss through the confirmation of larger populations in adjacent woodlands. A few species, however, associated mostly with the floodplain were identified such as Lampropholis delicata and Litoria fallax. These species could face greater consequences from management techniques. QPWS/CSIRO are experimenting with management techniques to control the spread of the invasive <b>para</b> <b>grass.</b> The effect of these treatments (burning and grazing) on the keelback snake (Tropidonophis mairii) during the wet season was studied by setting up aquatic traps in the floodplain in paddocks each with a different <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> treatment. The results found that snakes are more abundant in undisturbed, or control sites. This presents questions concerning the consequences of the weed vs. those of the management practice. A final study was done on the relation between Tropidonophis mairii and cane toads Bufo marinus, finding that despite the availability of cane toads, keelbacks selectively avoid them in their diet. Keelbacks are known to consume the toxic cane toad, but this defined preference for other individuals, shows that they are not a viable biological control method for the quickly expanding cane toad population...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate Jakr-Na-Rai (Gynura divaricata) as a roughage source on growth performance, blood constituent, blood glucose and cholesterol in growing rabbits. Twenty-four 7 -week-old New Zealand White rabbits (12 males and 12 females) were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 8 with equal sex. The rabbits in the first group were fed on commercial feed while the rabbits in the 2 nd and 3 rd groups were fed the same as first group and supplemented with <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (Brachiaria mutica) and Jakr-Na-Rai, respectively. The rabbits were raised in individual cages in opened house and received feed and water ad libitum for 4 weeks. Daily feed intake and body weight at the start and the end of the trial were recorded. Blood samples were collected for measurement of blood constituent, blood glucose and cholesterol level. Result showed that there was no significant difference in total dry matter intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio (p> 0. 05). Blood constituent at the beginning and the end of the experiment, except heterophil value at the start, also did not show any significant differences (p> 0. 05). A significant difference in blood glucose was detected between the rabbits consuming Jakr-Na-Rai and <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (p 0. 05). In conclusion, Jakr-Na-Rai can potentially lower blood glucose but had no effect on blood cholesterol. Furthermore, insoluble fiber is not the activ...|$|E
40|$|Responsible {{conservation}} {{decisions are}} made when managers consider the benefits provided by an action {{in relation to the}} potential negative effects incurred. Some introduced grasses can be managed using fire and grazing, but experiments, replicated in time and space, are required to determine the relative costs and benefits of this action on native biodiversity. We aimed to experimentally determine the effect on reptile and amphibian assemblages of repeated burning and grazing of the invasive weed <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (Urochloa mutica) over three years in a north Queensland conservation reserve in Australia. We measured the diversity and abundance of reptiles and amphibians, and quantified temperature and humidity during an experiment that repeatedly grazed, burnt, or burnt and grazed <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> in a replicated series of experimental plots. All burnt plots were drier and sites that were both burnt and grazed were hotter. The frog and reptile community was dominated by a few common species. Richness changed seasonally and was strongly related to the distance from the nearest woodland and free water, but it was unaffected by the management treatments. Abundance of the skink (Lampropholis delicata) and frog (Limnodynastes convexiusculus) decreased with burning and grazing, while a closely related frog (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) remained unaffected. There was a clear trade-off between decreasing the abundance of a few common species to increase the overall suitability of habitat for a diversity of native species. We suggest that, in this case, it is reasonable to make the value judgement that this trade-off is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Invasive plants, {{particularly}} grasses, {{are regarded}} as one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem function. One of the most significant effects of exotic grass invasion is the increase in fine fuel, which can increase fire frequency, intensity and extent. In northern Australia, many terrestrial and aquatic grasses introduced for pastoralism are now recognized weeds (Lonsdale 1994). <b>Para</b> <b>Grass</b> (Urochloa mutica (Forssk.) T. Q. Nguyen), an African perennial, has been widely promoted throughout northern Australia as a pasture species but is also considered a serious weed which threatens large areas of wetland from northern NSW to WA (Humphries et al. 1991) ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrological changes {{associated}} with irrigation, {{in conjunction with}} increased nutrient concentrations and aquatic plant densities, have greatly impacted fish habitat values on the Burdekin River floodplain. The two most significant weeds in the Burdekin floodplain are water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (Urochloa mutica). Water hyacinth creates a base for the <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (and then other weeds) to grow out into deeper water, creating weed mats that can then only be removed by mechanical means or floods of the largest magnitude. We attempted to rehabilitate floodplain lagoons by the mechanical removal of floating weed mats and monitored the result by measuring the subsequent effects on fish habitats and fish communities. Prior to weed removal, fish habitats were generally of poor quality, and fish community structure was skewed away from rich native assemblages to depauperate communities dominated in some instances by alien species. Poor water quality arising from floating weed mats {{is considered to be}} the main determinant of reduced fish abundance and diversity. After mechanical weed removal, recovery of water quality and physical habitat led to the re-establishment of many native fish species. Key refuge habitats within the distribution channels were a critical source of recruits for fishes dispersing during times of elevated seasonal flows into the newly rehabilitated reaches. This study demonstrates that floating alien weed mats have significant negative effects upon aquatic communities and that mechanical removal of these weed mats (as opposed to chemical removal) results in dramatic improvements in native fish species richness and abundance.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of multi-temporal Landsat 5 TM for object-based {{classification}} of native wetland vegetation and the perennial aquatic weed <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> within Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia. Using identical training data and segmentation, a nearest-neighbour classification produced from a four-image (dry season) time-series was compared with four 'single-date' classifications produced from the individual images of the same series. A 15 -class vegetation map generated from the multi-date classification produced an overall accuracy of 82 percent (kappa = 0. 80). This was an average increase in accuracy of 25 percent (kappa = 0. 28) compared to single-date classifications. The multi-date image composite also improved segmentation quality and spectral separability of vegetation classes. Reliable maps of wetland vegetation, potentially useful for strategic conservation, can be produced by integrated, object-based, analysis of multi-temporal Landsat...|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} weed {{management}} on native biodiversity are often overlooked. Burning and grazing plots {{of land in}} isolation and in combination, were used to experimentally reduce the biomass of introduced <b>para</b> <b>grass</b> (Urochloa mutica(Forssk.) T. Q. Nguyen)) in a North Queensland wetland. Frogs were monitored {{to assess the impact}} of these management trials. Marbled frogs (Limnodynastes convexius-culus Macleay) declined in response to all management treatments, and their abundance was correlated with vegetation biomass. The abundance of spotted marsh frogs (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis Günther) was not related to weed control treatments, but was influenced by the distance of the experimental plot from the nearest woodland. The decline of these frog species in response to management trials indicates that knowledge about impacts of planned weed control is critical, to inform management of taxa that may be affected...|$|E
