50|$|A {{more subtle}} issue {{is related to}} pairing. When players can choose their own opponents, they can choose opponents with minimal risk of losing, and maximum reward for winning. Particular {{examples}} of 2800+ rated players choosing opponents with minimal risk and maximum possibility of rating gain include: choosing computers that they know they can beat with a certain strategy; choosing opponents that they think are overrated; or avoiding playing strong players who are rated several hundred points below them, but may hold chess titles such as IM or GM. In the category of choosing overrated opponents, new-entrants to the rating system who have played fewer than 50 games are in theory a convenient target {{as they may be}} overrated in their <b>provisional</b> <b>rating.</b> The ICC compensates for this issue by assigning a lower K-factor to the established player if they do win against a new rating entrant.

All EUs easily satisfied WHO criteria for stopping MDA. Comprehensive surveillance was performed in 19 Public Health Inspector (PHI) areas (subdistrict health administrative units).

Fertility rates were highest for Hispanic women (107. 4), followed by Native American (70. 7), Asian or Pacific Islander (69. 4), black (69. 3), and non-Hispanic white women (58. 0). During the early to mid 1990 s, fertility declined for non-Hispanic white, black, and American Indian women. Rates for these population groups have changed relatively little since 1995; however, fertility has increased for Asian or Pacific Islander and Hispanic women. The birth rate for teen mothers continued to fall, dropping 5 % from 2000 to 2001 to 45. 9 births per 1000 females aged 15 to 19 years, another record low. The teen birth rate has fallen 26 % since 1991; declines were more rapid (35 %) for younger teens aged 15 to 17 years than for older teens aged 18 to 19 years (20 %). The proportion of all births to unmarried women remained about the same at one-third. Smoking during pregnancy continued to decline; smoking rates were highest among teen mothers. The use of timely prenatal care increased slightly to 83. 4 % in 2001. From 1990 to 2001, the use of timely prenatal care increased by 6 % (to 88. 5 %) for non-Hispanic white women, by 23 % (to 74. 5 %) for black women, and by 26 % (to 75. 7 %) for Hispanic women. The number and rate of twin births continued to rise, but the triplet/+ birth rate declined {{for the second year}} in a row. For the first year in almost a decade, the preterm birth rate declined (to 11. 6 %); however, the low birth weight rate was unchanged at 7. 6 %. The total cesarean delivery rate jumped 7 % from 2000 to 2001 to 24. 4 % of all births, the highest level reported since these data became available on birth certificates (1989). The primary cesarean rate rose 5 %, whereas the rate of vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery tumbled 20 %.

In 1863, lower rates were set for [...] "steamer" [...] mail to Europe at (six annas, eight pies for a -ounce letter). Lower rates were also introduced for inland mail.New regulations removed special postal privileges enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of overprinting [...] "Service" [...] on postage stamps and [...] "Service Postage" [...] on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.Shortages developed, so stamps also had to be improvised. Some [...] "Service Postage" [...] overprinted rarities resulted from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-pie stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new <b>rates.</b> <b>Provisional</b> six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting the top and bottom from a current foreign-bill revenue stamp and overprinting [...] "Postage". India was the first country in the Commonwealth to issue airmail stamps.|$|R
40|$|To create hydrologically {{sustainable}} wetlands, {{knowledge of}} the water use requirements of target habitats must be known. Extensive literature reviews highlighted a dearth of water-use data associated with large reedbeds and wet woodland habitats {{and in response to}} this field experiments were established. Field experiments to measure the water use rates of large reedbeds [ET(Reed) ] were completed at three sites within the UK. Reference Crop Evapotranspiration [ETo] was calculated and mean monthly crop coefficients [Kc(Reed) ] were developed. Kc(Reed) was less than 1 during the growing season (March to September), ranging between 0. 22 in March and reaching a peak of 0. 98 in June. The developed coefficients compare favourably with published data from other large reedbed systems and support the premise that the water use of large reedbeds is lower than that from small/fringe reedbeds. A methodology for determining water use rates from wet woodland habitats (UK NVC Code: W 6) is presented, in addition to <b>provisional</b> ET(W 6) <b>rates</b> for two sites in the UK. Reference Crop Evapotranspiration [ETo] data was used to develop Kc(W 6) values which ranged between 0. 89 (LV Lysimeter 1) and 1. 64 (CH Lysimeter 2) for the period March to September. The data are comparable with relevant published data and show that the water use rates of wet woodland are higher than most other wetland habitats. Initial observations suggest that water use is related to the habitat’s establishment phase and the age and size of the canopy tree species. A theoretical case study presents crop coefficients associated with wetland habitats and provides an example water budget {{for the creation of a}} wetland comprising a mosaic of wetland habitats. The case study shows the critical role that the water use of wetland habitats plays within a water budget. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|According to {{provisional}} reports, {{an estimated}} 301, 000 births {{occurred in the}} United States during January 1997. This was a 5 -percent decrease from the provisional number of births reported for January 1996 (318, 000). The birth rate, 13. 3 live births per 1, 000 population, was 6 percent lower than the rate of 14. 2 for January 1996. The fertility rate, 59. 5 live births per 1, 000 women 15 – 44 years, was 6 percent lower than the comparable rate for January 1996 (63. 2). The seasonally adjusted fertility rate (62. 4) was also 6 percent lower than the comparable rate for January 1996 (66. 3). An estimated 3, 882, 000 live births occurred in the 12 -month period ending with January 1997, a 1 -percent increase from the 3, 861, 000 births reported {{for the same period}} a year earlier. The birth rate of 14. 6 was 1 percent lower than the rate of 14. 7 for the preceding 12 -month period. The fertility rate for the most recent 12 -month period was 65. 1, slightly higher than the rate for the 12 months ending with January 1996 (64. 9). This combination of slightly changed rates points to a slowdown of the generally downward trend observed since early 1991. Natural increase As a result of natural increase, the excess of births over deaths, an estimated 84, 000 people, or 3. 7 persons per 1, 000 population, were added to the population during January 1997. For the 12 -month period ending with January 1997, 1, 574, 000 persons were added to the population. This represented a rate of natural increase of 5. 9, the same as for the preceding 12 -month period. The unchanged rate of natural increase was due to similar decreases in the birth rate and death <b>rate.</b> <b>Provisional</b> Vital Statistics for the United States [Rates for infant deaths are deaths under 1 year per 1, 000 live births; fertility rates are live births per 1, 000 women aged 15 – 44 years; all other rates are per 1, 000 total population.
