40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although {{the role}} of {{asbestos}} in the genesis of mesothelioma and <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancers</b> has been established, results from studies focusing {{on the relationship between}} occupational exposure to asbestos and digestive cancer remain contradictory. AIM: To determine whether occupational asbestos exposure increases the incidence of digestive cancers. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective morbidity study based on 2024 subjects occupationally exposed to asbestos. The incidence of digestive cancer was calculated from 1 st January 1978 to 31 st December 2004 and compared with levels among the local general population using Standardized Incidence Ratios. Asbestos exposure was assessed using the company's job exposure matrix. RESULTS: Eighty-five cases of digestive cancer were observed within our cohort, for an expected number of 66. 90 (SIR = 1. 27 [1. 01; 1. 57]). A significantly elevated incidence, particularly notable among women, was observed for peritoneal mesothelioma, independently of exposure levels. A significantly elevated incidence was also noted among men for cancer of small intestine and oesophagus, for cumulative exposure indexes for asbestos above 80 fibres/mL x years. A significantly elevated incidence of cancer of the small intestine was also observed among men having been exposed to asbestos for periods in excess of 25 years and for mean exposure levels in excess of 4 fibres/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the existence of a relationship between exposure to asbestos and cancer of the small intestine and of the oesophagus in men...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma complicated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to optimize the early diagnoses in the coexistence of COPD and <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma. Methods The clinical data of 118 patients with COPD complicated with <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively, including age, sex, smoking history, smoking index, clinical symptoms and signs, pathological type, staging, metastasis site and lung function index. 120 patients with simple COPD were selected as control. Results The smoking rate (55. 1 %) and smoking index ≥ 400 branch /year (90. 8 %) of the patients with COPD complicated with <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma were higher than the simple COPD group (20. 8 %, 48. 0 %). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P 0. 05), while the incidence of hemoptysis, weight loss, chest pain, hoarseness, pleural effusion and atelectasis were significantly higher than those in simple COPD group (P 0. 05), but the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) of COPD patients complicated with <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma was lower than that of simple COPD patients (P< 0. 05). In the COPD patients with <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common pathological type (51. 7 %). Male patients were mainly squamous cell carcinoma (60. 7 %), while female patients with adenocarcinoma (69. 0 %). Conclusion COPD combined with <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma occurs in male smokers more. There is higher incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. When they are first diagnosed, most of them are advanced or located late, due to no specific clinical symptoms at the early stages. Periodic chest CT examination for COPD patients can help early diagnoses of <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|There {{exists a}} rarely {{observed}} association between pulmonary histiocytosis X and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer.</b> However, {{the frequency of}} <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> in these patients is {{higher than in the}} general population. A 28 -year-old patient who currently smokes ten packs of cigarettes a year came to our department of pneumology with complains of cough and hemoptysis. An x-ray of the thorax revealed bilateral cysts and a shadow in {{the upper part of the}} right pulmonary field. In addition, a chest tomography showed multiple cysts dispersed throughout the two pulmonary fields and an irregular mass with a diameter of four centimetres in the upper right lobe. Bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during a cytologic exam of the bronchial washing. We decided to perform a thoracotomy on the patient, since there was no far metastasis. An upper lobectomy and wedge resection of the upper segment of the lower right lobe, which had been invaded by the tumour, were performed. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. A pulmonary biopsy was carried out on the tumour-free site and showed the presence of histiocytosis X. There is a hypothesis that a neoplasm developed on the pulmonary fibrosis could be an epiphenomenon of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> in patients who smoke and have pulmonary histiocytosis X. It is interesting to note that histiocytosis X and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> were diagnosed at the same time, since the <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> may have occurred within a few years following the diagnosis of histiocytosis X, even if she was a smoker. Hemoptysis, which is found in 5 % of patients with histiocytosis X, may suggest cancer. This young patient, a smoker, who complained of hemoptysis, is a particularly rare case of the association between pulmonary histiocytosis X and <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> whose pathogenesis is not clear cut. It is thus important to note that smoking can have major consequences, even in young people...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 25 sputum samples from controls and 22 bronchial aspiration samples from patients presenting with <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> who were professionally exposed to cancer were used. After Feulgen staining, 18 morphologic and DNA content parameters were measured on cell nuclei, via image cytom- etry. A method was developed for analyzing distribution quantiles, compared with simply interpreting mean values, to characterize morphologic modifications in cell nuclei. RESULTS: Distribution analysis of parameters enabled us to distinguish 13 of 18 parameters that demonstrated significant differences between controls and cancer cases. These parameters, used alone, enabled us to distinguish two population types, with both sensitivity and specificity > 70 %. Three parameters offered 100 % sensitivity and specificity. When mean values offered high sensitivity and specificity, comparable or higher sensitivity and specificity values were observed {{for at least one}} of the corresponding quantiles. CONCLUSION: Analysis of modification in morphologic parameters via distribution analysis proved promising for screening <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> from sputum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this work}} was to {{establish}} recommendations for the medical follow-up of workers currently or previously exposed to lung carcinogens. Methods A critical synthesis of the literature was conducted. Occupational lung carcinogenic substances were listed and classified according to their level of lung cancer risk. A targeted screening protocol was defined. Results A clinical trial, National Lung Screnning Trial (NLST), showed the efficacy of chest CAT scan (CT) screening for populations of smokers aged 55 – 74 years with over 30 pack-years of exposure who had stopped smoking for less than 15  years. To propose screening in accordance with NLST criteria, and to account for occupational risk factors, screening among smokers and former smokers needs to consider the types of occupational exposure for which the risk level is at least equivalent {{to the risk of}} the subjects included in the NLST. The working group proposes an algorithm that estimates the relative risk of each occupational lung carcinogen, taking into account exposure to tobacco, based on available data from the literature. Conclusion Given the lack of data on <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> (BPC) screening in occupationally exposed workers, the working group proposed implementing a screening experiment for <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> in subjects occupationally exposed or having been occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens who are confirmed as having high risk factors for BPC.

Material and METHODS: The screening procedure consisted of biennial chest radiograph and monodetector chest CT scan, given to 972 individuals who had been highly exposed to asbestos. A total of 2555 screening procedures were performed. The study focuses on the 1230 screening procedures for which a 2 -year follow-up period was available. RESULTS: Twenty-four cases of <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancer</b> were diagnosed. CT scan detected 20 cancers, 12 of which had not been detected by chest radiograph. Sensitivity of chest radiograph and CT scan were, respectively, 33 % and 83 %, lesions measuring over 2 mm in diameter being considered as suspect. The specificity of chest radiograph and CT scan were, respectively, 95 % and 78 %. Calculation of the differential false positive/true positive (FP/TP) ratio and the receiver operating characteristic curve, performed for both chest radiograph and CT scan, facilitated the determination of the best possible compromise between specificity and sensitivity, according to the diameter threshold applied for considering a nodule as suspect. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study confirms the superior sensitivity of chest CT scan compared with conventional chest radiograph, the associated loss in specificity leads to a recommended diameter of 5 mm as the threshold for considering non-calcified lesions as "suspect", for the surveillance of asbestos-exposed individuals...|$|R
40|$|In children, primary tumors of {{the lung}} {{constitute}} a unique subset of quasineoplastic and unequivocally neoplastic lesions whose benign or malignant potential is not always predictable {{on the basis of}} morphologic findings. One such neoplasm in the latter category is the <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> fibrosarcoma (PBPF). This clinicopathologic, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical study documents our experience with five PBPFs in newborns and children up to 11 years of age at diagnosis. The tumors were either endobronchial or intraparenchymal in location. A uniform population of interlacing bundles and sheets of densely arranged spindle cells with variable mitotic activity was observed microscopically in each case. Ultrastructurally, the cells had the features of fibroblasts and vimentin was the only immunohistochemical marker identified. Despite the disturbing pathologic findings, the four children with more than 1 year of follow-up have survived well 4 to 9 years after surgical resection. Our results are compared with the 21 cases of PBPF reported in the literature and the differential diagnosis is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Adenoid cystic carcinoma is <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> carcinoma with low malignancy, and 43 patients {{treated in the}} past 50 years in our hospital were retrospectively studied. The {{aim of this study}} is to discuss the clinical symptoms, pathologic characteristic and therapeutic method of primary tracheal or bronchuotracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma. Methods This study summarized total 43 patients of primary tracheal or bronchus adenoid cystic carcinoma treated in our hospital from Jan. 1958 to Dec. 2007. Among them, 40 patients were treated by surgical resection, and 3 patients were treated by fiberoptic bronchoscope’s interventional treatment.

Three hundred and seventy-one microbiological assays were carried out, and the following serum levels were obtained: 137 mg/ 1 ± 089, l h after erythromycin ethyl succinate (last dose); 305 mg/ 1 ± 097, 1 h after injection of erythromycin lactobionate; 59 mg/ 1 ± 263 amoxycillin, 2 h after amoxycillin Oast dose). Levels of antibiotics were determined in healthy, peritumoral and tumoral tissue, in lymph nodes and in per-operation bronchial mucus. Ratios between tissue and pulmonary serum concentrations demonstrate a good diffusion of erythromycin, particularly in healthy lung = ratio of 547 (erythromycin per os), 462 (iv erythromycin) and in the tumour— 3 * 12 (erythromycin per os) and 327 (iv erythromycin).

40|$|During tumor invasion, tumor {{epithelial}} cells acquire migratory and invasive properties involving important phenotypic alterations. Among these changes, one can observe reorganization or {{a loss of}} cell-cell adhesion complexes such as tight junctions (TJs). TJs are composed of transmembrane proteins (occludin, claudins) linked to the actin cytoskeleton through cytoplasmic adaptor molecules {{including those of the}} zonula occludens family (ZO- 1, - 2, - 3). We here evaluated the potential role of ZO- 2 in the acquisition of invasive properties by tumor cells. In vivo, we showed a decrease of ZO- 2 expression in <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancers,</b> with a preferential localization in the cytoplasm. In addition, in vitro, the localization of ZO- 2 varied according to invasive properties of tumor cells, with a cytoplasmic localization correlating with invasion. In addition, we demonstrated that ZO- 2 inhibition increases invasive and migrative capacities of invasive tumor cells. This was associated with an increase of MT 1 -MMP. These results suggest that ZO- 2, besides its structural role in tight junction assembly, can act also as a repressor of tumor progression through its ability to reduce the expression of tumor-promoting genes in invasive tumor cells.

40|$|The E-cadherin-catenin complex, by {{mediating}} intercellular adhesion, {{regulates the}} architectural integrity of epithelia. Down-regulation of its expression {{is thought to}} contribute to invasion of carcinoma cells. To investigate {{the involvement of the}} E-cadherin-catenin adhesion system in the progression of human bronchopulmonary carcinomas, we compared the immunohistochemical distribution of E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin in four human bronchial cancer cell lines with different invasive abilities and in 44 <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> tumors. Although invasive bronchial cell lines did not express E-cadherin and α-catenin, complete down-regulation of cadherin-catenin complex expression was a rare event in vivo in bronchopulmonary carcinomas. Nevertheless, a spotty and cytoplasmic pattern of E-cadherin and catenins was observed in 32 primary tumors, only in invasive tumor clusters. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that this redistribution was not related to a disruption of cadherin-catenin interaction but to down-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin. We conclude that loss of E-cadherin and/or catenins is not a prominent early event in the invasive progression of human bronchopulmonary carcinomas in vivo. The decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin may reflect a loss of functionality of the complex and implicates a major role in tumor invasion...|$|R
40|$|Ki-ras {{activation}} by {{point mutation}} on codon 12 {{has been reported}} in non-small-cell lung carcinomas and in various models of experimental lung tumours induced by chemical carcinogens. The cellular targets for carcinogenic compounds of tobacco smoke are usually considered to be the cells of the bronchial mucosa or alveolar epithelium. However, little is known about preneoplastic events in bronchopulmonary carcinogenesis. The hypothesis of the presence of widespread target cells containing Ki-ras mutation was investigated by evaluating concurrent neoplastic and non-neoplastic bronchial and alveolar samples from 51 patients with non-small-cell lung carcinomas. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method used can detect one cell with a mutation on codon 12 among 10 (2) normal cells. In tumour samples, a mutation was detected in 20 % of adenocarcinomas, but in none of the adenosquamous or squamous cell carcinomas. No mutation was detected in the non-neoplastic bronchial or parenchymal samples. When using an enriched PCR-RFLP method detecting one mutated allele among 10 (3) normal alleles a mutation was detected in 23 % of adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, Ki-ras activation by mutation on codon 12 was not observed in non-neoplastic bronchial or parenchymal tissues in patients with <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>cancers</b> and {{does not appear to be}} a genetic event present in non-malignant epithelial target cells exposed to tobacco smoke...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} 38 -year-old {{woman with a}} left lung tumor {{presenting}} as obstructive pneumonia. Bronchoscopic examination revealed a polypoid tumor filling the left main bronchus. The tumor was partially resected by a snaring procedure for diagnostic purposes. Microscopic examination revealed a submucosal tumor located underneath normal bronchial epithelium. The tumor was composed of sheets of uniform oval to cuboidal cells encompassing numerous blood vessels. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells exhibited smooth muscle markers, but were negative for neuroendocrine markers. The diagnosis of primary pulmonary glomus tumor was therefore made. Subsequent bronchoscopic intervention allowed us to pin-point {{the origin of the}} tumor: superior segmental B 6 a/b. She underwent a left lower lobe superior segmental resection successfully. Glomus tumors are relatively rare soft tissue tumors, and those of bronchopulmonary origin are exceedingly rare clinical condition. Among primary lung tumors, the carcinoid tumor is a mimic of the glomus tumor, and differentiating these tumors is known to be difficult, especially using small biopsy samples. In the present case, a large tissue sample obtained by bronchoscopic snaring was quite useful for the correct preoperative diagnosis. Because of the disease rarity, malignancy grade estimation of visceral glomus tumors has not been clearly addressed. Recently, the histopathological diagnostic criteria for malignant glomus tumors was defined in the WHO classification of soft tissue and bone tumors 4 th edition. Here we also reviewed the literature on <b>primary</b> <b>bronchopulmonary</b> glomus tumors with special attention to the current concept of malignancy grade estimation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgical {{resection}} {{has been}} advocated {{as an effective}} treatment for hepatic neuroendocrine tumors (HNETs) in Western countries, but few data are available to define its indications. We evaluated the results of Japanese patients to determine the prognostic factors and the feasibility of our aggressive surgical approach. Methods: The records of all consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for HNETs at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were selected for surgery if all tumors were deemed resectable, regardless of their extent. Results: A total of 21 patients were identified. Bilobar disease was present in 13 patients (62 %). Eleven patients (52 %) underwent major hepatectomy, which included right trisectio-nectomy, extended right or left hepatectomy and right hepatectomy. No in-hospital death occurred. The overall 1 -, 3 - and 5 -year survival rates were 95, 68 and 41 %, respectively, with a median follow-up of 34 months. Metastatic HNETs from <b>bronchopulmonary</b> <b>primaries</b> exhib-ited significantly poor outcome compared with other primary sites (P 0. 04). Patients who underwent curative resection had an improved overall 5 -year survival rate of 73 % compared with palliative resection (0 %, P 0. 01).

The majority of mice with heterozygous loss-of-function of Foxf 1 exhibit neonatal lethality with evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage in some of them. By comparing transcriptomes of human ACDMPV lungs with control lungs using expression arrays, we found that several genes and pathways involved in lung development, angiogenesis, and in pulmonary hypertension development, were deregulated. Similar transcriptional changes were found in lungs of the postnatal day 0. 5 Foxf 1 +/- mice when compared to their wildtype littermate controls; 14 genes, COL 15 A 1, COL 18 A 1, COL 6 A 2, ESM 1, FSCN 1, GRINA, IGFBP 3, IL 1 B, MALL, NOS 3, RASL 11 B, MATN 2, PRKCDBP, and SIRPA, were found common to both ACDMPV and Foxf 1 heterozygous lungs.

40|$|Abstract Fractional exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (FeNO) {{is a useful}} tool to {{diagnose}} and monitor eosinophilic bronchial inflammation in asthmatic children and adults. In children younger than 2 years of age FeNO has been successfully measured both with the tidal breathing and with the single breath techniques. However, {{there are a number}} of methodological issues that need to be addressed in order to increase the reproducibility of the FeNO measurements within and between infants. Indeed, a standardized method to measure FeNO in the first 2 years of life would be extremely useful in order to meaningfully interpret FeNO values in this age group. Several factors related to the measurement conditions have been found to influence FeNO, such as expiratory flow, ambient NO and nasal contamination. Furthermore, the exposure to pre- and postnatal risk factors for respiratory morbidity has been shown to influence FeNO values. Therefore, these factors should always be assessed and their association with FeNO values in the specific study population should be evaluated and, eventually, controlled for. There is evidence consistently suggesting that FeNO is increased in infants with family history of atopy/atopic diseases and in infants with recurrent wheezing. These findings could support the hypothesis that eosinophilic bronchial inflammation is present at an early stage in those infants at increased risk of developing persistent respiratory symptoms and asthma. Furthermore, it has been shown that FeNO measurements could represent a useful tool to assess bronchial inflammation in other airways diseases, such as <b>primary</b> ciliary dyskinesia, <b>bronchopulmonary</b> dysplasia and cystic fibrosis. Further studies are needed in order to improve the reproducibility of the measurements, and large prospective studies are warranted in order to evaluate whether FeNO values measured in the first years of life can predict the future development of asthma or other respiratory diseases. </p...|$|R

Methods: We randomly assigned 1273 infants born before 29 weeks of gestation (stratified according to sex, gestational age [< 27 weeks or 27 to < 29 weeks], and center) within 3 days after their first enteral feeding to receive either an enteral emulsion providing DHA at a dose of 60 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or a control (soy) emulsion without DHA until 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. The <b>primary</b> outcome was <b>bronchopulmonary</b> dysplasia, defined on a physiological basis (with the use of oxygen-saturation monitoring in selected infants), at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home, whichever occurred first. Result s: A total of 1205 infants survived to the primary outcome assessment. Of the 592 infants assigned to the DHA group, 291 (49. 1 % by multiple imputation) were classified as having physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as compared with 269 (43. 9 %) of the 613 infants assigned to the control group (relative risk adjusted for randomization strata, 1. 13; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 02 to 1. 25; P = 0. 02). The composite outcome of physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death before 36 weeks of postmenstrual age occurred in 52. 3 % of the infants in the DHA group and in 46. 4 % of the infants in the control group (adjusted relative risk, 1. 11; 95 % CI, 1. 00 to 1. 23; P = 0. 045).
