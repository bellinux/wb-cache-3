The main contribution of this diploma thesis is to identify the global indicators, which should be considered when drafting strategies in the fight against the legalization of <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> <b>crimes.</b> This diploma thesis addresses the changes caused by current globalization and highlights the dangerous effects it has on evolution of this consequent criminal activity together with evaluation of its potential in the future. Due to the tense situation in Europe caused by the series of terrorist attacks, part of the work is dedicated to the explanation of the relationship between terrorist financing and money laundering...|$|R
5000|$|Misuse of the {{financial}} system {{is not limited to}} money laundering schemes designed to preserve and maximise <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> <b>crimes</b> which have been committed. The financial system is misused in similar ways to fund terrorist atrocities. After the September 11 attacks, the international community rapidly recognised the important similarities between the processes involved in money laundering and in the financing of terrorism. Traditionally, the financing of terrorism stemmed from illegal activities, e.g. bank robberies, weapons and drug trafficking, etc. However, in recent years, a new phenomenon had grown: the carrying out of legitimate activities to finance terrorist actions. In this case, the phenomenon is the opposite of money laundering: the [...] "clean" [...] money collected through charities, legitimate commercial activities and so on, can be used to finance terrorist actions. The above considerations led to the Council of Europe’s decision to update the 1990 Strasbourg Convention.|$|R

50|$|A long firm fraud (also {{known as}} a {{consumer}} credit fraud) is a fraud that uses a trading company set up for fraudulent purposes; the basic operation is to run the company as an apparently legitimate business by buying goods and paying suppliers promptly to secure a good credit record. Once they are sufficiently well-established, the perpetrators then purchase {{the next round of}} goods on credit and decamp with both the goods and profits from previous sales. The goods can then be sold elsewhere. The procedure needs {{a certain amount of money}} to set up, often the <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> another <b>crime</b> or a previous long firm. Sometimes the individual who does jail time for assisting with the fraud is paid for their time served.|$|R

5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> his <b>crimes</b> supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle who dropped in to visit him on his way home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|R

The creation of a Select Committee of Experts on international cooperation as regards search, seizure and confiscation of the <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> <b>crime</b> (PC-R-SC) was proposed by the CDPC at its 36th Plenary Session in June 1987 and authorised by the Committee of Ministers in September 1987.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the structure of, and trends in, reported occupational safety crimes. The central focus is directed at analysing how we might understand the substantial increase in the number of reported offences witnessed during the first decade of the 21 st century. In order to analyse trends in occupational safety <b>crimes</b> we <b>proceed</b> <b>from</b> both official <b>crime</b> statistics and data that have been compiled specifically for the purposes of this study, including a nationally representative sample of offence reports relating to the occupational safety crimes reported to the police. The results show that the increase in reported offenses is primarily due to a shift in definitions and in the reactions of the authorities rather than to a powerful increase in the number of actual crimes committed. This leads to the conclusion that registered occupational safety offences should first and foremost be viewed as a measure of the work of the authorities, rather than as an indicator of real crime trends...|$|R
