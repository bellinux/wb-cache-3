40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to devote the {{development}} of new radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine application and methods of quality assurance stressing the pharmaceutical aspects. Preparation, distribution, storage and use of radiopharmaceuticals involves a number of pharmaceuticals and radiation protection problems emphasized by the rapidly increasing use of this type of drug relevant for the patient, for the staff and for the environment. To study the pharmaceutical aspects of radiopharmaceuticals is important to show the possible conflict between radiation protection and pharmaceutical viewpoints. Establishment of the clear specific character of radiopharmaceuticals as a pharmaceuticals is important to assume the responsibility that all radiopharmaceuticals have satisfactory quality, e. g. by purchasing, controlling and distributing radioactive drug, suitable preparation with the low toxicity and high efficiency, free from radiochemical impurities chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological. The emphasis is given to the rules governing the manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals and the importance of specifications given by the pharmacopoeia, which are obligatory.

50|$|The major {{emphasis}} in biomedicine, engineering and other technical professions {{to date has}} been on issues within a particular profession, with insufficient attention to larger societal problems. <b>Pharmaceuticals</b> present <b>particular</b> macroethical challenges. Drug designers seek to prevent and treatment diseases by modifying of stem cells and producing targeting drugs that have specific targeting mechanisms. However, these technological advances must be balanced possible contravening risks (e.g. side effects, transgenerational adverse impacts in progeny, and unwanted genetic expressions), as well as ethical challenges (e.g. immorality of treating unborn human beings as objects to be harvested). Thus, researchers are obliged to advance technologies, but must do so within acceptable ethical boundaries. If a researcher only acts {{within the bounds of}} one's research, i.e. exclusively microethical, the research may still be unacceptable from a societal perspective if it violates macroethical principles.|$|R

40|$|Permethrin entered {{use in the}} 1970 ’s as an {{insecticide}} with a {{wide range}} of applications, including agriculture, horticultural and forestry, which have since been restricted. In the twenty first century, the presence of permethrin in the aquatic environment has been attributed to its use as a human and veterinary <b>pharmaceutical,</b> in <b>particular</b> as a pedeculicide, in addition to other uses such as a moth proofing agent. However, as a consequence of its toxicity to fish, sources of permethrin and its fate and behavior during wastewater treatment is a topic of concern. This study has established that high overall removal of permethrin (c. 90 %) was achieved during wastewater treatment and that this was strongly dependent upon the extent of biological degradation in secondary treatment, with more limited subsequent removal in tertiary treatment processes. Sources of permethrin in the catchment matched well with measured values in crude sewage and indicated that 2 domestic use accounted for over half of the load to the treatment works.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{characterization}} of the quaternary system composed of water, triacetin (oil), ethanol (alcohol), and Tween 80 (surfactant), as its results enable the enhancement of the bioavailability of nimesulide, a poorly water soluble nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug widely employed in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> field. <b>Particular</b> attention {{is devoted to the}} surfactant-free ternary system, as it proved able to solubilize nimesulide as well, and the absence of a surfactant is desirable {{in order to keep the}} preparation as tolerable as possible. Both bulk and interfacial properties of this system are investigated, and a mathematical model to calculate the interface composition of a threecomponent two-phase system is developed. This model is based on Gibbs’ theory on interfaces, which considers an arbitrary mathematical dividing surface so that the two phases continue uniformly up to it, although interface regions have no sharply defined boundaries. We find that both the quaternary and the ternary systems investigated show a miscibility lacuna and that, in the surfactant-free ternary system, an increase of the ethanol weight fraction is reflected as an impoverishment of the ethanol interfacial molar fraction.  2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{innovative}} activity, as measured by patent indicators, in pharmaceutical and biotechnological sectors in the Nordic Countries. The biotech sector in general and <b>pharmaceutical</b> in <b>particular</b> is one of the areas selected for strategic investments in every Nordic country. In terms of patents granted by country of inventors Denmark plays a leading role followed by Sweden, while patenting activity in Finland and Norway is lower. A concentration of patents towards a relative small number of assignees (mainly large biotech and pharmaceutical companies based in Denmark and Sweden) is also observed. Norwegian patents, as measured by patent citations indices, are more “important” than those of the other countries, as well as in terms of relative size of innovations. Although there are other contributing factors, our data suggest that geographical proximity to large pharmaceutical companies plays a role in determining the relative success of national policies, and also that new investment policies in countries where large biotech or pharmaceutical companies are not established can yield positive returns in terms of innovation growth.
