We analyse how different degrees of substitutatibility/complementarity between private and public consumption and a pro/counter-cyclical stance of fiscal policy affect equilibrium determinacy and the response of the model economy {{to a wide range of}} shocks. Results show that determinacy is ensured by counter-cyclical fiscal policy under complementarity; increasing substitutability also <b>pro-cyclical</b> <b>stance</b> becomes stable.

40|$|Inflationary {{pressures}} that had heightened in the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) since 2003 have moderated in recent times. This paper studies {{the determinants of}} inflation in GCC, using an empirical model that includes domestic and external factors. Inflation in major trading partners {{appears to be the}} most relevant foreign factor. In addition, oil revenues have reinforced inflationary pressures through higher growth of credit and aggregate spending. In the short-run, binding capacity constraints also explain higher inflation in the face of higher government spending. Nonetheless, by targeting supply-side bottlenecks, the increase in public spending on capital is easing capacity constraints and will ultimately help to moderate price inflation. The results highlight the need to mitigate the <b>pro-cyclical</b> <b>stance</b> of fiscal policy to avoid exacerbating cyclical swings. Moreover, prioritizing fiscal spending to address structural bottlenecks should take priority to avoid inflationary pressures and ease capacity constraints towards reducing overdependence on oil activity. Inflation, external shocks, domestic policies, exchange rate pass-through...|$|E

Â© OECD 2012 2 Summary The Netherlands is expected to see growth resume only slowly, implying further increases in unemployment in the short term. Current fiscal targets imply a <b>pro-cyclical</b> <b>stance</b> {{for the next couple of}} years. In the medium term, economic performance will be affected by continued globalisation and ageing of the labour force. In this perspective, structural fiscal consolidation measures are necessary to secure fiscal sustainability, but the government should also prepare the business sector for the ongoing challenges of globalisation, and adapt labour market institutions for an older and shrinking labour force. Government finances should be brought under control to support confidence, comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, and secure fiscal sustainability. In the case of...|$|E
40|$|This policy brief {{defines the}} {{challenges}} of conducting appropriate fiscal policy over the past 20 years in four Caribbean countries (The Bahamas, Barbados, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago) and reviews international financial institutions' technical assistance and advice on tax and expenditures policies. The review finds that national authorities usually agree with the policy recommendations of the international financial institutions in most areas but disagree with the pace and scale of policy implementation. Moreover, delays in implementing required policy action at a suitable pace in many instances {{may have contributed to}} a <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal <b>stance</b> and worsened the region's fiscal accounts. In future designs of technical assistance, some Caribbean-specific features need to be taken into account. The authors analyze current conditions and provide viable recommendations. ...|$|R
40|$|The Stability and Growth Pact sets a {{medium-term}} {{target for}} fiscal policy of a budgetary position 'close to balance or in surplus'. This {{addition to the}} deficit rule defined by the Maastricht Treaty has been interpreted {{as an attempt to}} reconciliate the objective of sound public finances with the availability of adequate margins for stabilisation. However, with the debt rule set in the Treaty unchanged, there is a risk that the Pact will not fully achieve the desired reconciliation. Using the budget to implement stabilisation policy while still ensuring a reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio during cyclical downturns, as required by the Treaty, is likely to require large structural surpluses. Assuming positive nominal growth rates, the closer the debt ratio is to 60 per cent the larger are the surpluses needed. If countries with debt ratios higher than 60 per cent set insufficiently ambitious deficit targets, {{they will not be able}} to make full use of the margins allowed by the 3 per cent threshold. During cyclical downturns such countries may have to adopt a <b>pro-cyclical</b> budgetary <b>stance.</b> The regulation of the interaction between deficit and debt rules is complicated by the EU definitions of debt and deficit, as they refer to different groups of transactions and are based on different accounting conventions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{principal}} {{concerns of}} this paper are with the roles partisan politics have played {{in the making of}} fiscal and monetary policies within the OECD countries as well as {{the extent to which these}} policies have complemented each other. It is argued that parties of the left pursue fiscal policies that are distinctly different from those pursued by the right. The critical difference is in the way these parties use fiscal policy as a corrective mechanism for dealing with macroeconomic problems: leftist parties adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policies while right-wing parties adhere to <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal <b>stances.</b> The paper also examines two arguments regarding monetary policy and how partisan politics influences affect this policy area. The first and most conventional argument sees the formal independence of the central bank from government as a means of negating partisan influences on monetary policy; the second advances the proposition that, regardless of central bank independence, monetary authorities are not politically neutral but instead share views similar to those of parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum. Empirical analyses, using a pooled cross-section time-series design with data from 14 countries extending from 1961 through 1994, produces evidence in favor of the argument laid out on the role of partisanship in fiscal policy; it also shows little support for the view that central bank independence inhibits partisan influences while at the same time provides support for the thesis that central banks are politically non-neutral. Thus, coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is far less likely to occur when left-wing parties are in power...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{sources of}} {{volatility}} and vulnerability in the CEECs {{during the transition}} and leading up to EU accession. The Paper emphasizes {{the role of the}} transition shock as a source of extreme volatility on a much larger scale than the one observed during crises in emerging markets. The low degree of financial and institutional development, which lagged behind the opening of domestic markets to foreign trade, was of paramount importance for the severity of the economic contraction. Pro-cyclical fiscal policy and institutional uncertainties amplified output volatility. Many factors will contribute to more stability in the CEECs in the years ahead. EU integration has given a credibility bonus to the reform efforts of the CEECs, has driven the process of institutional convergence to EU structures, and has led to improvements in the functioning of markets, protection of property rights, contract and law enforcement. Convergence to EU macroeconomic targets has also taken place, reflecting remarkable progress in economic reform, while the deepening of real integration with other EU countries will sharply reduce the magnitude of idiosyncratic shock to CEECs. EU accession criteria will facilitate trade by reducing transaction costs and introducing common standards, and continue to attract capital flows. Still, as long as financial markets in the CEECs remain much less developed than those in the EU, output volatility is bound to remain higher in the CEECs than in the EU. Although our analysis indicates that at present the risk of capital flow reversal is low, with their complete liberalization financial capital flow volatility in the CEECs may increase, and if not adequately regulated, financial markets may become more vulnerable to turbulence in international markets. Greater openness of the capital account will constrain the flexibility of the CEECs in using macroeconomic and monetary policy, leaving fiscal policy as the only additional instrument to deal with conflicting domestic and external priorities. The adoption of existing rules in the EU is unlikely to overcome the <b>pro-cyclical</b> <b>stance</b> of fiscal policy displayed by CEECs during the transition period. Off-budgetary expenditures and contingent liabilities that may become explicit government liabilities also pose a risk to state finances. accession countries; pro-cyclical fiscal policy; under-developed financial markets; volatility...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} {{a model of the}} monetary policy process, and an application of the model to the post-World War I financial and macroeconomic policy system. ^ Orthodox money multiplier models mis-specify the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy. An alternative model is constructed from the micro-foundations of the credit supply process. The model locates the transmission channel of monetary policy in the impact of policy initiatives on the expectations of portfolio holders in the financial markets. If monetary policy initiatives have a negligible impact on expectations, they will not {{have a significant impact on}} the course of real economic activity in a capitalist economy with sophisticated financial markets and more than nominal business cycles. ^ The expectations formation process is analyzed to derive the institutional configuration and policy stance that contribute to a tight connection between monetary policy initiatives and the expected profitability of credit creation. ^ The analysis concludes that monetary policy, while potentially powerful, is an inherently unstable platform for macroeconomic control. The monetary authority 2 Ì 7 s control of expectations can fluctuate dramatically in a short space of time. If the monetary authority is viewed as technically weak vis a vis market forces or politically vulnerable to competing macroeconomic policy centers, it will face rapid and severe declines in monetary policy effectiveness. ^ The motivation for the construction of the postwar financial order was a great fear by the elites of the social and political consequences of modest amounts of inflation. The central bank was elevated to the status of a macroecomonic planner, and given the task of keeping the economy inflation free, and provided with a monopoly on macroeconomic policy. An asymmetrical, <b>pro-cyclical</b> policy <b>stance</b> promised to cap booms and promote 2 Ì 2 liquidations, 2 Ì 2 that is, to enforce a severe recession following an expansion. Robust central bank independence protected unpopular policies. ^ The system was effective, but chronically inflexible, being deliberately designed to be inhospitable to expansionary policy, and incapable of conforming to policy pressures from the electorate. During 1929 - 1933 the system worked as design, and paralyzed expansionary macroeconomic policy initiatives. The disastrous results discredited the system and its supporters. ...|$|R
