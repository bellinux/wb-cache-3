5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in aquaria, and <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg {{led to the}} discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 William Champion, and Lord Dysart, {{operators}} {{of the nearby}} Twickenham Ferry, took legal action against Hammerton to remove his right to operate the ferry. Although Hammerton won the initial case, the judgement was reversed on appeal.

5|$|In addition, it {{also appears}} that an applicant's {{subjective}} motivation {{is relevant to}} {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing.

5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{the scandal}} {{eventually}} faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited {{by members of}} the upper class.

5|$|Ecotourism setups {{are being}} used to {{generate}} <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> charismatic animals such as the jaguar, {{while at the same time}} generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Girl Pat affair {{was enough for}} Gaumont British to {{consider}} making it {{the subject of a}} feature film.

Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E
