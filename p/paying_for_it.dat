5|$|The episode {{somewhat}} parodies the AIG bonus payments {{controversy that}} occurred in March 2009 when it was publicly disclosed that AIG—an American insurance corporation—was paying approximately $200 million in bonus payments to employees of its financial services division. In the episode, NBC page Kenneth Parcell, along with other pages, wants {{to be paid for}} overtime, however, NBC has stopped <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to save money. Later, Kenneth receives General Electric executive Jack Donaghy's large bonus check by accident and is angered by this, and as a result, Kenneth rallies all the pages to strike. Despite hiring Lenny to try and end the strike, Jack finally gives in to Kenneth's demand. Television reviewer Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune noted that the strike here was {{similar to that of the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E

25|$|The year 1970 was a bittersweet, {{mixed and}} eventful one for Moore. He was again named as captain for the 1970 World Cup {{but there was}} heavy {{disruption}} to preparations when {{an attempt was made}} to implicate Moore in the theft of a bracelet from a jeweller in Bogotá, Colombia, where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Moore had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> While there was no doubt that Moore had been in the shop (having entered with Bobby Charlton to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Moore was arrested and then released. He then travelled with the England team to play another match against Ecuador in Quito. He played, winning his 80th cap, and England were 2–0 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Moore was detained and placed under four days of house arrest. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and an exonerated Moore returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. Moore received a guard of honour from his squad {{when he arrived at the}} team hotel.|$|E

500|$|Metcalfe's {{primary concern}} as {{governor}} {{was the issue}} of internal improvements. Among his proposed projects were a road connecting Shelbyville to Louisville and a canal on the Falls of the Ohio. When President Andrew Jackson vetoed funds to construct a turnpike connecting Maysville and Lexington, Metcalfe built it anyway, <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> entirely with state funds. Following his term as governor, {{he served in the}} state senate, and completed the unfinished term of John J. Crittenden in the U.S. Senate in 1848.

500|$|One {{potential}} solution {{has been}} outlined in a 2016 {{agreement between the}} Bureau of Reclamation, the local water districts {{and a number of}} other state and federal agencies. The local water districts would provide [...] of water for fishery flows during the spring; this water would be sold to the San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority. Instead of draining into the ocean, it would be captured by the large Central Valley Project and State Water Project pumping stations in the Delta for eventual re-use on Authority lands. Previously, Reclamation had been taking the Stanislaus irrigation districts' water without <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Essentially, the agreement allows for the water to be re-used for agriculture while still maintaining fishery flows in the Stanislaus River.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth—an NBC page—goes to Jack {{worried that}} he cannot {{honestly}} sign his timesheet because Kenneth worked many overtime hours but NBC has stopped <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to save money. Jack convinces him to sign the sheet, but Kenneth later accidentally receives a large bonus check of Jack's instead of his own paycheck. Kenneth grows angry over the bonus and leads a page strike. The strike grows in size as other trade unions join it, along with Tracy {{in an attempt to}} join the common man. Jack hires private detective Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to try to end the strike, but he fails. Finally, Jack admits to Kenneth that he is a [...] "big ol' liar" [...] and Kenneth ends the strike (though he nearly reveals to the other pages it was over a personal matter).|$|E
