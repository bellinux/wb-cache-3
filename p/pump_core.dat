40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} Ca 2 + ATPases (PMCA pumps) have a long, cytosolic C-terminal regulatory region where a calmodulin-binding domain (CaM-BD) is located. Under basal conditions (low Ca 2 +), the C-terminal {{tail of the}} pump interacts with autoinhibitory sites proximal to the active center of the enzyme. In activating conditions (i. e., high Ca 2 +), Ca 2 +-bound CaM displaces the C-terminal tail from the autoinhibitory sites, restoring activity. We have recently identified a G 1107 D replacement within the CaM-BD of isoform 3 of the PMCA pump in a family affected by X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia. Here, we investigate {{the effects of the}} G 1107 D replacement on the interplay of the mutated CaM-BD with both CaM and the <b>pump</b> <b>core,</b> by combining computational, biochemical and functional approaches. We provide evidence that the affinity of the isolated mutated CaM-BD for CaM is significantly reduced with respect to the wild type (wt) counterpart, and that the ability of CaM to activate the pump in vitro is thus decreased. Multiscale simulations support the conclusions on the detrimental effect of the mutation, indicating reduced stability of the CaM binding. We further show that the G 1107 D replacement impairs the autoinhibition mechanism of the PMCA 3 pump as well, as the introduction of a negative charge perturbs the contacts between the CaM-BD and the <b>pump</b> <b>core.</b> Thus, the mutation affects both the ability of the pump to optimally transport Ca 2 + in the activated state, and the autoinhibition mechanism in its resting state...|$|E
40|$|The design {{variables}} of an annular linear induction electromagnetic pump (ALIP) for SFR thermal hydraulic experimental loop were analysed magnetohydrodynamically. The theoretical model of ALIP was configured for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) analysis.

The developed pressure {{was found to}} be a function of {{design variables}}, including the geometrical variables of <b>pump</b> <b>core</b> length, inner core diameter and flow gap, and the electromagnetic ones of turns of coils, frequency and input current. The developed pressure from the MHD analysis was compared and identified with the developed pressure derived by an equivalent circuit method leading to Laithewaite's standard design formula for a linear induction electromagnetic pump. The design characteristic of the electromagnetic pump was analyzed according to the change of the pump's geometric and electromagnetic variables, taking into account hydraulic friction pressure loss in the narrow annular gap of the pump.

The proposed structure consists of a dichromatically coated planar convex lens spliced to an Ytterbium-doped double-clad photonic crystal fiber surrounded by multiple pump fibers. The lens is also used as a protecting end cap where the laser beam expands before exiting the surface. The pump fibers are also attached in this lens circularly surrounding fibers. The lens images these pump fibers end facets into the <b>pump</b> <b>core,</b> where the lens surface is coated by a dichroic mirror (reflective for 980 nm, transmissive for > 1030 nm). The allglass structure, assembled by laser splicing, makes the system stable, efficient and suitable for high power operation.

40|$|To {{investigate}} how calmodulin regulates a unique subfamily of Ca 2 + pumps found in plants, {{we examined the}} kinetic properties of isoform ACA 2 identified in Arabidopsis. A recombinant ACA 2 was expressed in a yeast K 616 mutant deficient in two endogenous Ca 2 + pumps. Orthovanadate-sensitive 45 Ca 2 + transport into vesicles isolated from transformants demonstrated that ACA 2 is a Ca 2 + pump. Ca 2 + pumping by the full-length protein (ACA 2 - 1) was 4 - to 10 -fold {{lower than that of}} the N-terminal truncated ACA 2 - 2 (Δ 2 – 80), indicating that the N-terminal domain normally acts to inhibit the pump. An inhibitory sequence (IC 50 = 4 μm) was localized to a region within valine- 20 to leucine- 44, because a peptide corresponding to this sequence lowered the Vmax and increased the Km for Ca 2 + of the constitutively active ACA 2 - 2 to values comparable to the full-length pump. The peptide also blocked the activity (IC 50 = 7 μm) of a Ca 2 + pump (AtECA 1) belonging to a second family of Ca 2 + pumps. This inhibitory sequence appears to overlap with a calmodulin-binding site in ACA 2, previously mapped between asparatate- 19 and arginine- 36 (J. F. Harper, B. Hong, I. Hwang, H. Q. Guo, R. Stoddard, J. F. Huang, M. G. Palmgren, H. Sze [1998] J Biol Chem 273 : 1099 – 1106). These results support a model in which the pump is kept “unactivated” by an intramolecular interaction between an autoinhibitory sequence located between residues 20 and 44 and a site in the Ca 2 + <b>pump</b> <b>core</b> that is highly conserved between different Ca 2 + pump families. Results further support a model in which activation occurs as a result of Ca 2 +-induced binding of calmodulin to a site overlapping or immediately adjacent to the autoinhibitory sequence...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} my {{work on the}} development and fabrication of fibres for beam delivery and generation. In all cases it is assumed the fibres will be suitable for high power applications. I describe the challenges of fabrication and refinements to existing techniques needed to produce and characterise the diverse fibres. Two jacketed air clad (JAC) fibres with square cores are developed. One is a passive delivery fibre that has capacity to capture a larger beam parameter product than other research and commercial fibres and was designed to deliver the output from a 1800 W diode source. The second jacketed air clad fibre has an inner core doped with Yb ions and a shaped <b>pump</b> <b>core</b> defined by a large NA air cladding. This gave reduced fibre length in an amplifier (compared to a conventional rare earth double clad fibre) providing an advantage {{with respect to the}} onset of non linear spectral broadening. Two all-solid photonic bandgap fibres (S-PBGF) for beam delivery from a fibre laser with a wavelength of 1070 nm and simultaneous rejection of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) light at a wavelength of 1126 nm are presented. The fibres gave larger MFD near 1 µm with SRS suppression than other published results {{at the time of this}} work. A new type of leakage channel fibre, called the micro-clad leakage channel fibre (micro-clad LCF), is demonstrated for the first time. This fibre type is intended for both beam delivery and in future fibres with an inner core doped with rare earth ions, for beam generation. I present the fabrication and characterisation of an exemplar fibre with mode area of 1440 µm 2. A class of simple antiresonant hollow core fibres are investigated. Various single cladding layer fiber structures are examined. I show that the spacing between core and jacket glass and the shape of the support struts can be used to optimize confinement loss. I demonstrate the detrimental effect on confinement loss of thick nodes at the strut intersections and present a fabricated hexagram fibre that mitigates this effect in both straight and bent condition by presenting radially aligned nodes. This fibre has loss comparable to published results for a first generation, multi-cladding ring, Kagome fibre with negative core curvature and has tolerable bend loss for many practical applications...|$|E

An alternative to produce gain and power in optical fiber is to use nonlinear effect such as stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). SRS is wavelength agile, limited only by the transparency range of the fiber and the pump power wavelength.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new {{geometry}} of clad-pumped fiber amplifier/laser that includes {{at least one}} doped core which guides the signal wave {{and at least one}} clad region that guides the incoherent pump. Our proposed geometry enables the incoherent diode pump light to be efficiently absorbed by the doped glass core over very short lengths on the order of a few to tens of centimeters. The transparent cladding is realized as a narrow slab with refractive index higher than that of the core. The slab is designed to effectively capture all of the incoherent pump light and is tapered to force the highly-moded incoherent guided light into the strongly absorbing core. Modes of this composite waveguide structure are analysed in this paper. Criteria are established in terms of the refractive indices of the core, slab and cladding that ensure efficient absorption of the pump light in the core while ensuring that only a single or few lowest order signal modes can propagate in the amplifying core. Numerical simulations with the Beam Propagation Method and a modal expansion technique confirm that a significant enhancement of the absorption efficiency of the <b>pump</b> in the <b>core</b> can be realized by tapering the slab waveguide.
