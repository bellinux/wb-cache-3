50|$|Dredge <b>pipe</b> {{pieces are}} a variety of <b>pipes</b> on board of {{dredgers}} like bend <b>pipe,</b> T-pipe, pitched T-pipe, Y-pipe, cross <b>pipe,</b> strait <b>pipe,</b> and conical <b>pipe.</b> These dredge <b>pipe</b> pieces are used on-board of dredgers to connect the dredge pump with the discharge <b>pipe.</b> Mostly the <b>pipes</b> are made from cast steel. Sometime welded <b>pipes</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pipe</b> {{support or}} <b>pipe</b> hanger is a {{designed}} element that transfer the load from a <b>pipe</b> to the supporting structures. The load includes {{the weight of}} the <b>pipe</b> proper, the content that the <b>pipe</b> carries, all the <b>pipe</b> fittings attached to <b>pipe,</b> and the <b>pipe</b> covering such as insulation. The four main functions of a <b>pipe</b> support are to anchor, guide, absorb shock, and support a specified load. <b>Pipe</b> supports used in high or low temperature applications may contain insulation materials. The overall design configuration of a <b>pipe</b> support assembly is dependent on the loading and operating conditions.|$|R
3000|$|... <b>pipe</b> {{size and}} {{material}} {{information such as}} available diameters, unit costs, <b>pipe</b> wall roughness, wall thickness and embodied energy. For new <b>pipes,</b> this information will be easily obtained from the <b>pipe</b> manufacturer. For existing systems, however, {{there may be some}} uncertainty in these parameters if detailed records of the ‘as constructed’ system and any <b>pipe</b> replacements have not been kept. In addition to this, the <b>pipe</b> wall roughness of existing <b>pipes</b> will generally be uncertain. <b>Pipe</b> wall roughness increase as <b>pipes</b> age, and <b>pipe</b> condition assessment may be needed to provide an estimate.|$|R

5|$|Access to an {{improved}} water source is universal in Japan. 97% {{of the population}} receives <b>piped</b> water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms. By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had <b>piped</b> water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and <b>piped</b> gas and street lighting had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
50|$|Large-diameter <b>pipe</b> (25 cm or greater) may be ERW, EFW or Submerged Arc Welded ("SAW") <b>pipe.</b> There are two {{technologies}} {{that can be}} used to manufacture steel <b>pipes</b> of sizes larger than the steel <b>pipes</b> that can be produced by seamless and ERW processes. The two types of <b>pipes</b> produced through these technologies are longitudinal-submerged arc-welded (LSAW) and spiral-submerged arc-welded (SSAW) <b>pipes.</b> LSAW are made by bending and welding wide steel plates and most commonly used in oil and gas industry applications. Due to their high cost, LSAW <b>pipes</b> are seldom used in lower value non-energy applications such as water pipelines. SSAW <b>pipes</b> are produced by spiral (helicoidal) welding of steel coil and have a cost advantage over LSAW <b>pipes,</b> as the process uses coils rather than steel plates. As such, in applications where spiral-weld is acceptable, SSAW <b>pipes</b> may be preferred over LSAW <b>pipes.</b> Both LSAW <b>pipes</b> and SSAW <b>pipes</b> compete against ERW <b>pipes</b> and seamless <b>pipes</b> in the diameter ranges of 16”-24”.|$|R
50|$|AMERICAN Steel <b>Pipe,</b> {{based in}} Birmingham, Alabama, {{produces}} electric-resistance-welded steel <b>pipe.</b> Applications include high pressure {{oil and gas}} transmission lines, distribution main lines, offshore gathering systems, steel <b>pipe</b> pilings, abrasive-resistance <b>pipe,</b> HIC resistant <b>pipe</b> for sour service, dredge <b>pipe,</b> and product pipelines.|$|R
5000|$|Insulated <b>pipes</b> (called also preinsulated <b>pipes</b> or bonded <b>pipe</b> [...] ) {{are widely}} used for {{district}} heating and hot water supply in Europe. They consist of a steel <b>pipe,</b> an insulating layer, and an outer casing. The main purpose of such <b>pipes</b> is to maintain {{the temperature of the}} fluid in the <b>pipes.</b> A common application is the hot water from district heating plants. Most commonly used are single insulated <b>pipes,</b> but more recently in Europe it is becoming popular to use two <b>pipes</b> insulated within the same casing. By using insulated <b>pipe</b> supports, direct heat transfer between <b>pipes</b> and their supports are prevented.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, a company <b>piped</b> waste from the {{production}} of illuminating gas (for gas lighting) into Mahanoy Creek. In Gilberton, Mahanoy Creek used to be underground, but surfaced before 1940.|$|E

5|$|Both the East Riding and Hull {{are still}} {{covered by the}} Humberside Police area and the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. <b>Piped</b> water is {{supplied}} by Yorkshire Water who also maintain the sewerage system. About 1% of the population use water from private supplies. They are usually in the more remote parts of the East Riding. The majority are bore holes {{but they can be}} wells or natural springs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pipe</b> band {{is another}} common format for {{highland}} piping, with top competitive bands including the Victoria Police <b>Pipe</b> Band from Australia (formerly), Northern Ireland's Field Marshal Montgomery, the Republic of Ireland's Laurence O'Toole <b>pipe</b> band, Canada's 78th Fraser Highlanders <b>Pipe</b> Band and Simon Fraser University <b>Pipe</b> Band, and Scottish bands like Shotts and Dykehead <b>Pipe</b> Band and Strathclyde Police <b>Pipe</b> Band. These bands, {{as well as}} many others, compete in numerous <b>pipe</b> band competitions, often the World <b>Pipe</b> Band Championships, and sometimes perform in public concerts.|$|R
50|$|Currently the College {{has three}} {{competitive}} <b>pipe</b> bands. These bands are registered with The Atlantic Canada <b>Pipe</b> Band Association (ACPBA) as grades 2, 4, and 5.

50|$|A hole {{towards the}} top of this <b>pipe</b> is {{provided}} for the water to exit into the water storage. This collection <b>pipe</b> extends into the outer <b>pipe</b> and has a 90 degree bend, and extends down ward between the inner and outer <b>pipes</b> about 1/6 of the length of the outer <b>pipe</b> up to 6 in. The collection <b>pipe</b> has a removable gauze to prevent leaves exiting the <b>pipe</b> and insects and their larvae breeding in the <b>pipe(s)</b> and entering the water collection tank(s). An inner <b>pipe</b> of a smaller diameter extends from {{the top of}} the large <b>pipe</b> (co-axially) about 1/3 of the length of the outer larger <b>pipe,</b> down past the exit point.|$|R
5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were <b>piped</b> or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and <b>piped</b> the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Carrick Post Office {{opened on}} 5 November 1841. Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} largely a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled <b>piped</b> water supply, from the Liffey, from 1961 and a sewerage plant {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts. The local councils' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development.|$|E
50|$|Flue <b>pipes</b> may be {{metallic}} or wooden. Metal <b>pipes</b> {{are usually}} circular in cross section; wooden <b>pipes</b> are usually square or rectangular, though triangular and round wooden <b>pipes</b> do exist. A flue <b>pipe</b> has two major parts, {{a foot and}} a resonator. The foot is the bottom portion of the <b>pipe,</b> usually conical. At its base is the toe hole, through which wind enters it. The length of the foot does not affect the <b>pipe's</b> pitch, so organ builders vary the foot lengths of their flue <b>pipes</b> depending on other factors, including the desired shape of the <b>pipes</b> in the façade, the height of the rackboard in which the <b>pipes</b> are seated, and the weight of the completed <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
30|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} {{to fit the}} bent metal inner <b>pipe</b> {{with respect to the}} outer <b>pipe</b> such that only the two ends of the <b>pipes</b> are in contact with each other by adjusting the flexural rigidity of the inner <b>pipe</b> with slits as shown in Fig. 2 b. Thus, the friction between the <b>pipes</b> can be reduced even if the inner <b>pipe</b> touches the outer <b>pipe</b> in areas other than the ends of the <b>pipes.</b> An inner <b>pipe</b> with optimally adjusted slit intervals can minimize the twist angle.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pipe</b> band {{arrangement}} was composed in the 1950s by <b>Pipe</b> Major A. R. Howie of the CFB Trenton <b>Pipe</b> Band, and a trio for <b>pipes</b> was composed in 1970 by <b>Pipe</b> Major Archie Cairns.|$|R
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} <b>piped</b> directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In April 1811 the Portsea Island Company {{constructed}} the first <b>piped</b> water supply to upper {{and middle class}} houses. It supplied water to approximately 4500 of the 14,000 houses, generating an income £5000 a year. HMS Victorys active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed £75 a year towards the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working class children in the country's first ragged school. In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas street lighting throughout the town, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Npower {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new £2billion clean coal power station on the site. The proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800MW advanced supercritical steam, high-efficiency coal-fired units, giving the station a total generation capacity of 2,400MW. This was one of two new coal-fired stations proposed by Npower in the UK. The site was chosen because of its readily available proximity to the national grid, its rail and port links, and its position next to the North Sea, which is useful for both cooling water, and as a potential CO2 storage site, where CO2 could be <b>piped</b> to oil and gas wells, and saline aquifers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> rams close {{around a}} drill <b>pipe,</b> restricting {{flow in the}} annulus (ring-shaped space between {{concentric}} objects) between {{the outside of the}} drill <b>pipe</b> and the wellbore, but do not obstruct flow within the drill <b>pipe.</b> Variable-bore <b>pipe</b> rams can accommodate tubing in a wider range of outside diameters than standard <b>pipe</b> rams, but typically with some loss of pressure capacity and longevity. <b>Pipe</b> ram should not be closed if there is no <b>pipe</b> in the hole.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pipe</b> clamp {{can also}} be used to connect a <b>pipe</b> to the {{remainder}} of a <b>pipe</b> hanger assembly. <b>Pipe</b> clamps are recommended for suspension for cold <b>pipe</b> lines that may or may not be insulated.|$|R
50|$|Reel <b>pipes</b> (also {{known as}} a half set, kitchen or parlour <b>pipes)</b> are a type of bagpipe {{originating}} in England and Scotland. These <b>pipes</b> are generally a scaled-down version of the large Great Highland <b>pipes.</b> Reel <b>pipes</b> are generally quieter than the Great Highland <b>pipes,</b> so suitable for indoor play.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it {{necessary}} {{to find a new}} water supply. Before the introduction of <b>piped</b> water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Charles M. Schwab {{bought the}} Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure, including <b>piped</b> water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town {{as well as the}} mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The <b>piped</b> water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
50|$|A double-walled <b>pipe</b> is a {{secondary}} contained piping system. It is a <b>pipe</b> within a <b>pipe,</b> or encased in an outer covering, with an annulus (interstitial space) {{between the two}} diameters. The inner <b>pipe</b> is the primary or carrier <b>pipe</b> and the outer <b>pipe</b> is called the secondary or containment <b>pipe.</b> The great majority of double-walled piping applications involve wastewater, groundwater, and process safety.|$|R
40|$|The parallel-plate loading {{mechanism}} (ASTM D 2412 standard test method) {{was used for}} investigating the long-term <b>pipe</b> stiffness values of HDPE, PVC and ABS <b>pipes.</b> Both conventional and accelerated test procedures were used. The nominal inside diameters of the test <b>pipes</b> were 300 and 400 mm. S-type long-term deflection curves were observed for the test plastic <b>pipes</b> on a semi-log scale. Long-term <b>pipe</b> deflection {{is a function of}} <b>pipe</b> material properties, <b>pipe</b> geometry, and external loading conditions. Load deflection rate increases with increasing <b>pipe</b> diameter. However, the relationship between load-deflection and different plastic <b>pipe</b> materials is still unclear. Long-term <b>pipe</b> stiffness values decrease with increasing test duration on a semi-log scale. The elevated temperature test procedure can be used as an acceleration method for estimating the long-term <b>pipe</b> deflection and <b>pipe</b> stiffness values in conjunction with the parallel-plate {{loading mechanism}}...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A high {{temperature}} heat <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger consists of heat <b>pipes</b> filled with different working media inside. In different temperature zones, heat <b>pipes</b> with different working media are linked safely by controlling the vapor temperature, the media inside the heat <b>pipe.</b> The vapor temperature inside the <b>pipe</b> is heavily {{affected by the}} temperature field of fluid outside the heat <b>pipes</b> and the heat transfer performance inside the heat <b>pipe,</b> while the heat transfer performance inside the <b>pipe</b> in turn has a bearing on the temperature distribution of fluid outside the <b>pipe.</b> to coordinate the fluid temperature distribution {{both inside and outside}} the <b>pipes,</b> study on local heat transfer enhancement has been conducted on {{high temperature}} heat <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger in this article, and CFD computational software was used to make rational and accurate prediction of fluid temperature distribution {{both inside and outside the}} <b>pipes,</b> so as to provide economic and reliable design basis for high temperature heat <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger...|$|R
