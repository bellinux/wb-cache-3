5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> <b>a</b> book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> <b>a</b> production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E

5|$|Wrexham {{were drawn}} to play West Ham United in the fourth round, where they secured a 2–2 draw at the Boleyn Ground thanks to goals from Wayne Phillips and Lee Jones. The replay was played on 4 February with a solitary West Ham goal coming from defender Colin Foster, {{securing}} a 1–0 win in front of 17,995 fans at the Racecourse Ground. Arsenal's league form in the meantime stuttered as they recorded no wins in January.

Phillips finished the 1912 season fourth on Vancouver in goals, and seventh overall in the league, with seventeen in fourteen games. Phillips, who realized that his skills had diminished, retired {{at the end of the}} season. A close friend of the Patricks, he remained close to the league, and occasionally officiated matches after his retirement.|$|E

25|$|The Chiefs {{controlled}} most of {{the first}} quarter, with Word rushing for 36 yards on 13 carries, but missed a chance to score when their normally reliable kicker Nick Lowery missed a 33-yard field goal. Marinovich promptly gave the Chiefs another scoring chance with an interception to Cherry, who returned the ball 17 yards. However, their ensuing drive ended with another missed field goal from Lowery, a 47-yard attempt {{early in the second}} quarter. On the Raiders next drive, Cherry intercepted Marinovich again, this time returning the ball 29 yards to the LA 11-yard line. DeBerg then put Kansas City up 7-0 with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jones. However, Marinovich finally managed to compose himself, <b>putting</b> <b>together</b> <b>a</b> 10-play, 65-yard drive that culminated with Jeff Jaeger's 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 7-3 with 26 seconds left in the half.|$|E

Willy Aybar added a 2-run home run of his own in the 3rd inning to make it 5–0. Kevin Cash put the Red Sox on the board in {{the bottom half of the}} 3rd inning with a solo home run.
