40|$|The {{ability to}} recover balance to avoid falling {{following}} a postural perturbation {{is a critical}} aspect of mobility. Our knowledge of human balance recovery emanates from studies that have intentionally disrupted balance control. These studies have utilized {{a number of different}} postural <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods</b> and a variety of perturbation intensities, which makes it difficult to compare between studies, and which may have resulted in inconsistencies and disagreement in the scientific literature. Previous work has suggested that different postural perturbations may induce fundamentally different responses, though the literature is sparse. It is important to understand these differences before a selection of methods could be made to investigate potential balance deficits among different special populations (e. g. older adults; neurological patients). The purpose of the current dissertation was: 1) to directly compare two different types of perturbation, platform-translation and shoulder-pull, on balance-correcting responses, 2) to describe kinematic and neuromuscular responses to different <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods,</b> to explore similarities and differences {{in the nature of the}} responses associated with different <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods,</b> and 3) to examine the effect of age on the relationships between perturbation characteristics in determining the balance-correcting response. Four studies were conducted. Firstly, the perturbation characteristics, force and displacement, common to platform-translation and shoulder-pull methods were determined to allow for a reasonable comparison between balance-correcting responses induced by both <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods.</b> These characteristics were used in the second and third study, which: 1) explored differences in dynamic postural stability resulting from two different <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods,</b> and 2) explored similarities and differences in the organization of balance-correcting responses induced with both methods. The fourth study investigated the effect of age on the relationship between perturbation characteristics, which determine the type of balance correcting response (i. e. feet-in-place or stepping) using a shoulder-pull method. These studies suggest that while there are similarities in the balance-correcting responses between <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods,</b> there are also critical differences that are unique to the modes of perturbation utilized. The current dissertation underscores that caution is required when interpreting results of studies utilizing different <b>perturbation</b> <b>methods</b> and that individual differences between participants, which can mask age-related differences, need to be recognized...|$|R

50|$|The weak {{nonlinearity}} and {{the long}} time scale of the amplitude variation can be taken advantage of to reduce the temporal description of the pulsating system to that of only the pulsation amplitudes, thus eliminating motion on the short time scale of the period.

50|$|Encke's method {{begins with}} the osculating orbit as a {{reference}} and integrates numerically to solve for the variation from the reference {{as a function of}} time. Its advantages are that perturbations are generally small in magnitude, so the integration can proceed in larger steps (with resulting lesser errors), and the method is much less affected by extreme perturbations. Its disadvantage is complexity; it cannot be used indefinitely without occasionally updating the osculating orbit and continuing from there, a process known as rectification. Encke's method is similar to the general <b>perturbation</b> <b>method</b> of variation of the elements, except the rectification is performed at discrete intervals rather than continuously.|$|E
