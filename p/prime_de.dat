50|$|A {{reliable}} and commanding goalkeeper, {{known for his}} leadership from the back and vocal presence on the pitch, in his <b>prime,</b> <b>De</b> Sanctis was known in particular for his shot-stopping ability, positioning, handling, and speed when rushing off his line, and is {{regarded as one of}} the best Italian goalkeepers of his generation; he was also adept at stopping penalties.|$|E

5000|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} midfielders in the world during his <b>prime,</b> <b>De</b> Rossi has been {{referred}} to as a [...] "complete midfielder" [...] because of his tackling, vision, awareness, passing range, strength and goal-scoring ability, which enable him to start counter-attacks or make attacking runs to advance into offensive positions after winning back possession. A quick, hard-working and tenacious player, with good technique and an excellent ability to read the game, he has been praised for his leadership, ball skills, stamina, positional sense and ability in the air, as well as his powerful long distance shooting; he is also an accurate penalty kick and set-piece taker. He has occasionally been criticised, however, for his aggression and tendency to pick up yellow cards unnecessarily.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of single-stranded DNA, the bacteriophage T 4 gene 41 and gene 61 proteins catalyze the synthesis {{of a group of}} pentaribonucleotides which are homogeneous in chain length but heterogeneous in nucleotide sequence. When single-stranded T 4 DNA is used as template, a unique dinucleoside sequence, pppApC, is found at the 5 ' end of these pentaribonucleotides with the general sequence pppApCpNpNpN. In {{the presence}} of the remaining five T 4 replication proteins, the pentaribonucleotides can be utilized with high efficiency to <b>prime</b> <b>de</b> novo DNA chain starts; as a result, {{the vast majority of them}} can be detected at the 5 ' end of newly made DNA molecules in an unaltered form. There are multiple, but specific, sites at which new DNA chains are primed in this way on a natural single-stranded DNA. Because identical RNA primers have been isolated from the 5 ' end of the Okazaki fragments made in T 4 -infected cells, we suggest that the T 4 gene 41 and gene 61 proteins also make the pentaribonucleotides that <b>prime</b> <b>de</b> novo T 4 DNA chain starts in vivo during lagging strand DNA synthesis...|$|E
30|$|The income {{resources}} that compute in the RAP are (see the acronyms {{table for a}} short description of each voice): indemnités journalieres; allocations chômage; pensions of any type; prestations familiales; allocation aux adultes handicapés; revenues from real estate and from capital; income from work; Aide au Logement (reduced by a forfeit according to the household size). The {{resources that}} do not enter the RAP are: Allocation Pour Jeune Enfant, {{for the period of}} pregnancy till the first month after child’s birth; Allocation Rentrée Scolaire; Allocation Education Speciale; scolarships; and <b>Prime</b> <b>de</b> Retour a l’Emploi.|$|E
30|$|However, an {{important}} objection to ‘fixing’ the temporary employment issue with social benefits and labor market policies is that turnover costs are shifted from employers to society. Another way of compensating temporary workers for their risk is granting them ‘insecurity bonuses’, as achieved in France {{in the form}} of the <b>prime</b> <b>de</b> précarité. In this system, employers have to pay a bonus to the worker (amounting to ten per cent of the total gross wage paid under the contract) if the employment relationship is not continued after the contract has expired. As mentioned, since 2013 there has also been a higher employer contribution rate to the unemployment insurance fund in case of short fixed-term contracts. This system ensures that employers contribute to the social costs of their hiring practices and increases incentives to use temporary contracts responsibly. In addition, it might reduce the perception among temporary workers being disadvantaged in several dimensions (unemployment risk and lower wages). For such a system to be effective, it would be important that, first, the bonus is sufficiently high to substantively affect employers’ incentives and workers’ material situation (albeit without totally discouraging hiring). Second, it has to be ensured that there are no legal loopholes that allow circumventing the bonus. Third,—and a more general point—the equal-pay principle has to be vigorously enforced through monitoring by unions and labor inspectors as well as through severe sanctions in case of non-compliance; otherwise, employers can cancel out the insecurity bonus by lowering temporary workers’ wages, a practice that already seems to be widespread.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} the potential to transform the study of highly variable viral pathogens by providing a rapid and cost-effective approach to sensitively characterize rapidly evolving viral quasispecies. Here, we report on a high-throughput whole HIV- 1 genome deep sequencing platform that combines 454 pyrosequencing with novel assembly and variant detection algorithms. In one subject we combined these genetic data with detailed immunological analyses to comprehensively evaluate viral evolution and immune escape during the acute phase of HIV- 1 infection. The majority of early, low frequency mutations represented viral adaptation to host CD 8 + T cell responses, evidence of strong immune selection pressure occurring during the early decline from peak viremia. CD 8 + T cell responses capable of recognizing these low frequency escape variants coincided with the selection and evolution of more effective secondary HLA-anchor escape mutations. Frequent, and in some cases rapid, reversion of transmitted mutations was also observed across the viral genome. When located within restricted CD 8 epitopes these low frequency reverting mutations were sufficient to <b>prime</b> <b>de</b> novo responses to these epitopes, again illustrating the capacity of the immune response to recognize and respond to low frequency variants. More importantly, rapid viral escape from the most immunodominant CD 8 + T cell responses coincided with plateauing of the initial viral load decline in this subject, suggestive of a potential link between maintenance of effective, dominant CD 8 responses and the degree of early viremia reduction. We conclude that the early control of HIV- 1 replication by immunodominant CD 8 + T cell responses may be substantially influenced by rapid, low frequency viral adaptations not detected by conventional sequencing approaches, which warrants further investigation. These data support the critical need for vaccine-induced CD 8 + T cell responses to target more highly constrained regions of the virus in order to ensure the maintenance of immunodominant CD 8 responses and the sustained decline of early viremia...|$|E
