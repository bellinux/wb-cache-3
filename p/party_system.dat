5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third <b>Party</b> <b>System</b> and launched the Fourth <b>Party</b> <b>System</b> and the Progressive Era.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the office of Governor is largely one of long periods of {{domination}} by a single party, though different parties were predominant in different eras. Federalists were rare among Kentuckians during the period of the First <b>Party</b> <b>System,</b> and Democratic Republicans won every gubernatorial election in the state until 1828. The Second <b>Party</b> <b>System</b> began when the Democratic-Republicans split into Jacksonian Democrats (the predecessor of the modern Democratic Party) and National Republicans (later to become Whigs). Beginning with the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828, the Whigs dominated the governorship until 1851, with John Breathitt being the only Democrat elected during that period.|$|E

The aim is to identify the causes of differences in <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> through the analysis of the institutional and legal framework and its influence on the composition of the current parliaments, stability of <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> and circumstances of the formation of political parties.

40|$|Starting from {{controversial}} {{findings about}} the relationship between <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> and the prospects of democratic consolidation, this article argues that problems can only be properly addressed {{on the basis of a}} differentiated typology of <b>party</b> <b>systems.</b> Contradictory research results do not pose an ‘African puzzle’ but can be explained by different and inadequate approaches. We argue that a modified version of Sartori's typology of <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> provides an appropriate method for classifying African <b>party</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on Sartori's framework, a preponderance of predominant and dominant <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> is identified. This can partly be explained by the prevailing authoritarian nature of many multiparty regimes in Africa as well as by the ethnic plurality of African societies. High ethnic fragmentation is not transformed into highly fragmented <b>party</b> <b>systems.</b> This phenomenon can be attributed to the most frequent ‘ethnic congress party’ which is based on an ethnic elite coalition.

5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the <b>party</b> <b>system</b> along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, the <b>party</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} {{dominated}} by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} <b>parties</b> and <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> in Nigeria since independence.

Special focus is awarded to the transformations of the four <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> and developments in their various institutional designs including regulating the number of parties that participate in the electoral politics of the country. In trying to achieve its objective, the article adopts chronological and thematic approaches. Chronologically, the paper investigates these <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> in successive order beginning with the First Republic when the elements of party politics were first adopted in Nigeria. Thematically, the article focuses on those issues that influenced the formation and transformation of the <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> from the First Republic in 1960 to the present Fourth Republic...|$|R

5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta {{during the first}} {{three and a half years}} of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that of party Vice President, was divided among eight different politicians. In 1966, Odinga stepped down as state Vice President, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt truly socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two <b>party</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This essay {{calls for}} a more nuanced {{analysis}} {{of the evolution of}} <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> in Latin America. I contend that the general impression that <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> are collapsing in Latin America and that processes of partisan and electoral dealignment are affecting most countries in the region is incor-rect. I also argue that the process of moderation and de-ideologization of the main political parties in many Latin American <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> often facili-tates processes of democratic consolidation. Finally, I discuss the positive impact recent transformations of Latin American <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> had on po-litical representation in the region, by showing that formerly excluded groups – especially indigenous groups – have been integrated into the politi-cal system...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{findings}} {{based on}} aggregate data {{have found that}} proportional representation (PR) has a mixed relationship with electoral participation. Large <b>party</b> <b>systems,</b> thought {{to be one of}} the benefits of PR in increasing turnout, instead depress turnout. This article examines two theories that seek to account for this paradox – that coalition governments resulting from larger <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> serve to depress turnout, and that larger <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> increase the complexity of the decision environment for voters. By combining individual-level data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems with contextual measures of effective number of parties, coalition structure and disproportionality, this article tests for interactions between the characteristics and attitudes of individuals and the contextual influences on electoral participation. The frequency of coalitions that violate the minimal-winning rule depresses turnout, especially among supporters of major parties. By accounting for variations in coalition governments, larger <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> appear, on balance, to enhance, rather than depress, individuals' propensity to vote. Limited evidence is reported that indicates that this participation-enhancing role of larger <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> is not evenly distributed across the electorate, as those lacking a university degree may find the decision environment created by larger <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> more complex...|$|R

5|$|From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian {{democracy}} began a set {{of reforms}} which included wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second <b>Party</b> <b>System</b> of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E

In doing so, they promoted the common notion of African exceptionalism. We believe that their conclusions are open to question because they draw inferences {{from a number of}} multiplicative interaction models in which they do not include all constitutive terms, interpret constitutive terms as unconditional marginal effects, and fail to calculate marginal effects and standard errors over a sufficiently large range of their modifying variables. By correcting these practices, we reach substantively different conclusions.

5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First <b>Party</b> <b>System,</b> he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace.

5|$|The new {{territorial}} {{governor was}} sworn in on June 11, 1809. At first Edwards tried to avoid partisanship but soon found that faction was an inevitable result of his power to appoint officials and distribute government jobs. Although the First <b>Party</b> <b>System</b> continued to define national politics, the Federalist and Republican Parties never took hold in frontier Illinois. Rather, factional loyalties were created by personality, personal bonds such as kinship and militia service, and especially the distribution of patronage. In the early territorial years, two rival factions grew up around Edwards and Judge Jesse B. Thomas. These two factions formed Illinois' political landscape during its time as a territory and for its first several years of statehood.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, Gould {{was elected}} to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed Singleton in 1894). Initially an {{opponent}} of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the <b>party</b> <b>system</b> came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a Free Trader. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the <b>party</b> <b>system</b> {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and <b>party</b> <b>system</b> of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

Secondly, we assess the challenges that European <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> have faced in recent years and the increased opportunities that this has offered regional actors. Political parties have found it increasingly difficult to integrate dealigned electorates and the opportunities for smaller (regional, issue, right-wing, Green) parties to stabilise themselves in national <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> have subsequently increased...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which students of <b>parties</b> classify <b>party</b> <b>systems.</b> Most typologies which we use (e. g Dahl, Blondel, Sartori) were developed in the 1960 s, and few new typologies have been developed or mooted since then. Most students of parties rely on Sartori’s 1976 typology, which distinguishes among one <b>party</b> dominant <b>systems,</b> two <b>party</b> <b>systems,</b> moderate pluralism, and extreme multipartyism. However, <b>parties</b> and <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> have changed considerably since then. As Mair has pointed out, there are fewer and fewer current instances of pure two party competition and none of polarized pluralism. Instead, <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> in most liberal democracies fit into the increasingly crowded category, moderate pluralism. The dearth of new typologies reflects the success of the Sartori’s scheme and the availability of indices such as Laakso and Taagepura’s Effective Number of Political Parties, which can be used {{to assess the impact of}} electoral laws. However useful the Effective Number of Electoral Parties (ENEP) or its legislative variant, Effective Number of Parliamentary Parties (ENPP), might be for correlation and regression, the index blurs key features of <b>party</b> <b>systems</b> – {{the ways in which}} parties regularly interact with each other and has minimal heuristic value.
