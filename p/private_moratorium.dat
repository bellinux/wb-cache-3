50|$|On December 5, 1997, Seed {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} clone a human being before any federal laws could be enacted to ban the process. Seed's announcement added fuel to the raging ethical debate on human cloning that had been sparked by Ian Wilmut's creation of Dolly the sheep, the first clone obtained from adult cells. Seed’s plans were to use the same technique used by the Scottish team. Seed's announcement went against President Clinton's 1997 proposal for a voluntary <b>private</b> <b>moratorium</b> against human cloning.

On February 14, 2000, the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, formalized the January 12, 2000, moratorium on recycling radioactive scrap metal that prevented the unrestricted release of recycled scrap metals to the <b>private</b> sector. This <b>moratorium</b> created significant problems for the INEEL lead recycling program and associated plans; however, through the cooperative efforts of the INEEL and Idaho State University as well as innovative planning and creative thinking the recycling issues were resolved. This collaboration has recycled over 160, 000 pounds of excess lead to Idaho State University with a cost savings of over $. 5 M...|$|R
40|$|Sri Lanka’s 2005 Article IV Consultation {{reports that}} the fiscal deficit {{exceeded}} budget targets, and with {{a significant amount of}} government financing provided by the central bank, the growth in monetary aggregates increased, contributing to higher inflation. The near-term economic outlook is to a large extent shaped by the post-tsunami reconstruction effort.
