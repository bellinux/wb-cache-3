During the 19th century, the Ket were mistaken for a tribe of the Finno-Ugric Khanty. A. Karger in 1934 published the first grammar (Кетский язык Ketskij jazyk), as well as a Ket primer (Букварь на кетском языке Bukvar' na ketskom jazyke), and a new treatment appeared in 1968, written by A.

5000|$|Evenki is {{a member}} of the Tungusic family. Its {{similarity}} to Manchu, the best-documented member of the family, was noted hundreds of years ago, first by botanist P. <b>S.</b> <b>Pallas</b> in the late 18th century, and then in a more formal linguistic study by M.

Some scholars propose two sub-families: one for Manchu, and another for all the other Tungusic languages, including Evenki. SIL International's Ethnologue divides Tungusic into two sub-families Northern and Southern, with Evenki alongside Even and Negidal in the Northern sub-family, and the Southern family itself subdivided into Southwestern (among which Manchu) and Southeastern (Nanai and others). Others propose three or more sub-families, or at the extreme a continuum with Manchu at one end and Evenki at the other.|$|R

50|$|P. <b>S.</b> <b>Pallas</b> {{initiated}} a more scientific approach to Turkology with his Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Türkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language (1839), O. N. Betlingk Grammar of the Yakut language (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering {{at the end}} of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age Orkhon inscriptions by V. Thomsen and W. W. Radloff (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of Türkische Bibliothek (1905-27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte (1921-26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.|$|R
40|$|We present two new avian {{molecular}} sexing {{techniques for}} nonpasserine and passerine birds (Neognathae), {{which are more}} suitable for use with museum specimens than earlier methods. The technique for nonpasserines is based on a new primer (M 5) which, in combination with the existing P 8 primer, targets a smaller amplicon in the CHD 1 sex-linked gene than previously. Primers targeting ATP 5 A 1, an avian sex-linked gene not previously used for sex identification, were developed for passerines. Comprehensive testing across species demonstrated that both primer pairs sex a range of different species within their respective taxonomic groups. Rigorous evaluation of each method within species showed that these permitted sexing of specimens dating from the 1850 <b>s.</b> For corn <b>bunting</b> museum specimens, the ATP 5 A 1 method sexed 98 % of 63 samples (1857 – 1966). The M 5 /P 8 CHD 1 method was similarly successful, sexing 90 % of 384 moorhen specimens from six different museum collections (1855 – 2001). In contrast, the original P 2 /P 8 CHD 1 sexing method only identified the sex of less than half of 111 museum moorhen samples. In addition to dried skin samples, these methods may be useful for other types of material that yield degraded or damaged DNA, and are hence potential new sexing tools for avian conservation genetics, population management and wildlife forensics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{fabric of}} flags is {{inextricably}} woven into our cultural heritage. Throughout civilization flags have heralded national identity in war and peace, {{as symbols of}} both victor and defender. Research into the origins of early 1800 flag fabrics wove a fascinating tie to England, where the wool fabric was made, and why it survived while the weaving industry was mechanized during the industrial revolution. Bunting fabric provided the canvas for the flag {{as a symbol of}} a nation and its people. This makes the history of bunting and its struggle for survival into the nineteenth century, an integral facet of our history. In England the fabric trade was being driven by the new economics and scale of production brought about by the industrial revolution. Bunting was used almost exclusively for flags, and its survival through this period was aided by the very structure of the fabric itself. Heavier fabrics were woven by men, but the lightweight character and smaller dimensions of bunting meant it could be woven by women and children. This provided not only a welcome but a necessary contribution to the economic wellbeing of working class households. The manufacture of bunting was a cottage industry based in the region around the village of Sudbury in Suffolk, a manufacturing town dating back to medieval times. With changes in transportation and the availability of new routes, the proximity of Sudbury to London allowed local clothiers easier access to principal buyers of bunting, and consequently close access to import trade in bunting. Textile Manufacture in Early Modern England While the woolen industry had been prevalent in England for centuries, a colony of Flemish worsted weavers settled in Sudbury, Suffolk during the reign of Edward III (1312 - 1377). The Flemings also introduced the jersey tammy that was being made in Norwich in the 1570 <b>s.</b> Jersey <b>bunting</b> was a variety of tammy suitable for flags as its wool yarns were opaque even in the strongest light. The first unequivocal record of worsted tammy manufacturing was in Norwich, Norfolk in 1605. There was a gradual spelling change from estamet to tammy to tamett, and by 1633 this became tammett. A stammet or tammy yarn was one that had been shrunk and smoothed by scouring and a tammy cloth the cloth woven from these yarns. The worsted tammies were lightweight, plain-weave fabrics, thinly warped so they were strong and stringy. They were often highly glazed by hot pressing and other means. A special form of the tammy called bunt or bunting was sold for making flags...|$|R
40|$|Myricaria is a shrub. {{it grows}} on pebble, and rocky {{banks of the}} mountainous rivers in the {{southern}} regions of Siberia. The academician P. <b>S.</b> <b>Pallas</b> was the first who became interested in Myricaria plants when traveling {{in the mountains of}} South Siberia. C. L. Willdenow (1816), C. G. Ehrenberg (1827), A. A. Bunge (1835), K. J. Maximovich (1889), S. G. Gorshkova (1949) and other scientists studied the species of this genus. E. G. Bobrov (1967) made the first review of this genus. A detailed analysis of literature and herbarium specimens of the Siberian species of the genus Myricaria was performed. There is no consensus on taxonomy of Siberian species of this genus in botanical literature. Therefore, study of moot points in taxonomy of these species on the basis of an analysis of characters for treatment of the genus Myricaria is of great importance. The features are: size and shape of leaves, peculiarities of structure and size of inflorescences. The author collected plants in the southern Siberia: in the Altay Mountains, Tyva, Pribaikalye and Zabaikalye during expeditions from 1990 to 2006. Also we collected seeds and cuttings of species of Myricaria and grew up them in the nursery of the Laboratory of Dendrology, SB CSBG RAS. When studying of morphological features forming the basis for description of the species, it has been established that only two species: M. bracteata and M. longifolia, instead of four from the botanical literature, grow in Siberia. Differences in the biological peculiarities and areas also are characteristic of the two species. The author does the critical overview and offers system of the Siberian species of the genus Myricaria...|$|R

50|$|Pallas {{settled in}} St Petersburg, {{becoming}} a favourite of Catherine II and teaching natural {{history to the}} Grand Dukes Alexander and Constantine. He was provided with the plants collected by other naturalists to compile the Flora Rossica (1784-1815), a Russian flora, and started work on his Zoographica Rosso-Asiatica (1811-31), a zoography of Russia and Asia. He also published an account of Johann Anton Güldenstädt's travels in the Caucasus. The Empress bought Pallas's large natural history collection for 2,000 rubles, 500 more than his asking price, and allowed him to keep them for life. During this period, Pallas helped plan the Mulovsky expedition, which was cancelled in October 1787. Between 1793 and 1794, Pallas led a second expedition to southern Russia, visiting the Crimea and the Black Sea. He was accompanied by his daughter (by his first wife {{who had died in}} 1782) and his new wife, an artist, servants, and a military escort. In February 1793, they travelled to Saratov and then downriver to Tsaritsyn. They explored the country to the east, and in August travelled {{along the banks of the}} Caspian Sea and into the Caucasus Mountains. In September, they travelled to the Crimea, wintering in Simferopol. Pallas spent early 1794 exploring to the southeast, and in July travelled up the valley of the Dnieper, arriving back in St Petersburg in September. Pallas gave his account of the journey in his P. <b>S.</b> <b>Pallas</b> Bemerkungen auf einer Reise in die Südlichen Statthalterschaften des Russischen Reichs (1799-1801). Catherine II gave him a large estate at Simferopol, where Pallas lived until the death of his second wife in 1810. He was then granted permission to leave Russia by Emperor Alexander, and returned to Berlin, where he died in the following year. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.|$|R
40|$|In the 18 th and 19 th century several German and Baltic-German {{scientists}} investigated almost unknown {{territories of}} the Russian Empire. Many {{of them were}} invited by the Russian Imperators and some became academicians of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences,and later had considerable influence {{on the development of}} science in Russia in general and on the organization of expeditions to the Far East and Siberia in particular. German naturalists like Georg Wilhelm Steller (1709 - 1746), Johann Georg Gmelin (1709 - 1755), Peter Simon Pallas (1741 - 1811), Karl Ernst von Baer (1792 - 1876), Ferdinand von Wrangell (1797 - 1870) and Alexander Theodor von Middendorff (1815 - 1894) traveled through Siberia collecting information about flora, fauna, geology, climate, ethnology,history and economy of the Far East of Russia. Their results were published in Russian, German and French,mostly in journals of the Russian Geographical Society (St. Petersburg), in travelogues or in separate monographs and book-chapters. Results of investigations of the Russian Empire became available in Europe by special scientific journals edited e. g. by P. <b>S.</b> <b>Pallas,</b> J. G. Georgi, Th. Fr. Ehrmann, A. Erman, K. E. v. Baer and G. v. Helmersen. The western world was first informed about frozen ground in Siberia by J. G. Gmelin, who reported finding the phenomenon in Yakutsk, but Leopold von Buch (1774 - 1853) doubted his report and argued that plants were growing in this region, which considered impossible on permanently frozen ground. As a result, he demanded that Gmelin’s data be removed from scientific textbooks [1]. On behalf of a merchant of the Russian-American Company, Fedor Shergin, a shaft was dug in Yakutsk to get drinking water. To Shergi’s surprise he was unable to reach liquid water, but the governor of the Russian- American Company, Ferdinand von Wrangell, requested him to continue digging {{at the expense of the}} Company, for studies of the frozen ground underneath Yakutsk. The sinking of the well, starting in 1828, has been continued until 1837 reaching an end depth of 382 English feet (about 116. 5 m), without reaching unfrozen soil [2]. The shaft developed great importance for further geocryological studies. First measurements of soil temperature were carried out therein in April 1829 by the German physicist Adolph Erman (1806 - 1877). Down to the bottom depth of 46 Paris feet (about 15 m) at that time he recorded continuously - 6 °R (- 7. 5 °C) in all deeper parts of the well, which corresponded very well with the mean annual temperature of Yakutsk of – 5. 9 °R. This result can be credited as a first finding of the permafrost depth of “Zero Annual Amplitude”. Assuming a geothermal gradient of 1 °R/ 100 feet, Erman expected liquid water in a depth of 600 feet (about 190 m) [3] but Shergin’s measurements published in 1838 indicated temperatures of - 0. 5 °R at the end bottom of the shaft (116. 5 m) [2]. Several scientists were doubtful about Shergin’s data [3]. Between 1838 and 1843 Karl Ernst von Baer compiled all data available on frozen ground in Siberia, from sources either published or from Russian archives. He wrote a special permafrost study including the first classification of permafrost and made suggestions for regular observations in Shergin’s shaft. Baer and the commission responsible formulated instructions for an expedition to eastern Siberia initiated by Baer and led by Alexander Theodor von Middendorff with the focus to investigate the region north of Turukhansk to the Chatanga River and to investigate permafrost, especially its thickness, temperature and distribution [4]. Baer also drew the first map of permafrost distribution. Unfortunately his permafrost study and this permafrost map were not published before 2000 [5]. Baer also suggested that investigations of air and soil temperatures be carried out in British North America [6]. According to Baer’s guide in 1843 - 1845, Middendorff carried out soil temperature measurements at Turukhansk and other Siberian places. In the Shergin shaft in Yakutsk, regular measurements, started by him in 1844, had been continued until 1846 by local observers. Middendorff reported a bottom temperature in the shaft of - 2. 4 °R. He published his geothermal investigations in great detail, including data on the thermal conductivity of soils, which were a result of the geothermic measurements in Shergin’s shaft [7]. As Erman had also earlier assumed, he supposed a permafrost depth of 600 feet beneath Yakutsk. Baer began a long discussion with him about his conclusions and the geothermal gradient he reported [8](cf. also [9]). Middendorff’s collection of permafrost observations in Siberia and his conclusions for the geographical distribution and thickness of permafrost provided the foundation for a generation of geocryologists. Temperature measurements in the active layer were carried out within the framework of the International Polar Year 1882 - 1883 at Sagastyr Station in the Lena River delta and on Novaya Zemlya. Soil temperature observations had been included in the meteorological program and were carried out regularly at 0. 4 m, 0. 8 m and 1. 6 m depths [10]. The medical doctor Alexander von Bunge (1851 - 1930) was a participant of this expedition. He described the place on Bykovsky Peninsula where Adams found the first mammoth carcass in 1799 and reported on other mammoth carcasses found in the Lena Delta, and on permafrost soils, polygonal structures and ice wedges that he observed. He published a hypothesis on the genesis of ground ice by thermal contraction [11]. In 1885 - 1886 Bunge was the leader of the expedition of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences to the New Siberian Islands during which he and his companion Eduard von Toll (1858 - 1902) found mammoth relicts and studied the ground ice formations on Great Lyakhovsky Island. European scientists were deeply impressed by the first photographs of huge ground ice wedges published by Toll. He speculated that these formations were relicts of glaciers and introduced terms like “fossil ice“and “ice rock”(Steineis) into geocryology [12].
