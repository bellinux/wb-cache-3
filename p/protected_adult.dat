After active immunizations, the vaccine dose-dependently induced antibodies and <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> mice from viremia and interferon α/β receptor knock-out (IFN-α/βR(-/-)) mice from death and disease. In passive transfer studies, administration of human vaccinee sera followed by RRV challenge <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> mice from viremia and young mice from development of arthritic signs similar to human RRV-induced disease. Based on the good correlation between antibody titers in human sera and protection of animals, a correlate of protection was defined. This is of particular importance {{for the evaluation of}} the vaccine because of the comparatively low annual incidence of RRV disease, which renders a classical efficacy trial impractical. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, did not occur in mice even at low to undetectable concentrations of vaccine-induced antibodies. Also, RRV vaccine-induced antibodies were partially cross-protective against infection with a related alphavirus, Chikungunya virus, and did not enhance infection. Based on these findings, the inactivated RRV vaccine is expected to be efficacious and protect humans from RRV disease...|$|E

Herein, we report that conditioned media (CM) from rat adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> cardiomyocytes from oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) -induced cell death. We focused on furin/PCSK protease activity in ASC-CM because many therapeutic factors of MSCs and soluble cardioprotective factors include the PCSK cleavage site. We found that recombinant furin protected cardiomyocytes from OGD-induced cell death. The ASC-CM had potent furin/PCSK protease activity and the cardioprotective effect of the CM from ASCs in the OGD-assay was abolished by an inhibitor of the furin/PCSK-like enzyme. Microarray analysis and Western blot analysis showed PCSK 5 A, the secreted type of PCSK 5, is the most abundantly secreted PCSK among 7 PCSK family members in ASC. Finally, knockdown of PCSK 5 A in ASCs decreased both the furin/PCSK protease activity and cardioprotective activity in the CM.

40|$|Abstract Background Retinal {{ganglion}} cells (RGCs) {{are responsible}} for the transmission of visual signals to the brain. Progressive death of RGCs occurs in glaucoma and several other retinal diseases, which can lead to visual impairment and blindness. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a potent antiangiogenic, neurotrophic and neuroprotective protein that can protect neurons from a variety of pathologic insults. We tested the effects of PEDF on the survival of cultured adult rat RGCs in the presence of glaucoma-like insults, including cytotoxicity induced by glutamate or withdrawal of trophic factors. Results Cultured adult rat RGCs exposed to glutamate for 3 days showed signs of cytotoxicity and death. The toxic effect of glutamate was concentration-dependent (EC 50 = 31 μM). In the presence of 100 μM glutamate, RGC number decreased to 55 ± 4 % of control (mean ± SEM, n = 76; P 50 values of 13. 6 ng/mL (glutamate) and 3. 4 ng/mL (trophic factor withdrawal), respectively. At 100 ng/mL, PEDF completely protected the cells from both insults. Inhibitors of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) significantly reduced the protective effects of PEDF. Conclusion We demonstrated that PEDF potently and efficaciously <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> rat RGCs from glutamate- and trophic factor withdrawal-mediated cytotoxicity, via the activation of the NFκB and ERK 1 / 2 pathways.

40|$|Advanced {{age is a}} {{risk factor}} of severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) in humans. To understand its pathogenesis, we developed an animal model using BALB/c mice and the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We examined the immune responses to SARS-CoV in both young and adult mice. SARS-CoV induced severe respiratory illness in all adult, but not young, mice on day 2 after inoculation with a mortality rate of 30 to 50 %. Moribund adult mice showed severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage accompanied by virus replication. Adult murine lungs, which had significantly higher interleukin (IL) - 4 and lower IL- 10 and IL- 13 levels before infection than young murine lungs, rapidly produced high levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines known to induce macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation (eg, tumor necrosis factor-α). On day 2 after inoculation, young murine lungs produced not only proinflammatory cytokines but also IL- 2, interferon-γ, IL- 10, and IL- 13. Adult mice showed early and acute excessive proinflammatory responses (ie, cytokine storm) in the lungs after SARS-CoV infection, which led to severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage. Intravenous injection with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibody 3 hours after infection had no effect on SARS-CoV infection. However, intraperitoneal interferon-γ injection <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> mice from the lethal respiratory illness.

The DI particles {{had to be}} biologically active, but {{did not have to}} be administered at the same inoculation site as the infectious virus. Serum and tissue levels of VSV postinoculation were significantly lower in DI-protected animals than in unprotected controls, suggesting that true autointerference was occurring. However, some aspects of protection also must be mediated through nonspecific mechanisms, since susceptible hamsters could be protected against VSV Indiana by coinjection with heterologous DI particles prepared from VSV serotype New Jersey or by simultaneous administration of polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid. By measuring serum levels of putative hamster interferon (type 1), we found that animals coinjected with VSV and DI particles or polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid produced significant levels of interferon. Since similarly high serum levels of interferon were measured in recipients of VSV alone (animals that eventually died from infection), there appeared to be no correlation between protection against lethal disease and induced levels of serum interferon. Instead, serum interferon levels correlated positively with amounts of VSV PFU found in serum and tissues of infected animals, the lowest levels being found in serum of animals protected with homologous DI particles. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that autointerference by DI particles as well as various host defense mechanisms (possibly including induction of interferon) participates in protecting hamsters against lethal VSV infection...|$|E
40|$|Homeodomain-containing {{transcription}} {{factors are}} important regulators {{of stem cell}} behavior. HOXB 4 mediates expansion of adult and embryo-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) when expressed ectopically. To define the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed gene expression profiling in combination with subsequent functional analysis with enriched adult HSCs and embryonic derivatives expressing inducible HOXB 4. Thereby, we identified a set of overlapping genes that likely represent “universal” targets of HOXB 4. A substantial number of loci are involved in signaling pathways important for controlling self-renewal, maintenance, and differentiation of stem cells. Functional assays performed on selected pathways confirmed the biological coherence of the array results. HOXB 4 activity <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> HSCs from the detrimental effects mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. This protection likely contributes to the competitive repopulation advantage of HOXB 4 -expressing HSCs observed in vivo. The concept of TNF-α inhibition may also prove beneficial for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HOXB 4 activity and FGF signaling are intertwined. HOXB 4 -mediated expansion of adult and ES cell-derived HSCs was enhanced by specific and complete inhibition of FGF receptors. In contrast, the expanding activity of HOXB 4 on hematopoietic progenitors in day 4 – 6 embryoid bodies was blunted {{in the presence of}} basic FGF (FGF 2), indicating a dominant negative effect of FGF signaling on the earliest hematopoietic cells. In summary, our results strongly suggest that HOXB 4 modulates the response of HSCs to multiple extrinsic signals in a concerted manner, thereby shifting the balance toward stem cell self-renewal...|$|E

However, when Lyt 2. 2 (+) cell-depleted and L 3 T 4 (+) cell-depleted effecters were mixed and transferred into adult mice the protective activity was retained, demonstrating that both Lyt 2. 2 (+) and L 3 T 4 (+) T cells are necessary to confer protection.

Expression of the heterologous prM-E genes in the genetic backgrounds of the two D 2 PDK- 53 variants, but not that of wild-type D 2 16681 virus, resulted in chimeric viruses that retained PDK- 53 characteristic phenotypic markers of attenuation, including small plaque size and temperature sensitivity in LLC-MK 2 cells, limited replication in C 6 / 36 cells, and lack of neurovirulence in newborn ICR mice.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: A {{maternal}} {{low-protein diet}} {{has been shown}} to induce an increased susceptibility of fetal islets to cytokines, but this effect can be avoided by maternal taurine supplementation. Here, we question whether these effects persist until adulthood in the offspring, despite the animal having a normal diet after weaning. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats received a diet of either 20 % or 8 % protein (control [C group] and recuperated [R group] respectively), which was or was not supplemented with taurine (control treated with taurine [CT group] and recuperated treated with taurine [RT group] respectively) during gestation and lactation. When the female offspring reached adulthood, an OGTT was performed. In a second stage, islets were isolated from these offspring, then pretreated or not with taurine, and subsequently treated with cytokines. RESULTS: Fasting glycaemia was higher (p< 0. 05) and insulinaemia was lower (p< 0. 01) in the R group than in the C group. Taurine supplementation decreased insulinaemia in the CT group and tended to increase it in the RT group. After the OGTT, glycaemia in R animals was not different from that in the C group, despite a blunted insulin response (p< 0. 05) which was restored by taurine. Supplementation in C-group mothers led to a weak glucose intolerance. In vitro, more apoptotic cells were observed in R islets after cytokines treatment (p< 0. 01). The addition of taurine to the culture medium in the R and C groups protected the islets from the cytokines (p< 0. 01). Maternal taurine supplementation decreased the sensitivity of islets in the RT group (p< 0. 01), but increased sensitivity in the CT group (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The increased vulnerability of islets to cytokines due to a restriction of protein during fetal development was still evident when the offspring reached adulthood. The low-protein diet also induced hyperglycaemia in the presence of lower insulinaemia. Taurine supplementation <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> islets of the R group from cytokine toxicity and restored the insulinaemia.

40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the major}} causative agent of acute lower {{respiratory}} tract infections in infants and young children. Unfortunately, there are no licensed RSV vaccines available, and the few treatment options for high-risk individuals are either extremely costly or cause severe side effects and toxicity. Thus, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic interventions against RSV is a preeminent public health priority. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) causes similar clinical symptoms and disease in mice to those observed in RSV-infected patients, and therefore {{is used as a}} model for pathogenesis studies. Lethal PVM infection (i. e. 3000 pfu) in Balb/c mice is characterized by 20 % weight loss in total body weight, rough coats, abnormal posture, nasal discharge, and difficulty breathing due to neutrophilia, edema and alveolitis in the lower airways. Also, these mice will succumb to the infection between days 6 and 7 p. i. Immunomodulation mediated by a novel formulation composed of the toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly I:C, an innate defense regulator peptide and a polyphosphazene (i. e. P-I-P) was first assessed in healthy adult Balb/c mice. Subsequently, the protective potential of P-I-P was further investigated {{in the context of a}} lethal PVM infection. P-I-P induced highest mRNA and protein expression of chemokines and cytokines in the lung milieu between 6 and 24 hr post-treatment. In addition, a single dose of P-I-P <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> mice against PVM when given 24 hr prior to challenge. These animals displayed minimal body weight changes, no clinical disease, 100 % survival, as well as reduced lung virus titers and pathology. P-I-P pre-treatment induced early mRNA and protein expression of key chemokine and cytokines, and decreased neutrophil and eosinophil numbers in the lungs, resulting in an overall modulation of the delayed exacerbated nature of PVM disease without short-term side effects. It was determined that the protective effects of P-I-P prophylaxis were maintained if administered up to 3 days prior to lethal PVM infection. On day 14 post-infection, P-I-P-treated survivor mice were confirmed to be PVM-free. These results demonstrate the capacity of this formulation to prevent PVM and possibly other viral respiratory infections...|$|E

The PI 3 K - AKT and MEK 1 / 2 - ERK 1 / 2 cell survival pathways have been shown to {{play a critical role in}} regulating myocardial ischaemia reperfusion injury. In this study we investigated whether the A 3 adenosine receptor agonist 2 -CL-IB-MECA protects the myocardium from ischaemia reperfusion injury, when administered at reperfusion or post reperfusion and whether the protection involved the PI 3 K – AKT or MEK 1 / 2 – ERK 1 / 2 cell survival pathways. In the Langendorff model of ischaemia reperfusion injury isolated perfused rat hearts underwent 35 minutes of ischaemia and 120 minutes of reperfusion. Administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA (1 nM) at reperfusion significantly decreased infarct size to risk ratio compared to non-treated ischeamic reperfused control hearts. This protection was abolished in the presence of the PI 3 K inhibitor Wortmannin or MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor UO 126. Western blot analysis determined that administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA (1 nM) upregulated ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation. In the adult rat cardiac myocyte model of hypoxia/reoxygenation cells underwent 6 hours of hypoxia and 18 hours of reoxygenation. Administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA (1 nM) at the onset of reoxygenation significantly decreased cellular apoptosis and necrosis. Administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA (1 nM) in the presence of the Wortmannin or UO 126 significantly reversed this anti-apoptotic effect and anti-necrotic effect. Our data further showed that 2 -CL-IB-MECA protects myocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury via decreasing cleaved-caspase 3 activity that was abolished in presence of the PI 3 K inhibitor but not in the presence of the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor UO 126. Administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA (100 nM) at the onset of reperfusion also significantly decreased infarct size to risk ratio in the ischaemic reperfused rat heart compared to controls that was reversed in the presence of Wortmannin or Rapamycin. This protection was associated with an increase in PI 3 K-AKT / p 70 S 6 K / BAD phosphorylation. 2 -CL-IB-MECA (100 nM) administered at reoxygenation also significantly <b>protected</b> <b>adult</b> rat cardiac myocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury 28 in an anti-apoptotic and anti-necrotic manner.

Furthermore, that this protection afforded by 2 -CL-IB-MECA (100 nM) when administered at reoxygenation was associated with a decrease in cleaved caspase 3 activity that was abolished in the presence of the Wortmannin Interestingly, postponing the administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA to 15 or 30 minutes after the onset of reperfusion significantly protected the isolated perfused rat heart from ischaemia reperfusion injury in a Wortmannin and UO 126 sensitive manner. This protection was associated with an increase in AKT and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation. Administration of the A 3 agonist 2 -CL-IB-MECA 15 or 30 minutes after the onset of reoxygenation significantly protected isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes subjected to 6 hours of hypoxia and 18 hours of reoxygenation from injury in an anti-apoptotic/necrotic manner. This anti-apoptotic was abolished upon PI 3 K inhibition with Wortmannin or MEK 1 / 2 inhibition with UO 126. The anti-necrotic effect of 2 -CL-IB-MECA when administered 15 or 30 minutes post-reperfusion was not abolished in the presence of the inhibitors. Delaying the administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA to 15 or 30 minutes after reoxygenation was associated with a decrease in cleaved-caspase 3 activity that was abolished in the presence of Wortmannin but not in the presence of the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor UO 126. Collectively, we have demonstrated for the first time that administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA at the onset of reperfusion protects the ischaemic reperfused rat myocardium from lethal ischaemia reperfusion injury in a PI 3 K and MEK 1 / 2 sensitive manner. Delaying the administration of 2 -CL-IB-MECA to 15 or 30 minutes after the onset of reperfusion of reoxygenation also significantly protects the isolated perfused rat heart from ischaemia reperfusion injury and the adult rat cardiac myocyte from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in an anti apoptotic / necrotic manner. Furthermore, that this protection is associated with recruitment of the PI 3 K-AKT and MEK 1 / 2 – ERK 1 / 2 cell survival pathways...|$|E
40|$|The neuroprotective role of 17 β-estradiol in the hippocampal dentate gyrus {{of adult}} rats treated with kainic acid has been investigated. The {{systemic}} injection {{of a single}} low dose (7 mg/kg) of kainic acid to ovariectomized rats produced a marked loss of Nissl-stained and somatostatin- immunoreactive hilar neurons. A single simultaneous systemic dose of estradiol (150 μg per animal) prevented the kainic acid-induced decrease in Nissl-stained and somatostatinergic hilar neurons. These results indicate that estradiol may <b>protect</b> <b>adult</b> hilar neurons in vivo from neurotoxic- induced cell death. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Ozone may induce a number of plant responses, e. g., visible injury on the leaves, that affect the ornamental value of urban forests. Antioxidant application may protect sensitive plants from ozone.
