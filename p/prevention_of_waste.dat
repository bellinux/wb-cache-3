50|$|Although precycling {{harnesses}} {{the familiarity}} of the term recycling, {{it is still important}} to note the difference between recycling and prevention. Since precycling focuses on the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste. Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature. Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products. Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down. However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation’s recycling capabilities are being utilized.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} supplementary feeding on the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> in preschool children {{in a rural area}} of Guatemala with a high prevalence of malnutrition. METHODS: Children aged 6 - 48 months, with a weight-for-length exceeding 90 % of that of the median NCHS/WHO/CDC reference population, received either Atole, a drink with a high protein and moderate energy content, or Fresco, a drink with no protein and a low energy content. Children consuming amounts of Atole equivalent to more than 10 % of the age-adjusted recommended dietary intake for energy were termed "supplemented". A comparable group of children consuming Fresco was termed "non-supplemented". The energy intake in the supplemented group was higher than that in the non-supplemented group by 16 - 18 % of the recommended daily intake. The corresponding difference in protein intake was 45 - 80 % of the recommended daily intake. The children were followed up at intervals of three or six months in order to evaluate their weight-for-length development. The difference between supplemented and non-supplemented children in the proportions maintaining their weight-for-length category {{at the end of the}} study intervals represented the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> attributable to supplementary feeding (attributable prevention). Households were used as units of analysis in order to avoid cluster effects. FINDINGS: The attributable prevention in children aged 6 - 24 months with weight-for-length between 90 % and 99. 9 % of the reference population at entry ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 26 and was statistically significant after three and six months of supplementation. However, it was not significant in children at or above 100 % weight-for-length or in older children. Children above 100 % weight-for-length did not become overweight as a result of supplementation. CONCLUSION: Supplementary feeding of children aged 6 - 24 months in populations with inadequate dietary intakes can prevent the onset <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> in a large proportion of children...|$|R
5000|$|Design for lean {{manufacturing}} {{is based on}} the premise that product and process design is an ongoing activity and not a one-time activity; therefore design for {{lean manufacturing}} should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization. [...] Design for lean manufacturing must be sustainable and holistic unlike other lean manufacturing or Six Sigma approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. Design for lean manufacturing also relates to system thinking as it considers all aspects (or the full circle) and takes the system conditions into consideration when designing products and services, delivering them according to customer needs. ® (Munro & Associates) drives <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> by adopting a systematic process to improve the design phase during development. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of Lean Design ® principles, which includes efficient and sustainable design team. Initial studies of the Japanese approach to design for lean manufacturing noted four principles; leadership of projects by a shusa (or project boss), tightly knit teams, communication on all of the difficult design trade-offs, and simultaneous development between engineering and manufacturing. Further study showed additional depth to the principles, citing 13 principles specific to the Toyota design for lean manufacturing methods in product and process development in the areas of process, skilled people, and tools and technology. As the practice of design for lean manufacturing has expanded in its depth and breadth of application, additional principles have been integrated into the method.|$|E

50|$|Design for lean {{manufacturing}} {{is a process}} for applying lean concepts to the design phase of a system, such as a complex product or process. The term describes methods of design in {{lean manufacturing}} companies {{as part of the}} study of Japanese industry by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the time of the study, the Japanese automakers were outperforming the American counterparts in speed, resources used in design, and design quality. Conventional mass-production design focuses primarily on product functions and manufacturing costs; however,design for lean manufacturing systematically widens the design equation to include all factors that will determine a product's success across its entire value stream and life-cycle. One goal is to reduce waste and maximize value, and other goals include improving the quality of the design and the reducing the time to achieve the final solution. The method has been used in architecture, healthcare, product development, processes design, information technology systems, and even to create lean business models. It relies on the definition and optimization of values coupled with the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> before they enter the system. Design for lean manufacturing is system design.|$|R
40|$|The <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> muscle <b>wasting</b> is {{important}} for maintaining quality of life, since loss of muscle mass {{can lead to a}} bedridden state and decreased resistance to diseases. The <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> muscle <b>wasting</b> requires an increase in protein synthesis and a decrease in protein degradation in skeletal muscle. We previously showed that lysine (Lys) markedly suppressed myofibrillar protein degradation by inhibiting the autophagic-lysosomal system via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and other signal molecules in C 2 C 12 cells. In this study, we investigated the involvement of Akt and adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP) -activated protein kinase (AMPK), two regulators of autophagy, on the suppressive effects of Lys on myofibrillar protein degradation in C 2 C 12 cells. Lys induced the phosphorylation of Akt, but the suppressive effects of Lys on myofibrillar protein degradation and autophagy were completely abolished in the presence of Akt 1 / 2 kinase inhibitor (Akti). Lys suppressed the phosphorylation of AMPK, but this effect was also abolished by Akti. On the other hand, AMPK activation by -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide- 1 -β-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR) did not affect either Akt activity or the autophagic-lysosomal system in C 2 C 12 cells treated with Lys. These results indicate that regulation of AMPK activity is not essential for the regulation of autophagy by Lys. Taken together, our results show that Lys suppresses myofibrillar protein degradation by the autophagic-lysosomal system through the phosphorylation of Akt in C 2 C 12 cells. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recently, {{operational}} organizations {{active in}} child nutrition {{in developing countries}} have suggested that blanket feeding strategies be adopted to enable the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> child <b>wasting.</b> A new range of nutritional supplements is now available, with claims that they can prevent wasting in populations at risk of periodic food shortages. Evidence is lacking as {{to the effectiveness of}} such preventive interventions. This study examined the effect of a ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) on the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> in 6 - to 36 -mo-old children within the framework of a general food distribution program. Methods and Findings: We conducted a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled pragmatic intervention study in a sample of 1, 038 children aged 6 to 36 mo in the city of Abeche, Chad. Both arms were included in a general food distribution program providing staple foods. The intervention group was given a daily 46 g of RUSF for 4 mo. Anthropometric measurements and morbidity were recorded monthly. Adding RUSF to a package of monthly household food rations for households containing a child assigned to the intervention group did not result in a reduction in cumulative incidence <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> (incidence risk ratio: 0. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 67, 1. 11; p = 0. 25). However, the intervention group had a modestly higher gain in height-for-age (+ 0. 03 Z-score/mo; 95 % CI: 0. 01, 0. 04; p < 0. 001). In addition, children in the intervention group had a significantly higher hemoglobin concentration {{at the end of the}} study than children in the control group (+ 3. 8 g/l; 95 % CI: 0. 6, 7. 0; p = 0. 02), thereby reducing the odds of anemia (odds ratio: 0. 52; 95 % CI: 0. 34, 0. 82; p = 0. 004). Adding RUSF also resulted in a significantly lower risk of self-reported diarrhea (- 29. 3 %; 95 % CI: 20. 5, 37. 2; p < 0. 001) and fever episodes (- 22. 5 %; 95 % CI: 14. 0, 30. 2; p < 0. 001). Limitations of this study include that the projected sample size was not fully attained and that significantly fewer children from the control group were present at follow-up sessions.
