40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{construction}} of a taxonomy of <b>incidents</b> in <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> and is organised as follows: the first section concerns a survey of existing taxonomies, glossaries or controlled languages for computer security incidents. It starts with a definition of the terms used in this report and a discussion on the use of taxonomies as measurement tools. The survey aims at clarifying the importance of the definition of a common language for exchanging and gathering information on computer security. The second section presents the original ideas for the taxonomy proposed with this report. The main assumption is in the definition of the main functions a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> should perform and in defining a disruption as the lack of one of these functions. The third section is the actual presentation of the taxonomy. Some examples of classification in this taxonomy of known computer security incidents are added. While the overall aim of this work is at the construction of complete taxonomy for <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> [...] - including the telecommunication services [...] - the examples provided in this section will mainly deal with disruptions occurring in the Internet domain. The fourth section presents the future work to be done for continuing the development of the taxonomy proposed here. JRC. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} adaptive {{antenna system}} was implemented to study the performance of adaptive arrays {{in the presence of}} weak interfering signals. It is a sidelobe canceler with two auxiliary elements. Modified feedback loops, which decorrelate the noise components of the two inputs to the loop correlators, control the array weights. Digital processing is used for algorithm implementation and performance evaluation. The results show that the system can suppress interfering signals which are 0 to 10 dB below the thermal noise level in the main channel by 20 to 30 dB. When the desired signal is strong in the auxiliary elements the amount of interference suppression decreases. The amount of degradation depends on the number of interfering signals <b>incident</b> on the <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> A modified steering vector which overcomes this problem is proposed...|$|R

During the introductory period of new <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> the basic problem of lacking experience arises. This problem is usually solved by a pilot project. Instead of this, there {{is another way to}} receive an overall sight of the new <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> This way is presented through modelling of a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> using its hypothetical model. The described method founds on a simple idea. While the signal staff officers are planning the structure of a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> they have got the necessary knowledge on the planned <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> But we can provide description of a new generation <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> The model of the hypothetical <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> is determined by specific system properties, station and device properties. This determination is a model of hypothetical <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> To solve any problem, the model of the hypothetical <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> can be used during staff exercises. Skilled signal officers and developers have to co-operate at such exercises. This method is suitable for making solution on all the matters such as structure of <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> transit or access nodes.

40|$|<b>Communication</b> <b>systems,</b> {{along with}} {{database}} systems, have attracted {{a lot of}} attention in software engineering research. Encouraged by the success of SQL systems, some early efforts have been devoted to the study of a similar <b>system</b> for <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> Even though there has been some research to provide a common language or a virtual machine for building <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> there are only few theoretical studies on the complexity of specifying and modeling <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we propose an approach to model common <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> which have no complicated stochastic control logics. Our model contains two parts: (1) a communication logic definition and (2) a set of <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> operations. Our approach has the following benefits: a unified interface between communication roles/systems, a recursive way to model <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> and the adoption of a multicastconference model.

40|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) technique provides a new degree of freedom for information transmissions in millimeter wave communications. Considering the spatial distribution characteristics of OAM beams, a new OAM spatial modulation (OAM-SM) millimeter wave <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> is first proposed for future mobile networks. Furthermore, the capacity, average bit error probability and energy efficiency of OAM-SM millimeter wave <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> are analytically derived for performance analysis.

30|$|The earlier works [20 â€“ 25] mainly {{considered}} {{energy harvesting}} <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> {{with only one}} transmitter. However, nowadays many <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> are equipped {{with more than one}} transmitter. Therefore, it is necessary to study energy harvesting <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> with multiple transmitters. In [26], optimal packet scheduling in a multiple access <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with two energy harvesting transmitters was investigated. In [27], a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with an energy harvesting transmitter over parallel and fading Gaussian broadcast channels was studied. In [28], an optimal power allocation policy for a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with two energy harvesting transmitters over an interference channel was proposed. These works shed light on energy harvesting <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> with multiple transmitters, but did not consider transmitter switching. In our opinion, transmitter switching can provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting <b>communication</b> <b>system,</b> especially when a transmitter is unable to send data or the energy harvested from the environment is insufficient for data transmission. If this happens, other neighboring transmitters can turn to work and help the transmitter to proceed data transmission. To make the transmitter switching effective and decrease the switching overhead, a well-designed policy is essential to choosing the suitable transmitter to work.|$|R
