40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the effects of institutional support on <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation and firm performance and describe how dysfunctional competition influences relevant outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a research model based on institution-based view and tests it using structural equation modeling and empirical data collected from 300 manufacturers in China. Findings: The results show that institutional support positively affects <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation and firm performance. Both <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation improve firm performance. The findings reveal that dysfunctional competition significantly reduces the positive effects of institutional support on <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation but leaves the effects of institutional support <b>and</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation on firm performance unaffected. Originality/value: This study contributes to innovation literature by providing insights into the impact of China’s institutional environment on manufacturing firms’ <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation decisions. The findings also contribute to institution-based view literature by providing empirical evidence on the joint effects of institutional support and dysfunctional competition on <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation and firm performance. This study can help manufacturers in China take advantage of institutional environment <b>and</b> adjust <b>product</b> <b>and</b> process innovation decisions accordingly...|$|R

40|$|The global company {{operates}} from {{a number}} of locations worldwide, which entails geographical distances and logistical implications for <b>product</b> <b>and</b> parts transported, as well as the choice of product variety because of numerable worldwide consumer preferences. In these companies, packaging becomes a frequently used object to complement <b>product</b> features <b>and</b> achieve an effective and efficient means of transportation. In this context, it is interesting to integrate packaging development in the product development process to improve development decisions on e. g. manufacturing, assembly and distribution, and also to reduce repeated changes in <b>product</b> design <b>and</b> other development processes. To corroborate these thoughts, the overall objective for this thesis is to explore the potential of improving resource utilisation in the development of <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging by an integrated development of <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging. In three surveys in Swedish mechanical, pharmaceutical and food industries, which account for approximately 74 % of all packaged products produced in Sweden, the potential for the concept was explored and positively validated. By comparisons across survey results and additional information provided by literature reviews of mechanical, pharmaceutical <b>and</b> food <b>product</b> development, the possibility of introducing integrated <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging development into an integrated procedure model has been established. Note that the packaging developer’s perspective is excluded in this thesis. Duc to extensive diversity in composition <b>and</b> organisation for <b>product</b> development across the product areas surveyed, an integrated <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging procedure model is heavily dependent upon product area. For the integration of <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging it is (1) important to include packaging in the product mission statement, (2) preferable to consider the function decomposition of <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging when specifying the <b>product</b> <b>and</b> (3) beneficial to also decide upon packaging hierarchy and packaging materials when deciding on detailed <b>product</b> systems <b>and</b> subsystems. Note that when the product area is known, relevant methods and techniques for the integration of <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging activities on an operational leve 1 in the procedure model may be developed Future research should implement a preliminary suggestion into {{one or more of the}} surveyed product areas’ product development activities to achieve a final <b>and</b> verified integrated <b>product</b> <b>and</b> packaging development procedure model...|$|R

Our findings provide implications on how to choose between explorative and exploitative alliances relative to the alliance objectives and firm resources and environmental contexts. ...|$|R

Similarly there is a significant feedback (long-term) effect from petroleum imports to gross national <b>product</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. This feedback is fairly significant. However, the short-term effect is highly significant, but there is a relatively slow response from the values of gross national product to petroleum imports.
