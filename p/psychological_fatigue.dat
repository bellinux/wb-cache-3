40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the <b>psychological</b> <b>fatigue</b> and analyze muscle activity of production workers who are performing processes jobs while standing for prolonged time periods. Methods: The <b>psychological</b> <b>fatigue</b> experienced by the workers was obtained through questionnaire surveys. Meanwhile, muscle activity has been analyzed using surface electromyography (sEMG) measurement. Lower extremities muscles include: erector spi-nae, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius were concurrently measured for more than five hours of standing. Twenty male produc-tion workers in a metal stamping company participated as subjects in this study. The subjects were required to undergo question-naire surveys and sEMG measurement. Results: Results of the questionnaire surveys found that all subjects experienced <b>psychological</b> <b>fatigue</b> due to prolonged standing jobs. Similarly, muscle fatigue has been identified through sEMG measurement. Based on the non-parametric statistical test using the Spearman’s rank order correlation, the left erector spinae obtained a moderate positive correlation and statistically significant (rs = 0. 552, p < 0. 05) between the results of questionnaire surveys and sEMG measurement.

40|$|Background. Although {{there is}} {{considerable}} support for adverse relationships between states of psychological and somatic distress and immune response, {{there is little evidence}} in humans of the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors. Methods. This study utilized a twin methodology to examine the interplay between <b>psychological</b> distress, <b>fatigue</b> and immune function. We recorded a number of measures of distress, including conventional depression and anxiety as well as the somatic symptom of prolonged fatigue, and immune responsiveness (by delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response) in 124 normal adult twin pairs (79 monozygotic, 45 dizygotic). Results. While there were strong genetic influences on the <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>fatigue</b> factors (only some of which are common to both), familial aggregation of immune responsiveness arose mainly from environmental factors shared by both members of a twin pair. Phenotypic correlations between psychological and immune measures were negligible, but multivariate genetic modelling revealed that these masked larger genetic and environmental correlations of opposite sign. Negative environmental effects of <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>fatigue</b> on immune responsiveness were countered by a positive genetic relationship between psychological distress and immune function. Conclusions. Our study suggests that current psychoneuroimmunological hypotheses in humans need to be modified to place increasing importance on the individual 2 ̆ 7 s genotype. In this cohort immune responsiveness varied in response to a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Additionally, although <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>fatigue</b> had some shared genetic determinants, independent genetic and environmental risk factors for fatigue were also identified...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{correlation}} study {{to identify the}} factors influencing sleep quality, fatigue, and postnatal de-pression inmothers who have given birth during the past 6 months. Methods:The study was conducted using a survey with questionnaires to 329 mothers who visited E University Medical Center, or three local clinics located in D city, between August andOctober 2013. Collected {{data were analyzed using}} the SPSS/WIN 20. 0 program. Results:Out of 329 subjects, 18. 2 % showed that they had mild postnatal depression whereas 24. 3 % had severe postnatal depression. Accordingly, 42. 5 % reported having postnatal depression. Postnatal depression had a significant corre-lation with sleep hours after childbirth (r=-. 16, p=. 003), spousal support (r=-. 28, p<. 001), sleep quality (r=-. 35, p<. 001), physical fatigue (r=. 66, p<. 001), <b>psychological</b> <b>fatigue</b> (r=. 69, p<. 001), and neurosensory fatigue (r=. 56, p<. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Somatic {{symptoms}} often co-occur with psychological symptoms {{but this}} overlap is poorly understood. Some {{aspects of this}} overlap differ in the South Asian context, {{but it is not}} clear whether this is a reporting effect or an underlying difference in experienced illness. METHODS: Home interviews were administered to 4, 024 twins randomly selected from a population-based twin register in the Colombo district of Sri Lanka (the CoTASS study). These included assessments of psychological, somatic and fatigue symptoms. The data were analyzed using factor analytic and quantitative genetic approaches. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the symptoms from the three scales represented three separate dimensions, rather than all tapping into a single dimension. However, familial correlations among the data were most consistent with a common pathway model. This implies that a portion of the underlying vulnerability is common across <b>psychological,</b> <b>fatigue</b> and somatic symptoms. There were sex differences in the etiology of this model, with shared environmental and genetic influences playing different roles in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: There is a complex etiological relationship between <b>psychological,</b> <b>fatigue</b> and somatic symptoms. This is similar in Sri Lanka to Western countries, but there may be a greater influence from the family environment, suggesting that care needs to be taken when generalizing research findings between countries. People who complain of certain fatigue or somatic symptoms may well also have psychological symptoms, or may have genetic or environmental vulnerabilities to such problems...|$|E

Fifty-five sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in a high school physical education class participated in one of four fitness activities every other day. Two activities were traditional fitness (running; step-aerobics) and two were sport fitness (ballistic basketball; ultimate indoor soccer). Participants were required to maintain a moderate exercise intensity (140 - 180 bpm) for a minimum of 20 minutes out of a 30 -minute lesson as measured by POLAR ACCUREX II heart rate monitors. Participants completed a Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale (SEES) pre- and postexercise in order to determine changes in positive well-being, <b>psychological</b> distress, and <b>fatigue.</b> Participants responded to an additional item, postexercise, in order to assess post-activity levels of enjoyment. Results showed that over time participants displayed a significant increase in positive well-being (£ 1, 239 = 18. 73, <. 0001) after participation regardless of the activity. No significant differences were discovered when examining participants’ perceptions of <b>fatigue</b> or <b>psychological</b> distress. Analysis of covariance revealed no significant differences between activities for positive well-being, <b>psychological</b> distress, or <b>fatigue.</b> In relation to post-activity perceptions of enjoyment, analysis of variance displayed a significant difference (£ 3 ^ 3 4 = 11. 53, e <. 0001) between activities. Participants enjoyed ballistic basketball and ultimate indoor soccer more than running and step aerobics. Based on the findings of this study we conclude that participants experience greater enjoyment through participation in sport fitness activities as opposed to traditional fitness activities. We also conclude that positive well-being increases over time regardless of the activity when performed at a moderate exercise intensity. M. S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|R

40|$|Insomnia is {{characterized}} by complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep which last {{for at least one}} month and which cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Estimates of insomnia in women with breast cancer range from approximately 20 % to 70 %, with reports of poor sleep lasting for years after completion of the cancer treatment. Insomnia in breast cancer patients is often associated with depression, anxiety, fatigue, and low quality of life. This study aimed at understanding whether an individual cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) would result in improvements in sleep as well as improvements in fatigue, depression, anxiety and quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer survivors. Fourteen breast cancer survivors (age M= 61, SD= 11. 6, range = 45 - 85) were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks of CBT-I followed by 6 weeks of follow up, or 6 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU) followed by 6 weeks of CBT-I. The hypotheses tested were that subjective and objective measures of sleep would improve during CBT-I compared to during TAU, that the QOL, fatigue, depression and anxiety would improve during CBT-I compared to during TAU, and that the effects of CBT-I on sleep and other symptoms would be maintained at 6 weeks. The results revealed that the participants assigned to receiving the CBT-I in the first six weeks had improved self-rated insomnia after treatment compared to the participants assigned to TAU (Insomnia severity index. Post-CBT-I: M= 12. 20, SD= 6. 57, range= 2 - 19; Post-TAU: M= 20. 71, SD= 3. 99, range= 16 - 26, p= 0. 03). The pooled analyses of pre and post CBT-I treatment for all 14 participants revealed significant improvements in self-rated insomnia and sleep quality as well as improvements in objective measures of sleep. The analyses of the group that received CBT-I followed by 6 weeks of follow-up revealed that the sleep benefits gained during treatment were maintained at follow-up. In addition, QOL significantly improved at follow-up. No significant effects were found for psychological or fatigue variables. The results are comparable to the sleep findings in previous studies that looked at group CBT-I therapies in breast cancer survivors, but differ in the effects found in <b>psychological,</b> <b>fatigue</b> and QOL measures. These results show that individual CBT-I is efficacious in improving sleep in breast cancer survivors.

Methods: Workload of 40 pilots was measured using physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blink frequency, saliva cortisol concentration) and <b>psychological</b> (<b>fatigue,</b> sleepiness, tension and task load) parameters. Approaches were conducted in A 320 and A 330 full-flight simulators during night shift. SCDA was compared to the standard Low Drag Low Power (LDLP) procedure as reference. Results: Mean heart rate and blood pressure during the SCDA were not elevated, partly even significantly reduced (on average by 5 bpm and 4 mmHg regarding the flying Captain). Cortisol levels did not change significantly with mean values of 0. 9 to 1. 2 ng/ml. Landing was the most demanding segment of both approaches as indicated by significant increases in heart rate and decreases in blink frequency. Subjective task load was low. Discussion: Both approach procedures caused a similar workload level. Interpreting the results, methodological limitations have to be considered, e. g. the artificial and controlled airspace situation in the flight simulator. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that under these ideal conditions, the SCDA is operable without a higher workload for pilots compared to the common LDLP. ...|$|E

Canadian women’s <b>psychological</b> states, <b>fatigue,</b> and sleep {{have not been}} examined prospectively for contributions to obstetric interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes. Context and purpose of the study: The prospective {{study was conducted in}} British Columbia (BC), Canada with 650 low-risk pregnant women. Of those women, 624 were included in this study. Women were recruited through providers’ offices, media, posters, and pregnancy fairs. We examined associations between pregnant women’s fatigue, sleep deprivation, and psychological states (anxiety and childbirth fear) and women’s exposure to obstetrical interventions and adverse neonatal outcomes (preterm, admission to NICU, low APGARS, and low birth weight). Methods Data from our cross-sectional survey were linked, using women’s personal health numbers, to birth outcomes from the Perinatal Services BC database. After stratifying for parity, we used Pearson’s Chi-square to examine associations between <b>psychological</b> states, <b>fatigue,</b> sleep deprivation and maternal characteristics. We used hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test 9 hypotheses comparing women with high and low childbirth fear and anxiety on likelihood of having epidural anaesthetic, a caesarean section (stratified for parity), assisted vaginal delivery, and adverse neonatal outcomes and women with and without sleep deprivation and high levels of fatigue on likelihood of giving birth by caesarean section, while controlling for maternal, obstetrical (e. g., infant macrosomia), and psychological variables. Results Significantly higher proportions of multiparas, reporting difficult and upsetting labours and births, expectations of childbirth interventions, and health stressors, reported high levels of childbirth fear. Women who reported antenatal relationship, housing, financial, and health stressors and multiparas reporting low family incomes {{were significantly more likely to}} report high anxiety levels. The hypothesis that high childbirth fear significantly increased the risk of using epidural anaesthesia was supported. Conclusions Controlling for some psychological states and sleep quality while examining other contributors to outcomes decreases the likelihood of linking childbirth fear anxiety, sleep deprivation, and fatigue to increased odds of caesarean section. Ameliorating women’s childbirth fear to reduce their exposure to epidural anaesthesia can occur through developing effective interventions. These include helping multiparous women process previous experiences of difficult and upsetting labour and birth. </p...|$|R

Authors note that actions in Syria and Iraq have indirect, but transnational effect, pose threat to the interests of the national security of Russia, especially including one, conducted in Crimea with the use of Islamic radicals for this purpose, who are on the peninsula and territory of the Ukraine. In the present article authors note that every year in the process of the population's <b>psychological</b> <b>fatigue</b> strengthening, new losses among the military personnel and the intelligence services staff and also death of peaceful citizens, their positions will only amplify. "Defeatism" will become a powerful political force. Problem of the international legal aspect of the counteraction to the threat from the actions of foreign fighters-terrorists who are hired or accepted with ISIL, al-Nusra Front and other groups and organizations of the terrorist orientation is connected with the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) made on September 24, 2014. It’s main objective – development of the nonviolent ways of the conflicts prevention and settlement {{for the purposes of the}} radicalization to the level generating terrorism risk degree decrease. In the conclusion authors argument that it is especially actual for the Russian regions, which is extremely vulnerable to extremism (North Caucasus, Volga Region) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to validate {{the use of the}} proposed International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10 th revision) (ICD- 10) criteria for fatigue (P-ICD 10) through comparison with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue (FACT-F) subscale and three visual analogue scale (VAS) qualities in cancer patients thought to be fatigued. Fatigue was assessed in 834 cancer patients at three clinical centres in Belgium, using P-ICD 10, FACT-F, and VAS to assess: level of energy (VAS 1), quality of life (VAS 2), and ability to perform daily activities (VAS 3). Of the 834 interviewed cancer patients, 54 % were classified as fatigued by the P-ICD 10 criteria. Internal consistency of P-ICD 10 was very good (alpha coefficient 0. 82). The principal component analysis corroborated good internal consistency with all variables included in the first component; a second component was used to identify <b>psychological</b> <b>fatigue</b> (concentration and short-term memory disabilities). An abridged set of screening tools based on the first three general symptoms of the P-ICD 10 is proposed with 100 % specificity and 86 % specificity, respectively. There was a marked decrease in FACT-F and VAS 1 scores in patients diagnosed as fatigued by the P-ICD 10 (mean +/- SD, FACT-F 20 +/- 9 vs 39 +/- 8, VAS 1 34 +/- 21 vs 61 +/- 21). A logistic regression model between P-ICD 10 criteria diagnosis and FACT-F (VAS 1) identified a score of 34 (61) on the FACT-F scale as a proposed cut-off point for the diagnosis of fatigue. The ICD- 10 criteria can be recommended as a diagnostic tool, whereas the FACT-F scale and the level of energy 100 -mm VAS assess the intensity of fatigue, and are more suitable for follow-up of cancer-related fatigue...|$|E

40|$|A person’s {{subjective}} {{experience to}} their first exercise session is likely to influence their long-term adherence to regular exercise. The aim of the current pilot study therefore is to quantify the subjective exercise experience of previously sedentary Vietnam War Veterans undertaking an initial bout of one of three different exercise interventions. Thirty-two Vietnam Veterans presenting {{with one or more}} chronic diseases/conditions participated in one of three acute exercise bouts: 1) lower-body vibration, upper-body resistance and stretching (WBVT); 2) lower-body vibration, upper-body resistance, aerobic exercise and stretching (WBVT+CV); and 3) full-body resistance, aerobic exercise and stretching (R+CV). Pre and post acute exercise measures of positive well being, <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>fatigue</b> were assessed with the Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale (SEES). A 3 (conditions) x 2 (time) repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD was used to identify any significant differences in SEES between exercise groups and pre and post-exercise. All interventions increased positive well being, with WBVT and R+CV reporting improvements across all areas of the SEES. The WBVT+CV group reported slightly increased psychological distress and the greatest increase in fatigue. An acute bout of exercise increases positive well-being in previously sedentary War Veterans however a longer-duration exercise bout containing multiple exercise modes may be too demanding for this population. Exercise professionals should consider commencing with a simple program to minimise <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>fatigue</b> as this may negatively impact on exercise adherence...|$|R
