500|$|The EP {{opens with}} [...] "Call Me Maybe", an upbeat track that draws {{influences}} from dance-pop and R. The clever lyrics {{of the song}} describes the [...] "infatuation and inconvenience of a love at first sight," [...] as described by Bill Lamb of About.com. During the pre-chorus, the singer states, [...] "Ripped jeans, skin was showing/Hot night, wind was blowing/Where you think you’re going, baby?" [...] As the chorus begins, the background incorporates synthesized string chords, and she sings, [...] "Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy, But here's my number, So call me maybe." [...] Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] is a [...] "Taylor Swift meets Robyn" [...] song. The title track, [...] "Curiosity", has a similar sound to [...] "Call Me Maybe", and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs for more of his love. [...] "Picture" [...] is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship. Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content. [...] "Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "Just a Step Away" [...] were both described as mid-tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love, teen love and that first crush. Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks, Carly is able to transcend the listener [...] "to a <b>porch</b> <b>swing</b> or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside’s summer sunshine. Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything that comes along with it." [...] The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Both Sides Now". Musically, the song is also an upbeat ballad, and differs from the original version {{in the sense that}} Jepsen's version is [...] "fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist." [...] Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to [...] "attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit" [...] with her [...] "unique version." ...|$|E

His determination to [...] "make something of himself." [...] His arrival in Columbus, Ohio, with just seventy-eight cents--he emphasized it: [...] "just seventy-eight cents, that's every red cent I had, when I started out to look for a job, and I didn't know a single guy in town." [...] His reading of books during the evenings of his first years in Ohio; he didn't [...] "remember their titles, exactly," [...] he said, but he was sure that [...] "he read a lot of them." ... At last he spoke of his wife, of their buggy-riding, of their neat frame house with the lawn and the <b>porch</b> <b>swing.</b> Of their quarrels--he made it clear that his wife had been [...] "finicky," [...] and had [...] "fool notions," [...] but he praised her for having [...] "come around and learned that a man is a man, and sometimes he means a lot better than it looks like; prob'ly he loves her a lot better than a lot of these plush-soled, soft-tongued fellows that give 'em a lot of guff and lovey-dovey stuff and don't shell out the cash.

Douglas comments on how sitting in the <b>porch</b> <b>swing</b> feels somehow [...] "right" [...] because one would always be comforted by the droning, ceaseless voices of the adults.

In June 2002, the company moved to its present 25000 sq ft storefront location at 119 West 23rd Street, occupying the entire first floor of the Printing Arts Building (which extends through to 24th street). The first three locations were notable for their eccentric decor, including an antique five-cent Coke machine, and a <b>porch</b> <b>swing.</b> The Coke machine remains at the 119 West 23rd Street location, but the <b>porch</b> <b>swing</b> was retired due to the newest space's substantially higher ceilings.|$|E

There are two computer monitors on {{either end of the}} porch, mimicking information-stations at national parks. Here, the participant is directed with instructions to touch the screen, which triggers video projections. It will be possible for both screens to be activated simultaneously, so there will often be dual images projected.

They looked across Loring Park and the Parade to the towers of St. Mark's and the Procathedral, and the red roofs of houses climbing Kenwood Hill. They drove about the chain of garden-circled lakes, and viewed the houses of the millers and lumbermen and real estate peers--the potentates of the expanding city. They surveyed the small eccentric bungalows with pergolas, the houses of pebbledash and tapestry brick with sleeping-porches above sun-parlors, and one vast incredible chateau fronting the Lake of the Isles. They tramped through a shining-new section of apartment-houses; not the tall bleak apartments of Eastern cities but low structures of cheerful yellow brick, in which each flat had its glass-enclosed <b>porch</b> with <b>swinging</b> couch and scarlet cushions and Russian brass bowls. Between a waste of tracks and a raw gouged hill they found poverty in staggering shanties.|$|R

He calls Emily out on her relationship with Jack Porter (Nick Wechsler), revealing to Daniel that she had come by the bar to give Jack a gift.

50|$|The ranch {{reflects}} Will Rogers' {{roots in}} horsemanship, {{starting with the}} polo field, {{which is the first}} thing the visitor sees when looking south from the parking area. The field is the only outdoor polo field in Los Angeles County, and the only field that is regulation size. The ranch has been in many movies and television shows, including Star Trek IV, in which it stood in for Golden Gate Park. The polo field features a gentle slope that forms an area for viewing the polo action. Up from the parking area are the ranch buildings, including the visitor center, which once was the ranch guest house. The visitor center features a film on the life of Will Rogers, literature and an audio tour of the grounds. The ranch buildings and grounds are maintained as they were when the Rogers family lived there in the late 1920s and 1930s. The living room of the main ranch house, with a collection of Native American rugs and baskets, features a <b>porch</b> <b>swing</b> {{in the center of the}} room and a mounted calf, which was given to Will Rogers to encourage him to rope the calf instead of his friends. The north wing of the house contains the family bedrooms, Rogers' study and the sunroom.|$|E
50|$|Charlotte Grayson/Clarke - Initially, Emily and Charlotte had no interactions, until Emily {{discovered}} Charlotte was her half-sister from Mason Treadwell's interview tapes, {{and they}} grow close. Charlotte {{becomes one of}} the few people Emily seeks to protect from her revenge scheme. Charlotte developed an addiction to oxycodone, and she attempted suicide in the first season finale, though Emily's reaction to this was never depicted. At one point, Emily attempts to console Charlotte on her <b>porch</b> <b>swing</b> by telling Charlotte a story she remembers from her childhood that she claims Amanda told her. Charlotte trusted Emily enough to tell her that Victoria was alive and in hiding. Emily is shown to realize the relationship she is missing with Charlotte by posing as the real Emily Thorne, and vice versa. When Charlotte announces her decision to change her surname to Clarke on her 18th birthday, Emily is seen smiling. Animosity develops on Charlotte's part towards Emily when she discovers her pregnancy was false, and continues in spite of Emily revealing her true identity as her sister. Charlotte is so angered that she subdues Emily in the Stowaway and sets it ablaze in an attempt to kill her. Emily decides to forgive Charlotte, who later calls on her for help when she accidentally kills a man she had slept with, who threatened her father. Taking Emily's advice, Charlotte leaves for rehab.|$|E

The highway then comes to a junction with N-10 on the north side of Franklin. The two routes run south, concurrently, for a half mile (0.5 mi) to the center of town there N-10 continues south and US 136 diverges to the east. The highway then continues east for another 10 mi before entering Riverton, a small village on the Republican River. The highway continues east passing the community of Inavale before arriving at an intersection with US 281 in the Webster County seat of Red Cloud. Red Cloud was an important pioneer community as eight passenger trains per day passed through its train depot. It was also the childhood home of author Willa Cather whose Great Plains trilogy of novels recounted life during the homestead frontier in the late 19th century. Her childhood home is one block south of US 136 on Cedar Street. The highway leaves Red Cloud, continuing due east for about 10 mi before coming to an intersection with N-78 just north of Guide Rock. US 136 then continues due east through corn, sorghum, soybean, and wheat fields for the next 14 mi before meeting up with N-14 north of Superior. The two highways run concurrently to the north for 4 mi before US 136 breaks off and continues its easterly trek. The highway then passes the communities of Nora and Ruskin before arriving in Deshler at an intersection with N-5. Deshler was home to the one of the nation's largest broom factory in the 1950s and 1960s.
