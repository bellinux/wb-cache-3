5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the short dot and dash signals and their ever-present adjacent dot duration silent periods, Morse code symbols are of longer duration than signals and are composed of unique dot/dash sequences of Morse signals and silent periods. Morse code symbols are separated from each other by at least a three dot duration inter-symbol silent period. Morse code symbols represent alpha-numeric, punctuation and prosign characters. Each such long duration symbol consists of a unique sequence {{of two or more}} of the three basic elements (dot, dash, silent period), e.g. the unique sequence for the English letter [...] "C" [...] is (...) [...] Each unique symbol represents either: (i) a unique alpha-numeric character (e.g. letters A-Z and numerals 0-9), (ii) a unique punctuation character (e.g. ? or @, etc.), or (iii) a unique <b>procedural</b> <b>symbol.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the performance of students on quadratic equations after they had developed procedural methods of solving linear equations by shifting symbols using rules such as ‘change sides, change signs ’ (Lima & Tall, 2008). Knowing their difficulties with algebraic manipulation, the teachers had focused first on simple quadratics with only two non-zero terms {{and then on the}} use of the formula which they considered as a universal method to solve all quadratic equations. The consequence was that longer-term only a few students could solve a quadratic equation using the formula, and a further procedural embodiment was adopted by a minority of students to solve an equation such as x 2 = 9 by ‘passing the power over 2 the other side and changing it to a root ’ to get the single solution x = 9 = 3. Other than this all other methods involved <b>procedural</b> <b>symbol</b> manipulation, often leading to error. While it is the duty of mathematics educators to improve student learning, it is also a responsibility to understand why so many students end up performing ‘rules without reason ’ that lead to failure. We discuss this phenomenon in terms of embodied cognition in which the procedural embodiment of symbol-shifting is preferred to any embodied model (such as a balance to represent an equation) and the manipulation of symbols fails to have the richer meaning proposed by theories of process-object encapsulation. This long-term failure is is placed within a wider theoretical framework incorporating human embodiment and symbolic manipulation...|$|E

5000|$|Although Morse code preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, Morse code may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation code). The Morse code source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest Morse code symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh codes. Morse code symbols are variable length sequences of: dot signals, dash signals, and dot duration silent periods. Vail based his Morse code on the English language source with the shortest Morse symbol, a sequence composed of a single Morse code dot followed by a single dot duration silent period, encoding the most often used English letter [...] "E" [...] with corresponding longer sequences used for less common English letters. Besides assigning Morse code symbols to alpha-numeric and punctuation characters of the information source language symbols the early creators of Morse code also assigned additional <b>procedural</b> <b>symbols</b> to the Morse code related to page formatting of documents and to control and turn over of telegraph communication channels.|$|R
30|$|In retrospect, {{the above}} tension between PTs’ and children’s {{learning}} {{may be reduced}} by improving the methods course instruction. First, the instructor could have acknowledged the tension between PTs’ and elementary children’s learning, but still explicitly {{emphasized the importance of}} reasoning upon a word problem situation from the perspective of children. Helping PTs explicitly see the value of the intended instructional approach may motivate them to struggle for success (Eccles et al. 1983). Second, the instructor could have helped PTs develop a stronger understanding of the definition or the basic meaning of multiplication before offering the shortcuts. With a stronger understanding, PTs may find it easier to conduct mathematical reasoning (Beckmann et al. 2015). In fact, the shortcut may not even be needed during the process of problem solving. This may minimize the risk of reinforcing PTs’ <b>procedural</b> foci and <b>symbol</b> precedence view that contradict children’s learning.|$|R
