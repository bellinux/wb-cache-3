50|$|The LSWR {{was now in}} {{possession}} of a shorter and more efficient route to Portsmouth.

5000|$|In October 1988, under {{charter to}} DFDS Seaways, the Trapezitza and her sister, {{which had been}} renamed Tzarvetz was {{purchased}} by Sealink British Ferries [...] and renamed initially to Fantasia and Fiesta respectively. After a short refit in Bremerhaven in 1989 the Fantasia was again renamed Channel Seaway and began operating a freight service between Dover and Calais. Sealink eventually {{decided to use the}} two vessels, in a <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> with SNCF to provide a joint service running between Dover and Calais. As a result of this decision, the Channel Seaway and her sister, now named Fiesta were sent to Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven in October 1989 to be converted from freight carriers to passenger carriers. As part of the <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement,</b> the Channel Seaway was to be given to SNCF, as a result of this, whilst at Bremerhaven, the two vessels swapped names, the Channel Seaway becoming the Fiesta. The Fiesta returned to Calais on 13 May 1990, however due to French industrial action, did not enter service until 9 July 1990. In 1989 ownership of the vessel transferred to Societé Nouvelle d'Armement Transmanche (SNAT) and then in 1990, SNCF transferred the operations to Societé Propietaire des Navaires (SPN). In August 1990, SPN and Sealink British Ferries signed an extension of 5 years to their <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> on board the Fiesta in Dover harbour. The early 90's was a difficult time for the Fiesta, her services frequently being interrupted by industrial action, most notably in June/July 1991, April 1992 and February 1995.|$|E

BUA also continued Airwork’s and Hunting-Clan’s participation in various <b>pool</b> <b>agreements</b> with foreign national airlines. On the East African routes, for example, BUA participated in a tripartite <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with BOAC and East African Airways. Participating in revenue-sharing agreements with its foreign counterparts was a prerequisite for securing overseas traffic rights, especially in Africa.|$|R

50|$|At this time, the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway {{opened a}} new line to Albert Harbour in Greenock; the company was allied to the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and the Albert Harbour station was {{adjacent}} to the steamer berths; the new entrant was severe competition for the Caledonian Railway's Greenock operation, {{and for a time}} there was cut-throat competition with ruinous fare reductions there, until a traffic <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> was finalised in 1871.|$|E
50|$|Such {{anti-competitive}} {{practices were}} {{not confined to}} BCal's European operations. The bilateral agreements governing most of BCal's long-haul routes obliged the airline {{to enter into a}} <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with the designated foreign flag carriers. These agreements stipulated that all revenues were to be equally shared by all carriers serving the same route. This usually meant that revenues were shared on a 50:50 basis, regardless of each carrier's actual market share. The only exceptions to this rule were the US as well as the Asian countries to which BCal flew. As far as the US was concerned, no US airline was allowed to enter into a <b>pool</b> <b>agreement</b> with any other airline — especially, a wholly/majority government-owned, foreign carrier — as this constituted a violation of that country's antitrust laws. With regard to the Asian countries that received scheduled services from BCal, the UK already had fully liberalised or fairly liberal bilateral air services agreements with these countries.|$|R

50|$|The {{accounts}} {{for the first half}} year, produced in March 1851, showed gross income for the six months to be £87,186 and a 2¼% dividend was declared. The Company owned 72 engines, 171 passenger coaches, and 2,416 non-passenger vehicles. Good enough as the results were, the long main line to Gretna was not producing much, due to the dominance of competing route of the Caledonian Railway, and business in general declined following the first half year. A <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> was finalised in 1853 which mitigated some of the worst toll charges, but routing of goods traffic via the CR was made obligatory in many situations. The agreement included a comprehensive limitation on encroachment by either railway into the other's territory.|$|E

Seeing the danger of admitting DNS trains worked by GWR locomotives into Southampton, the LSWR agreed to the connection on condition that their own engines took over at Winchester and worked DNS trains on to Southampton from there, over its own line onward from Shawford Junction. For the time being GWR engines were forbidden to work south of Winchester, {{and there was always}} an engine change in the cramped station there until a <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> finalised in 1910 removed this restriction.|$|E
50|$|Sixteen {{international}} airlines provided regular {{flights to}} Khartoum. The number {{of domestic and}} international passengers increased from about 478,000 in 1982 to about 485,000 in 1984.

As compared with the previous year, in 1989 passenger traffic on Sudan Airways fell by 32% to 363,181 people, reducing the load factor to 34.9%. By contrast, freight volume increased by 63.7% to 12,317 tons. At the end of 1979, Sudan Airways had entered into a <b>pooling</b> <b>agreement</b> with Britain's Tradewinds Airways to furnish charter cargo service between that country and Khartoum under a subsidiary company, Sudan Air Cargo.

The analysis has broader applicability than pools, being relevant to a number of co-marketing arrangements. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} extent to which patent <b>pools</b> (<b>agreements</b> where patent holders agree to license their {{intellectual}} property as a package) could be used as an institution to facilitate technology transactions in biotechnology. Patent pools have been used with success in the consumer electronics and other sectors but they are untested in biotechnology despite their transaction cost reducing potential. We suggest two explanations for the fact that patent pools have not been used in this industry. The first is that the current antitrust requirements are difficult to meet in biotechnology. The second is the availability of simpler alternatives that will often be more profitable to patent holders: aggregation of rights by one party and cross-licensing...|$|R
