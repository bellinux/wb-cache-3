5|$|Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe {{started its}} attacks on Channel convoys as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 {{during this time}} was to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The {{commander}} of JG 51, Oberst Theo Osterkamp established a policy of unrestricted combat air patrol (freie Jagd) of fighter Staffeln providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out Royal Air Force fighters. On 7 July 1940 Oesau claimed one Spitfire.|$|E

Defeated Sanity also released numerous promos, demos and splits. Influenced by bands such as Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation, their music is mostly {{based on the}} American death metal style. On 2 May 2009, the band announced their signing to Willowtip Records.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the more}} {{immediate}} problem of Barbary piracy was not fully settled. By 1807, Algiers {{had gone back}} to taking American ships and seamen hostage. Distracted by <b>the</b> <b>preludes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> War of 1812, the U.S. was unable <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> provocation until 1815, with the Second Barbary War, in which naval victories by Commodores William Bainbridge and Stephen Decatur led to treaties ending all tribute payments by the U.S.|$|R

5|$|Turkey {{used its}} F-16s {{extensively}} in its conflict with separatist Kurds in Kurdish parts of Turkey and Iraq. Turkey launched its first cross-border raid on 16 December 2007, a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq, involving 50 fighters before Operation Sun. This {{was the first}} time Turkey had mounted a night-bombing operation on a massive scale, and also the largest operation conducted by Turkish Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E

25|$|<b>Preludes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{project began}} in the late 1970s when Shrem started {{teaching}} a course at Yeshiva University. As a demonstration tool, Shrem recorded the bulk of the pizmonim for classroom distribution. The collection resulting from these recordings encompassed roughly 65% of the Sephardic pizmonim liturgy. Since 2004 and over the course of about seven years, Isaac J. Cabasso, on behalf of the Sephardic Pizmonim Project, has provided approximately 200 more recordings of pizmonim not recorded by Shrem.|$|R
5|$|Early that month, the Stavka issued {{orders to}} Southwestern Strategic Direction {{headquarters}} for an offensive in the region, after the victories following the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation and the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya Offensive Operation in the Donbas region. The forces of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Lieutenant General Kirill Moskalenko penetrated German positions {{along the northern}} Donets River, east of Kharkov. Fighting continued into April, with Moskalenko crossing the river and establishing a tenuous bridgehead at Izium. In the south, the Soviet 6th Army had limited success defending against German forces, which managed to keep a bridgehead of their own on the east bank of the river. Catching the attention of Stalin, it set the pace for the <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eventual offensive intended to reach Pavlohrad and Sinelnikovo and eventually Kharkov and Poltava.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that an eight-issue comic-book <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film, written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, {{would be released}} in March 2012. In February 2012, Marvel announced {{the release of a}} second limited series comic book tie-in, Black Widow Strikes written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote Captain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. The story is set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from Iron Man 2. Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers line-up as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ladbroke was a glider landing by British {{airborne}} troops during the Second World War near Syracuse, Sicily, that began on 9July1943 {{as part of}} Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft, the operation was carried out from Tunisia by glider infantry of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks, with a force of 136 Waco Hadrians and eight Airspeed Horsas. The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground {{near the town of}} Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks, as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full-scale invasion of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
50|$|Curtis {{had earlier}} experimented with multimedia. In 1911 {{he created a}} stage show with slides, a lecture, and live musical accompaniment, called The Indian Picture Opera. He used stereopticon {{projectors}}, where two projectors dissolved {{back and forth between}} images. This was his <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> entering <b>the</b> motion picture era.|$|R

5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Night of the Long Knives, {{in which most}} of the SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.|$|E
5|$|The Greek forces were, {{as agreed}} by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty {{in the person of}} Pausanias, who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, Pleistarchus, his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the Athenian {{contingent}} was under the command of Aristides; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents. This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.|$|E
5|$|The Third Perso-Turkic War was {{the third}} and final {{conflict}} between the Sassanian Empire and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Unlike the previous two wars, it was not fought in Central Asia, but in Transcaucasia. Hostilities were initiated in 627 AD by Khagan Tong Yabghu of the Western Göktürks and Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire. Opposing them were the Sassanid Persians, allied with the Pannonian Avars. The war was fought against the background of the last Byzantine-Sassanid War and served as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dramatic events that changed the balance of powers in the Middle East for centuries to come (Battle of Nineveh, Islamic conquest of Persia).|$|E

50|$|A new cat {{was made}} for each {{flogging}} by a bosun's mate and kept in a red baize bag until use. If several dozen lashes were awarded, each could be administered by a fresh bosun's mate—a left-handed one could be included to assure extra painful crisscrossing of the wounds.
