25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s {{and into the}} 1990s the {{predominant}} word <b>processing</b> <b>program</b> was WordPerfect. It had more than 50% of the worldwide market as late as 1995, but by 2000 Microsoft Word had up to 95% market share.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the popular}} Amstrad PCW range was introduced, which were principally word processors, {{complete}} with printer, running the LocoScript word <b>processing</b> <b>program.</b> They were also capable {{of running the}} CP/M operating system. The Amsoft division of Amstrad {{was set up to}} provide in-house software and consumables.|$|E
25|$|The IBM Selectric {{typewriter}} was {{a highly}} successful model line of electric typewriters introduced in 1961. Expensive Typewriter, written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch, was a text editing program that ran on a DEC PDP-1 computer at MIT. Since it could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a letter-quality printer), it may be considered the first word <b>processing</b> <b>program,</b> but the term word processing itself was only introduced, by IBM's Böblingen Laboratory in the late 1960s.|$|E

50|$|The first screenwriting {{software}} was SmartKey, a macro program that sent strings of commands to existing word <b>processing</b> <b>programs,</b> such as WordStar, WordPerfect and Microsoft Word. SmartKey was popular with screenwriters from 1982-1987, after which word <b>processing</b> <b>programs</b> {{had their own}} macro features.|$|R

25|$|Alphabetical, numeric, and {{punctuation}} {{keys are}} used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word <b>processing</b> <b>program,</b> text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed {{at the same time as}} some modifier keys.|$|E
25|$|Word for Windows is {{available}} stand-alone or {{as part of}} the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word <b>processing</b> <b>program</b> on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents via e-mail because almost every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see Microsoft Word Viewer). Word 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product, released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as Windows 95. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, releases of Word were named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.|$|E
25|$|Iraq was a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, placing its reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel <b>processing</b> <b>program</b> for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible for the Iraqis to take the necessary steps without being discovered.|$|E

Creed gives Andy romantic advice and says, [...] "This is how I got Squeaky Fromme", {{a reference to}} the Manson family member who tried to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford. A picture of President George W. Bush appears on a fake three-dollar bill Creed gives Jim to pay for the party. Creed suggests Kelly watch The Bonnie Hunt Show, a syndicated talk show hosted by actress Bonnie Hunt. Andy puts Splenda, an artificial sweetener, into Stanley's coffee because he has adult onset diabetes, a disorder characterized by high blood glucose. Andy sings Julia a song by Feist, the Canadian singer and songwriter, after he spots a Feist CD in her car. Michael takes a document file from Holly's computer that was created with Microsoft Word, the Microsoft word <b>processing</b> <b>program.</b> Pam said she hates the notion of even Al-Qaeda hating her, {{a reference to the}} Islamist terrorist organization that organized the September 11 attacks against New York City. Kelly confesses she went to juvenile detention in Berks County, Pennsylvania, at age 14 for doing something [...] "like Thelma & Louise, but with a boat", a reference to the 1991 road movie starring Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon on the run from their troubled, caged lives. Jim said during a birthday trip to a museum at age seven, his father bought him a plastic toy triceratops, a three-horned dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period, which Dwight insists is not a good dinosaur. Pam remembers the name of one audience member by comparing her to k.d. lang, the Canadian singer known for her extremely short hair.|$|E

2500|$|In theory, the Gaussian {{function}} at every {{point on the}} image will be non-zero, meaning that the entire image {{would need to be}} included in the calculations for each pixel. In practice, when computing a discrete approximation of the Gaussian function, pixels at a distance of more than 3σ are small enough to be considered effectively zero. Thus contributions from pixels outside that range can be ignored. Typically, an image <b>processing</b> <b>program</b> need only calculate a matrix with dimensions [...] × [...] (where [...] is the ceiling function) to ensure a result sufficiently close to that obtained by the entire Gaussian distribution.|$|E
2500|$|The mid-to-late 1980s saw {{the spread}} of laser printers, a [...] "typographic" [...] {{approach}} to word processing, and of true WYSIWYG bitmap displays with multiple fonts (pioneered by the Xerox Alto computer and Bravo word <b>processing</b> <b>program),</b> PostScript, and graphical user interfaces (another Xerox PARC innovation, with the Gypsy word processor which was commercialised in the Xerox Star product range). Standalone word processors adapted by getting smaller and replacing their CRTs with small character-oriented LCD displays. Some models also had computer-like features such as floppy disk drives {{and the ability to}} output to an external printer. They also got a name change, now being called [...] "electronic typewriters" [...] and typically occupying a lower end of the market, selling for under $200 USD.|$|E
