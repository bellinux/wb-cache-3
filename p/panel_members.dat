5|$|On 8 May, Carlsen {{played an}} {{exhibition}} game at Oslo City against the people of Norway, assisted by a grandmaster panel consisting of Simen Agdestein, Jon Ludvig Hammer, and Leif Erlend Johannessen. Each of the <b>panel</b> <b>members</b> proposed a move and the public could then vote over the proposed moves. Each panel member was allowed three chances to let chess engine Houdini propose a move during the game. Norway's moves were executed by Oddvar Brå who was disguised in a red spandex suit for the occasion. The game was drawn when Carlsen forced a perpetual check.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May, Stjepan Mesić, a Croat, was {{scheduled}} to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro, and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control, blocked the appointment, which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial. This maneuver technically left Yugoslavia without a head of state and without a commander-in-chief. Two days later, a repeated attempt to vote on the issue failed. Ante Marković, prime minister of Yugoslavia at the time, proposed appointing a panel which would wield presidential powers. It was not immediately clear who the <b>panel</b> <b>members</b> would be, apart from defense minister Veljko Kadijević, nor who would fill position of JNA commander-in-chief. The move was quickly rejected by Croatia as unconstitutional. The crisis was resolved after a six-week stalemate, and Mesić was elected president — the first non-communist to become Yugoslav head of state in decades.|$|E

25|$|Most of what {{is known}} about the actual {{proceedings}} of the meetings comes from notes kept by Durant which were later submitted as a memo to the NSC and commonly referred to as the Durant Report. In addition, various participants would later comment on what transpired from their perspective. Captain (later Major) Edward Ruppelt, then head of Project Blue Book, first revealed the existence of the secret panel in his 1956 book, but without revealing names of <b>panel</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E

In one of the indictments, ruling <b>panel</b> <b>members</b> Joseph DiNapoli and Matthew Madonna were charged with controlling a ring that extorted and bribed businesses and construction sites in Manhattan and the Bronx.

25|$|The biscuit {{reinforced}} {{butt joint}} {{is a fairly}} recent innovation in butt joint construction. It is used primarily in carcase and frame construction. The biscuit is an oval shaped piece of specially dried and compressed wood, usually beech, which is installed in matching mortises in both members of the joint {{in a similar fashion}} to a loose or floating tenon. Biscuit joints are common in both frame and carcase construction. They are particularly convenient for panel glue ups as they facilitate alignment of <b>panel</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced {{himself from}} {{the way in which}} the Consensus results have been {{interpreted}} in the wider debate. Thomas Schelling now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus <b>panel</b> <b>members</b> were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.|$|E

During this appearance, Raël upset <b>panel</b> <b>members</b> with his statements on democracy and cloning. The situation reached its peak when caricaturist Serge Chapleau called Raël a [...] "farce" [...] and a [...] "nerd", ridiculed his clothes, and {{grabbed him by the}} back of his neck. Raël left the stage, followed by his disciples. A fellow guest on the show, Parti Québécois Member of Quebec Legislative Assembly Pauline Marois, who would later become Premier of Quebec, called Raël [...] "insane". The Raëlian Movement asked Marois to apologize, which she refused.|$|E

500|$|The panel {{arranged}} for the witnesses at Seven Mile Beach to observe a series of flights by a de Havilland Dragonfly taking off from Cambridge aerodrome, and to identify which flight best represented what they saw {{on the night of}} the crash. [...] This exercise established that VH-AET reached a maximum height of about 425feet (130m). The <b>panel</b> <b>members</b> were satisfied that, after take-off, VH-AET achieved a normal climb of about 325feet per minute (1.6m/s) and a gradient of about 1¾% before suddenly commencing a descent of about 17½%. [...] Calculations showed that the aircraft's descent reached about 4,000 feet per minute (20m/s) and its speed about 160mph (257km/hour) before it struck the water.|$|E
500|$|In February 2004, the Union of Concerned Scientists {{published}} a report accusing the Bush administration of manipulating science for political purposes, listing more than 20 alleged incidents of censoring scientific results or applying {{a litmus test}} in the appointment of supposedly scientific advisory <b>panel</b> <b>members.</b> In April 2004, Marburger {{published a}} statement rebutting the report and exposing errors and incomplete explanations in it, and stating that [...] "even when the science is clear—and often it is not—it is but one input into the policy process," [...] but [...] "in this Administration, science strongly informs policy." [...] The Union of Concerned Scientists issued a revised version of their report after Marburger's statement was published. Marburger also called the report's conclusions illusory {{and the result of}} focusing on unrelated incidents within a vast government apparatus, and attributed the controversy as being related to the upcoming elections. It was noted that Marburger enjoyed close personal relationships with President Bush, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten, attesting to his active involvement within the administration.|$|E
