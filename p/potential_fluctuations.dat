40|$|Abstract — Well-known {{apparent}} electrical silicon bandgap narrowing in {{a heavily}} doped region of a bipolar transistor is observed {{by means of}} an enhanced minority-carrier injection experiment. In the region of interest, plasmons-induced <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are existent in nature and hence constitute the origin of apparent bandgap narrowing. In this letter, we extract the underlying <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations</b> directly from the enhanced minority-carrier injection experiment published in the literature. The core of the extraction lies in {{a combination of the two}} existing theoretical frameworks. First, the Gaussian distribution can serve as a good approximation of <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Second, no change can be made in the real bandgap between fluc-tuating conduction- and valence-band edges. Extracted <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations</b> come from plasmons, as verified by our published temperature dependences of plasmons limited mobility in the inversion layer of MOSFETs as well as theoretical calculation results on bulk silicon. More importantly, this letter can deliver potential applications in the modeling and simulation area of nanoscale FETs (MOSFETs, FinFETs, and so forth) and bulk semiconductors.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{luminescence}} properties of Mg-doped GaN grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra have been analyzed. Exciton, ultraviolet luminescence (UVL) and blue luminescence (BL) bands are the dominant PL bands in the spectra. At low temperature, Exciton and UVL bands show almost no shift with excitation intensity, whereas the BL band blueshifts by almost 0. 4 with increasing excitation intensity by seven orders of magnitude. Such shifting nature of bands with excitation intensity {{is explained by}} assuming that the BL band is detected from {{the region of the}} sample where <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are very large, but the UVL and exciton bands originate from the region of the sample where there are no <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> After the careful analysis of <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations</b> model and the donor-acceptor pair model, we conclude that the BL band in the studied GaN:Mg sample is not a separate band but the UVL band itself, which is significantly distorted by <b>potential</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Now, we call this band the BL* band.
