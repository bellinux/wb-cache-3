5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a world <b>power.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E

Three successive Byzantine recovery attempts failed over the next few years, and the island became a base for Muslim piratical activity in the Aegean, radically upsetting the balance of <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Despite some Byzantine successes over the Cretan corsairs, and the razing of Damietta by a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships in 853, Arab naval <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Levant was steadily reviving under Abbasid rule.
