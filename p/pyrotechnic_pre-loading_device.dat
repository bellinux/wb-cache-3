50|$|Asgardia {{intends to}} launch a series of {{satellites}} into orbit, and has announced that the first will be delivered to space by Orbital ATK in September 2017 {{as part of an}} International Space Station resupply mission. It will be a CubeSat measuring 10x10x20cm at a weight of 2.8kg, will be manufactured and deployed into orbit by NanoRacks, and has been named Asgardia-1. The nanosatellite will be a file storage <b>device</b> <b>pre-loaded</b> with things like family photos supplied by the first 1,500,000 members, with subsequent data being uploaded or downloaded using the Globalstar satellite network. That it is being boosted to space and then deployed by US companies on a NASA-funded mission means that the satellite will fall under US jurisdiction. Asgardia intends to partner with a non-signatory to the Outer Space Treaty (OST), perhaps an African state such as Ethiopia or Kenya, in the hopes of circumventing the OST's restriction on nation-states claiming territory in outer space. The satellite is expected to have a lifetime of 5 years before its orbit decays and it burns up on reentry.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{assessment}} {{of whether a}} forensic evidence item should be submitted for STR profiling is largely based on the personal experience of the Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) and the submissions policy of the law enforcement authority involved. While there are chemical tests that can infer the presence of DNA through the detection of biological stains, the process remains mostly subjective and leads to many samples being submitted that give no profile or not being submitted although DNA is present. The ParaDNA® Screening System was developed to address this issue. It consists of a sampling <b>device,</b> <b>pre-loaded</b> reaction plates and detection instrument. The test uses direct PCR with fluorescent HyBeacon™ detection of PCR amplicons to identify the presence and relative amount of DNA on an evidence item and also provides a gender identification result in approximately 75 minutes. This simple-to-use design allows objective data to be acquired by both DNA analyst and non-specialist personnel, to enable a more informed submission decision to be made. The developmental validation study described here tested the sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy, inhibitor tolerance, and performance of the ParaDNA Screening System {{on a range of}} mock evidence items. The data collected demonstrates that the ParaDNA Screening System identifies the presence of DNA on a variety of evidence items including blood, saliva and touch DNA items...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the main design parameters contributing to loosening of bolts due to vibration and to identify their relative importance and degree of contribution to bolt loosening. Vibration testing was conducted on a shaketable with a controlled-random input in the dynamic testing laboratory of the Structural Test Division of MSFC. Test specimens which contained one test bolt were vibrated for a fixed amount of time and percentage of pre-load loss was measured. Each specimen tested implemented some combination of eleven design parameters as dictated by the design of experiment methodology employed. The eleven design parameters were: bolt size (diameter), lubrication on bolt, hole tolerance, initial <b>pre-load,</b> nut locking <b>device,</b> grip length, thread pitch, lubrication between mating materials, class of fit, joint configuration and mass of configuration. These parameters were chosen for this experiment because they are believed to be the design parameters having the greatest impact on bolt loosening. Two values of each design parameter were used and each combination of parameters tested was subjected to two different directions of vibration and two different g-levels of vibration. One replication was made for each test to gain some indication of experimental error and repeatability and to give some degree of statistical credibility to the data, resulting in a total of 96 tests being performed. The results of the investigation indicated that nut locking devices, joint configuration, fastener size, and mass of configuration were significant in bolt loosening due to vibration. The results of this test can be utilized to further research the complex problem of bolt loosening due to vibration...|$|R

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} aims {{to answer some}} of the {{questions}} frequently asked by parents and schools. How common are severe food allergies among children? Every school is likely to have at least one pupil who is severely food-allergic, and many schools will have more. Peanut allergy is particularly common – with one in 70 children nationwide thought to be affected. (Grundy et. al, 2002). What are the symptoms of food allergy? For many children, the symptoms of food allergy are mild. In severe cases, symptoms may include generalised flushing of the skin, nettle rash (hives) anywhere on the body, swelling of the throat and mouth, severe asthma, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. In very severe cases there may be collapse and unconsciousness, although this is rare. Treating symptoms The treatment for a severe allergic reaction is an injection of adrenaline (also called epinephrine), delivered into the muscle {{in the side of the}} thigh. The adrenaline injectors prescribed in the UK at present are Emerade®, EpiPen ® and Jext®. These injectors are easy to use and designed for self-administration or administration by any suitably trained individual. If an injector has been prescribed, it should be available at all times – with no exceptions. The emergency services (ambulance) should still be called after use as symptoms may return after a short period and more than one injection of adrenaline may be required to control the reaction. Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis – what injectors are available? <b>Pre-loaded</b> adrenaline injection <b>devices</b> – Emerade®, EpiPen ® or Jext ® – are available on prescription for those thought to be at risk of a severe reaction.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a specially conceived procedure {{for the design}} of the damped cable system (DCS). The procedure is formulated according with a performance-based non-linear dynamic approach, and consists of a preliminary and a final verification phases. The former phase is carried out by referring first to a modal transformation, and then to a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) dynamic idealisation of the building protected by DCS. Both schemes derive from simplified assumptions on the structural characteristics and the cable geometry, {{as well as on the}} design hypothesis of preserving a first mode-dominated seismic response also in protected conditions. The cable geometry is traced out at this stage of the analysis with the aim of approaching – within the limits imposed by the architectural constraints and the actual structural configuration – a parabolic layout, or the “constant horizontal force” one. In fact, these represent the two most performing shapes highlighted by the extensive parametric analyses carried out by Udine University team within the context of Work-Package 1, as well as in the subsequent numerical investigations developed on selected case studies [1 - 3]. The solving equations of motion are explicitly formulated for the non-linear dynamic SDOF problem, which can nevertheless be modelled also by commercial calculus programs including non-linear viscous dashpot elements in their basic libraries, among which the widely used SAP 2000 NL code. The four-step preliminary phase is carried out by referring to the highest hazard level assumed in the performance-based approach, although additional checks can also be developed with regards to the remaining levels. The procedure is started by imposing a target reduction on the fundamental period of the unprotected structure, from which the preliminary values of cable-section area, and of first and second-branch Jarret device stiffness are determined (steps 1 and 2). The cable and <b>device</b> <b>pre-loads</b> are then evaluated by a separate criterion, where the limit top displacement of the building deemed compatible with the highest hazard level-related design objective is input (step 3). The preliminary choice of the damping coefficient of Jarret device is finally located by a parametric enquiry based on the proposed dynamic SDOF model (step 4) ...|$|R
