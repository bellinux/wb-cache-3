40|$|Evidence {{from the}} past three years {{indicates}} that the exchange rate between the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> and the official ECU Basket can deviate substantially from par. The value of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> is driven by expectations that a future European Central Bank will enforce par convertibility between the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> and the official ECU basket of currencies. Meanwhile, no existing institutional arrangement limits the private ECU’s value in terms of the Basket. This paper addresses the question of what determines the values of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> and of <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> interest rates. We show that an anticipation of a future fixing of the private ECU’s value, together with the interest rate setting mechanism of the large-value ECU payment and clearing system, are sufficient to determine its value. The determination of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> exchange rate provides the template for how to determine the value of any private composite currency, such as, for example, a private SDR. ...|$|E
40|$|Today's {{value of}} the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> is driven by {{expectations}} that a European monetary authority will at some future date declare itself willing to convert the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> into the official basket at par. Until then, its value is not limited by any existing institutional arrangements in the European Communities, such as the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System. We {{address the question of}} what determines the exchange rate between the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> and the official Basket, and what determines ECU interest rates. The Bank for International Settlements sets the ECU overnight interest rate on clearing balances as a weighted and lagged average of the money-market rates in the EC currencies, thereby fixing a point on the ECU term-structure. This exogenous fixing of the ECU interest rate and the expectation of a future fixing of the exchange rate satisfy the fundamental requirements for a obtaining a determinate real value of what is otherwise an undefined <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> unit of account. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of an “EMU premium” in German long rates is tested by examining the co-movement of German and other European yields, {{as well as the}} exchange rate of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU,</b> in reaction to EMU-related events. If German yields incorporate an “EMU premium” while other European currencies expect lower interest rates from EMU, then German and other European long yields should react in opposite directions to events affecting the probability of EMU. In fact, they typically react in the same direction. Similarly, events which lead to an appreciation of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> are associated with a decline in German yields. ...|$|E

40|$|The European Currency Unit (ECU) {{was officially}} {{introduced}} in March 1979 and {{has joined the}} ranks of innovative financial products that are rapidly appearing. The purpose of the paper is to explore the properties of the ECU and analyze those characteristics of the ECU, and products denominated in ECU, that offer value-added. Changes in communications and information technology, changes in the regulatory climate, and changes in the macroeconomic environment have generally encouraged recent financial innovations. We argue that the ECU has gained an edge on its component currencies because of its portfolio properties, its role in reducing transaction costs, the role of the European Monetary System, and trading factors peculiar to the <b>ECU.</b> <b>Private</b> participants should continue to gravitate toward the ECU as a useful vehicle to fulfill the services of money. ...|$|R
40|$|We present {{historical}} {{examples of}} {{new forms of}} money that can be com- pared with the ECU. We first define the ECU in its official role before turning to developments in the <b>private</b> market for <b>ECUs.</b> We then examine historical antecedents of three attributes of ECUs: a unit of account; a basket of currencies; a basis for monetary integration. We discuss which features if any of ECUs are unique, and {{the contribution of the}} historical analysis to assessing the future of ECUs. We then ask whether governments or markets have been dominant in the emergence of new forms of money. Whatever emerges as money in an economy becomes the general means of payment. Prices of commodities, services, and bonds are expressed in units of the money. Buyers use the money to purchase goods or bonds and sellers receive the money is exchange for goods or bonds. We conclude that, at this stage in its history, the ECU at best is an embryonic form of money, closer to historical imaginary monies than to existing currencies that the world has known. ...|$|R
40|$|Forward {{rates of}} European {{currencies}} against {{the private and}} official ECU exhibit a bias {{similar to the one}} found in other data: the Cumby-Obstfeld-Fama (COF) regression coefficients are systematically below unity, and two thirds of them are negative. We use the discount of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> relative to the official ECU as a measure of 'diffidence', a term that may cover both sharply fluctuating risk premia as well as Peso risk. Peso risk, in this context, covers not only fears of realignments but also the risk of a meltdown of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> relative to the official one (a notion that receives some support from a time-series analysis of these data). Dichotomizing the data {{on the basis of the}} size of the discount in the <b>private</b> <b>ECU),</b> we find that the COF beta strongly depends on the degree of diffidence and that the negative COF coefficients are generated by typically less than 20 percent of the data. If the diffidence factor contains a risk premium, then this risk premium is definitely not the one predicted by Bansal (1997). Nor is the diffidence factor proxying for Huisman et al. (1997) 's transaction-cost effects. Thus, Peso risk remains as a strong candidate explanation for the forward bias in this sample. Effects; Currency; Data; Risk; Time series;...|$|E
40|$|This short note {{shows that}} there exists a simple {{relation}} between the <b>private</b> <b>ECU,</b> its theoretical value and the associated interest rates. From this relation, one can estimate the time to EMU as expected by financial markets and see whether this time {{is consistent with a}} monetary union taking place on Januar...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} arbitrage pricing {{of bonds}} and {{the determination of}} interest rates in the European Currency Unit (ecu) in situations of impending ecu basket adjustments. These adjustments disrupt the markets for <b>private</b> <b>ecu</b> assets with a lead of several months. The approach of the paper {{is based on the}} observation that the ecu is a derivative asset, so that in the absence of transaction costs prices of ecu-denominated assets should be determined by the prices of the existing member currency assets and the member currencies' exchange rates. Using the technical apparatus of arbitrage pricing theory it is shown how the fundamental arbitrage pricing relationships implied by the derivative character of the ecu have to be adjusted in order to be applicable during periods of ecu basket adjustments.

40|$|Advantages often {{ascribed}} to the European currency unit (ECU) include: 1. The basket, as an invoicing vehicle, offers less exchange risk because of diversification. 2. The ECU {{has the advantage of}} being an 'open' basket. 3. ECU invoicing allows simplification of foreign exchange management and accounting systems. However, things cannot be that simple - otherwise, the ECU would have driven out other currencies to a much larger extent than is the case. The 'openness' of the ECU implies that the European Community authorities can unilaterally change the composition of investors' or borrowers' portfolios and affect the portfolio's value. The alleged simplification of foreign exchange management {{has nothing to do with}} the ECU - using only the US dollar could create a similar advantage. A general conclusion is that it is nearly impossible to test efficiency in the case of ECU short-term interest rates or bond yields. A related conclusion is that the true nature of the <b>private</b> <b>ECU</b> is somewhat of a mysterystatus: publishe...|$|E
