5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as <b>prickly</b> banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very <b>prickly</b> serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the <b>prickly</b> shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the <b>prickly</b> shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prickly</b> pear cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents {{were introduced}} to help control {{the spread of the}} plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of <b>prickly</b> pear had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As for fruit trees, mangos {{and oranges}} {{are the most}} populous. <b>Prickly</b> pears, flamboyants, and {{colourful}} bougainvilleas brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations {{have contributed to the}} deforestation of the island.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oligantha is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit. Its foliage is also not as <b>prickly</b> as that of B.cuneata.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} persist on canyon bottoms {{and rocky}} ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, <b>prickly</b> pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common. Utah penstemon and golden aster {{can also be}} found. Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.|$|E
5|$|G. juniperina subsp. trinervis (R.Br.) Makinson (formerly Grevillea trinervis) – is a <b>prickly</b> shrub with a {{spreading}} or prostrate habit {{ranging from}} 0.5 to 1.2, or rarely 2,m (20in–7ft) high and yellow, orange or red flowers. It {{is found in}} the western Blue Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnally active, the <b>prickly</b> shark rests {{during the}} day in deeper {{offshore}} waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks have a small home range and tend to remain within a given local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The <b>prickly</b> shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher is an omnivore. Its diet {{includes}} invertebrates such as beetles, moths, butterflies, arachnids, and snails. It also eats vegetable matter, {{and fruits}} from cacti, <b>prickly</b> pear, hackberries, and anacua, among other plants. The curve-billed {{has also been}} spotted eating dog food, and will feed it to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage is not as <b>prickly</b> as that of B.cuneata.|$|E
5|$|Grevillea juniperina, {{commonly}} known as juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea or <b>prickly</b> spider-flower, is a plant of the family Proteaceae native to eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland in Australia. Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the species in 1810, and seven subspecies are recognised. One subspecies, G. j. juniperina, is restricted to Western Sydney and environs and is threatened by loss of habitat and housing development.|$|E
5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as both have <b>prickly</b> foliage and domed flowerheads. However, the former grows on deep sand {{while the latter}} grows on grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of B. ilicifolia compared with the loose ones of B. sessilis are another distinguishing feature.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a <b>prickly,</b> {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not {{enthusiastic about}} being in LA and even less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but {{good sense of humor}} made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{recorded}} on North Island include Binoe's <b>prickly</b> gecko (Heteronotia binoei), the gecko Christinus marmoratus, the Jew lizard (Pogona barbata), King's skink (Egernia kingii), the western limestone ctenotus (Ctenotus australis), the western worm lerista (Lerista praepedita), the common dwarf skink (Menetia greyii), and the Abrolhos bearded dragon (Pogona minor minima). The carpet python was reported as {{present on the}} island in very low numbers before 1960, but {{it has never been}} observed there by naturalists, and is now absent.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{feeds on}} a variety of {{different}} produce, including blackberries, blueberries, peaches, pears, apples, <b>prickly</b> pears, chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and carrots. During the winter and early spring, the coyote eats large quantities of grass, such as green wheat blades. It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal droppings, beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and sorghum.|$|E
5|$|Tree {{species of}} hawkmoth have been {{recorded}} to emit ultrasound clicks by rubbing their genitalia; males produce by rubbing rigid scales on {{the exterior of the}} claspers while females produce sound by contracting their genitalia which causes rubbing of scales against the abdomen. The function of this noise-making is not clear and suggestions put forward include the jamming of bat echo-location, and, advertising that the bat's prey are <b>prickly</b> and excellent fliers.|$|E
5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} <b>prickly</b> pear cactus in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the <b>prickly</b> pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E
5|$|A small <b>prickly</b> leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Although B.cuneata {{was first}} {{collected}} before 1880, {{it was not}} until 1981 that Australian botanist Alex George formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This Banksia is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As Banksia cuneata is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency—fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. Banksia cuneata is rarely cultivated, and its <b>prickly</b> foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a <b>prickly</b> plant with little apparent horticultural potential, {{and none of the}} varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E
5|$|Between Sydney and Brisbane, B.integrifolia {{is found}} up to 200 {{kilometres}} (125mi) inland, with B.integrifolia subsp. monticola {{occurring in the}} Blue Mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres (5000ft). There it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from granites and basalts, and would experience up to 100 frosts per year. In this montane habitat, it occurs in association with Eucalyptus species such as E.viminalis (manna gum) and E.pauciflora (snow gum), and also rainforest species such as Nothofagus moorei (Antarctic beech) and Orites excelsa (<b>prickly</b> ash).|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's <b>prickly</b> relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its <b>prickly</b> foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its <b>prickly</b> foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the fictional}} {{archipelago}} of Earthsea, the story centers around a young mage named Ged, {{born in a}} village {{on the island of}} Gont. Displaying great power while still a boy, he joins the school of wizardry, where his <b>prickly</b> nature drives him into conflict with one of his fellows. During a magical duel, Ged's spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature that attacks him. The novel follows his journey as he seeks to be free of the creature.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, <b>prickly</b> pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prickly</b> shark {{is widely}} {{distributed}} around the Pacific Ocean. In {{the western and}} central Pacific, {{it has been reported}} off Japan, Taiwan, Victoria and Queensland in Australia, and New Zealand, as well as around the islands of Palau, New Caledonia, Tonga, Hawaii, and possibly the Gilberts. In the eastern Pacific, it is known to occur from Oregon to El Salvador (including the Gulf of California), around the Cocos and Galapagos Islands, and off Peru and Chile. This species generally seems to be uncommon; an exception is in Monterey Canyon off California, where sharks of both sexes are abundant throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{been implicated in}} the spread of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the <b>prickly</b> pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} for this species was {{collected from the}} Port Jackson area (Sydney district) and was described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810, who gave it the specific epithet juniperina which alludes to its juniper-like foliage. Likewise it {{is commonly known as}} juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea, as well as <b>prickly</b> spider-flower. The lectotype was selected by Don MacGillivray in 1993 from a collection by George Caley in 1803 11km (7mi) northwest of Prospect in what is now Sydney's outer western suburbs. Brown placed it in the series Lissostylis in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and <b>prickly</b> castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E
5|$|Tumbleweeds, {{which are}} the {{above-ground}} portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include Kali tragus (also known as Salsola tragus), or <b>prickly</b> Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and has gained {{a reputation as a}} noxious weed. Fungi of the genus Bovista are known to use the same strategy to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes is {{only known}} from the type {{locality}} {{in the province of}} Ciudad Real, Spain. Members of the Mycenaceae are saprotrophic, and X.setulipes was found in woodland made up of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), with undergrowth consisting of gum rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), <b>prickly</b> juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), and various heathers (Erica species). The mushrooms were growing in clusters on the forest floor from acid soil, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.|$|E
5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The <b>prickly</b> dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite <b>prickly.</b> He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was <b>prickly,</b> on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
