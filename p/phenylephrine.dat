5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or <b>phenylephrine.</b> Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{confusion}} about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names m-synephrine, Meta-synephrine and Neosynephrine, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally-occurring amine more commonly known as <b>phenylephrine.</b> Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and <b>phenylephrine,</b> they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion {{is compounded by the}} fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including Sympatol, Sympathol, Synthenate, and oxedrine, while <b>phenylephrine</b> has also been called m-Sympatol. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as p-synephrine in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, m-synephrine and o-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion over the distinctions between p- and m-synephrine has even contaminated the primary research literature.|$|E
25|$|As a result, many {{pharmacies}} {{no longer}} stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a <b>phenylephrine</b> product {{which has not}} been proven effective in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Its {{membership}} in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As {{a result of the}} increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, many pharmaceutical firms have reformulated, or {{are in the process of}} reformulating medications to use alternative, but less effective, decongestants, such as <b>phenylephrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Topical {{atropine}} {{is used as}} a cycloplegic, {{to temporarily}} paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting cholinergic antagonist) or <b>phenylephrine</b> (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination.|$|E
25|$|Another receptor-oriented {{study by}} Wikberg {{revealed}} that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) {{was a more}} potent agonist at guinea pig aorta α1 receptors (pD2 = 4.81) than at ileum α2 receptors (pD2 = 4.48), with a relative affinity ratio of α2/α1 = 0.10. Although clearly indicating a selectivity of synephrine for α1 receptors, its potency at this receptor sub-class is still relatively low, in comparison with that of <b>phenylephrine</b> (pD2 at α1 = 6.32).|$|E
25|$|Much {{reference}} {{has been}} made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with ephedrine, or with <b>phenylephrine,</b> often with the implication that the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to {{a very large number of}} other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and <b>phenylephrine,</b> any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. Tropicamide and <b>phenylephrine</b> are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. Atropine is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.|$|E

2500|$|In Australia, codeine {{preparations}} must be {{sold only}} at a pharmacy. Preparations will often {{be a combination of}} paracetamol (500mg), ibuprofen (200mg) and doxylamine succinate (5mg), and the codeine content may range from 5mg to 15mg; preparations with in excess of 15mg per tablet are S4 (Schedule 4, or [...] "Prescription Only") medications. The item is given over the counter, no prescriptions, at the discretion of the pharmacist. Most preparations are considered S3 (schedule 3, or [...] "Pharmacist Only") medications, meaning that they must be sold with the direct involvement of a pharmacist. It must be labelled and usage history monitored by the pharmacist to help deter misuse and dependence. The exception to this rule is cold and flu preparations such as [...] "Codral". These preparations contain <b>phenylephrine</b> (5mg), paracetamol (500mg) and codeine (9.5mg) or <b>phenylephrine</b> (5mg), paracetamol (500mg), chlorpheniramine (2mg) and codeine (9.5mg).|$|E
50|$|Oral <b>phenylephrine</b> is {{extensively}} metabolized by monoamine oxidase, {{an enzyme}} that is {{present on the}} outside of cells, throughout the body. Compared to intravenous pseudoephedrine, <b>phenylephrine</b> has a reduced and variable bioavailability; only up to 38%. <b>Phenylephrine</b> is a sympathomimetic drug, which means that it mimics the actions of epinephrine (commonly known as adrenaline) or norepinephrine. <b>Phenylephrine</b> selectively binds to alpha receptors which cause blood vessels to constrict. <b>Phenylephrine</b> may cause side effects such as headache, reflex bradycardia, excitability, restlessness and cardiac arrhythmias. <b>Phenylephrine</b> is not suggested for use in patients with hypertension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenylephrine</b> is a {{selective}} α1-adrenergic receptor agonist of the phenethylamine class used {{primarily as a}} decongestant, as an agent to dilate the pupil, and to increase blood pressure. <b>Phenylephrine</b> is marketed as an alternative for the decongestant pseudoephedrine, although clinical trials show <b>phenylephrine,</b> taken orally at the recommended dose, {{to be no more}} effective than placebo for allergy relief. <b>Phenylephrine</b> can also cause a decrease in heart rate through reflex bradycardia.|$|E
