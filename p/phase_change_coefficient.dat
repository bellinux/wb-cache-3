In the case of hygroscopic soils, the liquid water is strongly adsorbed on the solid phase and this particular thermodynamic state can highly influence the phase change kinetics. Based on the linear Thermodynamic of Irreversible Processes ideas, the non-equilibrium phase change rate is written as a linear function of the water chemical potential difference between the liquid and vapour state. In this relation, the system {{is characterized by a}} phenomenological coefficient which depends on the state variables. Using an original experimental set-up able to analyse the response of a porous medium subjected to non-equilibrium conditions, the <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> <b>coefficient</b> is determined in various configurations. This paper focuses on the influence of the gas phase pressure and underlines that a low gas pressure decreases the phase change kinetics. Then, evaporation and condensation processes are compared showing an asymmetric behaviour. These experimental results are interpreted from a microscopic point of view by relying on recent works dealing with molecular dynamics numerical simulation of the liquid/gas interface...|$|E

The device design was accomplished by analytic calculations on the base of a semi-empirical formulation and simulations with computational fluids dynamics. In the experimental optimization phase, a prototype of thermosyphon with a thermal resistance of 0. 110 K/W has been development, dissipating the heat of a Peltier pellet with the size of 40 × 40 mm, what is an improvement of 36 % in the thermal resistance, with regard to the commercial fin dissipater.

40|$|Lamb waves {{have been}} {{reported}} to be an efficient tool for non-destructive evaluations (NDE) for various application scenarios. However, accurate and reliable damage quantification using the Lamb wave method is still a practical challenge, due to the complex underlying mechanism of Lamb wave propagation and damage detection. This paper presents a Lamb wave damage quantification method using a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Three damage sensitive features, namely, normalized amplitude, <b>phase</b> <b>change,</b> and correlation <b>coefficient,</b> were proposed to describe changes of Lamb wave characteristics caused by damage. In view of commonly used data-driven methods, the GA-based LS-SVM model using the proposed three damage sensitive features was implemented to evaluate the crack size. The GA method was adopted to optimize the model parameters. The results of GA-based LS-SVM were validated using coupon test data and lap joint component test data with naturally developed fatigue cracks.

Application is made to the exothermic olivine-spinel (in Earth and Mars) and perovskite-post-perovskite (in Earth) phase transitions and the endothermic spinel-perovskite <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> (in Earth). The perturbation analysis provides a quantitative analytic criterion to predict whether a <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> near the lower boundary is stabilizing or destabilizing. When the exothermic <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> is stabilizing (destabilizing), the layer is most stable (unstable) when the <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> is in the middle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
