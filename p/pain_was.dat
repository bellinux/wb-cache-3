5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Pain {{supported}} Henry's nephew, King Stephen, and {{was with the}} new king throughout 1136. In July 1137, <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> ambushed by the Welsh and killed while leading a relief expedition to the garrison at Carmarthen. His heirs were his daughters, Cecily and Agnes. Cecily married the son of one of Pain's close associates, Miles of Gloucester. <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> generous in his gifts of land {{to a number of}} monastic houses.|$|E
5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll {{noted that}} <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the {{ordinary}} court, Pain also heard cases {{relating to the}} forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E
5|$|On Henry's {{death in}} December 1135, Pain {{attended}} the king's funeral. <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> an early supporter of King Stephen, {{although he was}} said initially to have been afraid to appear at Stephen's court {{for fear of being}} confronted by those he had oppressed. Nevertheless, <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> with the new king by early January 1136, when he witnessed one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at Reading. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king. Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136. The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.|$|E

5|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> {{too young}} to serve King William Rufus, but {{according}} to the later 12th-century writings of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlain—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a body servant. Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental. Other evidence against Map's claim that <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture: Acupuncture, the {{traditional}} Chinese medicinal practice of inserting needles into specific {{points of the}} body for therapeutic purposes and relieving <b>pain,</b> <b>was</b> first mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing compiled from the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC (Warring States period to Han Dynasty). The oldest known acupuncture sticks made of gold, found in the tomb of Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC), date to the Western Han (203 BC– 9 AD); the oldest known stone-carved depiction of acupuncture was made during the Eastern Han (25–220 AD); the oldest known bronze statue of an acupuncture mannequin dates to 1027 during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E
5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E
50|$|Intense knee <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> {{usually the}} {{presenting}} symptom that occurs during {{activities such as}} running, jumping, squatting, and especially ascending or descending stairs and during kneeling. The <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> worse with acute knee impact. The <b>pain</b> can <b>be</b> reproduced by extending the knee against resistance, stressing the quadriceps, or striking the knee. <b>Pain</b> <b>is</b> initially mild and intermittent. In the acute phase, the <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> severe and continuous in nature. Impact of the affected area can be very painful. Bilateral symptoms are observed in 20-30% of people.|$|R
50|$|Tension-type {{headache}} <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> {{often described}} as a constant pressure, as if the head were being squeezed in a vise.

50|$|Three {{types of}} {{nociceptive}} <b>pain</b> <b>are</b> experienced with chronic wounds; cyclic acute wound pain, non cyclic acute wound pain, and chronic wound pain. Cyclic acute wound <b>pain</b> may <b>be</b> experienced {{in conjunction with}} chronic wound pain and occurs during regular routines such as dressing changes or repositioning. Noncyclic acute wound <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> intermittent and usually occurs during procedures such as sharp debridement. Chronic wound <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> described as acute or chronic. Acute <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> nociceptive <b>pain</b> {{that serves as a}} warning to prevent mechanical, chemical, and thermal injuries. Acute <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> relieved when the damaging source <b>is</b> reduced. Chronic <b>pain</b> has physical and emotional components and is rarely an indication of ongoing damage.|$|R

5|$|In 1119 Pope Callixtus II {{addressed}} {{letters to}} a group of Anglo-Norman landholders in the Welsh Marches, including Pain, accusing them of having appropriated the lands of the Diocese of Llandaff and ordering their return. <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> among a group of nobles similarly accused by Pope Honorius II in 1128. Honorius once again ordered the nobles to restore to the Church lands they had confiscated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> born {{some time}} before 1100. His father {{may have been in}} the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king. The family lands in England, which were not extensive, were mainly in East Anglia, and Pain appears to have {{inherited}} most of them; his payment for danegeld, a tax, in 1130 for his East Anglian properties was 40shillings, compared to only 9 shillings for his brother Eustace.|$|E
25|$|Radiating <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> {{slightly}} different from referred pain; for example, the pain {{related to a}} myocardial infarction could either be referred or radiating pain from the chest. Referred <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> when the <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> located away from or adjacent to the organ involved; for instance, when a person has pain only in their jaw or left arm, {{but not in the}} chest. Referred <b>pain</b> has <b>been</b> described since the late 1880s. Despite an increasing amount of literature on the subject, the biological mechanism of referred <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> unknown, although there are several hypotheses.|$|R
50|$|Orofacial <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> {{a general}} term {{covering}} any <b>pain</b> which <b>is</b> {{felt in the}} mouth, jaws and the face. Orofacial <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> a common symptom, {{and there are many}} causes. It is estimated that over 95% of cases of orofacial pain result from dental causes (i.e. toothache caused by pulpitis or a dental abscess). After dental pain, the second most common cause of orofacial <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, pain-dysfunction syndrome).

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1137 <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> {{killed by}} a javelin {{blow to the head}} during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief {{expedition}} to the garrison at Carmarthen. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey, following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester. Pain's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen. Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his new wife, setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based.|$|E
5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> an early symptom in 18–49 percent of cases.

5|$|Pain is {{the presumed}} builder of Pain's Castle in the Welsh county of Radnor. He also {{controlled}} Caus Castle in Shropshire, and through his wife Ludlow Castle {{in the same}} county. Although he held the title to Weobley Castle, he {{does not appear to}} have exercised any control over it, which eventually went to Gilbert de Lacy. <b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to Jocelin de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester. Pain's share included property in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow, adding to the manors he held there through his wife; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 knights fees. By 1130 he had evidently acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire, where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>was</b> a son, {{probably}} the eldest, of John fitzRichard, a tenant-in-chief listed in Domesday Book. John {{may have had}} two wives, therefore the identity of Pain's mother is uncertain. On the basis of landholding, it has been speculated that Pain's mother was a daughter of Ralph Mortimer, who held Wigmore in Domesday Book. As well as being a moneyer, Pain's paternal grandfather, who came from near Avranches in Normandy, owned a mill. Pain's brother, Eustace fitzJohn, became a royal official who owned lands {{in the north of}} England. His other siblings included William, Alice and Agnes. William was {{probably the}} same William who later held Harptree in Somerset, and in 1130 was a royal justice in western England. Alice was the abbess of Barking Abbey and Agnes became the wife of Roger de Valognes.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1931–32, Arsenal {{reached the}} FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser {{came after a}} long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again {{in the second half}} to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> {{compounded by the fact that}} Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931–32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is reported {{of the variety}} of understandings available in British culture to understand acceptance of chronic <b>pain.</b> Q-factor analysis <b>is</b> used within a critical framework as Q-methodology. Thirty participants completed the procedure. Eight factors or accounts of accepting chronic <b>pain</b> <b>were</b> derived. These are reported as taking control, living day to day, acknowledging limitations, empowerment, accepting loss of self, more to life than pain, don't fight battles that cannot be won, and spiritual strength. Common features of accepting chronic <b>pain</b> <b>are</b> (1) the acknowledgement that a cure for <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> unlikely, (2) a shift of focus away from pain to non-pain aspects of life, and (3) a resistance to any suggestion that <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> a sign of personal weakness.

5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has forgotten about Charming. The <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
5|$|Nattrass failed a {{candidacy}} {{assessment in}} August 2013 and was duly deselected as UKIP {{candidate for the}} 2014 election, prompting him to initiate unsuccessful legal action against the party. He duly left UKIP and was in talks with the English Democrats, but cancelled plans to ally with them after they prematurely announced his joining the party. Nattrass, still a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), instead launched his own party after considering a career as an independent. An Independence Party's creation was announced in October 2013, being renamed An Independence from Europe on 7 March 2014 to avoid confusion with UKIP. Nattrass had previously considered the label 4 A Referendum. Electoral Commission records show that he had registered his own party significantly earlier, on 20 June 2012. From this date, he had also been filing financial statements for the fledgling, albeit inactive, organisation. The new party's development benefited from an incident in September 2013 when a Lincolnshire County Councillor, Chris <b>Pain,</b> <b>was</b> expelled from UKIP over an internal controversy. Fellow UKIP Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver supported Pain's innocence and were also expelled from the party for plotting to form a breakaway faction. All three became members of Nattrass' party and proceeded to represent their wards accordingly.|$|E
