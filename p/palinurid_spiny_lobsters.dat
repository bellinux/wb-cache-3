40|$|Understanding {{movements}} of <b>palinurid</b> (<b>spiny)</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{is important to}} fisheries management. However, movement data obtained with mark-capture techniques are often influenced by artefacts (e. g., displacement, tag-loss, tag-induced injury). To avoid these problems, a novel approach was employed to investigate the {{movements of}} an important coral reef palinurid, the painted lobster (Panulirus versicolor). Eighty adult individuals were captured by hand near Northwest Island, Australia. Each lobster was tagged internally (with elastomer) and externally (with plastic zip-ties) to enable both short- (1 – 10 days) and long-term (6 – 24 months) observations. Shortly thereafter, all lobsters were manually returned to their shelters (dens). After 6 – 24 months, 44 lobsters were recaptured, giving an overall recapture rate of 55 %. All of these individuals were recaptured within 500 m of their original den, thus indicating {{a high level of}} site-fidelity for this species. Short-term observations revealed that individuals moved frequently to and from nearby dens, and that male lobsters typically moved further than female lobsters. It is hypothesized that male lobsters move about their home range more actively, perhaps to seek mating opportunities or to defend resources. The significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the management of this important fishery resource...|$|E

40|$|Panulirus versicolor, {{otherwise}} known as the painted crayfish, is a <b>palinurid</b> (<b>spiny</b> <b>lobster)</b> that inhabits coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region, including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) where it forms an esteemed component of the local recreational spearfishery. At present, management strategies for P. versicolor are based solely on precautionary principles, since prior to this study virtually nothing was known about this species. The broad goal of this thesis was therefore to describe the population biology and fishery ecology of P. versicolor on the GBR, thereby providing a framework {{for the development of}} a comprehensive management scheme for this important fishery resource. To quantify the fishery for P. versicolor, teams of spearfishers conducted 135 hr of recreational fishing activities during 12 trips spread across 15 months and seven reefs. It was found that P. versicolor was the second most abundant component of the catch, after common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was estimated to be 0. 155 ± 0. 025 crayfish hr- 1, which is equivalent to one crayfish for each 6. 4 hr of spearfishing. Assuming this CPUE was representative of the recreational spearfishery as a whole, and given 37, 110 hr as the total annual spearfishing effort on the GBR (Henry and Lyle 2003), the total annual catch of P. versicolor was estimated to be 5, 773 ± 928 individuals (8, 660 ± 1, 530 kg). By world standards, this amount is relatively small. However, because this species is highly sought-after and is not abundant anywhere within its distributional range, fishing pressure on P. versicolor in readily accessible areas of the GBR may still be relatively high. Thus, a comprehensive management scheme should be implemented to ensure this species is not over-exploited. Development of a fishery management scheme requires knowledge of a range of population parameters (e. g. abundance, growth, mortality) which can be estimated by mark-recapture techniques. However, it was first necessary to develop a method of tracking individual crayfish in the wild, since most conventional tagging methods are ineffective due to moulting of the exoskeleton. As such, three unconventional tracking methods (ablation, elastomer implants, photographic identification) were evaluated in the field over periods of 6 – 36 months. Ablation proved to be ineffective due to a high incidence of infection and exoskeletal repair. In contrast, elastomer implants and photographic identification were shown to be highly effective (96. 5...|$|R

25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat.

It was recently discovered that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae.

40|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> feed on a {{wide range}} of natural marine food. They prey nocturnally upon a diverse {{assemblage}} of epifaunal and infaunal organisms including molluscs (such as snails and clams), smaller crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes and algae (Lipicius and Cobb, 1994). Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994). Tropical <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have several amenable characteristics which make them suitable for aquaculture. Tropical lobsters are adaptable to captive conditions, less cannibalistic and relatively fast growing than their counterparts in the sub-tropical and temperate regions (Anon., 1994). The greatest hurdle in growing <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is the difficulty in larval rearing and hence the culture of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> is still not commercially taken up in spite of significant advances made in recent years.

40|$|Abstract. A complex {{nervous system}} enables <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{to have a}} rich {{behavioural}} repertoire. The present paper discusses {{the ways in which}} the sensory systems of the Caribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus argus, particularly its chemosensory systems, are involved in feeding behaviour. It addresses the neural mechanisms of three aspects of their food-finding ability: detection, identification, and discrimination of natural food odours; the effect of learning on responses to food odours; the mechanisms by which <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> orient to odours from a distance under natural flow conditions. It demonstrates that the olfactory organ of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> might use acrossneuron response patterns in discriminating odour quality; that the hedonic value of food can be modified by experience, including associative and nonassociative conditioning; that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can readily orient to distant odour sources; and that both chemo- and mechanosensory antennular input are important in this behaviour. Either aesthetasc or nonaesthetasc chemosensory pathways can be used in identifying odour quality, mediating learned behaviours, and permitting orientation to the source of distant odours.
