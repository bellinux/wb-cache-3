40|$|A {{reaction}} control system nozzle block is provided for testing the response characteristics of space vehicles {{to a variety}} of {{reaction control}} thruster configurations. A pressurized air system is connected with the supply lines which lead to the individual jet nozzles. Each supply line terminates in a compact cylindrical plenum volume, axially perpendicular and adjacent to the throat of the jet nozzle. The volume of the cylindrical plenum is sized to provide uniform thrust characteristics from each jet nozzle irrespective of the angle of approach of the supply line to the plenum. Each supply line may be <b>plugged</b> <b>or</b> <b>capped</b> to stop the air supply to selected jet nozzles, thereby enabling a variety of nozzle configurations to be obtained from a single model nozzle block...|$|R

The unconnected corner is generally deployed as {{the high point of}} the Hover Station and it allows a diver to escape upwards if unable to pass through the 'hoop'.|$|R
