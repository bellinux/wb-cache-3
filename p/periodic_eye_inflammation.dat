40|$|In {{addition}} to the typical infantile spasm symptoms, several other symptoms, such as eye movements, {{have been reported to}} be associated with infantile spasms, although the relationship between the typical spasms and these other events is not fully understood. Here we present a case with West syndrome. We observed the appearance of <b>periodic</b> <b>eye</b> movements followed by the onset of typical spasms and the appearance/disappearance of <b>periodic</b> <b>eye</b> movements during withdrawal/increases of vigabatrin. We believe that the case strongly supports the notion that <b>periodic</b> <b>eye</b> movements and typical spasms represent a spectrum of symptoms related to the same phenomenon of West syndrome...|$|R
