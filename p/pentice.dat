50|$|The keep {{comprises}} {{a central}} circular tower, 62 ft in diameter, with six, large solid buttresses projecting outwards {{to form an}} hexagonal design, unique in England. It was made from magnesian limestone and 28 m tall with walls up to 15 ft thick in places. It has four floors: a ground floor {{that serves as a}} basement and a vaulted stone support for the chamber above; the first floor, through which the keep was accessed; two upper floors and a roof walk, which was probably covered by a <b>pentice</b> and defended by battlements.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{features a}} broad gable roof, which, in early Dutch barns extended very {{low to the}} ground. The barns feature center doors for wagons on the narrow end. A pent roof, or a <b>pentice,</b> over the doors offered some protection from inclement weather. The siding was usually horizontal and had few details. Dutch barns often lacked windows and had no openings other than the doors and holes for purple martins to enter. The design of the Dutch barn allows it to have a massive presence, giving it an appearance larger by comparison to other barns.|$|E
50|$|On {{the stone}} foundation, four huge ground beams (grunnstokker) are placed like a # sign, their ends {{protruding}} 1-2 {{meters from the}} lap joint where they intersect. The ends of these beams support the sills of the outer walls, forming a separate horizontal frame. The tall internal posts are placed on the internal frame of ground beams, and carry the main roof above the central nave (skip). On the outer frame of sills rest the main wall planks (veggtiler), carrying the roof over the <b>pentice</b> or aisles (omgang) surrounding the central space. The roof thus slopes down in two steps, as in a basilica.|$|E
50|$|The 16th-century prior's lodging {{which was}} {{converted}} into a two storey farmhouse had major alterations and extensions in 1701. Inside the building are massive beams. The <b>pentice</b> was added in the 19th century. The 15th-century barn, which is approximately 50 m north west of the church has seven bays supported by buttresses with diagonal buttresses at the corners. It has a collar beam roof. It has a well at the eastern end. The old infirmary {{was built in the}} 15th century and has an arch braced collar beam roof. The south wall shows the site where a stair turret was included, which would have linked the ground floor infirmary chapel with the infirmarer's quarters, which have both been demolished.|$|E
50|$|St Mary's Farmhouse in Durrington had two {{attendant}} barns, {{which were}} listed {{separately from the}} house (along with its front garden wall) to reflect their architectural value as a group. After the farmhouse was damaged by arsonists in 1978, it was saved from threatened demolition, but the barns were knocked down. One lay diagonally across {{the southwest corner of}} the farmhouse grounds; it was built mainly of flint and had a hipped roof of thatch. The other, of similar materials but with a partly gabled roof with a weatherboarded exterior, stood south of the house. An adjacent outbuilding, with a <b>pentice</b> roof, was included in its listing. Despite their demolition, they have not been officially delisted.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research study carried out to investigate the performance of the <b>pentice</b> structure at an underground mine in NSW during the extension and equipping of a haulage shaft by Macmahon under high-speed impact loading caused by the potential projectiles falling from the surface. This assessment will allow the structure to comply with AS 3785. 5 for “Headframes” (Australian Standard, 1998). The <b>pentice</b> structure is installed 1000 m below the surface in a 4. 268 m diameter shaft at the considered underground mine. The objective of the <b>pentice</b> is to allow Macmahon construction and shaft sinking crews to work in the shaft without any risk to their safety. The <b>pentice</b> structure includes a number of steel boxes 1 -m high that are filled with high yielding foaming grout Tekseal from Minova Australia Pty Ltd. The major aim of this investigation is to evaluate the capacity of the existing <b>pentice</b> to resist high-velocity impacts and to develop a high-performance protective system which is capable of absorbing energy and terminating large projectiles falling from a height of 1000 m. High-fidelity physics based finite element models for the mine <b>pentice</b> were developed to find a satisfactory solution to protect workers 1000 m below the surface from potential falling projectiles. It is established that the existing level 11 <b>pentice</b> structure is not capable of stopping the projectiles dropping from a height of 1000 m. Several high-performance protective solutions for strengthening the <b>pentice</b> against impact loads were proposed and evaluated numerically. As the final design, two-level protection is designed that includes the 9 level and 11 level <b>pentice</b> protective structures. The models of the 9 level <b>pentice</b> and the 11 level <b>pentice</b> are evaluated for the relevant impact loads. It is found that the new 9 level <b>pentice</b> requires an additional layer of the railway concrete sleepers along with the high-strength steel cover plate to provide adequate protection and terminate the falling projectiles. The supporting frames for the 9 level and 11 level <b>pentice</b> structures are designed using the dynamic reaction forces transferred from the <b>pentice</b> boxes. The developed two-level <b>pentice</b> protective system has proven to provide high level of protection against high-speed falling projectiles for workers performing shaft sinking duties in the shaft below...|$|E
