50|$|A paint mask is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> paint mists or vapors. A paint mask is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a dust mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as some masks may <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dust particles, but not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> chemical vapors.|$|R
50|$|Some barrier {{contraceptives}} <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> STIs. Hormonal contraceptives {{reduce the}} risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious complication of certain STIs. IUDs, by contrast, do not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> STIs or PID.|$|R
5|$|Some {{antioxidant}} supplements may promote {{disease and}} increase mortality in humans under certain conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may be prevented by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Amendment <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain.

5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it {{does not appear}} on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
50|$|A {{dust mask}} is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A dust mask can also be worn to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> allergens. A dust mask is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust masks with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even masks that do not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dust at all, such as paint masks and surgical masks. Misfitting masks are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the mask entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> splattering liquids or mists. Dust masks are manufactured to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> only certain dangers, and do not <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> chemicals such as vapors and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust masks with paint masks.|$|R

5|$|This {{development}} greatly facilitated {{vaccine research}} and ultimately {{allowed for the}} development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Other important advances that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> paralytic polio.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E

5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
25|$|Plantar warts are not {{prevented}} by inoculation with currently available HPV vaccines because the warts {{are caused by}} different strains of HPV. Gardasil <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> strains 6, 11, 16, and 18, and Cervarix <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> 16 and 18, whereas plantar warts are caused by strains 1, 2, 4, and 63.|$|E

Histopathological analysis demonstrated that immunization also <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> the progressive lesions resulting from {{invasion of the}} pulmonary mucosa by S. sonnei. These data show that mucosal proteosome-lipopolysaccharide vaccines can <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> lethal bacterial pneumonia and indicate that such vaccines are promising candidates for protection against intestinal shigellosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{three species}} of the genus Bordetella—B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica—have many antigens in common. Studies on {{representative}} strains of these species have shown {{that there are only}} a few specific antigens in each species. Whole-cell vaccines and extracts from B. pertussis contained specific mouse-protective antigen and a histamine-sensitizing factor. In addition, whole-cell vaccines and some saline extracts <b>protected</b> mice <b>against</b> intracranial challenge with B. bronchiseptica. Cells and a saline extract of B. parapertussis also <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica but not against B. pertussis. Whole cells of B. bronchiseptica <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica, but only one of three saline extracts <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> this challenge. Neither whole cells nor saline extracts from B. bronchiseptica <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. pertussis. The antigen in B. pertussis responsible for cross-protection against B. bronchiseptica was less resistant to heat than the protective antigen in B. bronchiseptica. Since histamine-sensitizing factor was not detected in B. bronchiseptica or B. parapertussis cells or extracts, this factor is not required to <b>protect</b> mice <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica challenge. Whether B. pertussis vaccines <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica by a nonspecific mechanism was not established, but it is clear that the specific antigen responsible for protection against B. pertussis was found only in B. pertussis and not in B. bronchiseptica or B. parapertussis...|$|R
