5|$|The first <b>product</b> <b>release</b> of the MX {{series was}} the MX960, a 14-slot, 480 Gbit/s switch and router. In late 2006, Juniper {{introduced}} the MX240 and MX480, which are smaller {{versions of the}} 960. They had a throughput of 240 Gbit/s and 480 Gbit/s respectively.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and <b>product</b> <b>release</b> steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E

25|$|Many multiunit CANDU {{stations}} utilize a {{water spray}} equipped vacuum building. All individual Candu units on site {{are connected to}} this Vacuum building by a large pressure relief duct which {{is also part of}} containment. The Vacuum building rapidly draws in and condenses any steam from a postulated break, allowing the reactor building pressure to return to subatmospheric conditions. This minimizes any possible fission <b>product</b> <b>release</b> to the environment.|$|E
25|$|GTP {{inhibits}} enzyme turnover over a {{wide range}} of conditions by increasing the affinity of GLUD1 for the reaction product, making <b>product</b> <b>release</b> rate limiting under all conditions in the presence of GTP. GTP acts by keeping the catalytic cleft in a closed conformation thus stabilizing the abortive complexes. GTP effects on GLUD1 are not localized solely to the subunit to which it is binding and that the antenna {{plays an important role in}} communicating this inhibition to other subunits.|$|E
500|$|In March 2012, Microsoft {{canceled}} Obsidian's upcoming Xbox One project codenamed [...] "North Carolina" [...] {{after seven}} months of development, resulting in the layoff of between 20 and 30 employees, including members of the Stick of Truth team. In May 2012, the game's final title was announced. In December 2012, THQ filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy after suffering several <b>product</b> <b>release</b> failures. The Stick of Truth remained on schedule as THQ tried to use the bankruptcy period to restructure and return its business to profit, but the company failed to find a buyer and a Delaware court ordered that THQ was worth more if its assets were sold individually.|$|E

500|$|Researchers {{demonstrated}} {{within hours}} of the <b>product</b> <b>release</b> that the third-generation iPad can be [...] "jailbroken" [...] to use applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple. The third-generation iPad can be jailbroken with Redsn0w 0.9.12 or Absinthe 2.0. Jailbreaking violates the factory warranty. One of the main reasons for jailbreaking is to expand the feature set limited by Apple and its App Store. Most jailbreaking tools automatically install Cydia, a native iOS APT client used for finding and installing software for jailbroken iOS devices. Many apps unapproved by Apple are extensions and customizations for iOS and other apps. Users install these programs to personalize and customize the interface, adding desired features and fixing annoyances, and simplify app development by providing access to the filesystem and command-line tools.|$|E

2500|$|ADP {{being one}} of the two major {{activators}} (NAD+ being the other one), acts by destabilizing the abortive complexes, and abrogating the negative cooperativity. In the absence of substrates, and with bound ADP, the catalytic cleft is in the open conformation, and the GLUD1 hexamers form long polymers in the crystal cell with more interactions than found in the abortive complex crystals (...) [...] This is consistent with the fact that ADP promotes aggregation in solution. When the catalytic cleft opens, R516 is rotated down on to the phosphates of ADP. The opening of the catalytic cleft is roughly correlated with distance between R516 and phosphates of ADP. In this way, ADP activates GLUD1 by facilitating the opening of the catalytic cleft which decreases product affinity and facilitates <b>product</b> <b>release.</b> thus allowing GLUD1 to reconcile the non-catalytic abortive complexes.|$|E
