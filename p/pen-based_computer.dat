This paper describes a method for automatically constructing hinted TrueType fonts from on-line handwriting data.

We use an aggressive matching strategy to find correspondences between an input glyph and a previously-hinted template, considering both global and local features to allow hinting even when they differ in shape and topology. Recognizing that stroke width statistics are among features that characterize a person’s handwriting, we recalculate global values in the control value table (CVT) before transfer to preserve the characteristics of the original handwriting...|$|R

This conceptual model is used to organize and analyse the broad range of literature related to pen-based interfaces, and to identify topics that are not sufficiently addressed by published research. Two issues highlighted by the model: digital ink legibility and digital ink structuring, are then investigated. In the first investigation, methods are devised to objectively and subjectively measure the legibility of handwritten script. These methods are then piloted in experiments that vary the horizontal rendering resolution of handwritten script displayed on a computer screen. Script legibility is shown to decrease with rendering resolution, after it drops below a threshold value. In the second investigation, the clustering of digital ink strokes into words is addressed. A method of rating the accuracy of clustering algorithms is proposed: the percentage of words spoiled. The clustering error rate is found to vary among different writers, for a clustering algorithm using the geometric features of both ink strokes, and the gaps between them. The work contributes a conceptual interface model, methods of measuring digital ink legibility, and techniques for investigating stroke clustering features, to the field of digital ink interaction research...|$|E
