40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of <b>pre-aeration</b> on sludge {{solubilization}} and the behaviors of nitrogen, dissolved sul-fide, sulfate, and siloxane. The results of this study showed that soluble chemical oxygen demand in sewage sludge could be increased through <b>pre-aeration.</b> The <b>pre-aeration</b> process resulted in a higher methane yield compared to the anaerobic condition (blank). The <b>pre-aeration</b> of sewage sludge, therefore, was shown to be an effective method for enhancing the digestibility of the sewage sludge. In addition, this result confirms that the <b>pre-aeration</b> of sewage sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion accelerates the growth of methano-genic bacteria. Removal rates for NH 3 -N and T-N increased simultaneously during <b>pre-aeration,</b> indicating simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. The siloxane concentration in sewage sludge decreased by 40 % after 96 hr of <b>pre-aeration</b> ; in contrast, the sulfide concentration in sewage sludge did not change. Therefore, <b>pre-aeration</b> can be employed as an efficient treatment option to achieve higher methane yield and lower siloxane concentration in sewage sludge. In addition, reduction of nitrogen loading by <b>pre-aeration</b> can reduce operating costs to achieve better effluent water quality in wastewater treatment plant and benefit the anaerobic process by minimizing the toxic effect of ammonia...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a short <b>pre-aeration</b> {{step was}} {{investigated}} as pre-treatment for thermophilic anaerobic digestion {{of the organic}} fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). It was found that <b>pre-aeration</b> of 48 h generated enough biological heat to increase the temperature of bulk OFMSW to 60 °C. This was sufficient self-heating of the bulk OFMSW for the start-up of thermophilic anaerobic digestion {{without the need for}} an external heat source. <b>Pre-aeration</b> also reduced excess easily degradable organic compounds in OFMSW, which were the common cause of acidification during the start-up of the batch system. Careful consideration however must be taken to avoid over aeration as this consumes substrate, which would otherwise be available to methanogens to produce biogas. To accelerate methane production and volatile solids destruction, the anaerobic digestion in this study was operated as a wet process with the anaerobic liquid recycled through the OFMSW. Appropriate anaerobic liquid inoculum was found to be particularly beneficial. It provided high buffer capacity as well as suitable microbial inoculum. As a result, acidification during start-up was kept to a minimum. With volatile fatty acids (VFAs-acetate in particular) and H 2 accumulation typical of hydrolysis and fermentation of the easily degradable substrates during start-up, inoculum with high numbers of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was critical to not only maximise CH 4 production but also reduce H 2 partial pressure in the system to allow VFAs degradation. In a lab-scale bioreactor, the combined <b>pre-aeration</b> and wet thermophilic anaerobic digestion was able to stabilise the OFMSW within a period of only 12 days.

40|$|An {{important}} {{advantage of}} using a short-term <b>pre-aeration</b> of municipal solid waste (MSW) with high organic fractions prior to landfilling is that it intensively decomposes a part of organic matter, especially easily biodegradable fractions in waste, and thus regulates the subsequent anaerobic degradation of MSW under landfill conditions, meanwhile conserving the bio-methane potential as much as possible. However, this organic matter degraded during the <b>pre-aeration</b> process is converted by aerobic microorganisms into high concentrations of organic leachate and exhausted gases (e. g. NH 3 and volatile organic compounds), which are also potential pollution sources to the surrounding environment. In this study, the emission characteristics of leachate and odorous gases generated during a short-term <b>pre-aeration</b> process of MSW are investigated in a laboratory reactor. It is found that MSW, pre-treated aerobically for 7 days, results in ~ 28. 1 % of weight loss and ~ 30. 3 % of capacity loss, respectively. Due to the initial hydrolysis, acidification and leaching of organic solids, TOC concentrations in leachate generated during the <b>pre-aeration</b> process increase rapidly at the beginning, and then are maintained at relatively stable levels, averaging from 16, 700 to 26, 000 mg/L. A certain amount of VFAs, mainly butyric acid (50 - 75 %) and acetic acid (20 - 50 %), is detected in leachate, with the concentration range of 1, 000 - 18, 000 mg/L, which can increase the odorous risk from leachate storage and treatment operation. NH 3 emission in the exhaust gases is highly consistent with the degradation of proteins and temperature evolution, with the maximum release capacity of ~ 37. 6 mg/(kg DM. h) occurring at day 4. Compared to the initial untreated waste, the release strength of halocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons from the pre-aerated waste is obviously decreased, whereas higher concentrations of organosulfurs, such as ethanethiol and dimethyl disulfide, and alkanes are observed (~ 10 times higher). This finding suggests that more attention should be paid to control the odorous charge during the subsequent storage, transportation and landfilling operation of the pre-aerated waste...|$|E

Usually, so-called flip buckets or ski jumps are provided to generate jets, yet they are rarely issued by deflectors. The application of a theoretical mass point parabola is limited to predict the jet features, because effects related to the take-off angle and the disintegration process affect the jet air transport and trajectories. This research discusses the effect of <b>pre-aeration</b> of the approach chute flow on the jet features. A comparison with a former study indicates that mainly the upper jet portion is affected, that the black water jet core becomes shorter, and that the air transport increases.

40|$|Landfilling {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the main methods used in managing Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Although in many countries national legislation aims to reduce this practice as much as possible, landfill is a necessary and unavoidable step in closing the material cycle. The need for innovative waste management techniques to improve landfill management and minimize the adverse environmental impact produced has resulted in an increasing interest in innovative systems capable of accelerating waste stabilization. Landfill bioreactors allow decomposition kinetics to be increased and post-operational phase to be shortened; in particular, hybrid bioreactors combine the benefits afforded by both aerobic and anaerobic processes. Six bioreactor simulators were used in the present study: four managed as hybrid, with an initial semi-aerobic phase and a second anaerobic phase, and two as anaerobic control bioreactors. The main goal of the first aerated phase is to reduce Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) in order to increase pH and enhance methane production during the anaerobic phase; for this reason, air injection was stopped only when these parameters reached the optimum range for methanogenic bacteria. Biogas and leachate were constantly monitored throughout the entire methanogenic phase with the aim of calibrating a Gompertz Model and evaluating the effects of <b>pre-aeration</b> on subsequent methane production. The results showed that moderate and intermittent <b>pre-aeration</b> produces a positive effect both on methane potential and in the kinetics of reaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the microbial oxygen utilization in a full-scale proprietary high rate activated sludge system. Emphasis is placed on determining the relationship between the ultimate B. O. D satisfied by the system and the oxygen utilization. A second objective is to study the effects of the dissolved oxygen concentration and the B. O. D. loading rate on the oxygen utilization rate. This study was performed at the municipal sewage treatment plant for the City of Lincoln, Nebraska. The municipal sewage treatment plant is located at the northern edge of Lincoln. The plant is designed for primary and secondary treatment. The effluent is discharged into the Salt Creek. Salt Creek is a perennial stream that flows into the Platte River. The raw sewage entering the treatment plant passes through a bar screen before entering the wet well. The sewage is pumped from the wet well to a distribution box. A venturi tube placed in the pipe between the wet well and distribution box measures the influent flow. From the distribution box the sewage flows into aerated grit chambers which remove grit and provide <b>pre-aeration.</b> Following <b>pre-aeration,</b> the sewage flows to primary sedimentation tanks and then into the secondary treatment systems. Sludge disposal is by anaerobic digestion and vacuum filtration. Performance tests consist of dissolved oxygen measurements and determinations of the oxygen utilization rate at design loadings. The tests are conducted between 12 : 00 noon and 5 : 00 p. m. on three consecutive days between Monday and Friday. At the time of the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration for each day, a sample of mixed liquor is tested to determine the oxygen utilization rate in the aeration tank. The mixed liquor suspended solids concentration should be between 4000 and 5000 milligrams per liter. Based on the author’s interpretation of the performance requirements, the data indicates that the activated sludge system tested does not meet the manufacturers specifications. Advisor: Mark J.

A first experimental study published at the 33 rd IAHR Congress, Vancouver, investigated deflectorgenerated jets {{in terms of their}} air concentration characteristics. For jet impact onto a movable bed, the scour potential reduces as the jet air content increases. It was demonstrated that the jet air concentration development is a function of its relative black-water core length, depending on the approach flow parameters and the deflector geometry. Jet-generating structures are located at the end of spillways, where high-speed flow with considerable air transport prevails, affecting the jet parameters, such that additional experiments were conducted involving pre-aerated approach flow.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a cost-effective modified primary treatment method which can significantly increase the removal of both finely-divided and soluble organic matter without resorting to the use of any chemical coagulants or secondary treatment method. It involves the recycling of {{a small portion of the}} settled primary sludge and then mixing it, after brief aeration, with raw sewage for a short period to induce biosorption and flocculation/enmeshment of various types of pollutants, thereby settling them together with the recycled sludge particles. During operation, the raw sewage is NOT subjected to any aeration; only a small aeration tank for sludge <b>pre-aeration</b> and a flocculation tank for sludge-sewage mixing are added; thus, the energy for the improved treatment method will not be too much higher than the conventional primary treatment method. Yet, the removal of both COD and SS can be improved significantly as compared to the conventional method. The increased removal is mainly attributed to the effective biosorption/flocculation and settling of colloidal particles and this suggestion has been substantiated by the data of particle analysis...|$|E

The air-water flow and turbulence properties were measured with an intrusive phase-detection probe and a total pressure sensor simultaneously. The inflow <b>pre-aeration</b> and turbulence level of the falling jet were carefully characterised, and the effects of jet impact velocity and jet length on air entrainment in plunging pool were investigated.

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Environmental Resource Engineering, 2014 Supplemental {{aeration}} may be {{a viable}} treatment strategy for ammonia removal in the treatment wetlands at the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility (AWTF). Aeration may ameliorate adverse effects of seasonal low temperatures and high loading rates on ammonia removal by facilitating nitrification. This work compares ammonia removal for three pilot-scale treatment wetland porosity configurations to determine if submerged surface area limits nitrification during aeration treatment and cold climate conditions. A 144 cubic foot hydraulic flume with an aspect ratio of 14 : 1 (length:width), and planted with mature emergent macrophytes was used for study. The pilot-scale treatment wetland was fed secondary treated wastewater from the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility. The lowest porosity configuration (porosity: 0. 60) demonstrated the highest ammonia removal performance. Higher porosity configurations (porosity: 0. 75 and 0. 86) demonstrated lower ammonia removal and nitrite production, suggesting aeration assisted nitrification may be limited by submerged surface area. Baseline (<b>pre-aeration)</b> ammonia removal for the pilot and full-scale treatment wetlands was compared to evaluate scale-up potential of the pilot-scale aeration system. A lack of similitude between pilot and fullscale baseline treatment performance suggests that differences in internal carbon and nitrogen loading may constrain direct use of pilot-scale system results for full-scale aeration system design...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Phosphorus–based land {{application}} of swine manure slurry results in under–application of nitrogen (N), while nitrogen–based application leads to over–application of phosphorus (P). Significant amounts of P {{must be removed}} from swine manure to reduce P over–application, {{and at the same}} time, safely apply targeted amounts of N. This study compared three schemes of soluble orthophosphate (ortho–P) reduction from liquid swine nursery manure during batch aeration: (1) solids–liquid separation before aeration (<b>pre–aeration</b> solids–liquid, or PASL, separation), (2) solids–liquid separation in the middle of aeration (mid–aeration solids–liquid, or MASL, separation) and (3) no solids–liquid separation (control). Significantly more ortho–P was converted to non–soluble species with MASL separation (92 %) than with either PASL separation (87 %) or the control (84 %). MASL separation also significantly improved the removal of total phosphorus (TP) in the sludge from the liquid after an overnight sedimentation process: 80 %, 70 %, and 66 % for MASL separation, PASL separation, and control, respectively. Solids–liquid separation enhanced the maintenance of higher oxidation potentials (depicted by higher values of ORP in the separated manures than in the control) in the manure during the latter days of aeration, implying that substantial energy saving is possible for prolonged aeration of separated liquid manure. This is an important element in the post–aeration treatment for ensuring that P removed from the solution stays in the sludge and is not released back into solution, if removal of the sludge does not immediately follow scheduled aeration treatment...|$|E

This paper deals with the {{reduction of}} polyphenols content in untreated OMW by means of a white-rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus. Dephenolization was performed both in an airlift bioreactor and in aerated flasks. The process was carried out under controlled non-sterile conditions, with different operating configurations (batch, continuous, biomass recycle) representative of potential industrial operations. Total organic carbon, polyphenols concentration, phenol oxidase activity, dissolved oxygen concentration, oxygen consumption rate and pH were measured during every run. Tests were carried out with or without added nutrients (potato starch and potato dextrose) and laccases inducers (i. e., CuSO 4). OMW endogenous microorganisms were competing with P. ostreatus for oxygen during simultaneous fermentation. Dephenolization of raw OMW by P. ostreatus under single batch was as large as 70 %. Dephenolization was still extensive even when biomass was recycled up to six times. OMW <b>pre-aeration</b> had to be provided under continuous operation to avoid oxygen consumption by endogenous microorganisms that might spoil the process.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{has shown that}} the chemical effects of grinding media on the flotation of real ores, especially those containing pyrite, are still not understood adequately. Many studies have been conducted on isolated minerals or in solutions only, and transport phenomena in the froth phase have generally been ignored in studies on galvanic interactions. A complex ore containing galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and significant quantities of magnetite, pyrrhotite and pyrite was used in batch flotation tests to study this problem. Metallic iron powder was added in different quantities to a ceramic ball mill in order to simulate the use of mild steel grinding media in flotation tests aimed at selectively floating chalcopyrite. An oxygen-saturated pulp milled in the presence of iron yielded the best recovery of chalcopyrite and copper-lead selectivity. Milling under a nitrogen atmosphere in the absence of metallic iron resulted in poor copper-lead selectivity. The galvanic interaction caused by the presence of iron yielded a stable, well-drained froth with low ratios of solids/water recovery and larger bubbles in the froth. However, milling in the absence of iron caused an extremely brittle froth with very fine bu bubbles, high recoveries of low grades of sulphur. In contrast with the improvement in the copper recovery and copper-lead selectivity obtained when the pulp was pre-aerated after milling in the presence of iron, no significant increase in the copper grade was observed after extensive <b>pre-aeration</b> when milling occurred in the absence of iron. The unsatisfactory flotation results in the absence of iron could be explained by the enhanced floatability of iron-bearing gangue minerals, which rupture films and suppress froth stability owing to bubble-overloading. © 1993.

40|$|Wastewater {{containing}} ammonia is {{a product}} of oil refineries, coal gasification plants, slaughterhouses, dairy plants, distilleries, fertilizer plants and pharmaceutical operations; ammonia is also found in municipal wastewater. The ammonia is toxic to living organisms and it is desirable that it be removed. The foremost aim of this research was to use biologically activated ion exchange materials for ammonia removal from wastewater. In the past sand, plastic media and activated carbon as well as some ion exchange materials, e. g., clinoptilolite, have been used like a solid surface for bacteria growth. In this work some other materials were used for a combined biological and ion exchange process. The materials used were mordenite and Macronet MN 500 for terrestrial water, and modified zeolites for selective uptake of ammonia from marine waters. Clinoptilolite was used for comparison, as an ion exchanger which previously has been biologically activated. The ammonia adsorption characteristics of the materials in saline and non-saline synthetic wastewater were determined and compared with literature data. The data was fitted using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The effect of the individual presence of potassium, calcium and magnesium ion upon ammonium ion uptake onto each material was also investigated. Bench scale ion-exchange stirred cell experiments were conducted to assess the uptake kinetics of ammonium ion. Process parameters include: initial ammonia concentration, the agitation rate, material particle size and mass of the material. The suitability of the ion exchange materials as a support for the growth of nitrifying bacteria was determined by observing the nitrification process in the flasks containing different materials, for the fresh and saline media. The ion exchangers were tested in continuous columns initially without bacterial growth and later with. To overcome the problem of low oxygen levels in the column and to avoid over aeration of the system, a novel design of columns was introduced, where aeration through the column was achieved by the air permeable silicon tubing. The synthetic material MN 500 exhibited the highest uptake capacity but the natural zeolites had the highest preference for ammonium ions in the presence of interfering cations. The ion exchange materials removed ammonia from saline water. A product of zeolitic nature, ZZ, exhibited the highest uptake capacity for ammonia removal from saline water. Natural zeolites were shown to be better media for bacterial growth in non-saline water. MN 500 exhibited better ammonia removal performance for the combined process in sea water compared to modified zeolite, ZZ. Both the clinoptilolite and mordenite used in non-saline medium, exhibited higher uptake capacity during the column experiments than for batch experiments. By introducing bacteria into the column, the uptake capacity was increased from the value of 0. 15 to the value of 0. 22 meq/g for clinoptilolite. The improvement for the biologically active mordenite was from the value of 0. 30 meq/g without bacteria to the value of 0. 4 meq/g with bacteria. The aeration of 2. 88 dm³/h, achieved by the tubing, provided better condition for the nitrification within the column, compared to the commonly used tank <b>pre-aeration</b> at the rate of 180 dm³/h. The biologically active ion exchange column was not efficient in removing ammonia from saline water. High salt concentrations and slower nitrification in saline medium interfered the process significantly. It could be concluded that biologically active ion exchange is acceptable method for ammonia removal from non-saline wastewater. The possible way to improve the efficiency of the process in saline water would be to apply it in wastewaters in with nitrifying bacteria are already established. Mordenite proved to be more adequate for biological activation compared to commonly used clinoptilolite, which indicates that more ion exchange materials should be tested for combined process. The new aeration system within the columns proved to be more efficient compared to the commonly used tank <b>pre-aeration...</b>|$|E

Den nya anläggningen dimensioneras för att kunna hantera det förväntade flödet år 2040. Det framtida verket kommer dessutom behöva rena avloppsvatten som i dagsläget behandlas i verket i Bromma. Ytterligare förväntas utsläppskraven för fosfor (P), kväve (N) och organiskt {{material}} (BOD 7) att skärpas.   För närvarande bedriver SVAB i samarbete med IVL (Svenska miljöinstitutet) en pilotanläggning i Sjöstadsverket för att undersöka hur tekniken effektivt kan implementeras i Henriksdal. En stor utmaning för att optimera driften är reningsprocessen av fosfor. Som alternativ till efterfällning av fosfor önskar Henriksdal att simultanfälla fosfor med tvåvärt järn (Fe 2 +) i MBR:en.   I följande arbete utreds hur kemisk fällning av fosfor med Fe 2 + fungerar i kombination med aktivslam och mer specifikt, med MBR. Syftet med arbetet är att bidra med kunskap till fortsatta studier i Sjöstadsverket inför implementeringen av MBR i Henriksdal. Arbetet utreder delar inom den kunskap och forskning som finns gällande området idag och identifierar kunskapsluckor inom studiet. Fokus har bland annat legat på att beskriva; mekanismer och reaktionskinetik; utreda vilka parametrar som styr utfällningen; hur slammet och den biologiska aktiviteten påverkas; samt hur dosering av järn inverkar på MBR.   Få studier har gjorts inom området och i många fall varierar resultaten studierna emellan. Detta beror sannolikt på två faktorer: 1) Vattenmatrisen i avloppsvattnet är komplex. 2) Avloppsvattnets innehåll kan variera mycket.   Exakta reaktioner och mekanismer för hur fosfor avskiljs med järn(II) dosering är ännu inte fullständigt klarlagt. En stor del av Fe 2 + som tillsätts {{kommer att}} oxideras till trevärt järn (Fe 3 +). Oxidationshastigheten av Fe 2 + styrs främst av pH och syretillgänglighet i vatten och hastigheten varierar kraftigt med avseende på dessa parametrar. Fe 2 + kan även oxideras biologiskt under anoxiska förhållanden av denitrifierare. Fosfor avskiljas i sin tur antingen direkt genom utfällning med Fe 2 + eller Fe 3 +, eller genom adsorption till järnhydroxider.   Järn(II) dosering inverkar på slammets morfologi, sedimenteringsindex, storlek och stabilitet. Dosering med Fe 2 + ger kompakta flockar med släta och täta ytor samt få utstickande filament. Fe 2 + kan inverka på den biologiska aktiviteten i slammet, men där finns bevis gällande både en synergistisk inverkan och en reducerande effekt.   Generellt rekommenderas att molförhållanden över 2, Fe 2 +:P används för att uppnå tillräcklig avskiljning av fosfor i aktivslam. Liknande molförhållande tycks rekommenderas i MBR. Utöver doseringshalt kan även doseringspunkt inverka på både avskiljningsgraden av fosfor och nedsmutsningen av membranen.   I studien sammanställdes även en massbalans av flödet och järn i MBR-linjen i Sjöstadsverket. Ytterligare gjordes analyser på vattnet för att undersöka förhållandet   Vid massbalansen uppmärksammades att avskiljningen av fosfor är låg i förluftning (FL) och försedimentering (FS). Avskiljningsgraden låg under vad som förväntades (uppmätt 18 %, förväntad 50 %). Den låga avskiljningsgraden beror sannolikt på att FL och Fs är förhållandevis små. I MBR erhölls ett 40 % större uttag av järn jämfört med inkommande halt järn till MBR. Det bör kunna förklaras av att järnhalten i slammet under denna period var ovanligt hög.   Förhållandet mellan fria Fe 2 +- och Fe 3 +-joner analyserades i tvåpunkter, efter FL (mätpunkt 1) och efter FS (mätpunkt 2). I mätpunkt 1 hade 80 % av järnjonerna fällt ut och ca 60 % oxiderat till trevärt järn. Uppehållstiden i FL är ca 13 min.   pH mättes i hela MBR-reningslinjen. I FL och FS låg pH kring ungefär 7, 5 och i MBR-reaktorerna låg pH omkring 6, 5. Det förenklade hastighetsuttrycket för oxidation av järn vid syrerika förhållanden d[Fe (II) ]/dt = -k[Fe(II) ] användes för att beräkna den teoretiska halveringstiden (t 1 / 2) av Fe 2 +. t 1 / 2 i FL beräknades till 13 min, i FS till 22 min och i MBR-reaktorerna till omkring 2 h. Den teoretiska t 1 / 2 stämmer relativt bra överens med vad som uppmättes vid analys av Fe 2 +: Fe 3 +. Den slutsats som kan dras är att sannolikt så kommer mer av järnet att fälla ut i sin trevärda form då järnet doseras i FL och FS, än då järnet doseras i de luftade biologiska reaktorerna.   Sammanfattningsvis, finns få studier som utreder processen för utfällning av fosfor med Fe(II) i aktivslam eller MBR. Kunskapen inom området är begränsad och det finns ännu många kunskapsluckor som behöver täckas. På grund av avloppsvattnets komplexitet räcker inte teoretisk kunskap för en effektiv implementering av MBR. To expand {{the capacity of}} the Stockholm Vatten AB (SVAB) municipal waste water treatment plant (WWTP) “Henriksdal” a membrane bioreactor will be implemented in the existing activated sludge process. The new WWTP is dimensioned to handle the expected flow of year 2040. The future WWTP will also need to treat waste water is currently treated in Bromma. Furthermore, the effluent treatment requirements for phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and organic substituents is expected to become stricter.   In cooperation between SVAB and IVL (The Swedish Environmental Institute) the new treatment process is being tested in a pilot plant in Sjöstadsverket. One of the challenges in the new project is to achieve sufficient removal of phosphorus. Today Henriksdal WWTP removes phosphorus through post-precipitation with ferrous iron (Fe 2 +). When the MBR is implemented SVAB wants to use simultaneous precipitation in the MBR.   In this report the chemical precipitation of Fe 2 + in combination with activated sludge and MBR is examined. The aim of this thesis is to aid SVAB by contributing with knowledge in the mentioned area. The report examines the knowledge and research available about the area today and identifies if there are any gaps of knowledge. Focus of the study is among other things: the reaction mechanisms and kinetics; what parameters favor efficient precipitation; how does ferrous iron integrate with the sludge; how to efficiently combine ferrous iron precipitation in MBR.   There are only a few studies in the field and the results often contradict each other. It is likely due to two factors: 1) the matrix of waste water is complex. 2) the matrix varies considerably between different areas and different WWTP’s.   The exact mechanisms and kinetics of phosphorus removal with chemical precipitation of ferrous iron are not fully understood. A lot of the Fe 2 + will oxidize to ferric iron (Fe 3 +). The oxidation rate is mainly dependent on the pH and oxygen concentration in the water. Fe 2 + can also be oxidized through biological oxidation in anoxic environments. The phosphorus is removed by direct precipitation with Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +, or through adsorption to iron hydroxides.   Fe 2 + can influence the characteristics of the sludge by changing the morphology, the size and the stability of the flocs and the settleability of the sludge. Dosing Fe 2 + gives more compact flocs, with smooth surfaces and few filaments. Fe 2 + can also influence the biological activity in the sludge. Some studies states the iron contributes to synergistic effects, some claim it reduces the activity.   For efficient phosphorus removal in activated sludge ratios of Fe:P > 2 mole /mole is mostly used. The recommendations seem to be the same for MBR. The dosing point also seem to be of importance to achieve sufficient removal, and furthermore to prevent fouling of the membranes.   Material balances for phosphorous and for iron, as well as analyses to examine the oxidation rate and pH of the waste water in the MBR-pilot plant were also performed. The material balance showed that the removal of phosphorous in the <b>pre-aeration</b> (PA) and the pre-sedimentation (PS) was low. The expected removal was 50 % while the achieved removal 18 %. This is probably due to the relatively small size of the PA and PS compared {{to the rest of the}} pilot-plant. In the MBR the outgoing flow of iron was 40 % larger than the incoming flow. During the examined weeks the iron concentration in the sludge was higher than usually. Probably iron had been accumulated in the sludge the weeks before.   The ratio between Fe 2 +-ions and Fe 3 +-ions was analyzed in two points, in the flow following the PA respectively the flow following the PS. In the PA 80 % of the ions had precipitated and 60 % of the free irons had been oxidized to Fe 3 +.   pH was measured in each reactor of the pilot plant. In the PA and the PS the pH was about 7. 5, while in the MBR-reactors the pH was around 6. 5. The theoretical half-life (t 1 / 2) of Fe 2 + was calculated from a simplified rate reaction expression for oxidation of Fe 2 + in aerated waters. t 1 / 2 in the PA was around 13 minutes, in the PS around 22 minutes and the bio reactors around 2 h. The theoretical t 1 / 2 of Fe 2 + is relatively close to the measured values of the ratio between Fe 2 +-ions and Fe 3 +-ions. From the results of the studies it is likely that more of the iron will precipitate as ferric iron in the PA and PS than if the ferrous iron is dosed in the aerated bioreactors.   In conclusion: there are only very few studies that examines the precipitation process of ferrous iron in activated sludge or MBR. The theoretical knowledge is not wide enough to use as an only tool when MBR is implanted in new WWTP’s. Due to the complexity of the waste water empirical studies need to be performed under the actual conditions that prevail at Henriksdal WWTP...|$|E
