40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} trunk muscle endurance training on the perception of back postural fa-tigue and performance of a laparoscopic task. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one medical students (18 men and 13 women) with no laparoscopic surgical experience {{were randomly assigned to}} either a training group or a control group. Participants in the train-ing group underwent a 6 -week, 18 -session trunk (abdominal and back muscle) endurance training program, whereas participants in the control group did not. Performance by all participants was assessed on a simu-lated laparoscopic task under varying conditions of low back <b>postural</b> <b>fatigue,</b> {{both before and after the}} train-ing program. Results: Participants in the training group showed significant improvements in trunk endurance after the 6 -week trunk endurance training program (P 0. 05), whereas those in the control group did not. The im-provements in trunk endurance were accompanied by significantly reduced perceptions of discomfort (P. 001) and fewer errors during performance of the laparoscopic task (P 0. 02), whereas no significant changes occurred for the control group (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Increasing trunk endurance can reduce <b>postural</b> <b>fatigue</b> and discomfort during simulated lap-aroscopic tasks, which may assist in the management of errors during laparoscopy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe use of loupe {{magnification}} during complex hepatobiliary and pancreatic (HBP) surgery {{has become}} routine. Unfortunately, loupe magnification has several disadvantages including limited magnification, a fixed field and non-variable magnification parameters. The {{aim of this}} report is to describe a simple system of video-microscopy for use in open surgery {{as an alternative to}} loupe magnification. MethodsIn video-microscopy, the operative field is displayed on a TV monitor using a high-definition (HD) camera with a special optic mounted on an adjustable mechanical arm. The set-up and application of this system are described and illustrated using examples drawn from pancreaticoduodenectomy, bile duct repair and liver transplantation. ResultsThis system is easy to use and can provide variable magnification of × 4 – 12 at a camera distance of 25 – 35 cm from the operative field and a depth of field of 15 mm. This system allows the surgeon and assistant to work from a HD TV screen during critical phases of microsurgery. ConclusionsThe system described here provides better magnification than loupe lenses and thus may be beneficial during complex HPB procedures. Other benefits of this system include the fact that its use decreases neck strain and <b>postural</b> <b>fatigue</b> in the surgeon and it {{can be used as a}} tool for documentation and teaching...|$|E
40|$|Causes, {{prediction}} {{and prevention}} of back pain at work by JDG Troup, PhD, MRCS, LRCP 1 TROUP JDG. Causes, prediction {{and prevention of}} back pain at work. Scand J Work Environ Health 10 (1984) 419 - 428. Pain {{in the back and}} lower limbs due to lumbar disorders has a multifactorial etiology, and there is no clear relationship between the morbid pathological change observed and the symptoms experienced. Of the precipitating factors, unaccustomed heavy work, <b>postural</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and injury are common. "Back injury, " however, embodies a variety of phenomena, few of which can readily be distinguished either in national statistical data or in previous epidemiologic studies. Thus the causal relationship between back pain and work is far from clear, a difficulty compounded by the prevalence of back symptoms in all groups of the population. There are few epidemiologically established methods for identifying people who are susceptible to a first attack of back pain, though, once back pain has been reported, recurrence may be predicted. Selection of the preventive approach depends on reliable information about the prevalence of back pain/discomfort, the back injury rate, sickness absence, etc; about accidents, work stoppages, job turnover, or any other pointers to the design of the workplace o...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of sleep deprivation on <b>postural</b> control, subjective <b>fatigue</b> assessment and psychomotor performance, and to assess the efficiency of an objective post uro-graphic test {{as an indicator of}} mental <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Postural</b> sway using static posturography (Romberg’s test), subjective fatigue assessment (Stanford Sleepiness Scale) and psychomotor performance (Sternberg dual-task test) were assessed in 12 subjects before and after 24 h of sustained wakefulness. After sustained wakefulness, the Romberg test parameters of circumference area and rectangle area with the eyes-closed, and standard deviation in the anterior–posterior direction with the eyes-open were significantly higher compared with baseline values (before sustained wakefulness). Subjective fatigue assessment scores were also significantly increased, while psycho-motor performance was unchanged. Sleep deprivation can arouse a feeling of fatigue and can affect postural stability, hence an objective posturographic test score may be useful as an indicator of mental fatigue...|$|R
40|$|In {{the retail}} {{supermarket}} industry where cashiers perform repetitive, light manual material-handling tasks when scanning and handling products, reports of musculoskeletal disorders and discomfort are high. Ergonomics tradeoŒs exist between sitting and standing postures, which are further confounded by the checkstand design and point-of-sale technology, {{such as the}} scanner. A laboratory experiment {{study was conducted to}} understand the eŒects of working position (sitting versus standing) and scanner type (bi-optic versus single window) on muscle activity, upper limb and spinal posture, and subjective preference of cashiers. Ten cashiers from a Dutch retailer participated in the study. Cashiers exhibited lower muscle activity in the neck and shoulders when standing and using a bi-optic scanner. Shoulder abduction was also less for standing conditions. In addition, all cashiers preferred using the bi-optic scanner with mixed preferences for sitting (n = 6) and standing (n = 4). Static loading of the muscles was relatively high compared with benchmarks, suggesting that during the task of scanning, cashiers may not have adequate recovery time to prevent fatigue. It is recommended that retailers integrate bi-optic scanners into standing checkstands to minimize <b>postural</b> stress, <b>fatigue</b> and discomfort in cashiers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{kyphosis}} deformity affects <b>postural</b> control. Muscular <b>fatigue</b> {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that can impair the mechanism of body balance. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of local fatigue on the myoelectrical activity of erector spine muscles and the center for pressure displacement of the feet during balance recovery following postural perturbation in kyphotic subjects. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 12 male students with> 40 degrees thoracic kyphosis and 12 controls were selected to participate in the study. A flexible ruler was used to measure thoracic kyphosis. For postural control assessment, each subject underwent unexpected, forward-backward perturbations while standing on a foot scan mounted on a movable plate triggered by a weight equivalent to 10...|$|R
40|$|Does greater {{strength}} {{capacity in}} the shoulder-complex afford increased protection against regionalized fatigue and discomfort induced by sustained awkward arm postures in light-weight manual assembly environments? This question was addressed by testing the relationship between differences in shoulder complex strength capacity, produced by variations in arm posture within a subject, and among subjects assuming equivalent arm postures, and severity of fatigue and discomfort sensed during a low-exertion manual performance task. Experimental findings showed that: (a) awkward arm postures produced substantial and rapid onset of <b>postural</b> <b>fatigue</b> and discomfort during a light-weight manual performance task where strength demands were low (i. e., less than 15 percent of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)), (b) variations in strength capability found among arm postures within an individual subject, or 3 mong subjects assuming the same arm posture, did not affect onset of substantial fatigue or discomfort when hands are postured near or above shoulder level, and (c) postures which simply appeared to be awkward, or which compromised strength capacity (e. g., working with the arm {{to the side of}} the body, or aligned in the coronal plane), did not necessarily increase discomfort of fatigue. Our findings suggest caution against sole reliance upon population or individual worker upper-extremity strength capabilities as predictors of fatigue and discomfort in the shoulder complex when manual exertions are small (e. g., light-weight manual assembly activities involving small parts or small hand-tools) and hands are postured at or above shoulder level...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue impairs {{sensorimotor}} performance, reduces spinal reflexes and {{affects the}} interaction of antagonistic muscles in complex motor tasks. Although there is literature dealing with the interference of fatigue and postural control, the interpretation is confounded by the variety of paradigms used to study it. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of <b>postural</b> <b>fatigue</b> on balance control and strategy, {{as well as on}} neuromuscular modulation, in response to postural perturbation (PERT) during a fatiguing balance task. A fatigue protocol consisting of continuous exposure to perturbations until exhaustion was executed in 24 subjects. Number of failed attempts, paths of center of pressure displacement (COP), ankle, knee, and hip joint kinematics, electromyographic activity of the soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), and gluteus maximus muscles (GM) and spinal excitability of SOL {{at the peak of the}} short-latency responses (SLR) were recorded after posterior PERT. The co-contraction index (CCI) was calculated for TA_SOL, VL_BF and RF_GM. (1) The number of failed attempts significantly increased while COP amplitude and velocity, as well as angular excursion at the ankle, knee and hip joints, decreased with fatigue (P < 0. 05). (2) Concomitantly, CCI of SOL_TA, VL_BF and RF_GM increased and spinal excitability in SOL declined. (3) Adaptations progressively augmented with progressing exhaustion and occurred in the distal prior to proximal segment. Distinctly deteriorated balance ability was accompanied by a modified neuromuscular control—the increase in co-contraction reflected by simultaneously activated antagonists is accompanied by smaller knee and hip joint excursions, indicating an elevated level of articular stiffness. These changes may be associated with an exaggerated postural rigidity and could have caused the delayed and reduced postural reactions that are reflected in the changes in COP displacement when compensating for sudden PERT. The reduction in spinal excitability may either be caused by fatigue itself or by an increase in reciprocal inhibition due to augmented TA activity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{orthotic}} intervention on unilateral <b>postural</b> sway after <b>fatigue</b> of the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor muscle groups. Design and Setting: Subjects were assigned to both or-thotic and nonorthotic testing conditions in a counterbalanced order, then assessed for postural sway before and after isoki-netic fatiguing contractions of the plantar flexors and dorsiflex-ors. Postural stability was measured on the motor-dominant extremity. (Motor dominance was assessed as the foot the subject used to kick a ball.)

30|$|Like the E/HF {{methods used}} to collect data, the {{analysis}} was largely qualitative. For the ergonomics assessment, {{the impact of the}} controls on <b>postural</b> and muscle <b>fatigue</b> was evaluated by analysing the objective force assessments in 3 -dimensional static strength modelling software. Further, the organisations’ own statistics associated with the history of injury in the use of their trams was reviewed and the physical loads in relation to injury causing factors were examined. These assessments identified target areas for changes to the physical cab. For the human factors work, data from the focus groups and informal interviews was transcribed and analysed with a number of techniques. Consistent with the aims of the research and scope of this paper, we report specifically on results that were identified through a process of thematic analysis applied to data from both the ergonomics and human factors components. This is in order to generate clear themes that meet the aims of the research and fulfil the objectives of the paper.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to investigate whether the calf muscle <b>fatigue</b> affects <b>postural</b> sway in bipedal stance and requires additional attentional demands. METHODS: Nine healthy university students had to respond as rapidly as possible to an unpredictable auditory stimulus while maintaining stable seated and upright postures with their eyes closed in two conditions of no-fatigue and fatigue of the calf muscles. Center of foot pressure (COP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Reaction times (RTs) values were used as an index of the attentional demand necessary for regulating <b>postural</b> sway. RESULTS: <b>Fatigue</b> yielded a significant anterior shift of mean position of the COP and increased range, mean speed, and dispersion of COP displacements. An increased attentional demand for regulating postural sway also was observed with fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that muscular fatigue may put the individuals at higher risk of falling, especially when engaging in concurrent tasks...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the myoelectric effects of muscle fatigue in Longissimus Thoracis, Iliocostalis Lumborum pars Thoracis and lumbar Multifidus during standardised muscle fatigue tests and in a marine environment. These muscles contribute significantly to the extensor moment of the lumbar spine and are an important <b>postural</b> stabiliser. <b>Fatigue</b> of these muscles is considered {{to contribute to the}} aetiology of low back pain; rehabilitation approaches that improve muscle endurance capacity would benefit from {{a better understanding of how}} these muscles fatigue. A feasibility study methodology was developed and a case series study undertaken to establish the utility of standardised fatigue testing before and after a marine high-speed transit that is considered to cause muscle fatigue. Surface EMG data were collected in combination with heart rate and motion data of the vessel and study participants. Standardised fatigue testing was utilised before and after the task to determine the sensitivity of the test; the test was not shown to have clinical utility in this case. Methodology was developed, using high-density surface electromyography (sEMG) and high-density surface electrodes, in order to analyse data from multiple locations over each muscle of interest. Software was developed that enabled specific channels and segments of data to be analysed. A post-mortem anatomical study, in an older population, was completed and this provided position and angle data from bony landmarks for the accurate positioning of high-density surface electrodes and subsequent interpretation of high-density sEMG signal data. A pilot validation study, utilising magnetic resonance images (MRI), compared results of the anatomical study with a MRI series from an older population and a further series in a younger population. The results of these studies partly concur, add to previous study results and provide data on sEMG electrode placement that will aid further sEMG studies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} a standard and a modified checkout workstation during a simulated task on trunk postures of a supermarket checkout operator. METHODS: Eight participants performed a task involving grasping, scanning and depositing products, while 3 D images of the trunk were collected. RESULTS: A number of kinematic changes were observed in trunk posture. A greater anterior flexion (3. 0 ± 1. 2 º) and lateral bending during grasping (7. 1 ± 1. 4 º) were found in the standard checkout workstation when compared to the modified model (p 0. 05). DISCUSSION: The modified checkout workstation provided less lateral bending of the trunk to grasp products (8. 1 º ± 2. 8; p 0. 05), irrespective of the checkout workstations (p> 0. 05). The modified checkout workstation successfully reduced risk of injury in some aspects, particularly the problems associated with lateral bending of the trunk. Other studies are required to test whether such potential benefits are obtained on a daily basis. CONCLUSIONS: Supermarket checkout operators may be at high risk of occupational injury due to different workstation demands. Modifications to checkout workstation design are an attractive possibility to reduce <b>postural</b> stress and <b>fatigue</b> in checkout operators. Longitudinal studies are required to test whether changes observed in the present study are sustained in the long term...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether high-intensity cycling training leads to adapted responses of balance performance in response to exercise-induced muscle fatigue. METHODS:Eighteen healthy adults were assigned to either 3 -weeks (n = 8, age 20. 1 ± 2. 6 years, height 177 ± 5 cm, mass 73. 6 ± 5. 1 kg) or 6 -weeks (n = 10, age 24. 3 ± 5. 8 years, height 179 ± 6 cm, mass 81. 0 ± 15. 8 kg) of high-intensity training (HIT) on a cycle ergometer. The centre of pressure (COP) displacement in the anteroposterior (COPAP) direction and COP path length (COPL) were measured before and after the first and final high-intensity training sessions. RESULTS:Pre-training, exercise-induced fatigue elicited an increase in COPAP (3 -weeks; p = 0. 001, 6 -weeks; p = 0. 001) and COPL (3 -weeks; p = 0. 002, 6 -weeks; p = 0. 001) returning to pre-exercise levels within 10 -min of recovery. Following 3 -weeks of training, significant increases in COPAP (p = 0. 001) and COPL (p = 0. 002) were observed post-fatigue, returning to pre-exercise levels after 15 -min of recovery. After 6 -weeks of training no significant increases in sway (COPAP; p = 0. 212, COPL; p = 0. 998) were observed following exercise-induced fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 3 weeks of HIT resulted in longer recovery times following fatigue compared to pre-training assessments. After 6 weeks of HIT, <b>postural</b> sway following <b>fatigue</b> was attenuated. These results indicate that HIT could be included in injury prevention programmes, however, caution should be taken during early stages of the overreaching process...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{unexpected}} {{loading and}} high frequency repetitive lifting {{have been identified}} as risk factors for low back injury. Despite the risk that such factors pose, there is a dearth of literature concerning the influence of posture and <b>fatigue</b> on muscular, <b>postural,</b> subjective and physiological responses in these situations. The primary aim of this thesis was {{to examine the effects of}} posture and lifting-induced <b>fatigue</b> on neuromuscular, <b>postural,</b> psychophysical and physiological responses to sudden loading and repetitive lifting. The first two studies in this thesis focused on muscular and postural responses to sudden loading of a hand-held box in an upright and stoop standing posture. Trials were performed with and without visual warning and following lifting-induced fatigue. Sudden loading in an upright posture resulted in co-activation of oblique abdominal and erector spinae musculature, with relatively simultaneous joint initiation of the lower limb and lumbar spine. In contrast, sudden loading in the stoop posture produced minimal abdominal muscle contribution. Maximal angular joint excursion was significantly less in the stoop than that in the upright posture. Prior exposure and warning primarily affected postural responses in the upright posture with earlier activation of the trunk and lower limb musculature resulting in a reduction in joint excursion. Such a mechanism may enhance postural stability. However, the influence of warning on reducing joint motion was compromised when fatigued. Studies three and four of the thesis focused on the effects of self-selected lifting posture (squat, mixed and stoop) and fatigue during repetitive lifting on psychophysical, physiological, neuromuscular and lumbar spine kinematic responses. Study three compared lifting postures using ratings of perceived exertion and heart rate response patterns. Similar subjective and physiological responses were found for different lifting postures, with a progressive rise in ratings of perceived exertion and heart rate measures throughout the task. All postures exhibited evidence of erector spinae muscle fatigue at the end of the task. Study four examined the effect of self-selected lifting posture on lumbosacral kinematics and associated trunk muscle activation patterns during lifting and lowering, pre and post fatigued. When compared to squat lifting, individuals who self-selected a stoop lifting technique displayed different lower erector spinae activation patterns. The stoop lifters also flexed their lumbar spines at faster velocities and adopted greater lumbosacral flexion than squat lifters, which could potentially place greater strain on the passive structures of the spine. Fatigue influenced lumbosacral motion patterns of stoop and mixed lifters to a greater extent than squat lifters, resulting in a decreased range and velocity of lumbar extension. Findings from this thesis provide insight into the underlying neuromuscular control of the trunk during high risk manual handling activities. It provides important information concerning the possible mechanism of <b>postural</b> and <b>fatigue</b> related musculoskeletal injury. This will assist the development of training and rehabilitation programmes targeted at neuromuscular, physiological, biomechanical and psychophysical requirements of manual handling tasks...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of fatigue on static and dynamic postural stability after completing a mountain ultra-marathon. Twelve male athletes participated in the study. Postural stability was assessed before and immediately after the race. Static postural stability was evaluated on a dynamometric platform with eyes opened (OE) and closed (CE). Dynamic postural stability was assessed with OE on an instrumented plate which allowed medio-lateral oscillations. Stabilometric data were affected by fatigue in the OE condition, concerning sway path velocity (p = 0. 0006), sway area velocity (p = 0. 0006), area of the confidence ellipse (p = 0. 0016), maximal anterior-posterior (AP) (p = 0. 0017) and medio-lateral (ML) (p = 0. 0039) oscillations. In the CE condition the sway path velocity (p = 0. 0334), the maximal ML oscillations (p = 0. 0161) and {{the area of the}} confident ellipse (p = 0. 0180) were also negatively influenced. Stabilogram diffusion analysis showed in the OE condition an increase of short-term diffusion coefficients considering the anterior-posterior direction (Dfys; p = 0. 0023) and the combination of the two (Dfr 2 s; p = 0. 0032). Equally, long term diffusion coefficients increased considering the anterior-posterior direction (Dfyl; p = 0. 0093) and the combination of the two (Dfr 2 l; p = 0. 0086). In CE condition greater values were detected for medio-lateral direction (Dfxl; p = 0. 033), anterior-posterior direction (Dfyl; p = 0. 0459) and the combination of the two (Dfr 2 l; p = 0. 0048). The dynamic postural stability test showed an increase of the time spent with the edges of the plate on the floor (p = 0. 0152). Our results showed that mountain ultra-marathon altered static stability more than dynamic stability. An involvement of cognitive resources to monitor <b>postural</b> stability after <b>fatiguing</b> could be the explanation of the worsening in the automatic task (quiet standing) and of the positive compensation in the less automatic task (dynamic standing on the instrumented plate) ...|$|R
