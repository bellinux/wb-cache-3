In the first stage, the decision-based recursive adaptive noise-exclusive median filter is applied to remove the noise cleanly {{and to keep the}} uncorrupted information as well as possible. In the second stage, the fuzzy decision rules inspired by human visual system (HVS) are proposed to classify image pixels into human <b>perception</b> <b>sensitive</b> class and non-sensitive class. A neural network is proposed to compensate the sensitive regions for image quality enhancement. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is superior to conventional methods in perceptual image quality as well as the clarity and the smoothness in edge regions of the resultant images...|$|E

Moreover, there are several filters and image smoothing techniques available in the literature. All these available techniques have certain limitations. Recently, neural networks are found to be a very efficient tool for image enhancement. A novel two-stage noise removal technique for image enhancement and noise removal is proposed in this paper. In noise removal stage, an adaptive two-level feed forward Neural Network (NN) with a Modified Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm was used to eliminate the impulse noise. In the image enhancement stage, the fuzzy decision rules inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) are used to categorize the image pixels into human <b>perception</b> <b>sensitive</b> class and nonsensitive class, and to enhance the quality of the image. The Hyper trapezoidal fuzzy membership function is used in the proposed technique. In order to improve the sensitive regions with higher visual quality, a Neural Network (NN) is proposed.

40|$|The role {{of color}} in the visual {{perception}} of mirror-symmetry is controversial. Some reports support the existence of color-selective mirror-symmetry channels, others that mirror-symmetry <b>perception</b> is merely <b>sensitive</b> to color-correlations across the symmetry axis. Here we test between the two ideas. Stimuli consisted of colored Gaussian-blobs arranged either mirror-symmetrically or quasi-randomly. We used four arrangements: (1) ‘segregated’ – symmetric blobs were of one color, random blobs of the other color(s); (2) ‘random-segregated’ – as above but with the symmetric color randomly selected on each trial; (3) ‘non-segregated’ – symmetric blobs were of all colors in equal proportions, as were the random blobs; (4) ‘anti-symmetric’ – symmetric blobs were of opposite-color across the symmetry axis. We found: (a) near-chance levels for the anti-symmetric condition, suggesting that symmetry <b>perception</b> is <b>sensitive</b> to color-correlations across the symmetry axis; (b) similar performance for random-segregated and non-segregated conditions, giving no support to the idea that mirror-symmetry is color selective; (c) highest performance for the color-segregated condition, but only when the observer knew beforehand the symmetry color, suggesting that symmetry detection benefits from color-based attention. We conclude that mirror-symmetry detection mechanisms, while sensitive to color-correlations across the symmetry axis and subject to the benefits of attention-to-color, are not color selectiv...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Spatial <b>perception</b> is <b>sensitive</b> to the {{energetic}} costs {{required to perform}} intended actions. For example, hills look steeper {{to people who are}} fatigued or burdened by a heavy load. Similarly, perceived distance is also inXu-enced by the energy required to walk or throw to a target. Such experiments demonstrate that perception is a function, not just of optical information, but also of the perceiver’s potential to act and {{the energetic}} costs associated with the intended action. In the current paper, we expand on the notion of “cost ” by examining perceived distance in patients diagnosed with chronic pain, a multifactorial dis-ease, which is experienced while walking. We found that chronic pain patients perceive target distances to be farther away compared with a control group. These results indicate the physical, and perhaps emotional, costs of chronic pain aVect spatial perceptions...|$|R
40|$|Learning to {{categorize}} objects can transform {{how they are}} perceived, causing relevant perceptual dimensions predictive of object category to become enhanced. For example, an expert mycologist might become attuned to species-specific patterns of spacing between mushroom gills but learn to ignore cap textures attributable to varying environmental conditions. These selective changes in perception can persist beyond the act of categorizing objects and influence our ability to discriminate between them. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} adaptation, we demonstrate that such category-specific perceptual enhancements are associated with changes in the neural discriminability of object representations in visual cortex. Regions within the anterior fusiform gyrus became more sensitive to small variations in shape that were relevant during prior category learning. In addition, extrastriate occipital areas showed heightened sensitivity to small variations in shape that spanned the category boundary. Visual representations in cortex, just like our <b>perception,</b> are <b>sensitive</b> to an object’s history of categorization...|$|R

40|$|Previous image clutter metrics were {{proposed}} {{based on}} the sensitivity of human visual perception to one feature of image. In this paper, a novel feature difference based image clutter metric is proposed by fully considering low-level image features, such as step edges, lines and Mach bands. As phase congruency is an invariant property of image features, the phase congruency (PC) is used to quantify the feature difference between the target and clutter images. Because PC is invariant to changes in image contrast while human visual <b>perception</b> is <b>sensitive</b> to contrast changes, a directional contrast (DC) feature is developed to calculate the contrast {{difference between the two}} images. Then we utilize the DC of the target image as an information content weighting measure to pool the local difference map to be a clutter metric. Comparative experiments demonstrate that this clutter metric correlates stronger with detection probabilities, false alarm probabilities and mean search times than previously proposed metrics.

Objectives: Sensitive skin data from the developing world is sparse. This study evaluates the prevalence and characteristics of sensitive skin in China and compares data collected to existing data from the western world. Patients/Materials/Methods: A total of 408 Chinese women voluntarily completed a survey on sensitive skin. Results: Some degree of skin sensitivity was claimed by 94 (23 %) of respondents; most (90. 4 %) said their skin was only slightly or moderately sensitive. Facial sensitivity was claimed by 21 % of Chinese women, sensitivity of the body surface by 9 % and genital sensitivity by only 6 %. Small numbers of respondents reported a history of skin allergy (3 %) or a familial history of sensitive skin (2 %). Many reported making buying decisions based on product claims. Conclusions: Only 23 % of Chinese women claimed any degree of sensitive skin, a prevalence substantially lower than that observed in most Western countries.

Whilst used largely within health and social sciences research, recent studies have demonstrated its value in eliciting views around organisations and organisational change. This paper appraises the draw-and-write method and reflects on the methodological lessons learned by using the technique in two studies conducted in England which aimed to elicit children’s <b>perceptions</b> of <b>sensitive</b> issues: transition from primary to secondary school and the management of bully/victim problems.

It concludes that it is difficult for this method to stand in isolation and that the role of drawings as both process and product means that the construction and interpretation of images may result in a within-study shift between poststructuralist and semiotic paradigms which requires researchers to adopt accompanying methods, such as interviews, which will acknowledge this shift and enable participant voice to be fully captured...|$|R
