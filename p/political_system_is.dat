The dynamics are governed by the likelihood of transitions and their outcome, which are both determined endogenously. We find that reforms and revolts result in extreme <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> - reforms by enfranchising {{the majority of the}} population leading to democracies, and revolts by installing autocracies. Reinforcing this polarization, extreme <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> persistent across time: Democracies are intrinsically stable, leading to long episodes without political change. Autocracies, in contrast, are subject to frequent regime changes. Nevertheless they are persistent, since ensuing revolts lead to autocracies comparable to their predecessors.

25|$|There are {{no formal}} parties in Tuvalu. The <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> based on {{personal}} alliances and loyalties derived from clan and family connections. The Parliament of Tuvalu is rare among national legislatures {{in that it is}} non-partisan in nature. It does tend to have both a distinct government and a distinct opposition, but members often cross the floor between the two groups, resulting in a number of mid-term changes of government in recent years, such as followed the Tuvaluan general election, 2010. Maatia Toafa was elected prime minister soon after the election, however on 24 December 2010, he lost office after a motion of no confidence, carried by eight votes to seven, which had the result that a new ministry was formed by Willy Telavi. Telavi retained a majority support in parliament following the Nui by-election, 2011, however the Nukufetau by-election, 2013 was won by the opposition candidate, which resulted in the loss of his majority. A constitutional crisis developed when Telavi took the position that, under the Constitution of Tuvalu, he was only required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013. However he was forced to call parliament following the intervention of the governor-general. On 2 August 2013 Willy Tevali faced a motion of no confidence in the parliament. On 4 August the parliament elected Enele Sopoaga as prime minister. In 2015 the parliament was dissolved with a general election set down for March.|$|E

Bio-inspired <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> operate with nature-based dynamics, inspired on the knowledge that has been acquired about complexity from natural social systems and life.

2500|$|During World War I, Chamberlain {{published}} several propaganda texts {{against his}} {{country of birth}} – Kriegsaufsätze (Wartime Essays). In the first four tracts, he maintains that Germany is a nation of peace; England's <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining [...] "living" [...] language; and {{the world would be}} better off doing away with English and French-styled parliamentary governments in favour of German rule [...] "thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence." [...] The final two discuss England and Germany at length. Chamberlain's basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth-humans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the next was a completely flawed system. Quoting the French scientist Gustave Le Bon, Chamberlain wrote {{the vast majority of people}} were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France. In Germany, Chamberlain asserted true freedom existed as freedom came from the state which alone made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos. Field summarized Chamberlain's thesis [...] "...the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Cosigning [...] "liberty" [...] to an inner, [...] "nonpolitical" [...] moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government". Quoting-sometimes wildly out of context-various British, French and American authors such as John Richard Green, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, John Robert Seeley, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, Paul Bourget, Francis Delaisi, James Bryce, John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson, and H. G. Wells, Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed [...] "to further the interests of money making all over the globe". Chamberlain's attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow [...] "Jewish plutocrats" [...] to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American. Right from the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews. Chamberlain wrote that America [...] "is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature". Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the Auswärtiges Amt worked hard to prevent Chamberlain's essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America. Chamberlain's wartime writings also gained much attention, albeit of a highly negative sort in his native Britain with The Times Literary Supplement declaring: [...] "The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense". In 1915, an unauthorised translation of Chamberlain's wartime essays was published in London under the unflattering title of The Ravings of a Renegade.|$|E
