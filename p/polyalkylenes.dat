The cyclic monomer dimethyl 2, 4 : 3, 5 -di-O-methylene galactarate, which was synthesized from galactaric acid, has several attractive features linked to its rigidity, chirality, non-toxicity and hydrophilicity. Aliphatic homopolyesters <b>poly(alkylene</b> 2, 4 : 3, 5 -di-O-methylene galactarate) s were prepared from dimethyl 2, 4 : 3, 5 -di-O-methylene galactarate and the aliphatic α,ω-diols 1, 6 - hexanediol; 1, 8 -octanediol; 1, 10 -decanediol and 1, 12 -dodecanediol; and were characterized by NMR, FT-IR, viscosimetry and GPC. According to the asymmetric constitution of the galactarate unit, these polyesters displayed optical activity in solution. The thermal behavior, mechanical properties and biodegradability of these polyesters were evaluated and compared with those displayed by their homologues dimethyl adipatederived homopolyesters. All <b>poly(alkylene</b> 2, 4 : 3, 5 -di-O-methylene galactarate) s and <b>poly(alkylene</b> adipate) s from synthesis were semicrystalline.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} pressure to reduce emissions, friction reduction {{is always an}} up-to-date topic in the automotive industry. Among the various possibilities to reduce mechanical friction, the usage of a low-viscosity lubricant in the engine {{is one of the}} most effective and most economic options. Therefore, lubricants of continuously lower viscosity are being developed and offered on the market that promise to reduce engine friction while avoiding deleterious mixed lubrication and wear. In this work, a 1. 6 L downsized Diesel engine is used on a highly accurate engine friction test-rig to determine the potential for friction reduction using low viscosity lubricants under realistic operating conditions including high engine loads. In particular, two hydrocarbon-based lubricants, 0 W 30 and 0 W 20, are investigated as well as a novel experimental lubricant, which is based on a <b>polyalkylene</b> glycol base stock. Total engine friction is measured for all three lubricants, which show a general 5 % advantage for the 0 W 20 in comparison to the 0 W 30 lubricant.
