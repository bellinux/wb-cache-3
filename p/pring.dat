In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin <b>Pring,</b> who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.|$|E

2500|$|Dulwich, {{named after}} the {{settlement}} in the London Borough of Southwark, has its origins in Section 263 of the Adelaide region as laid out by South Australia's first chief surveyor, Colonel William Light. It was bought by a Captain of the Royal Navy, Daniel <b>Pring.</b> In his initial absence the section was leased to a local cattle dealer, but upon the early death of <b>Pring,</b> his wife inherited the area. After several transactions the land was sold; John Hector, manager of the Savings Bank of South Australia bought much of the land {{with the exception of}} that located around Victoria Park. It was Hector who christened the land as the 'Village of Dulwich', or in the colloquial terms of the time, 'Hector's Paddock'. Hector oversaw the subdivision of the land and its transfer to many new owners. The Adelaide press at the time, {{in the form of the}} Advertiser and the South Australian Gazetter, was exceptionally generous in their words relating to the new village: 'The Suburban Village of Dulwich ... beautifully situated on a gentle rise sufficient to command a view of the sea, with the noble amphitheatre of the hills for a background', 'For building sites convenient to the metropolis, Dulwich has no rival'.|$|E

2500|$|Author Roger Ray {{thoroughly}} researched Josephine's {{story about}} joining the theater company and found many inconsistencies. [...] The Markham troupe was documented as leaving San Francisco {{on board the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, not a ship nor a stagecoach, in October 1879 for Casa Grande, Arizona, {{the end of the}} line. Josephine or Sadie Marcus’s name was never included among those on the Markham troupe’s rolls in 1879. The Yuma Arizona Sentinel reported on October 25, 1879, [...] "Tuesday arrived a Pinafore Company for Tucson, composed of Misses Pauline Markham, Mary Bell, Belle Howard, and Mrs. <b>Pring,</b> and Messrs. Borabeck and McMahon." [...] From Yuma, the troupe took a stagecoach to Tucson, not Prescott. The train trip was not interrupted by Indians. Ray says that Josephine didn't have a friend named Dora Hirsch. Her real name was Leah Hirschberg, whose mother was a music teacher. This family lived only a few blocks from where Josephine lived with her family. But Leah never left San Francisco with Josephine. She enjoyed some brief success as a juvenile actress on the San Francisco stage during the 1870s.|$|E
