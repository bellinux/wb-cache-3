According to ATOC, roll-out plans were subject to the installation of suitable ticket gates and back office equipment at all 330 stations. A 2009 date was set out for this to be finished by.|$|E
50|$|Sequence {{searches}} {{are frequently}} performed by biologists to infer {{the function of}} an unknown protein from its sequence. For this purpose, the protein's sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases and its function is deduced {{from those of the}} most similar sequences. Often, no sequences with annotated functions can be found in such a search. In this case, more sensitive methods are required to identify more remotely related proteins or protein families. From these relationships, hypotheses about the protein's functions, structure, and domain composition can be inferred. HHsearch performs searches with a protein sequence through databases. The HHpred server and the HH-suite software <b>package</b> <b>offer</b> many popular, regularly updated databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, as well as the InterPro, Pfam, COG, and SCOP databases.|$|E

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the eighties when a kind of trade revolution began, there were first serious attempts to develop the strategy of positioning in trade. Practically, there were attempts to synthesize the differentiation strategy based on competition (the objective is to have more successful and profitable offer than the competitive one) and the segmentation strategy based on consumers (the objective is to create a unique <b>package</b> <b>offer</b> for a desired, target segment of consumers). The first attempts to theorize the concept of positioning in trade can be found ten years later after it developed among producers. Thus the emphasis in the positioning strategy of commercial enterprises is placed on the specific position directed at the specific competitors. With the development of the market, globalization and information revolution, commercial enterprises were increasingly growing, gaining strength and internationalizing their position. Traditional marketing strategies gain importance only when modified and adapted to local markets. The motto “Think globally, act locally ” becomes more important with the development of a strategy which is unique in its structure- the strategy of positioning. “French Open”, a worldwide successful tennis tournament as one of the products of French Tennis Federation, is an example of profitable and well-done strategy of positioning...|$|E

40|$|The stashR package (a Set of Tools for Administering SHared Repositories) for R {{implements}} {{a simple}} key-value style database where character string keys {{are associated with}} data values. The key-value databases can be either stored locally on the user 2 ̆ 7 s computer or accessed remotely via the Internet. Methods specific to the stashR package allow users to share data repositories or access previously created remote data repositories. In particular, methods are available for the S 4 classes localDB and remoteDB to insert, retrieve, or delete data from the database {{as well as to}} synchronize local copies of the data to the remote version of the database. Users efficiently access information from a remote database by retrieving only the data files indexed by user-specified keys and caching this data in a local copy of the remote database. The local and remote counterparts of the stashR <b>package</b> <b>offer</b> the potential to enhance reproducible research by allowing users of Sweave to cache their R computations for a research paper in a localDB database. This database can then be stored on the Internet as a remoteDB database. When readers of the research paper wish to reproduce the computations involved in creating a specific figure or calculating a specific numeric value, they can access the remoteDB database and obtain the R objects involved in the computation...|$|E
40|$|This {{body of work}} investigates various {{techniques}} for the surface modification of food contact materials for use in food packaging and processing applications. Nanoscale changes {{to the surface of}} polymeric food packaging materials enables changes in adhesion, wettability, printability, chemical functionality, and bioactivity, while maintaining desirable bulk properties. Polymer surface modification is used in applications such as antimicrobial or non-fouling materials, biosensors, and active packaging. Non-migratory active packagings, in which bioactive components are tethered to the <b>package,</b> <b>offer</b> the potential to reduce the need for additives in food products while maintaining safety and quality. A challenge in developing non-migratory active packaging materials is the loss of biomolecular activity that can occur when biomolecules are immobilized. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a biocompatible polymer, is grafted from the surface of ozone treated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) resulting in a surface functionalized polyethylene to which a range of amine-terminated bioactive molecules can be immobilized. The grafting of PEG onto the surface of polymer packaging films is accomplished by free radical graft polymerization, and to covalently link an amine-terminated molecule to the PEG tether, demonstrating that amine-terminated bioactive compounds (such as peptides, enzymes, and some antimicrobials) can be immobilized onto PEG-grafted LDPE in the development of non-migratory active packaging. ^ Fouling on food contact surfaces during food processing has a significant impact on operating efficiency and can promote biofilm development. Processing raw milk on plate heat exchangers results in significant fouling of proteins as well as minerals, and is exacerbated by the wall heating effect. An electroless nickel coating is co-deposited with polytetrafluoroethylene onto stainless steel to test its ability to resist fouling on a pilot plant scale plate heat exchanger. Further work was performed to test the stability of non-fouling material after extended exposure to an alkali detergent or acid sanitizer formulated for clean-in-place procedures in dairy processing facilities. Additionally, the anti-corrosive property of the surface coating was tested on carbon steel against chlorine ions, a common corrosive agent found in the food industry. Accelerated corrosion and long-term chemical exposure studies were conducted to measure the coating stability against the harsh corrosive agents. ...|$|E
