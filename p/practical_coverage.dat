40|$|Availability in {{wireless}} visual sensor networks {{is a major}} design {{issue that}} {{is directly related to}} applications monitoring quality. For targets monitoring, visual sensors may be deployed to cover most or all of targets, and monitoring quality may be focused on how well a set of targets are being covered. However, targets may have different dimensions and it is expected that large targets may be only partially viewed by source nodes, which may affect coverage quality and lead to a state of unavailability. In this context, this article analyzes the effect of target’s size on effective coverage in wireless visual sensor networks. A new coverage metric, the Effective Target Viewing (ETV), is proposed to measure monitoring quality over a set of targets, which is exploited as a fundamental parameter for availability assessment.

40|$|Predicting {{potential}} {{consequences of}} Vapor Cloud Explosions (VCEs) {{has always been}} an important issue in safety assessments, because of the devastating damage that this phenomenon can create on (petro chemical) production sites. Although the TNO Multi-Energy method has been {{recognized as one of the}} best methods to predict blast overpressures of vapor cloud explosions, its application has been complicated by the required expert knowledge to choose a blast strength category and the congested fraction of the flammable cloud. In the GAME project (Guidance on Application of Multi-Energy, a contract research project for HSE), TNO already developed a quantitative method to derive the blast strength of VCEs, based on well-defined congestion area properties. Recently, this method has been extended and combined with dispersion models to derive a <b>practical</b> cloud <b>coverage</b> fraction, which is used to find the other important influencing parameter: the explosive mass of the congested part of the flammable cloud.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are often {{required to provide}} event miss-ratio assurance for a given event type. To meet such assurances along with minimum energy consumption, this paper shows how a node&# 39;s activation and rate assignment is dependent on its distance to event sources, and proposes a <b>practical</b> <b>coverage</b> and rate allocation (CORA) protocol to exploit this dependency in realistic environments. Both uniform event distribution and nonuniform event distribution are considered {{and the notion of}} ideal correlation distance around a clusterhead is introduced for on-duty node selection. In correlation distance guided CORA, rate assignment assists coverage scheduling by determining which nodes should be activated for minimizing data redundancy in transmission. Coverage scheduling assists rate assignment by controlling the amount of overlap among sensing regions of neighboring nodes, thereby providing sufficient data correlation for rate assignment. Extensive simulation results show that CORA meets the required event miss-ratios in realistic environments. CORA&# 39;s joint coverage scheduling and rate allocation reduce the total energy expenditure by 85 &# 37;, average battery energy consumption by 25 &# 37;, and the overhead of source coding up to 90 &# 37; as compared to existing rate allocation techniques...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the cell coverage optimization {{problem for the}} massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink. By deploying tilt-adjustable antenna arrays at the base stations (BSs), cell coverage optimization can become a promising technique that is able to strike a compromise between covering cell-edge users and pilot contamination suppression. We formulate {{a detailed description of}} this optimization problem by maximizing the cell throughput,which is shown to bemainly determined by the user distribution within several key geometrical regions. Then, the formulated problem is applied to different example scenarios. For a network with hexagonal cells and uniformly distributed users, we derive an analytical lower bound of the ergodic throughput in the objective cell; based on this, it is shown that the optimal choice for the cell coverage should ensure that the coverage of different cells does not overlap. For a more generic network with sector- shaped cells and nonuniformly distributed users, we propose an analytical approximation of the ergodic throughput. After that, a <b>practical</b> <b>coverage</b> optimization algorithm is proposed, where the optimal solution can be easily obtained through a simple 1 -D line searching within a confined searching region.

In <b>practical</b> scenarios, cellular <b>coverage</b> is characterized with multiple overlapping layers of cells while capacity has been estimated for accommodating the highest traffic load during peak hours. However, the traffic load in cellular networks can have spatial and temporal fluctuations due to user mobility and daily variations of user activity.
