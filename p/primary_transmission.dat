2500|$|Labor unions began {{organizing}} in the broadcasting {{industry in}} the early 1930s. Among the most active of the unions was the American Radio Telegraphists Association (ARTA), later part of the CWA. ARTA organized radio operators at Mackay Radio & Telegraph in early 1934. There were two units, one for [...] "point-to-point" [...] operators on land and one for operators at sea. The point-to-point operators were organized into three divisions, covering the three major employers (Mackay Radio, Globe Wireless, and RCA). In June 1935, ARTA members in the land and marine divisions at Mackay Radio decided to coordinate their bargaining so that both groups of workers might win a contract. The talks stalled after Mackay Radio threatened to declare bankruptcy, but the union pressed ahead with its demands in September. ARTA asked for recognition of the union, a written contract, the 48-hour week, and a 14.5 percent wage increase. The ARTA members at Mackay Radio held a vote and authorized a strike if no contract was forthcoming by September 23, 1935. No agreement was reached, and the strike began at 12:01a.m. on October 5, 1935. In San Francisco, Mackay's <b>primary</b> <b>transmission</b> office on the West Coast, 60 of the 62 operators walked off the job. But the strike was far less successful elsewhere. Workers in Seattle and New York City walked out {{for only a few}} hours. In Washington, New Orleans, Chicago, and West Palm Beach, workers either did not strike or walked out in such few numbers as to make the strike ineffective. The company flew in 11 replacement workers from other offices to keep the San Francisco office functioning.|$|E

In this work, we present a novel cognitive channel access method based on learning from both <b>primary</b> channel <b>transmissions</b> and the receiver ARQ feedback signals. This new sensing-plus-confirmation scheme constitutes a non-trivial generalization of the more traditional “Listen-Before-Talk ” (LBT) strategy that merely listens to and yields to <b>primary</b> <b>transmissions</b> regardless of <b>primary</b> receiver responses. Our new method exploits the bi-directional and interactive nature of most wireless communication links to facilitate better opportunistic secondary access while achieving primary receiver protection.

The squid giant axon, which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly, is close to 1 millimetre in diameter, the size of a small pencil lead. Axonal arborization (the branching structure at the end of a nerve fiber) also differs from one nerve fiber to the next. Axons in the central nervous system typically show complex trees with many branch points. In comparison, the cerebellar granule cell axon is characterized by a single T-shaped branch node from which two parallel fibers extend. Elaborate arborization allows for the simultaneous transmission of messages to a large number of target neurons within a single region of the brain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the spectrum sharing for mobile wireless communications, where a secondary user or cognitive radio (CR) communicates {{using the same}} bandwidth originally allocated to an existing primary user link. An effective means for the CR to use to protect the <b>primary</b> <b>transmissions</b> is by applying the socalled interference-temperature constraint, whereby the resultant interference power at each primary receiver is kept below some predefined value. For the fading primary and secondary user channels, the interference-power constraint at each primary receiver is usually {{one of the following}} two types: One is to regulate the averageinterference-power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to limit the peak-interference-power (PIP) at any of the fading states. From the secondary user’s perspective, given the same (average or peak) powerconstraint value, the AIP constraint is more favorable than the PIP because of the more flexibility in dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states. However, from the perspective of protecting the <b>primary</b> user <b>transmissions,</b> the more restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than the AIP. Surprisingly, in this paper it is shown that this seemingly apparent fact is usually untrue for the <b>primary</b> user <b>transmission</b> over the fading channel. This is due to an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i. e., the randomized interference powers from the secondary transmitter in the AIP case can be in fact more advantageous for minimizing the resultant primary user capacity losses as compared to the more deterministic ones in the PIP case. Therefore, the AIP can be superior than the PIP for both the primary and secondary user transmissions...|$|R
