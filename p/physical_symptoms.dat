5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming <b>physical</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of <b>physical</b> <b>symptoms</b> specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of <b>physical</b> <b>symptoms,</b> including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{distinct}} {{trajectories of}} psychological distress over {{the first year of}} the diagnosis with breast cancer (BC) and its determinants have not been explored. Methods: 285 of 405 Chinese women receiving surgery for BC were assessed at 5 -day, 1 -month, 4 -month, and 8 -month post-surgery on measures {{of psychological distress}}, optimism, treatment decision-making (TDM) difficulties, satisfaction with treatment outcome, satisfaction with medical consultation, and <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress. Latent growth mixture modelling identified trajectories of psychological response to BC. Multinominal logistic regression compared TDM difficulties, satisfaction with treatment outcome, satisfaction with medical consultation, optimism, and <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress, by distress pattern adjusted for age, education, employment status, and stage of disease. Results: Four distinct trajectories of distress were identified, namely, resilience (66 %), chronic distress (15 %), recovered (12 %), and delayed-recovery (7 %). TDM difficulties, optimism, satisfaction with consultation, and <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress predicted distress trajectories. Psychologically resilient women had less <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress at early post-surgery compared with women with other distress patterns. Compared with the resilient group, women in the recovered or chronic distress groups experienced greater TDM difficulties, whereas women in the delayed-recovery group reported greater dissatisfaction with the initial medical consultation. Women in the chronic distress group reported greater pessimistic outlook. Conclusion: Optimism and better early post-operative treatment outcomes predicted resilience to distress. Pre-operative interventions helping women to establish a realistic expectation of treatment outcome may minimize disappointment with treatment outcome and resultant distress, whereas post-operative rehabilitation should focus on symptom management. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. postprin...|$|R
5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial <b>physical</b> <b>symptoms</b> are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited {{as general}} restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE Theory {{suggests}} that a tendency to experience distortions in somatosensory awareness is associated with <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> reporting (i. e., somatization) but empirical evidence for this is lacking. This article describes research designed to test this hypothesis. METHODS Somatosensory distortion was operationalized as the frequency of illusory touch experiences (i. e., false alarm rate) on the Somatic Signal Detection Task. Two studies correlated false alarms on this task with <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> reporting on the 15 -item Patient Health Questionnaire, the first using a nonclinical sample (n = 35), the second using a clinical sample of endoscopy patients who were identified as having either medically explained (n = 25) or medically unexplained symptoms (n = 30). RESULTS Scores on the 15 -item Patient Health Questionnaire were positively correlated with false alarm rate in both studies (r = 0. 288 - 0. 506), even after controlling for trait anxiety, depression, anxiety (standardized β range = 0. 793 - 0. 932, all p. 1). CONCLUSIONS There {{seems to be a}} robust link between <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> reporting and the tendency to experience somatosensory distortion, consistent with recent cognitive theories.

40|$|Introduction Patient-centered {{care is a}} {{recognized}} approach to enhance quality of oncological care. While most studies on supportive care needs among cancer patients focused on the time patients receiving or completing adjuvant treatment, {{little is known about}} the extent of unmet supportive care needs among cancer patients at the time awaiting surgery which is often a primary treatment for some cancer types such as breast, lung and colorectal cancer. There is growing attention in supportive care need of colorectal cancer patient in recent decades with the advocacy of holistic care. The influence of supportive care unmet need on <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> and psychological distress is being concerned as a risk factor of the distress. Meanwhile, colorectal cancer in Hong Kong are being concerned by its growing incidence. Studies often targeted on prevalence of the needs but seldom on the association between supportive care needs and <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> and psychological distress. Moreover, surgery is often the primary treatment for curative colorectal cancer. There is little known about the influence of supportive care need during the surgical phase. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of pre-surgical unmet supportive care needs among Hong Kong Chinese patients with colorectal cancer. It is hypothesized in this study that pre-surgical unmet needs influence on <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> and psychological distress at 4 -week post-surgery. Methods Quantitative study was applied to analyze data of longitudinal study in supportive care needs, <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress, and psychological distress of Chinese patient with colorectal cancer. The data was collected at Queen Mary Hospital by School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong. 503 patients were approached and 303 patients were eligible in this study. A total of 246 colorectal cancer patients provided written consent and enrolled to the longitudinal study. Primary outcomes were supportive care needs at pre-surgery, <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress and psychological distress in terms of anxiety and depression at 4 -week post-surgery. A multiple linear regression was used to analyze the influence of supportive care needs on <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> and psychological distress at 4 -week post-surgery, adjusted with participant’s baseline distress level, demographic and clinical characteristics. Results The present study showed a moderate pre-surgical unmet supportive care needs in health service and information (HSI) need with SCNS-SF 34 -C mean score of 36. 29 (95 % CI: 33. 31, 39. 27), ranging from 0 to 100. The extent of supportive care needs was small on Patient care and support (PCS) (mean score 18. 35, 95 % CI: 16. 22, 20. 48), Psychological (PSY) (mean score 11. 15, 95 % CI: 9. 34, 12. 96) and Physical and daily living (PDL) (mean score 10. 10, 95 % CI: 8. 56, 11. 69) domains. Low sexuality needs (Sex) (mean score 2. 10, 95 % CI: 0. 98, 3. 22) was observed in the present study. Furthermore, there was low level of post-surgical distress observed in this study. <b>Physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress was reported with MSAS-SF mean score 0. 42 (possible range of score 0 to 4) (95 % CI: 0. 36, 0. 48). HADS Anxiety was reported with mean score of 1. 64 (possible range of score 0 to 14) (95 % CI: 1. 26, 2. 02) and HADS depression with mean score of 2. 93 (possible range of score 0 to 14) (95 % CI: 2. 42, 3. 43). In this study, the associations between specific domains of pre-surgical supportive care unmet needs and respective 4 -week post-surgical distress were found to be significant. Greater pre-surgical unmet HSI need predicted higher post-surgical <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress (β = 0. 004, 95 % CI: 0. 002, 0. 007). The unmet need in PSY domain predicted increasing post-surgical anxiety (β = 0. 043, 95 % CI: 0. 015, 0. 071). The unmet needs in PSY (β = 0. 046, 95 % CI: 0. 008, 0. 084) and PDL domains (β = 0. 052, 95 % CI: 0. 008, 0. 097) predicted increasing post-surgical depression as well. In addition, patient characteristic of having colostomy was found to be a significant factor that increased both post-surgical <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> and psychological distress, while chemotherapy and low household monthly income were found to significantly increase post surgical depression among Hong Kong Chinese colorectal cancer patients. Conclusion Health service and information need was the most prevalent unmet need among Hong Kong Chinese patients waiting for colorectal cancer surgery. Moreover, pre-surgical supportive care unmet needs lead to greater post-surgical <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress, anxiety and depression. Therefore, provision of supportive care, in order to satisfy patient's unmet needs, should be able to relieve post-surgical distress of cancer patients. Resource, in terms of manpower, staff training, facility enhancement, service planning, electronic platform and patient information access, should be increased or reallocated in order to relieve supportive care unmet needs of colorectal cancer patients, especially in HSI, PSY and PDL domain needs. In addition, patient characteristics of having colostomy, chemotherapy and low household monthly income significantly increased post-surgical distress. Healthcare professionals should be aware of patient with those characteristics. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Between 30 % and 70 % {{of western}} women {{experience}} psychological morbidity after undergoing surgery for breast carcinoma; however, the rates and risk factors among Chinese women are unknown. Identifying at-risk women enables preventive intervention. METHODS. Among 430 Chinese {{women who were}} approached within 1 week after undergoing surgery for early-stage breast carcinoma (baseline), 405 women (94 %) completed measures of self-efficacy and psychological morbidity (the Chinese Health Questionnaire 12 -item instrument [CHQ 12]) and completed retrospective measures of treatment decision-making (TDM) difficulties, satisfaction with TDM involvement, and satisfaction with consultation and treatment outcome expectations. One-month postsurgery follow-up (follow-up), CHQ 12 scores for 367 of 405 women (91 %) were adjusted for concurrent <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress and trait optimism (the revised Chinese Life Orientation Test) and baseline predictors using stepwise multivariate regression. RESULTS. At baseline 28 % of women evidenced mild psychological morbidity, and 42 % of women evidenced moderate-to-severe psychological morbidity: At follow-up, the respective rates were 32 % and 36 %. Preferred TDM involvement was associated with lower psychological morbidity (F = 6. 702; P < 0. 001). Baseline CHQ 12 scores were predicted by outcome expectancies and TDM difficulties (adjusted regression coefficient [R 2] = 0. 192). Baseline CHQ 12 scores and follow-up chemotherapy, in turn, predicted <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress at follow-up. After adjustment, high <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress, baseline psychological morbidity, low optimism, and no chemotherapy independently predicted follow-up CHQ 12 scores (adjusted R 2 = 0. 585). CONCLUSIONS. Psychological morbidity was linked to women's TDM difficulties, their inability to anticipate treatment effects accurately, and <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> distress, possibly exacerbated by symptom misattribution. Optimizing TDM support and helping women accurately determine outcomes in terms of symptom experience and meaning and physical appearance may help to reduce psychological morbidity. Women who have TDM difficulties should {{be considered to be}} at high risk for psychological distress. © 2004 American Cancer Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a {{group of}} rare genetic {{lysosomal}} disorders with progressive multisystem involvement. An MPS-specific <b>physical</b> <b>symptom</b> scale was developed and introduced a <b>Physical</b> <b>Symptom</b> Score (PSS) to quantify the somatic disease burden across MPS I, II and VI. Hypothesis: Somatic burden of disease in patients with attenuated MPS I, II and VI {{as measured by the}} PSS will be positively associated with age and negatively associated with neuropsychological functions [i. e. full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and attention]. Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with attenuated MPS I (n =  24), II (n =  14), and VI (n =  10) aged 6 to 32  years on enzyme replacement therapy who were enrolled in “Longitudinal Studies of Brain Structure and Functions in MPS Disorders” across seven centers. Somatic disease burden was measured by the PSS. Neuropsychological functions were measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA). Results: PSS was positively associated with age in attenuated MPS I (P <  0. 001), MPS II (P <  0. 01) and MPS VI (P <  0. 05). There was a negative association of PSS with FSIQ in attenuated MPS I (P <  0. 001) and in MPS VI (P <  0. 001) but not with MPS II. Although attention scores were below average in all groups, a significant negative association between PSS and one measures of sustained attention (TOVA d prime) was found only in MPS VI. Conclusions: <b>Physical</b> <b>Symptom</b> Score increased with age in attenuated MPS I, II and VI, reflecting progressive somatic burden of disease despite treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, the association of increased somatic disease burden with decreased neurocognitive ability suggests that both measures reflect disease severity and are not independent...|$|R
