Methods: In order to establish a social isolation model, the experimental animals were kept in individual cages, starting from 21 days of age till adulthood. The socially isolated rats, which were reared under standard and enriched environmental conditions, were administered with MK- 801 (between days 20 - 30 after birth for a period of 10 days at a dose of 0. 25 mg/kg body weight, twice a day, by subcutaneous route). As from 3 months of age, the behavior of the adult rats was assessed using the open-field test, light-dark preference test and the elevated plus-maze test. Results: In the open-field test, it was observed that the frequency of rearing, considered as exploratory behavior, has increased significantly in the group administered with physiological saline and isolated under enriched <b>physical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> compared to the group isolated under standard <b>physical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (p< 0. 01). In the elevated plus-maze test, the duration of the period the animals remained in the open arm has shortened in the group, which was administered with physiological saline and isolated under enriched <b>physical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> in comparison to the animals exposed to standard <b>physical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Energy {{and carbon}} balance {{implications}} of representing vegetation using a composite or mosaic approach {{in a land}} surface scheme are investigated. In the composite approach the attributes of different plant functional types (PFTs) present in a grid cell are aggregated in some fashion for energy and water balance calculations. The resulting <b>physical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (including net radiation, soil moisture and soil temperature) are common to all PFTs and affect their ecosystem processes. In the mosaic approach energy and water balance calculations are performed separately for each PFT tile using its own vegetation attributes, so each PFT "sees" different <b>physical</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and its carbon balance evolves somewhat differently from that in the composite approach. Simulations are performed at selected boreal, temperate and tropical locations to illustrate the differences caused by using the composite versus mosaic approaches of representing vegetation. These idealized simulations use 50 % fractional coverage {{for each of the}} two dominant PFTs in a grid cell. Differences in simulated grid averaged primary energy fluxes at selected sites are generally less than 5 % between the two approaches. Simulated grid-averaged carbon fluxes and pool sizes at these sites can, however, differ by as much as 46 %.

These gestures offer varying levels of support under different conditions, making some gestures more or less suitable for different settings. While these ges-tures offer a rich space for designing communicative behaviors for robots, {{a better understanding of how}} different deictic gestures affect communication under different conditions is critical for achieving effective human-robot interaction.
