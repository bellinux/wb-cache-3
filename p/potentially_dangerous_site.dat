This is because invariably, 2 ̆ 2 culture 2 ̆ 2 cannot do the work policy makers {{would like it to}} do, and its invocation within policy spheres usually already signals a kind of developmental distress, a perceived need for retooling through a form of social engineering. In other words, 2 ̆ 2 culture 2 ̆ 2 (in the anthropological sense) reflects and shapes, yet cannot in and of itself solve the most pressing challenges facing Jamaica today...|$|E
40|$|International audienceForest {{management}} in mountainous regions implies sylvicultural interventions on slopes. But in such forested areas, engines, workers or falling trees can initiate rock falls {{and the site}} can temporarily turn to a <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>site.</b> This presentation deals with a type of fence specifically developed for this context. In particular, this type of fence requires no heavy interventions neither than heavy engines such as for soil-moving or nailing. Moreover, it is a temporary structure, supposed to act {{for the duration of}} the interventions or as long as it is necessary to counterbalance the lack of protection within the growing period of the trees. The fence is composed of a wire mesh, three cables and two rigid rods. This fence is tightened between existing trees. The first real size experiments have been made during summer 2008. It consisted in impacting successively the fence in its centre with rocks of varying mass (from 30 kg to 500 kg) with the aim of evaluating its capacities. For this purpose, a cable was tightened between two trees. This cable allowed conveying a trolley supporting the rock. The rock was dropped just before the impact thanks to a snap shackle. The system allowed reaching a maximal rock velocity before impact of 17 m/s. This velocity was calculated thanks to image analysis obtained with a numerical video camera and a numerical high speed camera. The main continuous measurement made was tension in the upper cable. In addition, an accelerometer was nailed on one of the fence supporting trees. A total of 17 impact experiments were performed on for different fences. The first results showed that (i) angular blocks can cut wires even for low mass rocks, (ii) the wire rupture hardly propagates in the mesh during another impact, (iii) supporting cables can be cut during the impact, (iv) the fence is not perforated by the direct impact even for rocks 500 kg in mass, and (v) a reparation of a perforated mesh consisting in placing a patch is perfectly efficient. In parallel to these experiments, numerical simulations were performed based on the discrete element model developed by Bertrand (2008). It has allowed the estimation of the relevance of some technical options. The results obtained are encouraging and should lead to the development of efficient low energy fences to be used on forested slopes...|$|E
40|$|Many {{problems}} have been identified with the education of Gypsy and Traveller pupils in schools (Bhopal, 2004; Warrington, 2007). Generally these have been articulated by policy makers, educational professionals and academics about Gypsies and Travellers communities; however, {{there is also a}} body of work that details Gypsy and Traveller families’ concerns about their children’s education (Acton, 2004; Dean, 2007). Underachievement and poor attendance issues in particular have caused concern for education policy makers since publication of the Plowden report in 1967 (Plowden, 1967; Bhopal et al, 2000). As a result the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has produced a number of publications aimed at raising the achievement and attainment of Gypsy and Traveller pupils (DfEE, 1999; DfES 2003; 2006). Common concerns for Gypsy and Traveller parents include fears their children will encounter racism and bullying at schools, fears around safety including using public transport, going on school trips or taking part in PE lessons, and engagement with culturally sensitive subjects such as sex education (Bhopal et al, 2000; Clark and Greenfields, 2006). Many Gypsy and Traveller parents also feel their children do not receive the quality of education they are entitled to; sometimes reflecting the failure of schools to deliver a culturally appropriate curriculum and sometimes suggesting schools do not deliver educational provision of the same quality received by non-Gypsy and Traveller children (Bhopal and Myers, 2008). Whilst it is apparent that there has been an increase in the numbers of Gypsy and Traveller children attending schools, {{it is also clear that}} over the last fifty years many Gypsy and Traveller children have not attended school. In most research undertaken about Gypsy and Traveller children’s expectations of education since the 1960 ’s there are accounts of the bullying and racism they have faced (Liegeois, 1987; Reiss, 1975). This has been a consistent cause for families not to send their children to school. To date these issues have not been fully addressed and still reflect much that is commonplace despite continuing efforts to improve practice in schools (DfES, 2003, 2006). Therefore a management of the danger in ways that result in Gypsy and Traveller children feeling that going to school is safe, even if it is understood within a context of the school being a <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>site,</b> is a positive development if the intention is to improve Gypsy and Traveller children’s educational outcomes. The perception of the school environment in this light in many ways reflects the context of Gypsy and Traveller lives and their relations with wider society. Within this context, this paper will explore the most common problem identified by researchers as to the reasons why parents do not want to send their children to school – that of racism. The research will draw upon in-depth interviews conducted in one primary and one secondary school in an inner London borough. Both of the schools were the main receiving schools for the local Gypsy and Traveller population. Close to the schools is a local council run Gypsy and Traveller site which has been in the area for over 50 years. Interviews were conducted with heads, teachers, learning support assistants, parents and pupils. Despite race equality polices being in place in both schools, many of the pupils reported having experienced racism and these experiences not being taken seriously by teachers. One of the respondents indicated, ‘What about us? People don’t think anyone can be racist to us because we’re white. Those black people have their colour to show, what do we have?’ Many of the teachers also revealed overt racist attitudes towards Gypsy and Traveller pupils and indicated that Gypsy and Traveller children used their ethnicity as an ‘excuse’ so that they did not have to conform to school rules. Despite race equality policies being present in both schools, Gypsy and Traveller continued to experience overt racism and many parents felt such racism was not dealt with effectively and not given the same attention as racism experienced by non-white groups. Drawing upon this research, the paper will address the following questions: 1. 	How is white racism defined by Gypsy and Traveller groups? 2. 	How do schools deal with the racism experienced by Gypsy and Traveller groups and how does this in turn affect the educational experience of these groups? 3. 	Do what extent are Gypsies and Travellers ‘othered’ within schools? <br/...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{identified}} new hierarchical relationships within international society. However, few scholars {{have provided a}} satisfactory account of what informs their formation, reproduction or constitutional effects for international society. We argue that underpinning {{the emergence of a}} more hierarchical international society is a new social logic of risk, which constructs illiberal and/or fragile states as <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites</b> of instability and disorder that pose particular security risks for Western states. We proceed to argue that such risk-based hierarchies are transformative of both inter-state and intra-state relations, by stripping equal political agency from ‘risky’ actors within and without the state. We demonstrate these claims by drawing on examples of international state building in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} reduce otter () road {{mortality}} and to predict accident sites, we assessed the localities of traffic accidents involving otters in the Uckermark County, Brandenburg, Northeast Germany. Eighty-eight otter accident sites from the years 1990 to 2003 [...] as recorded by the (Brandenburg State Office for Environment) [...] were categorised according to traffic and road patterns, otter habitat suitability, as well as presence and type of watercourse crossings. From these numerical data, we {{compiled a list of}} characteristics to identify other <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites</b> where otter road traffic accidents are likely to occur using a geographic information system. With a principal component analysis, we categorised three groups of accident sites. Firstly, most otter road accidents were located close to either one or two lakes. Secondly, otters were frequently killed at places where no body of water occurred within a distance of 200  m to the road. Thirdly, and in contrast to other locations, in the Uckermark County, fewest accidents happened where a road crossed a watercourse. Mitigation measures were suggested and discussed for the recorded and potential accident sites...|$|R
40|$|Open accessRapid {{technological}} development is inevitably associated with many environmental problems which primarily include pollution of soil, water and air. In many cases, {{the presence of}} contamination is difficult to assess. It is {{even more difficult to}} evaluate its potential danger to the environment and humans. Despite the existence of several whole organism-based and cell-based models of sensing pollution and evaluation of toxicity and mutagenicity, there is no ideal system that allows one to make a quick and cheap assessment. In this respect, transgenic organisms that can be intentionally altered to be more sensitive to particular pollutants are especially promising. Transgenic plants represent an ideal system, since they can be grown at the site of pollution or <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>sites.</b> Plants are ethically more acceptable and esthetically more appealing than animals as sensors of environmental pollution. In this review, we will discuss various transgenic plant-based models that have been successfully used for biomonitoring genotoxic pollutants. We will also discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of these systems and describe some novel ideas for the future generation of efficient transgenic phytosensors. Ye...|$|R
