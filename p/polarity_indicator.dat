40|$|A spectroscopic method, {{based on}} the {{interface}} selectivity of second-harmonic generation, is used to obtain the polarity of liquid interfaces. In this paper the second-harmonic measurement of the spectrum of the <b>polarity</b> <b>indicator</b> molecule N,N′-diethyl-p-nitroaniline (DEPNA) at the air/water interface demonstrates the method. Two different approaches are {{used to measure the}} intramolecular charge transfer (CT) absorption band position of DEPNA at the air/water interface. The DEPNA CT band blue-shifts from 429 nm in bulk water (polar solvent) to 359 nm in bulk hexane (nonpolar solvent) and 329 nm in the gas phase (no solvent). At the air/water interface, the charge transfer peak band maximum occurs at 373 nm, which indicates that the polarity of the air/water interface is {{similar to those of the}} bulk solvents carbon tetrachloride and butyl ether. The DEPNA results together with the results from another solvatochromic <b>polarity</b> <b>indicator</b> molecule, ET-(30), which will be reported elsewhere, show that the polarity results of the air/water interface are general. 1...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{polarity}} scales {{have been}} of great value in advancing our understanding of chemical and physical processes in bulk solvents. However, {{an understanding of the}} polarity at liquid interfaces has been more elusive and no scale of interface polarity currently exists. Following our demonstration that second harmonic spectroscopy can be used to measure interface polarity, we have determined the polarity of several liquid/ liquid and vapor/liquid interfaces. The polarities of the water/ 1, 2 -dichloroethane and water/chlorobenzene interfaces have been investigated using the <b>polarity</b> <b>indicator</b> molecule N,N-diethyl-p-nitroaniline (DEPNA). The betaine dye 4 -(2, 4, 6 -triphenylpyridinium) - 2, 6 -diphenylphenoxide, (ET(30)), was used to probe the polarity of the air/water interface. The intramolecular charge transfer (CT) absorption band positions of both DEPNA and ET(30) are measured and used to define the interface solvent polarity. An important finding is that the polarity of the liquid interfaces is simply related to the polarity of the bulk phases. The interface polarity is found to be equal to the arithmetic average of the polarity of the adjoining bulk phases. This surprisingly simple result suggests the possible dominance of the long-range solute-solvent interactions, not the local interface interactions, in determining the difference in the excited- and ground-state solvation energies of the interface adsorbed molecules. 1...|$|E

40|$|A polarity-coincidence {{detector}} with biased <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators</b> (biased hard limiters) is {{studied to}} determine the effects of the bias on the detector output mean value, output variance, and output signal-to-noise power ratio. The mean value of the detector output is derived for the case of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with arbitrary spectra for the signal and noise. The mean value is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise power ratio, and as a function of the biases in the input channel and the reference channel <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators.</b> It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output mean value. The variance of the defector output is derived for the cage of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with RC low-pass spectra for signal and noise, for small input signal-to-noise power ratios only. The variance is expressed as a function of the biases in the input channel and reference channel <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators,</b> and as a function of the input signal-to-noise band-width radio. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output variance. The output signal-to-noise power ratio (the square of the output mean divided by the output variance) is derived for both an ideal polarity-coincidence detector (no bias) and for a biased polarity-coincidence detector. The output signal-to-noise power ratio is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise power ratio, the biases in the input channel and the reference channel <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators,</b> and input signal-to-noise band-width ratio, for small input signal-to-noise power ratios only. It is shown that the output signal-to-noise power ratio of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of a correlation detector. When the input signal-to-noise band-width ratio is unity, the degradation is about 1. 4 db. The degradation increases to about 2. 2 db. when the input signal-to noise band-width ratio becomes either very small or very large. It is also shown that the output signal-to-noise power ratio of a biased polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector. A simple expression for the degradation is presented. Limits on the biases are given, such that when the biases are smaller than these limits, the degradation of the output signal-to-noise power ratio is negligible...|$|R
40|$|ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOUR OF SOLVATOCHROMIC COMPOUNDS IN HETEROGENEOUS MICROENVIRONMENTS Various new solvatochromic dyes (molecules {{that change}} colour {{according}} to the environment they are in, {{and for that reason}} are used as <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators)</b> were prepared. This property was used to determine how these dyes in water interacted with cyclodextrins, which are large molecules acting as “hosts”, hosting many organic compounds in their cavity. It was thus possible to determine in detail how is this dye family inserted in the cyclodextrin cavity. These results, published in four different specialized international journals, are the first to be ever obtained on this type of interaction between cyclodextrins and an important and popular family of solvatochromic dyes: pyridiniophenolates.

40|$|Twitter {{sentiment}} analysis or {{the task of}} automatically retrieving opinions from tweets has received an increasing interest from the web mining community. This is due to its importance {{in a wide range}} of fields such as business and politics. People express sentiments about specific topics or entities with different strengths and intensities, where these sentiments are strongly related to their personal feelings and emotions. A number of methods and lexical resources have been proposed to analyze sentiment from natural language texts, addressing different opinion dimensions. In this article, we propose an approach for boosting Twitter sentiment classification using different sentiment dimensions as meta-level features. We combine aspects such as opinion strength, emotion and <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators,</b> generated by existing {{sentiment analysis}} methods and resources. Our research shows that the combination of sentiment dimensions provides significant improvement in Twitter sentiment classification tasks such as polarity and subjectivity...|$|R
5000|$|This {{leads to}} an {{alternative}} set of symbols for basic gates that use the opposite core symbol (AND or OR) but with the inputs and outputs negated. Use of these alternative symbols can make logic circuit diagrams much clearer and help to show accidental connection of an active high output to an active low input or vice versa. Any connection that has logic negations at both ends can {{be replaced by a}} negationless connection and a suitable change of gate or vice versa. Any connection that has a negation at one end and no negation at the other can be made easier to interpret by instead using the De Morgan equivalent symbol at either of the two ends. When negation or <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators</b> on both ends of a connection match, there is no logic negation in that path (effectively, bubbles [...] "cancel"), making it easier to follow logic states from one symbol to the next. This is commonly seen in real logic diagrams - thus the reader must not get into the habit of associating the shapes exclusively as OR or AND shapes, but also take into account the bubbles at both inputs and outputs {{in order to determine the}} [...] "true" [...] logic function indicated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Isolated microspores of B. napus {{in culture}} change their {{developmental}} pathway from gametophytic to sporophyt-ic and form embryo-like structures (ELS) upon prolonged heat shock treatment (5 days at 32 °C). ELS express polarity {{during the initial}} days of endosporic development. In this study, we focussed on the analysis of polarity development of ELS without suspensor. Fluorescence microscopy and 3 -D confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) without tissue interfering enabled us {{to get a good}} insight in the distribution of nuclei, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the architecture of microtubular (MT) cytoskeleton and the places of 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation in successive stages of microspore embryogenesis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed, for the first time, the appearance of a fibrillar extracellular matrix-like structure (ECM-like struc-ture) in androgenic embryos without suspensor. Two types of endosporic development were distinguished based upon the initial location of the microspore nucleus. The polarity of dividing and growing cells was recognized by the differential distributions of organelles, by the organization of the MT cytoskeleton and by the visualization of DNA synthesis in the cell cycle. The directional location of nuclei, ER, mito-chondria and starch grains in relation to theMTs configurations were early <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators.</b> Both exine rupture and ECM-like structure on the outer surfaces of ELS are supposed to stabilize ELS's morphological polarity. As the role of cell polarity during early endosporic microspore embryogenesis in apical–basal cell fate determination remains unclear, micro-spore culture system provides a powerful in vitro tool for studying the developmental processes that take place during the earliest stages of plant embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop a simple means of {{estimating}} the cosolvent/water solubility profile using just the available properties (logKow, dielectric constant etc.) of the solute, cosolvent and water. Ethanol was used as the model cosolvent. One of the most commonly used <b>polarity</b> <b>indicators</b> is the octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow). Numerous programs are used to predict the logKow. The calculated values of logKow from three of the most commonly used programs ClogPÂ®, ACD/logPdbÂ® and KowWinÂ® were compared to experimental values. It was found that all three programs have a user friendly interface but ClogP appears to be more accurate. While the ethanol/water solubility profiles of very polar and very non-polar drugs are monotonic, many semi-polar drugs show a maximum solubility at an ethanol volume fraction (fmax) between zero and one. A new empirical function that describes this deviation from linearity was applied to the experimental data forfifty-one compounds. The proposed model was a more accurate predictor of the co-solvent solubility profile than a general third order polynomial with the samenumber of parameters. The fmax value was also accurately predicted from the first derivative of the model. A sigmoidal relationship was observed between the value of fmax and logKow of the solute. Combining this sigmoidal relationship with the previously reportedlinear relationship between logKow and the initial slope of the plot of log solubility vs. ethanol composition enables the estimation of the totalethanol/water solubility profiles of semi-polar compounds from just logKow. A new bilinear function was also introduced to address the deviation from linearity. This model accounts for both the initial and terminal slopes in theethanol/water solubility profiles of semi-polar solutes. The proposed model is dependent only on logKow and an empirical constant that is cosolvent specific. It is also more accurate than the log-linear model and a general parabolic model. A solubility case study using Antalarmin, a novel stress inhibitor was performed. This study illustrates the use of cosolvents as solubility enhancers as well as pH,surfactants, complexants and lipid based systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial activity of Wuyiencin fractions with different <b>polarities</b> against six <b>indicator</b> microorganisms: Rhodotorula rubra, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Cladosporium fulvum and Staphylococcus aureus. The fermentation broth of Wuyiencin was submitted to AB- 8 macroporous adsorptive resin and fractionated with solvents of different polarity. The fraction eluted with water had remarkably antimicrobial activity against all the microorganisms investigated except for C. fulvum and S. aureus (MIC ≤ 0. 0625 mg/mL), probably due to the presence of active components. The fraction eluted with methanol showed potential antimicrobial activity against all the test microorganisms except for R. rubra, with MIC values of 0. 5 and 2 mg/mL. In conclusion, fractions eluted with water and methanol, respectively, represent the main active-part of Wuyiencin, and could be emphasized for agricultural applications in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Recent {{research}} suggests that a maximum rate of lightning strikes occurs at least 15 to 20 minutes prior to tornado formation within a supercell storm. These maxima are associated with strengthening updrafts as they appear in radar measurements. An increase in lightning rates correlates with an increase of shear in {{the lower part of}} the storm. In combination with a strong updraft or downdraft, this shear can provide the ingredients for rotation and possibly a tornado. Polarity reversal of lightning around the time of tornado touchdown also has been examined. Thus, increasing lightning flash rates and reversal of lightning strike <b>polarity</b> are potential <b>indicators</b> of possible tornado formation. This research examines these findings by conducting a GIS analysis of tornado and lightning data from a severe storm event on 9 May 2006, which occurred near the rural town of Anna, Texas. This storm produced several tornadoes ranging from F 0 to F 3. The lightning data show three distinct patterns in the 50 minutes prior to the first reported tornado touchdown, which include an increase in lightning strikes, an increase in the percent of positive polarity strikes, and a spatial concentration of strikes prior to touchdown along the path of the tornado. As the study of lightning signatures becomes more refined, forecasters can use real time lightning data to compliment radar signatures in an effort to predict tornado development in severe storms...|$|R
