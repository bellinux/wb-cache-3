25|$|The United States Department of Defense removed {{seventeen}} {{soldiers and}} officers from duty, and eleven soldiers {{were charged with}} dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It is reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to them being in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” as he talked of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time,</b> and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Kevin Wetmore {{noted the}} film's {{portrayal}} of {{violence as a}} reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: [...] "Death is a random act in post-9/11 horror—the result of being in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time,</b> as the cliché goes. Unlike in eighties slasher horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, having premarital sex are often forerunners to being killed by the killer(s); , death is random and unrelated to one's behavior." ...|$|E

500|$|While Lillian and Victor Cordero {{had done}} their jobs well (before hiring them, Baird had made several {{attempts}} to employ U.S. citizens, but none had worked out), on January 22 the INS said {{it sought to}} question them and very likely deport them. [...] The couple had previously separated and {{were about to be}} divorced. [...] Lillian Cordero agreed to leave the country and return to Peru, under a 30-day [...] "voluntary departure" [...] program. [...] Victor Cordero first went into hiding, hoping to stay in the country; his lawyer said {{he had been in the}} wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> and that, [...] "He doesn't understand why he's being singled out." [...] But by January 29, he too had voluntarily left the U.S. for Peru. [...] Neither of them ever appeared in the media. Although illegal domestics were rarely deported unless they had been involved in crimes, [...] the INS maintained that the couple were treated no differently than any other illegal aliens who were brought to their attention.|$|E
2500|$|In {{times of}} war, natural disaster, {{societal}} collapse, {{or in the}} absence of an established system of criminal justice, there may be increased incidences of extrajudicial punishment. In such circumstances, police or military personnel may be unofficially authorised to punish severely individuals involved in looting, rioting and other violent acts, especially if caught in flagrante delicto. [...] This position is sometimes itself corrupted, resulting in the death of merely inconvenient persons, that is, relative innocents who are just in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Over 1,000 people {{attended}} a vigil in commemoration of Morley's life at St Anne's Church, Soho on 5 November 2004. Speeches were given by his friends, {{and one on}} behalf of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Those who could not get into the church due to overcrowding stood in the street with candles. Morley's friend said, [...] "This is the second time he was in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time,</b> but {{for all of us here}} today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts." [...] Livingstone said, [...] "David Morley was well known and well loved in London's lesbian and gay community." ...|$|E

Raban criticised some [...] "notably talentless" [...] dialogue writing, [...] "Perhaps Begg really did strike up a warm relationship with soldier Jennifer … but only in bad fiction do people speak this way". Finally concluding [...] "There can be no doubt about the reality of the predicament described by Moazzam Begg … the indiscriminate dragnet thrown out by the United States … brought in a catch that included many bystanders who {{happened to be in the}} wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time,</b> and whose single common denominator was that they were Muslims" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} series {{differs from the}} film versions in one fundamental aspect: Nikita (Peta Wilson) is innocent. She is not a killer, nor a drug user, just a homeless young woman in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b> Section One —an elite, top-secret counter-terrorism organization— sets Nikita up {{to be accused of}} murdering a police officer and {{sentenced to life in prison}} where she supposedly commits suicide and is brought into Section One. Because Nikita will be killed (or [...] "cancelled") if she fails to comply, she is forced to carry out the organization's ruthless methods of fighting terrorism, while attempting to keep her moral integrity intact. This personal struggle becomes the primary conflict of the series. A key scene in the two theatrical films involves Nikita's first assignment —to murder a VIP in a crowded restaurant. Although the Nikita of the {{television series}} eventually does become, by necessity, a ruthless killer, in the television version of this first mission she uses her ingenuity to avoid having to kill the VIP (whereas the film versions of the character complete the assignment). However, despite the machinations of others in power around her, Nikita retains her compassion and humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b> Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came down on me. The activism that goes on online is [...] important." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pryor's {{involvement}} in this incident is dramatized as a subplot in the 2015 film Bridge of Spies, {{in which he is}} portrayed by Will Rogers with Tom Hanks as Donovan. Pryor was [...] "simply <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time," [...] he says. Pryor praised the movie but mentioned that the filmmakers [...] "took a lot of liberties with it".|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the {{warrants}} issued against him, he still lives freely in Moscow, according to the FBI. As to Mogilevich himself, government law enforcement agencies from throughout the world had by then been trying to prosecute him for over 10 years. But he had, {{in the words of}} one journalist, [...] "a knack for never being in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time".|$|R
50|$|The next morning, {{while making}} a {{delivery}} to the Calcasieu Parish jail, Nonc asks to see Marnie, who he reckons could be imprisoned there. Under {{the guise of}} being her brother, they meet. She explains {{that she was a}} victim of being in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time; her boyfriend Allen was the real offender. Before he leaves the jail, he lets Marnie and Geronimo embrace once more.|$|R
2500|$|The {{longevity}} {{of the war}} has engendered a strong isolationism in the Ishgardian government which filters down into the attitude of her people. Ishgard withdrew from the first Eorzean Alliance and declined {{to participate in the}} second, being preoccupied with their own war effort. This isolationism also manifests itself in a fanatic persecution of [...] "heretics", i.e., anyone accused of consorting or sympathizing with dragons. In the lead-up to the events of the expansion, Nidhogg, who had been dormant for some time, bellows a great roar to rally the dragon horde to renew their assault on Ishgard. The player's character—an adventurer hailed as a Warrior of Light for fending off the Garlean invasion—comes into the good graces of Ser Aymeric, Lord Commander of the Temple Knights, for the defense of Ishgard during one such attack. When the player is caught at the wrong <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> during a coup attempt in Ul'dah, the hero flees to Ishgard for asylum from the charge of regicide with Alphinaud and Tataru, the only remnants of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to escape the fiasco. Nidhogg's roar prompts a change in both sides of the conflict—Aymeric and Count Edmont of House Fortemps open Ishgard's gates to outsiders {{for the first time in}} years on the pretext of aiding the war effort. Meanwhile, Lady Iceheart grows her band of heretics and Estinien, the current Azure Dragoon, comes out of hiding in search of his archenemy, Nidhogg.|$|E
