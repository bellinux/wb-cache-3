5|$|During the Second World War, Johann Georg Otto Schick {{designed}} {{a series of}} patterns such as Platanenmuster (plane tree <b>pattern)</b> and erbsenmuster (pea-dot <b>pattern)</b> for the Waffen-SS, combining micro- and macro-patterns in one scheme.|$|E
5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity <b>pattern</b> A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity <b>pattern</b> and the one that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity <b>pattern</b> B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity <b>pattern</b> C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity <b>pattern</b> D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|However, floral synapomorphy (shared characteristics) is rare {{since most}} {{conform to the}} general monocot <b>pattern.</b> This <b>pattern</b> is ancestral (plesiomorphic) for the lilioid monocots. Structural monosymmetry is rare, except for Orchidaceae.|$|E

Figure  1 b shows induced mined tree <b>patterns,</b> embedded <b>patterns</b> and non-redundant homomorphic <b>patterns.</b> Figure  1 b includes the largest <b>patterns</b> that can be mined in each category. As one can see, the shown embedded <b>patterns</b> are not induced <b>patterns,</b> and the shown homomorphic <b>patterns</b> are neither embedded nor induced <b>patterns.</b> Further, the homomorphic <b>patterns</b> are larger {{than all the other}} <b>patterns.</b>|$|R

50|$|Creational design <b>patterns</b> {{are further}} {{categorized}} into Object-creational <b>patterns</b> and Class-creational <b>patterns,</b> where Object-creational <b>patterns</b> deal with Object creation and Class-creational <b>patterns</b> deal with Class-instantiation. In greater details, Object-creational <b>patterns</b> defer {{part of its}} object creation to another object, while Class-creational <b>patterns</b> defer its object creation to subclasses.|$|R
5|$|Many {{military}} camouflage patterns {{since the}} 1940s have been disruptively coloured, {{and with the}} issue of US Woodland <b>pattern</b> to United States armed forces from 1981, disruptive <b>pattern</b> became a dominant feature of military uniforms. From 1969, Disruptive <b>Pattern</b> Material (DPM) began to replace plain material for uniforms in the British Armed Forces and was later used by many other armies.|$|E
5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} a <b>pattern</b> {{in which the}} cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a <b>pattern</b> that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the <b>pattern</b> stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the <b>pattern</b> stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial <b>pattern</b> stabilizes (more slowly) to a <b>pattern</b> that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E
5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of <b>pattern</b> design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage <b>Pattern</b> (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low <b>pattern</b> contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the <b>pattern</b> geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage <b>Pattern,</b> a non-pixellated <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways to categorize attack <b>patterns.</b> One way is to group them into general categories, such as: Architectural, Physical, and External (see details below). Another way of categorizing attack <b>patterns</b> is to group them by a specific technology or type of technology (e.g. database attack <b>patterns,</b> web application attack <b>patterns,</b> network attack <b>patterns,</b> etc. or SQL Server attack <b>patterns,</b> Oracle Attack <b>Patterns,</b> [...]Net attack <b>patterns,</b> Java attack <b>patterns,</b> etc.) ...|$|R
30|$|NFPA 921 further lists {{that fire}} <b>patterns</b> can be {{classified}} by their generation or causal relationship to the fire dynamics by providing the following classes: plume-generated <b>patterns,</b> ventilation-generated <b>patterns,</b> hot gas layer-generated <b>patterns,</b> full-room involvement-generated <b>patterns</b> and suppression-generated <b>patterns</b> (NFPA 2014).|$|R
50|$|Memory <b>patterns</b> {{are already}} <b>patterned</b> by quadruple <b>patterning</b> for NAND and crossed quadruple/double <b>patterning</b> for DRAM. These <b>patterning</b> {{techniques}} are self-aligned {{and do not}} require custom cutting or trim masks. For 2x-nm DRAM and flash, double <b>patterning</b> techniques should be sufficient.|$|R
5|$|The {{eastern edge}} of the Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} is marked by Locust Mountain and Vulcan Hill. The southern edge is formed by Broad Mountain, Fisher Ridge, and Line Mountain. The northern edge is formed by Little Mountain, Locust Mountain, and Mahanoy Mountain. The drainage system of the watershed is a trellis <b>pattern,</b> a dentritic <b>pattern,</b> or an angular drainage <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>pattern</b> {{that the}} line-ending words follow is often {{explained}} if the numbers 1 to 6 {{are allowed to}} stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its <b>pattern</b> based upon a bottom-up pairing of {{the lines of the}} preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that the <b>pattern</b> for the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza.|$|E
5|$|When {{the force}} marched west in 1873, it brought twenty-five British Army 1868 <b>pattern</b> lances {{along on the}} {{expedition}} to impress the Blackfoot First Nation. The force also used swords, with the 1822 <b>pattern</b> British Light Cavalry sabre approved for commissioned officers, and the non-commissioned officers carrying the British 1853 <b>pattern</b> weapon; some constables unofficially equipped themselves with swords, despite Commissioner French having doubts about their utility. The policy around the carrying of these weapons was reviewed in 1880, due to concerns that swords were no longer practical in conflicts with the First Nations. Commissioner Irvine wanted to equip all of his force with swords for use in close quarter combat, while the authorities in Ottawa were opposed to any extension; as a compromise, some 1822 <b>pattern</b> swords were purchased for storage in the police armouries. In 1882, non-commissioned officers were authorised to carry the 1822 <b>pattern</b> sabre, and commissioned police officers adopted the new British 1896 <b>pattern</b> cavalry sword when it was issued a few years later. The mounted police deployed to Siberia {{at the end of}} the First World War carried the 1908 <b>pattern</b> cavalry sword.|$|E
50|$|Several {{extensions}} to {{the above}} set of workflow <b>patterns</b> have been proposed. In particular, the same research groups that developed these <b>patterns,</b> have also proposed a set of Workflow Data <b>Patterns,</b> Workflow Resource <b>Patterns,</b> Workflow Exception Handling <b>Patterns,</b> and Service Interaction <b>Patterns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{software}} engineering, behavioral design <b>patterns</b> are design <b>patterns</b> {{that identify}} common communication <b>patterns</b> between objects and realize these <b>patterns.</b> By doing so, these <b>patterns</b> increase flexibility {{in carrying out}} this communication.|$|R

5|$|When {{the general}} flow <b>pattern</b> buckles from a zonal <b>pattern</b> to the meridional <b>pattern,</b> a slower {{movement}} in a north or southward direction is more likely. Meridional flow patterns feature strong, amplified troughs and ridges, generally with more northerly and southerly flow.|$|E
5|$|A one-vertex crease <b>pattern</b> {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the <b>pattern.)</b> Each crease must be folded, but the <b>pattern</b> does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E

5|$|Konami, who had {{distributed}} the original Q*bert to Japanese arcades in 1983, produced {{a game with}} the title Q*bert for MSX computers in 1986, released in Japan and Europe. However, the main character is a little dragon, and the mechanics are based on Q*bert's Qubes. The player once again turns around colored cubes by jumping from cube to cube, {{trying to reach the}} displayed target <b>pattern.</b> Contrary to Mylstar's arcade game, each of the 50 stages has a different <b>pattern</b> of cubes, in addition to the known rule extensions in later stages. The game also features a competitive 2-player mode, where each side is assigned a different <b>pattern,</b> and the players can score points either by completing their <b>pattern</b> first, or by pushing the other off the board.|$|E

30|$|For the {{appropriate}} design of ArchReco we have introduced {{a number of}} ontologies for modelling the Design <b>Patterns</b> and the contextual elements in a uniformed way. A few years ago, {{the most commonly used}} designed <b>patterns</b> were the GoF Design <b>Patterns</b> (Gamma et al. 1995), which are still the fundamental Design <b>Patterns</b> that software engineers use. Over the last few years, Design <b>Patterns</b> became a common practice for several companies and individual engineers developed new Design <b>Patterns</b> and categorized them according to the domain the <b>patterns</b> are applied to. For example, repositories such as the yahoo ([URL] repository of Design <b>Patterns</b> for the UI/UX domain contain a number of <b>patterns</b> that can be applied in web based interfaces. Additionally, there are specific Design <b>Patterns</b> related to Data collection, Web Services, Mobile development and several other domain specific Design <b>Patterns.</b>|$|R
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change <b>pattern</b> in eight seconds. They were able to match the <b>pattern</b> of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing <b>pattern</b> is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its <b>pattern</b> to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
5|$|Metrical rhythm {{generally}} involves precise {{arrangements of}} stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the <b>pattern</b> of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English {{is most often}} founded on the <b>pattern</b> of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical <b>pattern</b> involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a <b>pattern</b> present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The <b>pattern</b> is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic <b>pattern</b> of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{important}} issues in data mining is the interestingness problem. This problem is described as finding the interesting <b>patterns</b> from {{a large number of}} discovered <b>patterns.</b> Typically, in a data mining application, it is all too easy to discover a huge number of <b>patterns.</b> Most of these <b>patterns</b> are actually useless or uninteresting to the user. But due to the huge number of <b>patterns,</b> it is difficult for a user to comprehend all the <b>patterns</b> and to identify those interesting to him/her. To prevent the user from being overwhelmed by the large number of <b>patterns,</b> techniques are needed to analyze and to rank the <b>patterns</b> according to their interestingness. This paper proposes such a technique. It performs post-analysis of the discovered <b>patterns</b> to help the user identify those interesting ones. The technique is based on fuzzy matching of the discovered <b>patterns</b> with a set of user-specified <b>patterns.</b> The degrees of match are then used to rank the discovered <b>patterns</b> according to vari [...] ...|$|R
