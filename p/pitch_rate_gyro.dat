40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{attitude}} estimation {{device is}} proposed utilizing cost-effective measurement sensors. The device fuses a rate gyroscope with an accelerometer array to estimate {{and eliminate the}} <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias online yielding accurate real time aircraft attitude tracking. Attitude determination algorithms are dependent on instantaneous and accurate measurements of translational and rotational body rates for precise estimation of vehicle orientation in three-dimensional space. Measurement error of instantaneous rate sensors, gyroscopes, is introduced via inherent biases and signal noise resulting in gyro drift. Integration of the rate signal for calculation of a net displacement amplifies these minute measurement errors leading to inaccurate and unreliable attitude observation. The proposed device is a departure from typical attitude observers and bias estimators due to its reliance on accelerometers measuring the local gravitational vector in lieu of additional magnetic field sensors or GPS. The end result of this work is a longitudinal attitude estimation device able to compute a <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias in real-time producing accurate pitch angle tracking while subjected to simulated aircraft flight conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for designing a low-cost attitude and heading estimation system which {{is composed of}} three single-axis <b>rate</b> <b>gyros,</b> a tri-axis accelerometer, and a tri-axis magnetometer. <b>Rate</b> <b>gyro</b> sensor we have chosen is a small relatively inexpensive piezoelectric vibrating <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> originally developed for the automobile market and active suspension systems by Murata. It generates voltage output proportional to the angular velocity of the vehicle around the principal axis of the device. Accelerometer is a tri-axis digital output linear accelerometer developed by ST that includes a sensing element and an IC interface {{able to take the}} information from the sensing element and to provide the measured acceleration signals to the external world through an I 2 C/SPI interface. Magnetometer is an integrated tri-axis magnetic field sensing module manufactured by PNI. It is used to measure Earth?셲 magnetic field. SPI interface allows easy access to its measurement parameters and resulting field measurement data. Output signals coming from these sensors are fused through two Kalman filters. One Kalman filter is used to estimate roll and pitch angles and the other is for heading angle estimation. By using this method, we have obtained attitude (roll and pitch angle) and heading information which are reliable over long period of time. Results from a set of simulation works have shown the performance of the presented method.

In this study, five <b>pitching</b> <b>rates</b> were applied to lab-scale fermentations to investigate its impact on the yeast physiology and beer quality. The fermentation rate increased significantly and the net yeast growth was lowered with increasing <b>pitching</b> <b>rate,</b> without affecting significantly the viability and the vitality of the yeast population. The build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed when higher yeast concentrations were pitched.

40|$|A 3 meter-span, {{unmanned}} air vehicle {{has been}} flight tested {{in order to}} find its dynamic modes of motion, in-flight Euler angles, and in-flight angles of attack and sideslip angles. Instrumentation included an inertial measurement unit, a GPS, and a 3 -axis sonic anemometer. ^ Before flight, the inertial measurement unit was calibrated for rotation rate, temperature, and acceleration. Each of these calibrations was linear. ^ The dynamic modes were estimated based on aircraft geometry, mass, and moments of inertia. For the short period pitch, Dutch roll, and roll modes, the estimates were compared to results from flight and were found to match. The Phugoid and spiral modes were found to be impractical to flight test due to space constraints and atmospheric turbulence, respectively. The low wing loading of the UAV strengthened the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data. ^ The Euler angles were calculated from <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data and compared to other measurement or calculation methods, including a ground-based video camera and equations using GPS and sonic anemometer data. It was found that roll and pitch angle errors fluctuate around zero due to coupling between the Euler angle equations. Yaw angle, however, does not exhibit this behavior. It was established that Euler angle drift rates of less than 6 °/s can be achieved through calculation from <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> and that better results may be obtained by updating the Euler angles with outside sources of information. ^ The angles of attack and sideslip angles were calculated from <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> and GPS data and compared to sonic anemometer calculations. It was found that angle of attack calculated the former way did not match the sonic anemometer calculations due to error in pitch angle and possibly the GPS 2 ̆ 7 slow, 4 Hz update rate. Sideslip angle did match the sonic anemometer data after accounting for error in yaw angle and GPS lag. ^ These results {{can be used as a}} foundation for the improvement of cheap, light flight testing equipment for small UAVs. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{low-cost}} GPS receivers and antennas for attitude determination can {{significantly reduce the}} overall hardware system cost. Compared {{to the use of}} high performance GPS receivers, the carrier phase measurements from low-cost equipment are subject to additional carrier phase measurement errors, such as multipath, antenna phase centre variation and noise. These error sources, together with more frequent cycle slip occurrences, severely deteriorate attitude determination availability, reliability and accuracy performance. This paper presents the investigation of a low-cost GPS/gyro integration system for attitude determination. By employing the dead reckoning sensor type, the ambiguity search region can be specifically defined as a small cube to enhance the ambiguity resolution process. A Kalman filter is implemented to fuse the <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data with GPS carrier phase measure-ments. The quality control system based on innovation sequences is used to identify cycle slip occurrences and incorrect inter-antenna vector solutions. The availability of the integrated system also improves with respect to the GPS standalone system since the attitude par-ameters can be estimated using the angular rate measurements from <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> during GPS outages.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{previously}} developed, novel one-dimensional attitude estimation device is expanded {{through the development}} and implementation of an innovative method for estimation of two-dimensional attitude making use of a unique low-cost, dual arc accelerometer array measuring longitudinal and transverse rotational rates in real-time. The device and method proposed is an expansion of {{a previously}} developed method for one-dimensional attitude determination and <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias estimation utilizing a one-dimensional accelerometer array. This new revolutionary device utilizes a dual arc accelerometer array and an algorithm for accurate and reliable two-dimensional attitude determination and <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> bias estimation in real-time. The method determines the local gravitational field vector from which attitude information can be resolved. Upon determining the location of the local gravitational field vector relative to two consecutive accelerometer sensors, the orientation of the device may then be estimated and the attitude determined. However, this measurement is discrete in nature; therefore, integrated <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> measurements are used to determine attitude information resulting in a continuous signal. However, attitude estimates and measurements produced by instantaneous rate sensors and gyroscope integration tend to drift over time due to drift and bias inherent to the <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> sensor. The integration of the acquired instantaneous rate signals amplify measurement errors leading to an undependable and imprecise estimate of the vehicles true attitude and orientation. A method for compensation of these errors is proposed in this work resulting in a highly accurate and continuous attitude estimate. For this thesis, simulations of the proposed method and device will be conducted with the inclusion of characteristic, real-world sensor noise and bias estimates produced from corrupted and biased sensors to analyze and assess the feasibility and validity of the proposed method and system configuration for two-dimensional attitude determination.
