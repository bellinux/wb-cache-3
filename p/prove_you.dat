2500|$|The Hare runs {{like crazy}} through a forest and meets the Wolf. The Wolf asks: [...] "What's the matter? Why such haste?" [...] / [...] "The camels there are caught and shod!" [...] The Wolf says: [...] "But you're not a camel!" [...] / [...] "Hey, after you are caught and shod, just {{you try to}} prove to them {{that you are not}} a camel!"

The Hare and the joke itself were used to illustrate the hassles of a Soviet lishenets in a 1929 issue of a satirical magazine Chudak. Mikhail Melnichenko, in an article about Soviet political jokes cites a 1926 private collection, which renders the joke in a more gruesome form, where [...] the Hare is scared of the rumor that all camels are taken hostages by Cheka and shot (a reference to the Red Terror). A similar parable was told by a 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi Jalal ad-Din Rumi, it which a person was scared to be taken for a donkey and skinned.|$|E
