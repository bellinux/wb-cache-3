50|$|The M-88 was {{designed}} to address the shortcomings of the Tumansky M-87. The improvements incorporated in the M-88 were a strengthened crankcase, crankshaft, connecting rods, waffle ribbing at the <b>piston</b> <b>bottom</b> and a two speed geared centrifugal supercharger. The M-88 retained the same bore/stroke and displacement as the M-87 while increasing power to 1,000 - 1,150 hp. Design work began in 1937 and by 1939 the first prototypes were being flight tested in the Polikarpov I-180 fighter prototypes. At first the M-88 was not a success, but the designers persisted and the M-88 {{was made into a}} reliable and widely produced engine. There were a number of different variants with the most numerous being the M-88B, of which 10,585 were produced at Zaporozhye and Omsk. The M-88B solved most of the mechanical failures associated with the M-87 and early M-88's by including oil injectors in the crankshaft, improved cooling and strengthened drive components. 16,087 M-88's were produced.|$|E

50|$|Gasoline engines take in {{a mixture}} of air and {{gasoline}} and compress it by the movement of the <b>piston</b> from <b>bottom</b> dead center to top dead center when the fuel is at maximum compression. The reduction {{in the size of the}} swept area of the cylinder and taking into account the volume of the combustion chamber is described by a ratio. Early engines had compression ratios of 6 to 1. As compression ratios were increased the efficiency of the engine increased as well.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the bottom}} of the stroke, the exhaust valve to the {{condenser}} is closed and the equilibrium valve is opened. The weight of the pump gear draws the piston up, and as the piston comes up, steam is transferred through the equilibrium pipe from above the <b>piston</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of the cylinder below the piston.|$|R
50|$|Compression {{serves to}} {{increase}} the proportion of energy which can be extracted from the hot gas and should be optimised for a given application. Too high a compression can cause detonation, which is undesirable compared with a smooth, controlled burn. Too low a compression may result in the fuel/air mixture still burning when the <b>piston</b> reaches the <b>bottom</b> of the stroke and the exhaust valve opens.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the design}} of the earlier Ba.65 the Ba.75 was {{slightly}} larger and was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane and unlike the Ba.65 had a fixed tailwheel landing gear. The Ba.75 was powered by a 900 hp (670 kW) Isotta-Fraschini K.14 radial <b>piston</b> engine. The <b>bottom</b> and lower sides of the fuselage were glazed to allow observation of the ground. The only Ba.75 was built and test flown in 1939.|$|R
50|$|This {{design was}} {{developed}} by Malcolm Beare of Australia. The technology combines a four-stroke engine bottom end with an opposed piston in the cylinder head working at half the cyclical rate of the <b>bottom</b> <b>piston.</b> Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine. Claimed benefits include a 9% increase in power, and improved thermodynamic efficiency through an increased compression ratio enabled by {{the elimination of the}} hot exhaust valve.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "resonance tuning", some {{naturally}} aspirated intake systems operate at a volumetric efficiency above 100%: the air pressure in the combustion chamber before the compression stroke {{is greater than the}} atmospheric pressure. In combination with this intake manifold design feature, the exhaust manifold design, as well as the exhaust valve opening time can be so calibrated as to achieve greater evacuation of the cylinder. The exhaust manifolds achieve a vacuum in the cylinder just before the piston reaches top dead center. The opening inlet valve can then—at typical compression ratios—fill 10% of the cylinder before beginning downward travel. Instead of achieving higher pressure in the cylinder, the inlet valve can stay open after the <b>piston</b> reaches <b>bottom</b> dead center while the air still flows in.|$|R
50|$|The piston {{then moves}} downward,where the air-fuel mixture remains from the {{previous}} intake-compression stroke. Shortly after the exhaust port is uncovered by the downward travel of the piston, the transfer ports begin to be uncovered. The transfer ports act as a passage through which the air-fuel mixture moves from the crankcase into the cylinder above the piston. Once the <b>piston</b> reaches the <b>bottom</b> of the stroke, the second stroke is completed and the process is repeated.|$|R
40|$|Introducing a gaseous fuel, e. g., methane, {{into the}} {{conventional}} {{spark ignition engine}} intake system causes engine power loss contributed by low density of the fuel. A study of gaseous fuel/air mixing in a simplified two-dimensional axisymetrical cylinder shaped chamber with centrally located orifice inlet condition was performed using multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analysis. Agreement with the experimental data was reasonable in some respect, {{but it was not}} satisfactory overall. The swirling effect on fuel concentration files was evident and the best uniformity for the fuel concentration distribution during the compression stroke was found when swirling strength was Sn = 0. 4. The fuel concentration distribution was non-uniform for all flow cases when the fuel injection is in effect. Fuel concentration uniformity increased as the <b>piston</b> approaches <b>bottom</b> dead center. Improvement in the fuel concentration uniformity continued during the compression stroke...|$|R

Automotive {{technology is}} very fast growing because of their needed in human life. The two stroke engine is reciprocating engine in which the piston takes over any valve functions in order to obtain power stroke each revolution of the crankshaft. This involves the use of ports in the cylinder walls which are covered and uncovered by movements of piston. Two stroke engines are used for motorcycles, lawn mowers, chain saw and marine engine. Cylinder Head is one of the important parts in engine part. The purpose of The Cylinder Head to cover the movement of <b>piston</b> from <b>Bottom</b> Dead Centre to Top Dead Centre and also combustion chamber in The Cylinder Head is very important in combustion process...|$|R
30|$|The {{negative}} pulse command transfer is realized by switching {{the open and}} close of the current limiting valve. Therefore, the interference signal generated during the transmission is the disturbance of the frequency of other influencing factors: the frequency disturbance generated by the <b>piston</b> pump, the <b>bottom</b> hole power machine, the influence of bubbles in the slurry on the signal transmission frequency, the frequency disturbance caused by the moving drill, The interference frequency and signal transmission frequency of the larger difference can be filtered out by the filter.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{cylinder}} and its combustion chamber with the <b>piston</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of its stroke may contain 1000 cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has {{moved up to}} the top of its stroke inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100 cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.|$|R
40|$|<b>Piston</b> cores, <b>bottom</b> grabs, and single-channel seismic data {{acquired}} during Deep Freeze/USARP cruises {{have been}} used to examine sedimentation and recent climatic history in the bays and fjords of the Gerlache Strait region (Antarctic Pensinsula). The local climate and glacial setting exhibit profound influences on sedimentation via the processes associated with subglacial water. Visible sediment plumes are rare, and glacial ice above sea level is pristine white, indicating that debris is entering the water from the glaciers that are grounded below sea level. In the relatively warm and wet Palmer Archipelago, terrigenous muds and sands with a variable IRD component are ponding in every available bathymetric depression, and sediment gravity flow processes are common.

50|$|German {{psychologist}} William Stern {{invented the}} tone variator in 1897 to study human sensitivity {{to changes in}} pitch, going beyond the traditional psychophysical research of studying the sensitivity to differences in discrete tones. The instrument consists of an adjustable brass resonator, which is supplied with a constant flow of air across the opening at the top. Turning a graduated cam {{on the front of}} the apparatus raises or lowers a <b>piston</b> in the <b>bottom</b> of the resonator, changing the volume of its interior, thus altering the sounded pitch over a continuous range.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary piston spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary <b>piston</b> <b>bottoms</b> in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|R

5000|$|The {{archetype}} {{of the modern}} form of the two-stroke diesel is the (high-speed) Detroit Diesel Series 71 engine, designed by Charles F. [...] "Boss" [...] Kettering {{and his colleagues at}} General Motors Corporation in 1938, in which the blower pressurizes a chamber in the engine block that {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "air box". The (very much larger medium-speed) Electro-Motive Diesel engine is used as the prime mover in EMD diesel-electric locomotive, marine and stationary applications, and was designed by the same team, and is built to the same principle. However, a significant improvement built into most later EMD engines is the mechanically assisted turbo-compressor, which provides charge air using mechanical assistance during starting (thereby obviating the necessity for Roots-blown scavenging), and provides charge air using an exhaust gas-driven turbine during normal operations—thereby providing true turbocharging and additionally increasing the engine's power output by at least fifty percent.In a two-stroke diesel engine, as the cylinder's <b>piston</b> approaches the <b>bottom</b> dead centre exhaust ports or valves are opened relieving most of the excess pressure after which a passage between the air box and the cylinder is opened, permitting air flow into the cylinder. The air flow blows the remaining combustion gases from the cylinder—this is the scavenging process. As the <b>piston</b> passes through <b>bottom</b> centre and starts upward, the passage is closed and compression commences, culminating in fuel injection and ignition. Refer to two-stroke diesel engines for more detailed coverage of aspiration types and supercharging of two-stroke diesel engines.|$|R
50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the <b>piston</b> reaches the <b>bottom</b> of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{the drive}} utilizes a jointed rhomboid to convert linear work from a reciprocating piston to rotational work. The connecting rod of the piston is rigid {{as opposed to}} a common reciprocating engine which directly connects the piston to the crankshaft with a flexible joint in the piston. Instead, the rod connects to one corner of a rhombus. When force is applied to the piston, it pushes down; at the same time, the outer corners of the rhomboid push out. They push on two cranks/flywheels which cause them to rotate, each in opposite directions. As the wheels rotate the rhombus progresses its change of shape from being flattened {{in the direction of the}} piston axis at top dead centre to being flattened in the perpendicular direction to the <b>piston</b> axis at <b>bottom</b> dead centre.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the ideal}} Otto cycle engine, the vacuum engine {{relies on a}} {{constant}} heat source provided by burning fuel. As mentioned above, a valve allows an intake of heat into the piston chamber. Estimating the heat in or Qin is constant in the controlled volume space, the ideal gas equation PV = nRT implies {{an increase in the}} pressure of the piston chamber. After the valve closes, the piston undergoes an adiabatic process during the downward stroke. Once the <b>piston</b> reaches the <b>bottom</b> of its stroke, the chamber is cooled either by the surrounding air or water, and the resulting Qout forces the pressure in the piston to decrease. The system then undergoes another adiabatic compression of the gas in the chamber, which is subsequently released by the valve {{at the top of the}} cylinder's stroke, while simultaneously allowing new heated gas to enter the chamber.|$|R
50|$|Adrien {{subsequently}} {{made several}} improvements to his compressor. One problem with his original compressor {{was that the}} effort that was required to compress the gas was greatest {{at the bottom of}} the piston's stroke, at which point the gas's pressure was greatest. Adrien solved this problem by using a fusée, a device that watch makers used to allow a watch's mainspring to exert a constant torque as the mainspring unwound and its force became weaker. Adrien reversed the function of the fusée: in his compressor, the fusée allowed a constant force that was supplied by the compressor's source of power (men) to be converted into a force that increased as the <b>piston</b> neared the <b>bottom</b> of its stroke. Thanks to this modification, one man could now power the compressor instead of the ten men that had been required earlier. He also changed the method of cooling the compressor, and he reduced the number of cylinders from three to two. He obtained a patent for this improved compressor.|$|R

5000|$|The cycle {{starts with}} the <b>piston</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of its stroke. As it rises, it draws air into the {{crankcase}} through the inlet port. At the same time fuel is sprayed into the vaporiser. The charge of air {{on top of the}} piston is compressed into the vaporiser, where it is mixed with the atomised fuel and ignites. The piston is driven down the cylinder. As it descends, the piston first uncovers the exhaust port. The pressurised exhaust gases flow out of the cylinder. A fraction after the exhaust port is uncovered, the descending piston uncovers the transfer port. The piston is now pressurising the air in the crankcase, which is forced through the transfer port and into the space above the piston. Part of the incoming air charge is lost out of the still-open exhaust port to ensure all the exhaust gases are cleared from the cylinder, a process known as [...] "scavenging". The piston then reaches the bottom of its stroke and begins to rise again, drawing a fresh charge of air into the crankcase and completing the cycle. Induction and compression are carried out on the upward stroke, while power and exhaust occur on the downward stroke.|$|R
5000|$|There {{may be one}} or more pistons. Each piston {{is inside}} a cylinder, into which a gas is introduced, either already under {{pressure}} (e.g. steam engine), or heated inside the cylinder either by ignition of a fuel air mixture (internal combustion engine) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder (Stirling engine). The hot gases expand, pushing the <b>piston</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of the cylinder. This position {{is also known as}} the Bottom Dead Center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top (Top Dead Centre) (TDC) by a flywheel, the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a double acting cylinder) by the same process acting {{on the other side of}} the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or [...] "exhausted" [...] gases are removed from the cylinder by this stroke. The exception is the Stirling engine, which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.|$|R
40|$|In an {{internal}} combustion engine, valve timing {{is an important}} design parameter which affects many engine performance parameters. In this study, the effect of intake timing of an engine was investigated. The engine {{used in this study}} combines a 4 -stroke engine bottom end with an opposed piston in the cylinder head working at half the cyclical rate of the <b>bottom</b> <b>piston.</b> Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of the original engine that use poppet valve to control intake and exhaust port opening and closing. For the analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software has been used to analyze in-cylinder air flow motion during intake stroke process with engine speed of 4000 rpm. The intake port of the engine was modified to vary the intake timing. The modification of intake port was done by using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, Solidwork. From the CFD analysis, the in-cylinder air flow pattern and flow distribution before and after intake port modification was clarified. Simulation result shows that as the diameter of the port is decreased, the pressure drop and velocity of air flow into the engine cylinder are increased. Modification of the intake port shape from curved port to straight port was result in more symmetrical in-cylinder air flow distribution along the cylinder axis. For further study, it is strongly recommended to verify the simulation result with the experiment result as soon as the engine was successfully fabricated...|$|R
50|$|The sample {{assembly}} {{is constructed}} of multiple cylindrical sleeves which {{are placed in}} the opening in the pressure vessel or “bomb”. The outermost sleeve is typically composed from NaCl {{which is used to}} transfer the vertical load applied from the steel piston into a confining pressure on the sample {{at the center of the}} assembly. NaCl is used since it is relatively weak and it assists in the transfer of stress. Directly inboard of the outer NaCl sleeve is a ceramic support sleeve with a graphite sleeve inside of it, which is used for resistive heating of the sample. The inner most sleeve which houses the sample along with the upper and lower alumina pistons, is commonly also composed of NaCl. In addition to this arrangement, the inner sleeve can also be composed of a ternary eutectic salt mixture which is called a molten salt cell. The advantage to the molten salt cell is the salt mixture melts at moderate temperatures which allows for a true hydrostatic pressure to be applied the sample. When using a molten salt cell it also becomes necessary to add an additional nickel capsule to contain the salt mixture in order to prevent damage to other parts of the sample assembly. Temperature is monitored by a side entry thermocouple(s) that penetrate the wall of the graphite furnace and are directly adjacent to the sample, and are typically threaded through protective mullite insulation. The deviatoric stress is transferred to the sample through the σ1 piston. This piston is orientated in series with the upper piston, sample and lower piston within the inner sleeve which all sits on top of a tungsten carbide <b>bottom</b> <b>piston.</b>|$|R
50|$|Piston port is the {{simplest}} of the designs and the most common in small two-stroke engines. All functions are controlled solely by the piston covering and uncovering the ports as it moves {{up and down in}} the cylinder. In the 1970s, Yamaha worked out some basic principles for this system. They found that, in general, widening an exhaust port increases the power by the same amount as raising the port, but the power band does not narrow as it does when the port is raised. However, there is a mechanical limit to the width of a single exhaust port, at about 62% of the bore diameter for reasonable ring life. Beyond this, the rings will bulge into the exhaust port and wear quickly. A maximum is 70% of bore width is possible in racing engines, where rings are changed every few races. Intake duration is between 120 and 160 degrees. Transfer port time is set at a minimum of 26 degrees. The strong low pressure pulse of a racing two-stroke expansion chamber can drop the pressure to -7 PSI when the <b>piston</b> is at <b>bottom</b> dead center, and the transfer ports nearly wide open. One of the reasons for high fuel consumption in two-strokes is that some of the incoming pressurized fuel-air mixture is forced across the top of the piston, where it has a cooling action, and straight out the exhaust pipe. An expansion chamber with a strong reverse pulse will stop this out-going flow. A fundamental difference from typical four-stroke engines is that the two-stroke's crankcase is sealed and forms part of the induction process in gasoline and hot bulb engines. Diesel two-strokes often add a Roots blower or piston pump for scavenging.|$|R
40|$|Piston {{telemetry}} research involves {{monitoring the}} temperatures at specific internal location points within a combustion engine piston. The temperatures are detected with type K thermocouples as voltages and processed to convert them into temperatures using cold junction compensation methods. The present system uses a specific sensor designed {{to operate in}} the high temperature environment within the piston, reading multiple thermocouples. Because of the reciprocating motion of the piston, power generation is intermittent and available only when the <b>piston</b> reaches near <b>bottom</b> dead centre, using inductive coupling to power the sensors and transmit data to an evaluation unit for data processing. The planned system involves designing and building a prototype telemetry unit using ¿off the shelf¿ components that integrate the reading of thermocouple outputs, signal processing and cold junction compensation. Wireless telemetry is adopted for data transmission with an integrated Bluetooth and microcontroller module. The data acquisition module can be adapted for other sensors by adapting the firmware uploaded to the microcontroller. The hardware electronics are envisaged to be encased in thermal insulation to enable operation in high temperature environments. The considered system requires a power supply for the integrated components {{in the form of a}} power generator and that it should meet two criteria: to be located within confined spaces and to be permanently available, without having to dismantle systems to change batteries. The selected method is an induction generator constructed from a coil stator connected to the piston connection rod big end and a permanent magnet rotor connected to the crankshaft. The suggested mechatronic system is validated against the present system by comparing both systems to determine whether wireless telemetry can perform within acceptable tolerances and limits for the specified task. Then, for acceptable performances, reduce costs and include flexibility to operate in multiple environments. Bench testing shows that the power generator is capable of driving the sensors and the Bluetooth integrated DAQ system. EPSRC and University of Bradfor...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{based on}} simple principles, Newcomen's engine was rather complex and {{showed signs of}} {{incremental}} development, problems being empirically addressed as they arose. It consisted of a boiler A, usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than 1 - 2 psi (0.07 - 0.14 bar) - the maximum allowable pressure for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking [...] "Great balanced Beam", the fulcrum E of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building, the engine being located in-house. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head F of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head D was suspended a piston P working in a cylinder B, the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the <b>piston</b> and the <b>bottom</b> end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston {{was surrounded by a}} seal {{in the form of a}} leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank C (or header tank) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a stand-pipe for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of surficial sediments and sediment dispersion {{patterns on the}} steep continental slope off Nice (SE France) have been studied using side-scan sonar, 3. 5 kHz profiles, short <b>piston</b> cores and <b>bottom</b> photographs. The input of terrigenous material to the Baie des Anges, a submarine embayment bounded by two prominent ridges, is dominated by fluvial input from the Var River, the Paillon River being only a minor source. The Var River provides very coarse bedload material (gravel and cobble) directly {{to the head of}} the Var Canyon. Gravel and cobble deposits are found all along the Var Canyon and the Upper Fan Valley of the Var submarine fan and have been shaped into gravel waves. The fine particles (suspension load) are separated from the coarse bedload upon entering the sea and form up to 60 -m thick deposits on the uppermost continental slope of the Baie des Anges. These deposits are formed by settling out of sediment plumes. The presence of silt and fine sand laminae that decrease in thickness and frequency away from the Var River mouth indicate the influence of meso- and hyperpycnal flows on these plume deposits. Areas outside the Baie des Anges are not connected to major fluvial input and receive only hemipelagic sediments. These primary deposits are highly unstable and sediment failure due to seismic loading, sedimentary loading or undercutting is frequent. Sediment failure produces secondary sediment gravity flows that export most of the material to the basin, but also produce turbidity-current over-spill deposits on ridges bounding the slope canyons and on terraces within the Var Canyon. Slump and debris-flow deposits are also observed. At least some of these secondary flows erode the continental slope as cross-cutting chutes on the upper continental slope and erosional scours in the Upper Fan Valley demonstrate. Modern sediment dispersal patterns on the continental slope off Nice are proposed as a modern analogue to lowstand conditions on continental margins. In fact, the absence of a continental shelf together with a steep slope strongly reduces the influence of sealevel on the physiography of the margin...|$|R
50|$|The p-V diagam is a {{simplified}} and idealised {{representation of the}} events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a Carnot cycle. Starting at 1, the <b>piston</b> is at <b>bottom</b> dead centre and both valves are closed {{at the start of}} the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure. Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically—that is without heat transfer to or from the environment—by the rising piston. (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise. At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas. Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3. In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2. Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected. During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately). This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it. Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3-4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger). After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram. If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram. At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air. The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2—this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine. Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p-V loop. The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression. It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.|$|R
40|$|Engine DesignThis {{project was}} aimed at {{developing}} an orbital internal combustion engine (ICE) technology that is able to combust {{a wide range of}} fuels that can be converted into useable energy that currently are not being utilized. The key difference that sets this engine apart from all other internal combustion engine’s is that the combustion chambers themselves rotate with the output shaft around a fixed cam. Similar orbital engine’s were used earlier in the 20 th century predominantly in aircrafts. These engine’s faded out of production in the 1950 ’s due to high maintenance demands due to worn cams and lubrication issues. With the today’s technologic improvements, the shortfalls of the engine can now be mitigated with advances in material science lubricants and manufacturing. These engine’s offer comparatively high outputs and never before have they been modeled to explore their true potential. The concept engine being investigated operates at a very slow speed and has the advantage of being able to alter the piston trajectory by altering the cam geometry. This level of customization is impossible in traditional crank slider configurations. The slower rpm allows the combustion of very low grade fuels that are currently not being utilized commercially as an energy source while producing good output when compared to current internal combustion technologies. Conventional engine simulation software was used to explore the performance potential for this engine configuration. An initial simulation model was verified against an existing prototype and a second model was created to aid in a second generation engine that is currently being developed. These models were used to explore the engine’s capability and optimal configuration. The results of a multitude of simulations were used to create a calculator for industry that uses Microsoft excel to access and interpolate from the data to predict performance for possible variants and to aid in future prototype designs without the need for the software package. The primary focus of the research was to investigate how engine performance was affected by manipulating the piston trajectory, velocity and dwell time near TDC and BDC by adjusting the cam profile. This has proven to have very large implications concerning the engine’s output. It was discovered that by prolonging the time the piston spent at the extremities of its stroke (relative to crank rotation, or in this case, engine rotation) greatly improved combustion and engine performance. Prolonging the time the <b>piston</b> spends near <b>bottom</b> dead centre (BDC) allowed more time for air and fuel to enter the combustion chamber. With the addition of a highly pressurized crankcase, this proved to highly successful in improving performance at higher RPM. Prolonging the time the piston spends near top dead centre (TDC) after ignition lead too much higher pressure being developed during the power stroke, which is advantageous for volumetric efficiency and combusting slower burning fuels. Increasing the dwell time at TDC had the most benefit to performance predominantly at lower RPM. These tuning capabilities make the engine very versatile and highly desirable. The results of tuning the piston trajectories using Ricardo Wave software has lead to a potential 60 % increase in peak torque on the engine as well as raising the torque delivery over the entire RPM spectrum. This analysis also provided critical information to aid {{in the development of the}} 2 nd generation engine in respect to breathing and the forces acting on each of the engine components. This research into the influence of dwell and how it can be manipulated to improve the efficiency of combustion is likely to have influences in other ICE applications and development and help push the envelope for better efficiencies and the use of alternative fuels...|$|R
