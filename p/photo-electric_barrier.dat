40|$|Monolithic 32 x 64 and 64 x 1 : 128 {{palladium}} silicide (Pd 2 Si) interline transfer infrared charge coupled devices (IRCCDs) sensitive in the 1 to 3. 5 micron {{spectral band}} were developed. This silicon imager exhibits a low response nonuniformity of typically 0. 2 to 1. 6 % rms, and was operated in the temperature range between 40 to 140 K. Spectral response measurements of test Pd 2 Si p-type Si devices yield quantum efficiencies of 7. 9 % at 1. 25 microns, 5. 6 % at 1. 65 microns 2. 2 % at 2. 22 microns. Improvement in quantum efficiency is expected by optimizing the different structural {{parameters of the}} Pd 2 Si detectors. The spectral response of the Pd 2 Si detectors fit a modified Fowler emission model. The measured <b>photo-electric</b> <b>barrier</b> height for the Pd 2 Si detectors is 0. 34 eV and the measured quantum efficiency coefficient, C 1, is 19 %/eV. The dark current level of Pd 2 Si Schottky barrier focal plane arrays (FPAs) is sufficiently low to enable operation at intermediate temperatures at TV frame rates. Typical dark current level measured at 120 K on the FPA is 2 nA/sq cm. The operating temperature of the Pd 2 Si FPA is compatible with passive cooler performance. In addition, high density Pd 2 Si Schottky barrier FPAs are manufactured with high yield and therefore represent an economical approach to short wavelength IR imaging. A Pd 2 Si Schottky barrier image sensor for push-broom multispectral imaging in the 1. 25, 1. 65, and 2. 22 micron bands is being studied. The sensor will have two line arrays (dual band capability) of 512 detectors each, with 30 micron center-to-center detector spacing. The device will be suitable for chip-to-chip abutment, thus providing the capability to produce large, multiple chip focal planes with contiguous, in-line sensors...|$|E
