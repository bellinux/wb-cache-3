5|$|The jack jumper ant genome is {{contained}} {{on a single}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number known (indeed possible) for any animal, a number shared with the parasitic roundworm Parascaris equorum univalens. Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine polymorphic loci, which yielded 67 alleles.|$|E
5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} per individual varies {{from one to}} over 70 among the species in the genus. The genome of M. pilosula is contained on a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number possible for any animal, and workers of this species are homologous. Like M. pilosula, M. croslandi also contains a single chromosome. While these ants only have a single chromosome, M. pyriformis contains 41 chromosomes while M. brevinoda contains 42. The chromosome count for M. piliventris and M. fulvipes is 2 and 12, respectively. The genus Myrmecia retains many traits that are considered basal for all ants (i.e. workers foraging alone and relying on visual cues).|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} Hominidae except humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans have 24 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{chromosome}}s.</b> Humans have only 23 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Human chromosome 2 {{is a result}} of an end-to-end fusion <b>of</b> two ancestral <b>chromosomes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Guppies have 23 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> {{including}} one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> sex <b>chromosomes,</b> {{the same number}} as humans. The genes responsible for male guppies' ornamentations are Y-chromosome linked and are heritable.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
25|$|During meiosis, when {{germ cells}} divide to create sperm and egg (gametes), each half {{should have the}} same number of {{chromosome}}s. But sometimes, the whole <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> will end up in one gamete, and the other gamete will not get that chromosome at all.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the unfalsifiability criticism of evolutionary theory, numerous examples of potential ways to falsify evolution have been proposed. J. B. S. Haldane, when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied [...] "fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era." [...] Numerous other potential ways to falsify evolution have also been proposed. For example, the fact that humans have one fewer <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> than the great apes offered a testable hypothesis involving the fusion or splitting of chromosomes from a common ancestor. The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that human chromosome 2 is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other primates. Extra, inactive telomeres and centromeres remain on human chromosome 2 {{as a result of}} the fusion. The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of DNA sequencing methods. If true, human DNA should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes, than to other mammals. If not, then common descent is falsified. DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA (between 95% to 99.4% depending on the measure). Also, the evolution of chimpanzees and humans from a common ancestor predicts a (geologically) recent common ancestor. Numerous transitional fossils have since been found. Hence, human evolution has passed several falsifiable tests.|$|E
50|$|It has 78 {{chromosomes}} {{in total}} (27 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> microchromosomes, six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> medium-sized <b>chromosomes,</b> and six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> large <b>chromosomes).</b>|$|R
50|$|A regular human carries 23 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{in his or}} her cells. Cells {{containing}} two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{are known}} as diploid cells. Those with diploid triploid mosaicism have some cells which are triploid, meaning that they have three copies <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> or a total <b>of</b> 69 <b>chromosomes.</b> Triploidy is distinct from trisomy, in which only one chromosome exists in three pairs. A well-known example of trisomy is trisomy 21 or Down syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Construction of {{cytogenetic}} maps {{can provide}} important information for chromosome identification, chromosome evolution and genomic research. However, it hasn't {{been conducted in}} many scallop species yet. In the present study, we attempted to map 12 fosmid clones containing tandem repeats by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) in the Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (Jay, 1857). The results showed 6 fosmid clones were successfully mapped and distributed in 6 different <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Three clones were respectively assigned to a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> metacentric <b>chromosomes,</b> a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> submetacentric <b>chromosomes</b> and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> telocentric <b>chromosomes</b> and the remaining 3 clones showed their loci on three different <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> subtelocentric <b>chromosomes</b> by co-hybridization. In summary, totally 8 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> <b>of</b> the Yesso scallop were identified by 6 fosmid clones and two rDNA probes. Furthermore, 6 tandem repeats of 5 clones were sequenced and could be developed as chromosome specific markers for the Yesso scallop. The successful localization of fosmid clones will undoubtedly facilitate the integration of linkage groups with cytogenetic map and genomic research for the Yesso scallop...|$|R
500|$|In {{the colonies}} {{of a few}} ant species, there are {{physical}} castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called [...] "soldier" [...] ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their [...] "duties" [...] typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation {{in the size of}} workers. The smallest and largest workers in Pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500-fold difference in their dry-weights. Workers cannot mate; however, because of the haplodiploid sex-determination system in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as honeypot ants, young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called repletes. For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus. Usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes, demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism. This polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths; however, genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in Acromyrmex sp. These polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes; differences in a single gene of Solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens. The Australian jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) has only a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid), the lowest number known for any animal, making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects.|$|E
2500|$|One copy of {{each pair}} is {{inherited}} from {{the mother and the}} other copy is {{inherited from the}} father. [...] The first 22 pairs of chromosomes (called autosomes) are numbered from 1 to 22, from largest to smallest. [...] The 23rd <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are the sex chromosomes. Normal females have two X chromosomes, while normal males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.
