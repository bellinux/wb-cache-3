The reported amplitude of the T_c-oscillations varies significantly from one experiment to another.

Such oscillations in the coupling depend on the substrate material, the quality of the interface, the <b>protection</b> <b>cover</b> and other details of the fabrication process, changing from one experiment to another.

30|$|The I-factor {{describes}} the infiltration conditions, {{and more specifically}} the bypass degree of <b>protection</b> <b>cover,</b> due to lateral and subsurface water flow in the catchment of karstic holes and sinking (blind) streams. If the protective cover is completely bypassed by a shallow hole through which surface water may pass directly into the karstic aquifer, then I =  0, while I =  1 if the infiltration occurs diffusely (e.g., on a flat, highly permeable and free draining surface). The intermediate values occur in catchment areas of variable slopes, depending on the proportion of lateral flow components. The final protection factor “π” is extracted by the combination of P and I (π = Ρ × I) and subdivided into five classes, where π ≤  1 indicates very low degree of protection leading to extreme vulnerability, while π =  5 indicates a very high protection with subsequent very low vulnerability (Vrba and Zaporozec 1994; Goldscheider et al. 2000).

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThe {{objective}} of this Master’s thesis was to investigate whether or not using protection covers made of reinforced concrete is a viable option for protection of subsea installations on the seabed. The main focus of the thesis is on the structural design of the cover. The original problem, raised by Subsea 7, was that in shallow waters of about 100 m depth, the protection covers made of GRP experience problems with on-bottom stability due to the hydrodynamic forces from currents and waves. Unless tons of ballast steel is added to increase {{the mass of the}} cover, and rock-dumping {{on the sides of the}} cover is performed, the covers are prone to be unstable or possibly moved by the currents and waves. The hypothesis behind the thesis is that the slightly higher density of concrete and the thicker walls of the concrete covers, as well as some slight changes to the typical shape of the cover, will make them heavy enough to be stable on the seabed on its own without added ballast weight and rock-dumping. The type of cover assessed in the thesis is a simple tunnel or arch cover, which is typically used to cover pipelines or spools. The inner diameter of the cover was set to 2 m, so that it can protect pipelines or spools up to size 16 ” with the necessary clearances to walls and roof. A 3 D model of the reinforced concrete cover was created, and a finite element analysis performed using the software Ansys® Workbench, Release 14. 5. The trawl design loads of 300 kN from NORSOK standard U- 001 was applied to the cover. A dynamic dropped object simulation on the reinforced concrete cover model was also performed. The analyses showed that the concrete protection covers had sufficient strength to withstand the force from the trawl board and to withstand the energy from the dropped objects without damaging the product underneath. A 2 D beam model of the cover was created in STAAD. Pro V 8 i in order to get the design forces and moments in the cover. The concrete <b>protection</b> <b>cover</b> was designed according to the concrete standard Eurocode 2. This design resulted in the necessary amount of reinforcement to withstand the design forces and moments, and proved that the cross-section of concrete and reinforcement of the <b>protection</b> <b>cover</b> was able to withstand the design loads from trawl gear impacts. A full scale dropped object test of impact energies 5 kJ, 20 kJ, 30 kJ and 50 kJ, according to NORSOK standard U- 001 was performed on doubly reinforced concrete protection covers of 215 mm thickness and inner radius of 1000 mm. The test was performed on concrete covers provided by Multiblokk AS. The objects used in the test had masses of 140 kg, 550 kg, 850 kg and 1400 kg and was dropped onto the cover from approximately 3, 7 m height. An initial test was performed on gravel on Multiblokk AS’ premises, and the four main tests were performed with the cover submerged in the basin at the laboratories at the University of Stavanger. The covers in the main tests cracked slightly, but none were penetrated or collapsed. The dropped object tests proved that the strength of the protection covers was more than enough to withstand the dropped object energies, and that the initial design of the cover is suitable to build upon further. Based on the results from the structural assessment of the cover, the tests and analyses, the concept of using concrete protection covers was found to be a feasible concept that should be investigated further and in more detail. Its heavy weight, high strength and the possibility of liberation from rock-dump requirements gives the concrete <b>protection</b> <b>cover</b> a competitive edge that is well worth exploring further...|$|E
40|$|Transition metal {{nanoparticles}} {{with different}} surfactants were investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) {{to obtain information}} about the interaction between metal core and protecting shell. For tetraalkylammoniumchloride stabilized Pd- and Co-colloids, a detailed model {{of the interaction between}} the metal core and the stabilizing shell could be established, in which chlorine is the connecting element between the metal core and the organic <b>protection</b> <b>cover.</b> Different lengths of the alkyl-chains can cause different equilibrium positions for the chlorine atoms. At aluminum-organic stabilized Pt-colloids, Al K-XANES and Pt L_I_I_I-XAS were carried out. In this case, it turned out that aluminum is the connecting element between metal core and protection shell. After modification of the shell by connecting different molecules to the outside of the shell, rearrangements of the shell could be observed. In contrast to the surfactant stabilized systems discussed above, metallic covers, especially gold coatings, of Co-particles did not lead to a complete protection shell. In all cases, the cobalt in the nanoparticles was oxidized. A core shell structure could not be verified for any of the metallic stabilized colloids. (orig.)

40|$|Quantum {{confinement}} of the perpendicular {{motion of}} electrons in single-crystalline metallic superconducting nanofilms splits the conduction band {{into a series}} of single-electron subbands. A distinctive feature of such a nanoscale multi-band superconductor is that the energetic position of each subband can vary significantly with changing nanofilm thickness, substrate material, <b>protection</b> <b>cover</b> and other details of the fabrication process. It can occur that the bottom of one of the available subbands is situated {{in the vicinity of the}} Fermi level. We demonstrate that the character of the superconducting pairing in such a subband changes dramatically and exhibits a clear molecule-like trend, which is very similar to the well-known crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime to Bose-Einstein condensation (BCS-BEC) observed in trapped ultracold fermions. For Pb nanofilms with thickness of 4 and 5 monolayers (ML) this will lead to a spectacular scenario: up to half of all the Cooper pairs nearly collapse, shrinking in the lateral size (parallel to the nanofilm) down to a few nanometers. As a result, the superconducting condensate will be a coherent mixture of almost molecule-like fermionic pairs with ordinary, extended Cooper pairs. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
