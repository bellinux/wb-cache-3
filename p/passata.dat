50|$|The play {{critically}} {{regarded as}} Novelli's most notable theatrical work, L'acqua cheta (Still Water), first opened at Florence's Teatro Alfieri on 28 January 1908. Though since {{hailed as a}} classic masterpiece of Florentine comedyeven described {{as the beginning of}} the modern Florentine vernacular theaterthe work opened to mixed critical reviews that were largely negative, at first receiving a positive review from only one critic, Mario Ferrigni. It nonetheless enjoyed an overwhelming popular success among theater-goers. The play was later turned into an operetta after receiving a musical score from composer Giuseppe Pietri: the Novelli-Pietro operetta premiered on 27 November 1920 in Rome. The numerous other productions born out of Novelli's fruitful association with the Alfieri included the premieres of Acqua <b>passata</b> (Water Under the Bridge) in 1908; Casa mia (My House), L'ascensione (The Ascension), and L'Ave Maria (Ave Maria) in 1909; Gallina vecchia (The Old Hen) in 1911; La Cupola (The Cupola) in 1913; and Canapone in 1914.|$|E

50|$|In 1608, {{from the}} press of Giovanni Fontani of Pisa, came forth a second book of fencing by Niccoletto Giganti in which he deals {{with the use of}} the single sword, sword and dagger and also the sword and rotella, the sword and targa, the sword and buckler, the sword and cape, the dagger alone, the dagger against the spear and the dagger alone against the sword. Subsequently he {{discusses}} grabs to the weapon and pommel strikes to the face, and of other grapples advising to put your left hand over the hilt of your opponent's sword. He proposes executing the <b>passata</b> sotto in the tempo in which your opponent performs a cavazione on the line of terza. Finally he discusses a new guard with the sword and dagger with the left foot forward, suggesting that he proposes to publish another book where he will teach all of the actions possible with the left foot forward. This treatise is illustrated with 53 figures, very badly drawn and likewise engraved; nevertheless his treatise is filled with very useful teachings.|$|E
40|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) {{combined with}} the concept of optothermal window (OW) is proposed as a new approach (LED-OW) to detect lycopene {{in a wide range of}} tomato-based products (tomato juice, tomato ketchup, tomato <b>passata</b> and tomato puree). Phytonutrient lycopene is a dominant antioxidant in these products while beta-carotene is present in significantly lower quantities. Therefore for all practical reasons the interfering effect of beta-carotene at 502 nm analytical wavelength can be neglected. The LED-OW method is low-cost and simple, yet accurate and precise. The major attributes of the new method are its rapid speed of response and the fact that no preparation whatsoever of the sample is needed before the analysis. The lycopene found in tomato products studied here varies from 8 mg/ 100 g to 60 mg/ 100 g fresh product. Results obtained by LED-OW method were compared to the outcome of conventional, time consuming spectrophotometric methods and the correlation was very good (R = 0. 98). Precision of the LED-OW instrumental setup ranged from 0. 5 to 7. 4 %; the RSD achieved for lycopene-richest samples (= 40 mg/ 100 g) did not exceed 1. 7 %. Repeatability of analysis by LED-OW was found to vary between 0. 7 and 7. 1 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical strategy for a large-scale screening of carotenoids in tomato fruits by exploiting {{the potentialities of}} the triple quadrupole–linear ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer (QqQLIT). The method involves separation on C 30 reversed-phase column and identification by means of diode array detection (DAD) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization–mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). The authentic standards of six model compounds were used to optimize the separative conditions and to predict the chromatographic behavior of untargeted carotenoids. An information dependent acquisition (IDA) was performed with (i) enhanced-mass scan (EMS) as the survey scan, (ii) enhanced-resolution (ER) scan to obtain the exact mass of the precursor ions (16 – 35 ppm), and (iii) enhanced product ion (EPI) scan as dependent scan to obtain structural information. LC-DAD-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) chromatograms were also acquired for the identification of targeted carotenoids occurring at low concentrations; for the first time, the relative abundance between the MRM transitions (ion ratio) {{was used as an}} extra tool for the MS distinction of structural isomers and the related families of geometrical isomers. The whole analytical strategy was high-throughput, because a great number of experimental data could be acquired with few analytical steps, and cost-effective, because only few standards were used; when applied to characterize some tomato varieties (‘Tangerine’, ‘Pachino’, ‘Datterino’, and ‘Camone’) and <b>passata</b> of ‘San Marzano’ tomatoes, our method succeeded in identifying up to 44 carotenoids in the ‘Tangerine’” variety...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} {{variability}} of stable isotope ratios and mineral composition in tomato and derivatives along the production chain (juice, <b>passata</b> and paste) in order to evaluate the possibility of tracing their geographical origin. The ratios 13 C/ 12 C, 15 N/ 14 N, 18 O/ 16 O, D/H, 34 S/ 32 S {{and the content of}} Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Y, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Tm, Yb, Ir, Tl, Pb, U and of nitrates, chlorides, sulphates and phosphates were measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Ion Chromatography, respectively. The tomato products were from three Italian regions – Piedmont, Emilia Romagna, and Apulia. By applying linear discriminant analysis on 17 of these parameters (Gd, La, Tl, Eu, Cs, Ni, Cr, Co, d 34 S, d 15 N, Cd, K, Mg, d 13 C, Mo, Rb and U) excellent discrimination among products from the three regions was achieved. Irrespective of the processing technology, over 95 % of the samples were correctly reclassified in cross-validation into the production site. The use of these parameters will allow the development of analytical control procedures {{that can be used to}} check the geographical provenance of Italian tomatoes and products derived from them...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that lycopene supplementation reduces the expression of oxidant-responsive heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) in basal conditions {{and in response to}} an oxidant challenge and determined whether this is temporally associated with increased cell viability. Methods: We determined basal and stimulated ex vivo expression of HO- 1 and cell viability in lymphocytes from volunteers after lycopene supplementation. Twenty-four healthy young men on a low lycopene diet consumed 1) 170 g of <b>passata</b> sauce with butter or 2) butter alone for 3 wk in a randomized crossover design. Results: Plasma lycopene concentrations {{at the end of the}} tomato and control trials were 0. 54 +/- 0. 20 versus 0. 20 +/- 0. 15 mu mol/L, respectively (P < 0. 05). There was a significant increase in the proportion of live cells (91 +/- 5 % versus 87 +/- 9 %) and a corresponding reduction in apoptosis (6 +/- 4 % versus 11 +/- 9 %) in untreated lymphocytes after supplementation (P < 0. 05), with no effect. on cell viability in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment. HO- 1 protein expression in basal conditions and induction of HO- 1 after hydrogen peroxide treatment was not different between trials. Conclusion: Lycopene supplementation did not affect basal oxidative stress or susceptibility to oxidant-induced stress as indicated by the expression of the oxidant-responsive protein HO- 1 and cell viability in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment. However, lycopene supplementation significantly reduced apoptosis in freshly harvested untreated lymphocytes. We conclude that this was not through an oxidant-mediated mechanism because of the lack of an effect on oxidant-responsive HO- 1...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for reliable analytical methods to verify {{the authenticity of the}} food we eat. First of all there is a growing enthusiasm for high quality food with a clear regional identity among consumers and scares such as BSE, chicken influenza and malpractice by some international food producers have added to public sensitivity regarding the validity of food origin labelling. In addition to heightened consumer awareness in the last few years, European Union policy on food has also been orientated towards safeguarding consumers. To achieve this scope the EU has on the one hand reinforced national control activities {{and on the other hand}} investigated new markers able to support food characterisation and geographical traceability, ensuring its authenticity. Along with elemental composition, the stable isotope ratios of bioelements such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur have been used for thirty years, both separately or jointly, in order to check the authenticity of different premium products. With regard to stable isotopes, this ability is based on isotopic fractionation occurring during physical and chemical processes, as well as along metabolic pathways. For this reason, the different isotopic ratios vary according to photosynthetic and nitrogen cycles, pedological characteristics of soils, agricultural practices and geographical origin. In contrast to stable isotope ratios, which mostly depend on climatic, hydrological or geographical conditions, elements are profoundly affected by soil geology and pedological characteristics, over and beyond ‘contamination’ during processing. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry methods were developed to characterise and determine the authenticity of Italian and European extra virgin olive oils, olive oil squalene/squalane, Italian alpine PDO cheeses, Italian tomatoes and tomato derived products (juice, <b>passata,</b> paste). In particular, the d 13 C and d 18 O of Italian extra virgin olive oils made it possible to distinguish samples from North and South Italy, whereas different dD values, determined for the first time along with d 18 Obulk, were found in oils from the Italian Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts, improving the differentiation of samples from Central Italy. The isotopic composition of rainfall, along with the average temperature and humidity on the two coasts, can explain these differences in the oils. The combination of elemental composition and isotopic ratios analysis extended to olive oils collected at eight European sites, allowed good discrimination in relation to geographical provenance. ä 13 C, ä 18 O and äD were shown to be significantly correlated to geographical and climatic factors (e. g. latitude, distance from the coast, temperature), whereas elemental composition was related to the geological characteristics of the soil where the products were grown. Furthermore, d 13 C was shown to be a suitable marker for identification of squalene/squalane origin. By defining d 13 C threshold values of - 27. 4 ‰ for olive oil squalene/squalane, the addition of shark products can be detected starting from a minimum of 10...|$|E
