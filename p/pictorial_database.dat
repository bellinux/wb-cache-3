40|$|The use {{of shape}} as a cue for {{indexing}} into <b>pictorial</b> <b>databases</b> has been traditionally based on global invariant statistics and deformable templates, {{on the one}} hand, and local edge correlation on the other.

The use of symmetry matching as a joint correlation measure between pairs of edge elements further constrains the comparison of edge maps. In addition, a natural organization of groups of symmetry into a hierarchy leads to a graph-based representation of relational structure of components of shape that allows for deformations by changing attributes of this relational graph. A graduate assignment graph matching algorithm is used to match symmetry structure in images to stored prototypes or sketches.

For each level of the Quadtree, formulae for the average numbers of internal, external white and external black nodes follow. Next, for each level of the Quadtree, the relationship between each node category of the two trees is presented. Based on the formulae developed, we study how the storage requirements of the two trees differ for each Quadtree level.

40|$|One of {{the strongest}} cues for {{retrieval}} of content information from images is shape. However, due to {{the wide range of}} transformations that an object might undergo, this is also the most difficult one to handle. It seems that shape retrieval {{is one of the major}} barriers nowadays to image databases being commonly used. We present an approach for shape retrieval from <b>pictorial</b> <b>databases</b> which is based on invariant features of the image. In particular we use a combination of semi-local multivalued invariant signatures and global features. Spatial relations and global properties are used to eliminate nonrelevant images before similarity is computed. The advantages of the proposed approach are its ability to handle images distorted by different viewpoint transformations, its ability to retrieve images even in situations in which part of the shape is missing (i. e., in case of occlusion or sketch-based queries), and its ability to support efficient indexing. We have implemented our approach in a heterogeneous database having a SQL-like user interface augmented with sketch-based queries. The system is built on top of a commercial database system and can be activated from the Web. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

We have investigated and developed a methodology that serves to automatically identify such a subset of aROIs (algorithmically detected ROIs) using different Image Processing Algorithms, IPAs, and appropriate clustering procedures. In human perception, an internal representation directs top-down, context-dependent sequences of eye movements to fixate on similar sequences of hROIs (human identified ROIs). In this paper, we introduce our methodology and we compare aROIs with hROIs as a criterion for evaluating and selecting bottom-up, context-free algorithms. An application is finally discussed.

40|$|Object {{recognition}} {{is a central}} problem in computer vision. When objects are defined by boundary curves, they can be represented either explicitly or implicitly. Implicit polynomial (IP) equations have long been known to offer certain advantages over more traditional parametric methods. However, the lack of general procedures for obtaining IP models of higher degree has prevented their general use in many practical applications. In most cases today, parametric equations are used to model curves and surfaces. One such parametric representation, elliptic Fourier Descriptors (EFD), has been widely used to represent 2 D and 3 D curves, as well as 3 D surfaces. Although EFDs can represent nearly all curves, it is often convenient to have an implicit algebraic description F(x, y) = 0, for several reasons. Algebraic curves and surfaces have proven very useful in many model-based applications. Various algebraic and geometric invariants obtained from these implicit models have been studied rather extensively, since implicit polynomials are well-suited to computer vision tasks, especially for single computation pose estimation, shape tracking, 3 D surface estimation from multiple images and efficient geometric indexing into large <b>pictorial</b> <b>databases.</b> In this paper, we present a new non-symbolic implicitization technique called the matrix annihilation method, for converting parametric Fourier representations to algebraic (implicit polynomial) representations, thereby benefiting from the features of both...|$|R
40|$|The {{search in}} <b>pictorial</b> <b>databases</b> {{has been based}} on various approaches, {{such as the use of}} histograms {{describing}} physical characteristics of raster images or of key words defining the contents of the picture from the semantic point of view. Our approach is based on the structural description, in which objects in the picture (represented by keywords) are linked by relations of various types. In order to perform an efficient search in the picture, it is necessary to have a tool at one's disposal that describes these relations in a formal way. Such a description would allow the user not only to search for a picture with specific properties, but also to perform transformations of the picture description. These transformations may infer some information from existing ones that may lead to an easier search for a specific picture. Another application of these transformations is the transformation of the picture description into standard graphical formats which add flexibility to the system using the approach described. The formalism used for picture description is XML. It is similar to the MPEG- 7 structure and semantic description. The pilot system with the features described has been designed, implemented and tested. The generalized concept of the system and relation to other XML-based picture formats (e. g. MPEG- 7) could allow the user to perform usability tests of functions of these formats...|$|R

Web browsers such as Netscape give access to an enormous range of such data. In order to make use of large amounts of pictorial and video data, it is necessary to develop indexing and retrieval methods. <b>Pictorial</b> <b>databases</b> have made great progress recently, to the extent that there are now a number of commercially available products. Video databases are now being researched and developed from a number of different viewpoints. Given a general indexing scheme for video, the next step is to reuse clips in further applications. In this paper we present an initial application for the reuse of video clips. The aim of the system is to resequence video clips for a particular application. We have chosen a well-constrained application for this purpose, the aim being to produce a video tour of a campus between designated start and destination points from a set of indexed video clips. We use clips of a guide entering and leaving buildings on our campus, and when visitors select a start location and a destination, the system will retrieve clips suitable for guiding the visitor along the correct path. The system uses an index of spatial relationships of key objects for the video clips to decide which clips provide the correct sequence of motion around the campus. Although the full power of the indexing notation is unnecessary for this simple problem, the results from this initial implementation indicate that the concept could be applicable to more complex problems...|$|R

40|$|We are {{investigating}} a graph matching approach for indexing into pictorial databases using shock graphs, a symmetry-based representation of shape. Each shape (or {{a collection of}} edge elements) is represented by a shock graph. Indexing of a query into a <b>pictorial</b> <b>database</b> is accomplished by comparing the corresponding shock graph to the graphs representing database elements and selecting the best match. This paper introduces a new metric for comparing shock graphs. The premise underlying the use of symmetry as a cue for indexing is that the correlation of pairs of edge elements in the sketch query and in the image is a more robust measure of indexing than simply correlating edge elements. Each pair of edge elements is represented by a symmetry curve, and can be extracted from real images and represented as singularities resulting from the propagation of each such orientation element. Previous work shows that these singularities, or shocks, can be detected, classi ed, grouped, and organized into a shock graph embedded in the plane. In previous work, we proposed {{the use of a}} graph comparison heuristic called the graduated assignment algorithm which casts the problem as an integer quadratic program. This heuristic has two drawbacks. First, the quadratic program does not fully capture the topological constraints of graph matching, and so even an optima...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Image processing systems have typically exhibited {{a high degree of}} application specificity. This makes it unlikely that any of the processing tasks for one application can be applied to another. Research has also found that such systems had not made use of knowledge about human perception although, it can be argued, such knowledge is independent of the application. This thesis takes the view that the structures which people perceive in pictures are of considerable importance to supporting picture-based human computer interaction. However, the design of systems which process pictures based on knowledge of human perception presents two major challenges. The first relates to determining the appropriate psychological knowledge that the computational modelling effort will be based upon. The second relates to the testing and evaluation of systems that aim to generate perceptually-valid structures, which poses significant problems because such systems are concerned with perceptual structures rather than semantic interpretations. An approach to developing picture processing systems is proposed that overcomes these problems. The approach represents a development strategy that exploits psychological theory in constructing image processing algorithms. The aim of these algorithms is to generate structures that match those perceived by humans. The approach enables new algorithms to be developed as additional psychological knowledge becomes available. Given appropriate training, users of such systems are able to see in images the structures that are generated by the system. The thesis presents the results of a study of perceptual and computational approaches to the processing of pictures. Motivations for {{and the development of a}} computational model based on perceptual grouping are described. A thorough evaluation of the computational model is performed which highlights both its value and limitations. Specific applications of the computational model in areas such as shape emergence in design, and <b>pictorial</b> <b>databases,</b> are then considered...|$|R

As a solution to the growing solid waste management problem in Sri Lanka, Local Authorities, NGOs, researchers and environmentalists have implemented several compo sting projects. As waste characteristics of municipal solid waste in Sri Lanka show a very high proportion of organic matter (60 - 85 %), high moisture content (60 - 75 %) and low calorific value (l 000 - 1200 kcal/kg). Most of these projects are currently abandoned or operating under poor conditions due to social, economic and technical problems encountered and none of options have solved the solid waste management problem itself. A key issue that is highlighted is the lack of qualified personnel (experts) to advise and assist Local Authorities to adopt the best solid waste management practices. Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems are favourable tool to overcome these problems. Therefore by capturing past mistakes, weak points and considering past experience, a user friendly Expert System called BESTCOMP was developed for better management of solid waste composting by Pradeshiya Sabhas in Sri Lanka. This research mainly focused on the behaviour of the physical, chemical and biological process in compo sting. The model is geared towards decision making as well as providing required expertise to solid waste composting hierarchy. BESTCOMP consists of many decision models such as compost process and control, <b>pictorial</b> <b>database,</b> site selection, technology selection, waste analysis reports, expertise information, Government laws and regulation on solid waste management, information desk for researchers and training tool, such that the user can identify problems faster, examine various alternatives and make prudent choices.
