40|$|On November 1, 2009, the Directive on Payment Services in the Internal Market (Payment Services Directive), which {{defines the}} legal {{framework}} {{for the establishment of}} a single market for payment services in the European Economic Area 2 and introduces a new category of payment service providers (known as “payment institutions”), was implemented in Austrian law by means of the Austrian Payment Services Act (Zahlungsdienstegesetz). The essential areas governed by the Payment Services Act are market access and licensing requirements for <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> (including the relevant supervisory provisions) as well as the issues of transparency, liability and recourse in the execution of payment services. The definition of <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> now allows nonbanks to provide payment services (subject to certain licensing and supervisory provisions), which – as classic banking transactions – were previously the exclusive domain of credit institutions in Austria. From the European Commission’s perspective, this change should facilitate access to the financial market for new payment service providers. Against this backdrop, this article provides an overview of the most important supervisory provisions in the Payment Services Act. The article then assesses the current significance of these newly defined <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> for the Austrian financial market and takes a look beyond Austria’s borders to discuss the situation in selected countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{in other}} areas of the {{financial}} market, progress toward the integration of payments markets has not yet been satisfactory. While the introduction of the euro was an important step in this direction, a single European payment area for cashless payments still does not exist. Current initiatives thus aim to lay the groundwork for integrated cross-border payment transactions, in particular by harmonizing the applicable legal framework. The European Commission’s New Legal Framework for Payments in the Internal Market initiative is of special importance here. It proposes, inter alia, the introduction of a new category of payment service providers (<b>payment</b> <b>institutions)</b> in addition to credit and e-money institutions that would perform payment services under comparatively less stringent licensing and supervision regulations. Against this background, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank conducted an empirical survey among Austrian market participants (banks and nonbanks) in the summer of 2005 to assess possible competition and risk-related implications of the introduction of <b>payment</b> <b>institutions</b> on the Austrian financial market. The survey showed that most of the Austrian market participants questioned were critical of the current draft Directive and that respondents shared the European Commission’s primary expectations - for example, that it will create a level playing field - only partly or not at all. On the contrary, they fear distortions of competition, increased risks and, over the long term, a loss of confidence in the stability of the payments market among end users. There is unanimous agreement among respondents that both payment and credit institutions should be subject to the same capital and supervision requirements in order to head off these risks. Furthermore, the survey shows that none of the Austrian market participants questioned is currently considering transformation into a payment institution. <b>Payment</b> <b>Institutions,...</b>|$|E
