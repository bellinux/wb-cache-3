40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, in the {{framework}} of the strategic groups' literature, it analyZes changes in productivity and efficiency of Spanish <b>private</b> and <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> over an eight-year period (1998 - 2006). Second, by adapting the decomposition of the Malmquist productivity indices suggested by Färe et al. (1994), it proposes similar components decomposing the Luenberger productivity indicator. Initially, productivity is decomposed into technological and efficiency changes. Thereafter, this efficiency change is decomposed into pure efficiency, scale and congestion changes. Empirical results demonstrate that productivity improvements are partially due to technological innovation. Furthermore, it is shown how the competition between <b>private</b> and <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> develops in terms of the analyzed productivity and efficiency components. While private banks enjoy better efficiency change, <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> contribute more to technological progress. Consequently, the Luenberger components are used as cluster analysis inputs. Thus, economic interpretations of the resulting performance groups are made via key differences in productivity components. Finally, following the strategic groups' literature, supplementary insights are gained by linking these performance groups with banking ratios.

40|$|Developments in risk-transfer {{instruments}} and risk management techniques {{in the last}} two decades have fundamentally changed how banks manage their assets and liabilities. In this document we show that, for all three sectors of German universal <b>banks</b> (<b>private</b> commercial <b>banks,</b> <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> and cooperative banks), asset-liability dependency declined over the period 1994 - 2007, the decline was strongest for those banks that use more than sector-average amounts of derivatives. Only in the case of private commercial banks, we do find that lower regulatory capital has coincided with higher asset-liability dependencies. Over our sample period, the difference has diminished since poorly-capitalized private commercial banks have reduced their asset-liability dependencies more intensively than their well-capitalized counterparts. Moreover, we find that profitability matters for the asset-liability dependency but not in the same way for all three sectors. Asset-liability dependency is lower for private commercial banks with higher provision income, <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> with lower ROE volatilities and cooperative banks with higher ROEs.

The situation created after the first banking law of 1921 and the simultaneous creation of the banking cartel (Banking Control Council-Consejo Superior Bancario or CSB), generated a series of defence mechanisms put in place by the <b>savings</b> <b>banks.</b> The most important of these was the creation of regional federations of <b>savings</b> <b>banks.</b> Bank federations in Spain emerged as a response to regulatory changes that modified the otherwise equal framework for business under which <b>private</b> commercial and <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> could compete.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} bank prudential regulation {{in an era}} of financial liberalization and intense competition, together with the lack of empirical research on capital adequacy in the Spanish banking system, shape the motivation for this study. This research examines the impact of the Spanish bank capital adequacy regulation on capital augmentations (changes in the total amount of the capital) of banking institutions operating in Spain. The period analyzed is 1987 - 90, during which deregulation and the 1985 risk-based capital requirements have been two major forces in the Spanish banking markets. An empirical model of capital augmentations is developed for Spanish banks. The general model (employing regulatory and book-value capital) for both <b>private</b> and <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> appears to explain better the capital augmentations of <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> compared with those of private banks. One of the main findings in this general model is that capital adequacy regulation appears to be a stricter constraint for <b>savings</b> <b>banks.</b> Market-value capital is also employed in the model for the Spanish private banks quoted on the Spanish stock market, but the explanatory power of the model is not improved. When bank size is introduced into the analysis, the results appear to indicate that larger banks might have certain advantages in terms of capital ratios and in terms of capital augmentations. The findings of this research have implications for the role of the market in regulating capital adequacy, for the deregulation - reregulation framework of banking, the economic desirability of 'functional' (versus institutional) supervisory regulation of banks, and for the competitive neutrality of bank legislation...|$|R

25|$|Between 1978 and 1981, {{when the}} United States and Puerto Rican economies were {{suffering}} from high inflation rates, local banks were facing losses {{due to an}} increasing number in bankruptcies and unemployment rates, and some were forced to either close, merge, or sell portions of their assets. To counter these economic conditions, Westernbank applied conservative policies and banking practices that included tightening its credit lending criteria, assuming stricter loan to value ratios, favoring collateralized loans, and restructuring its assets and liabilities. In 1988, facing an impending recession in the US and Puerto Rico, Westernbank began applying the same conservative measures, to reduce inherent risks and protect the bank’s capital position.

40|$|Since {{economic}} reforms began, the Chinese state has shifted {{the locus of}} control over the allocation of resources from the fiscal to the financial ledger (Sehrt, 1999). Under the planning system, funds were mobilized by setting prices to concentrate profits in state-owned industry (Naughton, 1995). During the reform period, market competition eroded the profitability of SOEs, and the government struggled to establish an effective taxation system to generate revenue (Wong, Heady, and Woo, 1995). However, by asserting its control over the banking system, the state was able to continue directing national resources to support its most important political constituencies, in particular urban workers in state-owned enterprises (Brandt and Zhu, 2000). This strategy was facilitated by the rapid growth of individual <b>private</b> <b>savings</b> in state-owned <b>banks,</b> which have come to dominate China’s national savings (Kraay, 2000). 1 Thus, during the reform period, the financial system increasingly became the key mechanism by which the government realized its distributional goals...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether a credit crunch occurred in Germany during the recent financial crisis and to analyze the underlying factors. In order to disentangle credit supply and demand we specify a theory-based dynamic disequilibrium model of the German credit market. To estimate this model we use a new approach based on Bayesian Inference suggested by Bauwens and Lubrano (2007). Besides the analysis of the whole banking sector we will apply the model to five groups of banks (big <b>private</b> <b>banks,</b> Landesbanken, <b>savings</b> <b>banks,</b> credit cooperatives, regional institutions of credit cooperatives) that were affected differently by the financial crisis. The results suggest that a credit crunch did not occur in Germany during the recent economic crisis as well as during the following recovery starting in 2010. Furthermore, we find that especially those banks that were more affected by the financial crisis through huge impairments restricted their credit supply more than others. Both supply and demand side factors contributed to the stabilization of credit financing. This suggests that the structure of the German banking sector as well as economic policy measures avoided a credit crunch...|$|R
