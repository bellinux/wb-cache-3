Variation in spare part, spare part 2 ̆ 7 s life service, and {{procurement lead time}} tend to increase number of spare part request. On the other hand, huge number of inventories has no direct correlation with plant availability {{as the fact that}} many break-down equipment need extended repair time due to unavailable spare part. Inventory also became main topic on company performance especially on financial side. This paper will discuss spare part procurement method on Steel Making Plant that projected able to maintain and increase Plant Availability and concern to inventory level.

The parametric shape models used are superquadrics, as recovered from depth data. The primary contribution of our research lies in a principled solution to the difficult problems of object <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> and model indexing. The novelty of our approach is {{in the use of}} a formal statistical approach for superquadric <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> and a formal evidential framework for model indexing. In addition, the method used for model indexing is amenable to the use of massive parallelism using a connectionist implementation of evidential semantic networks.

40|$|International audienceObject {{recognition}} {{or human}} pose estimation methods often resort to a decomposition into {{a collection of}} parts. This local representation has significant advantages, especially in case of occlusions and when the ``object'' is non-rigid. Detection and recognition requires modelling {{the appearance of the}} different object parts as well as their spatial layout. The latter can be complex and requires the minimization of complex energy functions, which is prohibitive in most real world applications and therefore often omitted. However, ignoring the spatial layout puts all the burden on the classifier, whose only available information is local appearance. We propose a new method to integrate the spatial layout into the <b>parts</b> <b>classification</b> without costly pairwise terms. We present an application to body <b>parts</b> <b>classification</b> for human pose estimation. As a second contribution, we introduce edge features from RGB images as a complement to the well known depth features used for body <b>parts</b> <b>classification</b> from Kinect data...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} has developed and implemented a part recognition and classification structure to execute parts verification in a multi-level dependent demand manufacturing system. The part recognition algorithm enables {{the parent and}} child relationship between parts to be recognised in a finite-capacitated manufacturing system. This algorithm was developed using SIMAN simulation language and implemented in a multi-level dependent demand manufacturing simulation model. The <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> structure enables the modelling of a multi-level dependent demand manufacturing between parts {{to be carried out}} effectively. The <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> structure was programmed using Visual Basic Application (VBA) and was integrated to the work-to-list generated from a simulated MRP model. This <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> structure was then implemented in the multi-level dependent demand manufacturing simulation model. Two stages of implementation, namely parameterisation and execution, of the part recognition and classification structure were carried out. A real case study was used and five detail steps of execution were processed. Simulation experiments and MRP were run to verify and validate the part recognition and classification structure. The results led to the conclusion that implementation of the recognition and classification structure has effectively verified the correct parts and sub-assemblies used for the correct product and order. No parts and sub-assemblies shortages were found, and the quantity required was produced. The scheduled release for some orders was delayed due to overload of the required resources. When the loading is normal, all scheduled release timing is adhered to. The recognition and classification structure has a robust design; hence it can be easily adapted to new systems parameter to study a different or more complex case...|$|E
40|$|<b>Part</b> <b>classification</b> and coding {{is still}} {{considered}} as laborious and time-consuming exercise. Keeping in view, the crucial role, which it plays, in developing automated CAPP systems, the {{attempts have been made}} in this article to automate a few elements of this exercise using a shape analysis model. In this study, a 24 -vector directional template is contemplated to represent the feature elements of the parts (candidate and prototype). Various transformation processes such as deformation, straightening, bypassing, insertion and deletion are embedded in the proposed simulated annealing (SA) -like hybrid algorithm to match the candidate part with their prototype. For a candidate part, searching its matching prototype from the information data is computationally expensive and requires large search space. However, the proposed SA-like hybrid algorithm for solving the <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> problem considerably minimizes the search space and ensures early convergence of the solution. The application of the proposed approach is illustrated by an example part. The proposed approach is applied for the classification of 100 candidate parts and their prototypes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As input, we use a depth image in which each pixel is classified to be either from a particular robot part or the background. The classifier is a random decision forest trained on {{a large number of}} synthetically generated and labeled depth images.

Pooling these votes over all foreground pixels and subsequent clustering gives us an estimate of the true joint positions. Due to the intrinsic parallelism of pixel-wise classification, this approach can run in super real-time and is more efficient than previous ICP-like methods. We quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of this approach on synthetic data. We also demonstrate that the method produces accurate joint estimates on real data despite being purely trained on synthetic data...|$|E

40|$|Castree {{identified}} {{the need for}} labour geography to understand ‘transnational spheres of organising’. The increased focus on transnational solidarity provides an important framework for using scale to understanding different ways of organising (Wetlesen, 2008). This paper proposes to use a five <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> of labour responses to corporate globalisation to explore how scale influences labour organising. How and why workers organise at different scales of operation has implications for international solidarity. This paper will also explore some of the tensions between unions at national and international/ regional levels. Increasingly unions are pursuing multiple strategies of organising, for example, working with social movements as well as operating within formal social dialogue structures. The five <b>part</b> <b>classification</b> of labour responses to corporate globalisation {{can be seen as}} a historically evolving continuum. • 1. Multinational collective bargaining Multinational collective bargaining was an important attempt to engage with multinational companies but has been sometimes undermined by the perspectives of trade unions, which remained national in focus. National trade unions need to develop coherent transnational strategies by sector. • 2. Labour codes and codes of conduct Voluntary codes of conduct were a response to some of the failures of governments and international agencies to implement labour standards. However, they would be more effective if governments played a more active role in implementation. • 3. European/global workers councils and social dialogue European/global workers councils are structures, within multinational companies, that enable workers and management to discuss issues of concern. The short comings of these arrangements are that they are often under-resourced and meetings are only annual events. They highlight some of the national pressures that trade union representatives experience in trying to operate transnationally. • 4. New labour internationalism and community coalitions The development of union- community coalitions draws in a wider range of groups into labour struggles but understanding different organisational cultures and ways of organising takes a long time. The main issue for the future is how to maintain and sustain long term coalitions, sometimes over long distances. • 5. Organising marginalised workers – new forms of labour solidarity Specific initiatives to organise marginalised workers may pose some challenges for existing trade unions but workers in both informal and formal sectors need to work together and widen the scope of labour constituencies geographically.
