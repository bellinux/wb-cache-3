2500|$|From 1971, {{under the}} {{guidance}} of newly hired press secretary Allen Callaghan, a former Australian Broadcasting Corporation political journalist, Bjelke-Petersen developed a high level of sophistication in dealing with news media.

The Premier's public profile rose rapidly with the resulting [...] media coverage. Bjelke-Petersen began regular media and parliamentary attacks on the Whitlam Labor government, vowing to have it defeated, and he and Whitlam exchanged frequent verbal barbs, culminating in the prime minister's 1975 description of the Queensland premier as [...] "a Bible-bashing bastard... a <b>paranoic,</b> a bigot and fanatical". The pair clashed over federal plans to halt the sale of Queensland coal to [...] Japan, take over the administration of Aboriginal affairs, remove outback petrol subsidies and move the Australian border in the Torres Strait southwards to a point midway between Queensland and Papua New Guinea.

60|$|It {{had better}} be stated here and now {{at the outset that}} the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly {{addicted}} runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm {{on the one hand and}} on the other a happily chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, <b>paranoic</b> bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.|$|E

5000|$|He is a {{large man}} who does not see himself as fat, preferring to call himself [...] "well covered" [...] or having a chest that has [...] "slipped a bit". From Asterix and the Banquet onwards—previously he had simply {{expressed}} ignorance of being fat, such as when he merely commented that {{he wished he had}} known he was too fat to pose as a lion in Asterix the Gladiator—Obelix is so in denial over this matter that he usually does not even notice when other people refer to him as [...] "that fat one", and often shows total confusion over which fat person people are referring to. When he does understand the allusions are made on his behalf he flies into a rage and starts beating up the person who said it. Sometimes, when he is in a bad mood, just hearing the word [...] "fat"—even if it is not in reference to him—can quickly enrage him. Being called fat, or being hinted as being fat, {{is one of the main}} causes of conflicts between Asterix and Obelix which leads to more developing conflicts in which they must work together, once escalating to the point that Obelix actually gave Asterix amnesia when he hit him too hard during an argument (Asterix and the Actress). Although they usually simply insult each other verbally they inevitably make up swiftly. Sometimes, Obelix can be so <b>paranoic</b> over the allusion of the word Fat that he can even break the fourth wall with the mere mention of this. Visibly in Asterix and the Black Gold, when the narrator points out that their (Asterix and Obelix's) vessel was pulled like a [...] "Big and fat fish", Obelix became clearly offended and yelled [...] "WHO IS FAT!?"

The aims of {{this study}} are (i) to assess the {{drop-out}} rate in an outpatient sample with mood disorder diagnosis in a psychotherapy unit; (ii) to focus clinical and sociodemographic variables related with drop-out; (iii) to delineate a psychopathological profile of the dropping-out patient through the SCL- 90 -R and OPD scores. Method. The sample {{of this study}} includes 90 depressive patients, which came to our service for a psychotherapy. The outcome is classified as drop-out and non drop-out. Each patient is submitted to the multidimensional scale SCL- 90 -R {{in the course of the}} first interview. At the end of the first visit each patient has been evaluated through the first and the fourth OPD axis. A descriptive analysis of all the data collected was made and the principal links between clinical and sociodemographic variables and dropout, between SCL- 90 -R score and drop-out, and between OPD scores and drop-out were detected. Results. About 42 % of the patients were drop-out, of which 89 % by the third session. The variables associated with drop-out are: pathological score in the <b>paranoic</b> and interpersonal sensibility scale of SCL- 90 -R, low compliance scores, low integration of defences, self perception, object's perception and link. Discussion. The drop-out rate in depressive patients turned out to be frequent.

Slowing of the background activity with paroxysmal changes. Type 2. Paroxysmal activity. Type 3. Slowing of the background activity only. Type 4. No change (the background activity and paroxysmal activity). The four types of EEG changes were set against various clinical features. 1. Somewhat higher correlation {{was found between the}} paroxysmal type of EEG change and the patient 2 ̆ 7 s history of head injury. 2. Doses of the drugs were not correlated with the EEG changes. 3. The types of the drug-induced EEG changes were not correlated with psychic events, such as readaptation in the hospital life, improvement of rapport and appearance of partial insight (Krankheitsgefuhl) as the landmarks of clinical improvement. 4. EEG variability in the course of drug therapy should be taken into consideration. Patients were divided into two groups : Group 1. Variable : new occurrence of EEG changes in the frames of slowing of the background and/or appearance of paroxysmal activity. Group 2. Unchanged : no newly occurred change in EEGs. Clinical improvement was exceedingly high in the variable group, especially in those with additional paroxysmal activity. 5. Classical three disease types (hebephrenic, catatonic and <b>paranoic)</b> were not correlated with EEG changes; while clinical courses, typical or atypical, were more intimately related with EEG variability. There was high correlation between the atypical course and the variable group, especially those with additional paroxysmal change. Clinical remission was high in the atypical schizophrenics.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis thesis has had as {{its purpose}} {{the study of}} the {{measurement}} of the emotion of anger. Its method is that of an examination, evaluation and summarization of all scientific studies in the experimental psychology of anger. It sources will be the recognized journals of psychology plus the writer's own research. It assumers as a postulate for the thesis that measurement is the most exact description of physical phenomena by the method of comparison to a fixed and known quantity. It defines emotion as a configuration of feeling tones arising out of the disturbed functioning of the viscera and glands, plus an overt set of behaviour patterns which show a stirred up state of the organism plus a lack of ability {{on the part of the}} individual to handle the situation in accordance with his known intellectual capabilities. Anger is best described as the emotion arising out of the thwarting of the personality, desires, and purposes. Physiologically, anger results from the functioning of the thoracic-lumbar section of the autonomic nervous system; it is correlated in its functioning with the emotion of fear, and is antagonism functionally, with the emotions of sex and hunger. Psychologically, anger is described as an emotion that arises only when there is a fair margin of safety on the part of the individual in gaining his purpose by such overt behaviors. Introspectively, anger is unpleasant. Anger may express itself subjectively, and by fantasy of repression and in so doing, it has its psychoanlytical phases. Genetically, anger arises in early infancy, and with experience changes, and is modified into socialized behaviour. Anger has its abnormal psychology in the individual who cannot get angry, in the irritable person, in the person who has temper tantrums, in the individual who holds a grudge for a long time, and finally in the <b>paranoic</b> who believes everyone is persecuting him. On the theoretical side, anger may arouse from the disturbed viscera or muscies or from the passage of stimuli through the thalamus. Anger may possibly be differentiated from the other emotions by the sensations arising from its expression...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty male {{patients}} hospitalized in Johbu Hospital and managed in one ward {{were divided into two}} groups according to mental status. One consists of fixed state schizophrenia patients, named the fixed group. Room assignments were rigidly maintained in this group. The other is named the non-fixed group. Their rooms were separate from the former group and attended by appointed nurses. Application of resocialization of the patients was attempted, with the effects obtained over a period of eighteen months 2 ̆ 7 hospitalization and their analysis by the use of Moreno 2 ̆ 7 s method of Sociometry. There are, however, many problems to solve if Moreno calls three kinds of Tele, i. e. Attraction, Repulsion and Indifference, is directly used as a test for the patients. Therefore Acquaintance Test was at the same time used in order to meet these problems. Firstly, after eighteen months 2 ̆ 7 treatment, all the in-patients took the test to provide a crosssectional characterization of their human relationships. The result suggested that the highly socialized patients undergoing occupational therapy were the most influential factor in the relationships of all the in-patients. Secondly, the vertical relationship of the patients undergoing occupational therapy was studied. Thirdly, a tentative method for patients with high socialization to work on patients with low socialization was applied, producing several findings. 1) Even after a long spell of 2 ̆ 2 working-on 2 ̆ 2, the larger part of the schizophrenic patients with sufficient ability to read did not even know the names of their room-mates, which constitutes a great obstacle to the rehabilitation of patients. 2) The influence of the make-up of the room upon its inmates was not to be ignored in terms of their unity. When the room is of a too non-confining and informal make-up, the inmates do not feel they belong to it and find difficulty in communicating with other room-mates. When, to the contrary, the room has a too closed-in and exclusive structure, the inmates show a strong tendency to individual seclusion. 3) The way patients stand in their relationships with other patients differs rather markedly according to the kinds of mental disease. The patients showed greater ability than expected in forming correct judgment of other patients from the standpoint of social adaptability. Among schizophrenic patients, <b>paranoic</b> ones reject positively other patients, while not being so strongly rejected themselves. Autistic patients are in loose connection with only patients of their own selection. Epileptics definitely choose and reject other patients, and are actively rejected by them. The results of the test indicate that psychopathies have no tendency to rule the group of the patients in the hospital but to separate themselves from it.
