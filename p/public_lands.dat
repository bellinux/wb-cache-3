5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating the use of <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated {{millions of acres of}} forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E
40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>land</b> {{development}} is an approach where the <b>public</b> authority acquires <b>land</b> for development, services the <b>land</b> with <b>public</b> infrastructure, and transfers the serviced building plots to private building developers or self-developing end-users. Motivations to use <b>public</b> <b>land</b> development {{can be divided}} to planning goal related motivations and financial motivations. In this paper, we study management of public risks related {{to the use of}} <b>public</b> <b>land</b> development by analysing case studies located in Finland and the Netherlands, countries known to have strong tradition in <b>public</b> <b>land</b> development. Our findings indicate that, whereas <b>public</b> <b>land</b> development has efficiencies in managing the risks related to the achievement of public planning goals, the management of the financial risks related to the <b>public</b> <b>land</b> development approach can be remarkably difficult even in countries with wide experience in <b>public</b> <b>land</b> development...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} {{of democracy and}} the market economy ideology in post-communist Central and Eastern Europe is encouraging changes in rural <b>public</b> <b>land</b> policy. A system of state <b>public</b> <b>land</b> is being partly dismantled, {{to be replaced by}} private ownership. This paper exploresthe present dynamics of the rural <b>public</b> <b>land</b> reprivatization process in Slovakia. In Slovakia approximately 40 % of rural <b>public</b> <b>land</b> are being reprivatized. Evidence indicates that the reprivatization of <b>public</b> <b>land</b> is having a detrimental effect on the management of State Forests, National Parks and game management. The integrated, centrally planned <b>public</b> <b>land</b> system of the communist era is being fragmented by reprivatization. This paper argues that this process is creating barriers to the achievement of the sustainable management of the natural resources of rural Slovakia. Recent Governmentof Slovakia laws and policies on sustainable development and environmental management, and adherence to international environmental conventions may provide opportunities for enlightened change in the reprivatization process. A <b>public</b> <b>land</b> system in a democratic free market economy can be an effective mechanism to secure the protection and the sustainable managementof forests, farmland, game, outstanding landscapes and wildlife. This is an opportune time to debate the future of rural <b>public</b> <b>land</b> in Central and Eastern Europe in order that enlightened policy making may be fostered. ...|$|R

He was a national political figure by this point, and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E

In response to the problem, they created the Bank of Indiana and sold nine million acres (36,000km²) of <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> to finance their projects. The General Assembly relocated the capitol to Indianapolis in 1824, and in 1831 they authorized the construction of the first dedicated statehouse.|$|E
