40|$|The {{marginal}} cost of plant capacity, {{measured by the}} price of equity is significantly procyclical. Yet, {{the price of a}} major intermediate input into expanding <b>plant</b> <b>capacity,</b> <b>investment</b> goods, is coutercyclical. The ratio of these prices is Tobin's q. We interpret the fact that Tobin's q differs from unity at all reflects that there are diminishing returns to expanding plant capacity by installing investment goods (`adjustment costs'). Also, its numerator and denominator have such different cyclical properties. We find the sign switch in their covariation with output reflects interaction of our adjustment cost specification with the operation of two shocks: one which affects the demand for equity and another which shifts the technology for producing investment goods. The adjustment costs cause the two prices to respond differently to these two shocks which is why it is possible to choose the shock variances to reproduce the sign switch. These model features are incorporated into a modified version of a model analyzed in Boldrin, Christiano and Fisher (1995) which contains assumptions designed to account for the observed mean return on risk free and risky assets. We find various modifications not only account for the sign switch but also continue to account for the salient features of mean asset returns. We turn to business cycle implications of our model. The model does as well as standard models with respect to conventional business cycle measures of volatility and comovement with output, and on one dimension the model significantly dominates standard models. The factors that help it account for prices and rates of return on assets also help it account for the fact that employment across a broad range of sectors moves together over the cycle. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{the shares}} of {{variable}} renewable generation in power systems increase, so does the need for, inter alia, flexible balancing mechanisms. These mechanisms help ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system by compensating for fluctuations in supply or demand. However, a focus on short-term balancing is sometimes neglected when assessing future capacity expansions with long-term energy system models. Developing heuristics that can simulate short-term system issues {{is one way of}} augmenting the functionality of such models. To this end, we present an extended functionality to the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), which captures the impacts of short-term variability of supply and demand on system adequacy and security. Specifically, we modelled the system adequacy as the share of wind energy is increased. Further, we enable the modelling of operating reserve capacities required for balancing services. The dynamics introduced through these model enhancements are presented in an application case study. This application indicates that introducing short-term constraints in long-term energy models may considerably influence the dispatch of power <b>plants,</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>investments,</b> and, ultimately, the policy recommendations derived from such models...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{concludes that}} Chilean farmers have lower or competitive winter milk production costs, measured {{as the cost}} per unit of production and per unit of production factor. This research highlights Chilean and New Zealand advantages, being the formers lower labor cost and lower value of land, and the latter's existence of the veal market and a completely vertically integrated industrial organization. This industrial organization provides "tacit protection" to NZ dairy farmers, this protection provides the necessary stability to permit complete specialization by dairy farmers, which increases efficiency. The "tacit protection" explains the higher prices paid to New Zealand winter milk producers in comparison to Chilean farmers. Finally NZ's Industrial Organization (I. O.) (farmers, companies and NZDB, completely vertically integrated) eliminates the additional cost of having predominantly even year round milk production and having a lower reception & elaboration (processing) capacity. Finally the research shows Chilean disadvantages: the political economic environment and the Industrial Organization. The first disadvantage is related {{the use of the}} exchange rate as an economic tool, which has reduced its real value by 40 % since 1990. And the second disadvantage is the pressure on farmers from elaborating companies to produce more during the winter in order to avoid a larger <b>plant</b> reception/elaboration <b>capacity</b> <b>investment,</b> which has a high cost if the seasonal production system were predominantly used instead. Another disadvantage for Chilean farmers is that companies keep farmers convinced this is the best production system, and that they are not able to compete with countries such as New Zealand. Companies like Soprole (controlled by the NZDB) and Nestle, greatly benefit out of the winter production system, by having lower infrastructure costs and by having all the imports controlled in their hands. This creates monopolic powers in the final product market. NZDB and the NZ I.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on strategic capacity management concerned with determining the sizes, types, and timing of <b>capacity</b> <b>investments</b> and adjustments under uncertainty. Specific attention is given to recent developments to incorporate multiple decision makers, multiple capacity types, hedging, and risk aversion. Capacity {{is a measure of}} processing abilities and limitations and is represented as a vector of stocks of various processing resources, while investment is the change of capacity and includes expansion and contraction. After discussing general issues in <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> problems, the paper reviews models of <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> under uncertainty in three settings: The first reviews optimal <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> by single and multiple risk-neutral decision makers in a stationary environment where capacity remains constant. Allowing for multiple capacity types, the associated optimal capacity portfolio specifies the amounts and locations of safety capacity in a processing network. Its key feature is that it is unbalanced; i. e., regardless of how uncertainties are realized, one typically will never fully utilize all capacities. The second setting reviews the adjustment of capacity over time and the structure of optimal investment dynamics. The paper ends by reviewing how to incorporate risk aversion in <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> and contrasts hedging strategies involving financial versus operational means. <b>Capacity,</b> <b>Investment,</b> Expansion, Planning, Real Options, Hedging, Risk, Mean-Variance...|$|R

We model a monopolist firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible versus dedicated) and capacity level under demand uncertainty. Differing from {{the majority of the}} stochastic <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> literature, we assume that the firm is budget constrained and can relax its budget constraint by borrowing from a creditor. The creditor offers technology-specific loan contracts to the firm, after which the firm makes its technology choice and subsequent decisions.

We model a monopolist firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible versus dedicated) and capacity level under demand uncertainty. Differing from {{the majority of the}} stochastic <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> literature, we assume that the firm is budget-constrained both in the <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> and production stages, and that the production stage budget is stochastic. Our analysis contributes to the <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> literature by extending the theory of stochastic <b>capacity</b> <b>investment</b> to understand the impact of financial constraints, and by analyzing the impact of budget variability on the profitability of the firm. We demonstrate that budget variability is detrimental for the firm with either technology, thus the firm is better off by hedging the budget uncertainty through proper risk management. One of our main contributions is to analyze the impact of financial constraints on the flexible versus dedicated technology choice. We demonstrate that without production costs,a higher internal budget favors the flexible technology only when the fixed cost of the flexible technology is higher. With production costs in place, {{and in the absence of}} fixed cost difference, a higher internal budget favors the dedicated technology.

40|$|This thesis explores {{generation}} capacity expansions {{in power}} markets using a real options approach. Our framework considers several features of actual power markets, including time-varying demand and generation technologies with different cost characteristics. We propose a capacity expansion model where the market clearing {{is determined by}} equilibrium modelling. Further, we compute the marginal value of additional generation capacity, solve a series of optimal stopping problems and simulate the operation and investment decisions of all market participants over a horizon of several decades. The thesis consists of two papers applying the framework in different settings. In the first paper, "Electricity Capacity Expansion in a Cournot Duopoly", we examine a duopoly where base and peak load power plants are available to the investor and compare it to a market governed by a central planner. We find that both imperfect competition {{in the market and}} a time-varying demand boost peak load investments. In a numerical example, we notice that welfare losses from producers exercising market power exceed 10 %. The second paper, "A real options approach to generation capacity expansion in imperfectly competitive power markets", is our main contribution to the thesis. In this article, we expand our framework to include renewables, rationing and firms with different levels of market power, and we apply it to the German power market. We find that the need for peak load power plants increases with the share of renewables. Without monetary incentives, gas-fired power plants are not profitable for merchant investors. When all types of gas-fired power <b>plants</b> receive <b>capacity</b> payments, <b>investments</b> in combined cycling power plants occur at the expense of investments in renewables. Hence, we argue that only peaking power <b>plants</b> should receive <b>capacity</b> payments. This will reduce rationing while making renewable investments profitable...|$|R

We consider manufacturing situations that differ in sales contribution, in market elasticity to sales effort, work-in-process costs, and demand sensitivity to lead time. If demand is insensitive to lead time we find that for situations with a low sales contribution and high work-in-process costs (for example the manufacturing of capacity equipment {{that is at the}} end of the innovative life cycle, such as food processing machines and textile printing machines), using a dynamic demand rate policy can bring substantial improvements in profit. Moreover, when using the optimal demand rate policy, the profit is quite insensitive to the initial <b>capacity</b> <b>investment.</b> If demand is sensitive to lead time, using a dynamic demand rate policy brings substantial increases in profit in all situations considered.
