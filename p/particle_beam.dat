5|$|ARPA {{responded by}} forming Project Defender, {{initially}} considering {{a wide variety}} of far-out concepts like <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> weapons, lasers and huge fleets of space-borne interceptor missiles, the latter known as Project BAMBI. In May 1958, York also began working with Lincoln Labs, MIT's radar research lab, to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or other means. This project emerged as the Pacific Range Electromagnetic Signature Studies, or Project PRESS.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another <b>particle</b> <b>beam.</b> This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
25|$|In July 1989, the Beam Experiments Aboard a Rocket (BEAR) program {{launched}} a sounding rocket containing a neutral <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> (NPB) accelerator. The experiment successfully demonstrated that a <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> would operate and propagate as predicted outside {{the atmosphere and}} that there are no unexpected side-effects when firing the beam in space. After the rocket was recovered, the <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> was still operational. According to the BMDO, the research on neutral <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> accelerators, which was originally funded by the SDIO, could eventually be used to reduce the half-life of nuclear waste products using accelerator-driven transmutation technology.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{difference}} between the creation and control of charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> and neutral <b>particle</b> <b>beams,</b> as only the first type can be manipulated to a sufficient extent by devices based on electromagnetism.

50|$|Particle-beam weapons can use charged or neutral particles, and can {{be either}} endoatmospheric or exoatmospheric. <b>Particle</b> <b>beams</b> as beam weapons are {{theoretically}} possible, but practical weapons have not been demonstrated yet. Certain types of <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> {{have the advantage of}} being self-focusing in the atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|According to Corso, {{the reverse}} {{engineering}} of these artifacts indirectly {{led to the}} development of accelerated <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> devices, fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit chips and Kevlar material.|$|E
25|$|A {{storage ring}} {{is a type}} of {{circular}} particle accelerator in which a continuous or pulsed <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> may be kept circulating {{for a long period of}} time, up to many hours. Gerard K. O'Neill invented the first particle storage ring in 1956.|$|E
25|$|For instance, at the CERN or SLAC, {{the very}} large {{particle}} accelerators were designed while taking terrestrial tides into account for proper operation.

50|$|Charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> diverge rapidly due to mutual repulsion, so neutral <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> {{are more}} {{commonly}} proposed. A neutral-particle-beam weapon ionizes atoms by either stripping an electron off of each atom, or by allowing each atom to capture an extra electron. The charged particles are then accelerated, and neutralized again by adding or removing electrons afterwards.|$|R

25|$|On September 27, 1993 the {{cryogenic}} cooling {{system of the}} Tevatron Accelerator was named an International Historic Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The system, which provides cryogenic liquid helium to the Tevatron's superconducting magnets, was the largest low-temperature system in existence upon its completion in 1978. It keeps the coils of the magnets, which bend and focus the <b>particle</b> <b>beam,</b> in a superconducting state so that they consume only ⅓ of the power they would require at normal temperatures.|$|E

There are {{different}} forms of radiation therapy, including 3D conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> therapy and brachytherapy, which are commonly used in the treatments of cancers of the head and neck. Most people with head and neck cancer who are treated in the United States and Europe are treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy using high energy photons. At higher doses, head and neck radiation is associated with thyroid dysfunction and pituitary axis dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|Propagation of charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> in {{background}} plasma {{as a method}} of space charge neutralization has been shown to achieve a high degree of charge and current neutralization and therefore enables nearly ballistic propagation and focusing of charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams.</b> Correspondingly, use of plasmas for propagation of charged <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> has important applications for transport and focusing of intense <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> in inertial fusion and high energy density laboratory plasma physics. However, the streaming of beam ions through a background plasma can lead to development of the two-stream instability between the beam ions and the plasma electrons. The beam electric and magnetic fields enhanced by the two-stream instability can lead to defocusing of the ion beam. Using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we study the scaling of the instability-driven self-electromagnetic fields and consequent defocusing forces with the background plasma density and beam ion mass. We identify plasma parameters where the defocusing forces can be reduced. Comment: 28 pages, submitted to Phys. Plasma...|$|R

He executes a plan to achieve world dominion through the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program with a prototype <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> weapon to hold the world hostage. He is portrayed as utterly ruthless, calmly destroying all of Moscow just to demonstrate the beam's power and killing anyone in his organisation who shows cowardice or threatens his command, such as Sebastian Bludd. Cobra Commander was voiced by Charlie Adler.|$|E
25|$|The {{cyclotron}} was {{an improvement}} over the linear accelerators (linacs) that were available when it was invented, being more cost- and space-effective due to the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field. In the 1920s, {{it was not possible}} to generate the high power, high-frequency radio waves which are used in modern linacs (generated by klystrons). As such, impractically long linac structures were required for higher-energy particles. The compactness of the cyclotron reduces other costs as well, such as foundations, radiation shielding, and the enclosing building. Cyclotrons have a single electrical driver, which saves both money and power. Furthermore, cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target, so the average power passed from a <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> into a target is relatively high.|$|E
25|$|As the Klingons {{are portrayed}} as a warrior culture, Klingon starships are usually {{depicted}} as warships, heavily armed {{with a variety of}} <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> weaponry and antimatter warheads. Many Klingon ships also make use of cloaking technology to hide the vessel from view. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a predator's shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies' design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Later Klingon starships by other designers kept to this same overall configuration, although updated to reflect their respective time periods: Rick Sternbach's designs for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine drew on elements of Starfleet ships features to reflect the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons, while John Eaves' designs for Enterprise incorporated more rugged and primitive construction to make the vessels appear consistent with the earlier time period.|$|E

50|$|A {{classical}} diffractor is {{devoid of}} quantum character. For diffraction, classical physics usually considers {{the case of}} an incoming and an outgoing wave, not of <b>particle</b> <b>beams.</b> When diffraction of <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> was discovered by experiment, it seemed fitting to many writers to continue {{to think in terms of}} classical diffractors, formally belonging to the macroscopic laboratory apparatus, and of wave character belonging to the quantum object that suffers diffraction.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a variant}} on Eugen Sänger's {{antimatter}} rocket. One {{of the key}} difficulties of harnessing the energy from matter-antimatter collisions {{is that most of}} the energy released by them is in the X-ray and gamma ray spectrum. The redshift rocket proposes to use <b>particle</b> <b>beams,</b> such as those produced by ultrafast laser pulses. Both the matter and antimatter would be accelerated to near light speed away from the spacecraft before colliding in the reaction chamber. This would lead to the radiation that reaches the spacecraft being redshifted. If the speed of the <b>particle</b> <b>beams</b> is great enough, the radiation that hits the spacecraft will be of a frequency that can be reflected. Energy absorbed by the spacecraft could be used to help power the <b>particle</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
25|$|From {{the autumn}} of 1979, the LaRouche {{movement}} conducted most of its U.S. electoral activities as the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee. The name drew complaints from the Democratic Party's Democratic National Committee. Democratic Party leaders refused to recognize LaRouche as a party member, or to seat the few delegates he received in his seven primary campaigns as a Democrat. His campaign platforms included {{a return to the}} Bretton Woods system, including a gold-based national and world monetary system; fixed exchange rates; and ending the IMF. He supported the replacement of the central bank system, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, with a national bank; a war on drug trafficking and prosecution of banks involved in money laundering; building a tunnel under the Bering Strait; the building of nuclear power plants; and a crash program to build <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> weapons and lasers, including support for elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). He opposed the Soviet Union and supported a military build-up to prepare for imminent war; supported the screening and quarantine of AIDS patients; and opposed environmentalism, deregulation, outcome-based education, and abortion.|$|E

The next step was to do so. With the help of Victor W. Cohen, Rabi built a molecular beam apparatus at Columbia.

500|$|The game {{contains}} weapons {{based on}} non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, {{as well as}} entirely fictional armaments like <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage, and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons {{tend to be more}} cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for [...] "... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function", rather than [...] "... just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles." [...] F.E.A.R.s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the synchrocyclotron is the isochronous cyclotron, which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with time. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons, but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a strong focusing effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral trajectory. For this reason, an isochronous cyclotron is also called an [...] "AVF (azimuthal varying field) cyclotron". This solution for focusing the <b>particle</b> <b>beam</b> was proposed by L. H.
