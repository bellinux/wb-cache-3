50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient.

Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system.

40|$|Overpressure is a {{major hazard}} in the process {{industry}} {{with the potential to}} lead to a major accident. <b>Pressure</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Valves</b> (PSVs) are often used as the last layer of protection against such a hazard and require regular recertification in order to be dependable.

However, experience from the Norwegian oil and gas industry is that the recertification process several times have caused leaks of gas. The process thus represents a certain risk in itself and the question is then whether the recertification intervals presently being used actually are optimal from a risk point of view?

40|$|In {{the case}} of two- phase flow discharge, <b>pressure</b> <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> (PSV) design becomes {{difficult}} due to complex thermal-fluid dynamic phenomena that occur between the two phases.

Generally, for each method a different way of calculating k(d) is proposed, but various studies are looking for a general correlation that considers all the two-phase flow aspects. This paper will compare some experimental results obtained with a steam-water system and a small PSV (office diameter phi(or) = 6 mm) with the predictions of three methods, an HEM, an HNE and a more recent method, called HNE-DS, proposed by the ISO working group on PSV sizing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract -	A careful {{design of}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> (PSV) is an {{essential}} requisite for safeguarding of industrial plants; if two-phase flow is possible, {{it is very important}} for their correct design to predict the onset of the critical flow. This phenomenon occurs when the fluid velocity becomes equal or higher than the sound velocity in the fluid. Some other interesting aspects for the PSV design are the calculation of the subcritical two-phase flowrate and the back-pressure effect on the valve discharge performance. This paper shows the results of an experimental research carried out with steam-water two-phase through a convergent-divergent nozzle. The effect of some test parameters, such as inlet pressure and quality, mass flowrate, back-pressure, on the flow behaviour are evaluated. The experimental data are also compared with the results of a calculation method based on the homogeneous equilibrium model. The results show quite a good reliability of the model, with some uncertainties related to the test procedures (the mass flow rate is imposed); indeed, this condition makes difficult the checking of the critical flow arising, in spite of the help of the experimental data on the test section pressure profile...|$|R
50|$|Tests on replica bypass {{assemblies}} {{showed that}} bellows squirm could occur at <b>pressures</b> below the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> setting, but that squirm {{did not lead}} to a leak (either from damage to the bellows or from damage to the pipe at the mitre welds) until well above the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> setting. However theoretical modelling suggested that the expansion of the bellows as a result of squirm would lead to a significant amount of work being done on them by the reactor contents, and there would be considerable shock loading on the bellows when they reached the end of their travel. If the bellows were 'stiff' (resistant to squirm), the shock loading could cause the bellows to tear at <b>pressures</b> below the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> setting; it was not impossible that this could occur at pressures experienced during start-up, when pressure was less tightly controlled. (Plant pressures {{at the time of the}} accident were unknown since all relevant instruments and records had been destroyed, and all relevant operators killed).The Inquiry concluded that this ("the 20-inch hypothesis") was 'a probability' but one 'which would readily be displaced if some greater probability' could be found.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{industrial}} engineering problems require fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis and dynamics analysis to improve functionality or operational performance. One such {{problem is the}} popping off of <b>pressure</b> <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV) widely used in pressure vessels and pipes. Popping off of a spring-loaded <b>pressure</b> <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV) is crucial to prevent the pressure vessel or pipe from overpressure. It's difficult to observe {{the dynamics of the}} valve disc as well as the flow characteristics through the small chamber between the valve disc and valve seat over such a remarkable short period in the past. To address this issue, a transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with moving grid technique has been presented in this work. Fine structure grid has been generated over the whole flow domain to ensure that the valve disc can move freely and continuously without negative volume problem. Two types of time-dependent overpressure are given to simulate the popping of the PSV under different overpressure conditions. Response parameters such as the displacement of the disc, fluid force on the disc and the blowdown value are monitored to see their influence on the popping of the valve. The results are helpful to improve the popping action of the valve in design stage, and demonstrate the availability and efficiency of using transient CFD simulation in the popping analysis of spring-loaded PSV...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncident {{involving}} {{failures of}} ASTM A 53 carbon steel (CS) pipe, connected to <b>pressure</b> <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV) and carrying raw gas has caused serious supply disruption. This study {{was performed to}} identify the most probable cause of the pipe failure. It was conducted by reviewing the existing design, construction data and pipe material analysis using non-destructive techniques such as VT, PT, MT and UT along with metallographic, hardness and microscopic analysis. The investigation revealed that excessive material loss has occurred in both failure and its adjacent regions due to abrasive grinding, resulting {{in the formation of}} a through thickness flaw. These grindings were performed to accommodate the pre-installed piping spool to avoid alteration in the pipe position. RCA demonstrated that this rapid thinning of the steel pipe body later led to its failure. Metallurgical study using photomicrograph shows that the morphology of the steel material was consistent and did not show any evidence of internal corrosion or micro fractures. Further damage to the surface of already excessively reduced thickness occurred due to nominal pipe vibration and atmospheric effect during service. The research work described in the paper has a significant meaning to recognize the root cause of such failures in CS pipes and through given recommendations to eliminate future such happenings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV) {{is widely}} used to open and relieve excess pressure from a pressure vessel/system. The rapid opening and reliable reclosing of a PSV are of great importance and are strongly determined by the coupling effect of the compressed spring and the fluid flow through the chamber region, which is mainly determined by the shape {{and the size of}} the disc and adjusting ring. In this paper, a multi-objective design optimization of a PSV is presented to trade-off the rapid opening and the reliable reclosing. The opening and reclosing operation is firstly estimated by comparing the spring force and the fluid forces, respectively, where flow force is obtained by using three-dimensional (3 -D) steady CFD simulation. Then, radial basis function (RBF) models are developed to approximate the two objective functions. A multi-objective optimization algorithm is then utilized to search the optimal design. Additionally, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is carried out to identify the most important variables for the optimal design. The results show the influence of design variables on the opening and reclosing of the PSV, and give the optimal structure with desirable function. The analysis and optimization method used also shows a great potential to assist engineers in the preliminary design of PSVs, especially when the physical experiments are difficult to implement...|$|E
