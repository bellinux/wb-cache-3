25|$|By some analysts, {{the process}} has been {{declared}} ineffective. The stalling of the Middle East <b>Peace</b> <b>Process</b> <b>is</b> having an impact on the Barcelona Process and is hindering progress especially in the first basket. The economic basket can be considered a success, and there have been more projects for the exchange on a cultural level and between the peoples in the riparian states. Other criticism is mainly based on the predominant role the European Union is playing. Normally it is the EU that is assessing the state of affairs, which leads to the impression that the North is dictating the South what to do. The question of an enhanced co-ownership of {{the process has}} repeatedly been brought up over the last years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues surrounding this <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> <b>is</b> whether the Palestinian Authority in fact met its obligations to promote tolerance. There is specific evidence that the Palestinian Authority actively funded and supported many terrorist activities and groups. Palestinians stated that any terrorist acts stemmed from Israel not having conceded enough land and political power to win support among ordinary Palestinians. Israelis stated that these acts of terrorism were because the Palestinian Authority openly encouraged and supported incitement against Israel, and terrorism. There was increasing disagreement and debate among Israelis {{about the amount of}} positive results and benefits produced by the Oslo process. Supporters said it was producing advances leading to a viable Palestinian society which would promote genuine acceptance of Israel. Opponents said that concessions were merely emboldening extremist elements to commit more violence in order to win further concessions, without providing any real acceptance, benefits, goodwill, or reconciliation for Israel in return.|$|E

On 14 December, Batasuna’s Pernando Barrena said that the <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> “going nowhere.” He accused the Socialist Party of making excessive demands to Batasuna.|$|R

2500|$|The party's {{platform}} on the <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> <b>is</b> simple. Aryeh Deri {{has suggested}} that [...] "there is currently no negotiating partner on the Palestinian side, so {{the basis of the}} next government should be socioeconomic". On that subject, Shas' economic plan calls for an {{increase in the minimum wage}} to NIS 30 an hour, lowering the value-added tax on basic household items and requiring 7.5% of every building plan to be devoted to public housing. Shas insist that their housing plan create Mixed-income housing rather than segregating rich and poor neighborhoods.|$|E

2500|$|Corbyn is {{a long-standing}} {{supporter}} of a United Ireland and {{describes himself as}} an [...] "anti-imperialist campaigner" [...] for the region. He invited Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams to London in 1984, from which the Party Leader Neil Kinnock [...] "did everything in his power" [...] to disassociate himself. A second meeting in 1996 was cancelled following pressure from Tony Blair. Corbyn responded by saying [...] "dialogue with all parties remains essential if the <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> <b>is</b> to continue". He has been strongly criticised by Labour and Conservative MPs for holding meetings with {{former members of the}} PIRA in the Palace of Westminster, to discuss topics such as conditions in Northern Irish prisons and the PIRA ceasefire. At Trafalgar Square marches opposing British troops' placement in Northern Ireland, Corbyn urged (prior to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry) for the British government to officially condemn Bloody Sunday and issue an inquiry into the massacre. When Corbyn stopped the march and addressed the crowd using a bullhorn, police officers warned Corbyn against the move due to the contentious nature of the march.|$|E
