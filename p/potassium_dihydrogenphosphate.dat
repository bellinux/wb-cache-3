One of effectiveness and stability indicators of diaphragm discharge is generation of hydrogen peroxide. In theoretical part, detail principle description of electric discharge in liquid is situated. Further, properties of electrolyte are introduced and general spectrophotometric method of obtained sample determination is described. In experimental part, a full procedure of experiment is introduced. Next part containing results and discussions introduces particular results of individual measurements and their reasons.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} method was developed for the separation and determination of four cobalamins in seawater. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase discovery RP-amide C 16 column with buffer <b>potassium</b> <b>dihydrogenphosphate</b> and acetonitrile as the mobile phases in linear gradients elution mode. Cobalamins were previously preconcentrated in C 18 resins cartridges. Detection was performed using UV-diode array detector {{in a range of}} λ of 200 - 400 nm. The method showed to be linear over a range of 1 - 300 ngmL- 1 with acceptable precision and accuracy. The detection limits ranged between 0. 07 pgmL- 1 for 5 ′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and 0. 5 pgmL- 1 for hydroxocobalamin. The mean cobalamins recoveries for direct determination ranged between 76 and 93 % for hydroxo-, cyano- and methylcobalamin, while the recovery for 5 ′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin was only 31 % suggesting that the preconcentration method was not valid for this cobalamin. The method was successfully applied to coastal seawater where the concentrations ranged from 4. 2 to 7. 3 ngL- 1 for hydroxo-, 1. 4 - 3. 9 ngL- 1 for cyano-, 2. 1 - 4. 6 ngL- 1 for 5 ′-deoxyadenosyl- and 33 - 83. 5 ngL- 1 for methylcobalamin. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Summary: A new isocratic HPLC method, {{employing}} electro-chemical detection, {{is described}} for {{the determination of}} urinary vanillylmandelic acid, 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid and homova-nillic acid. The main advantages of this technique are: simplicity, simultaneous determination of all analytes, {{the absence of an}} extraction procedure, isocratic elution and low cost. The diluted urine is injected onto a CIS reversed phase column. The mobile phase is <b>potassium</b> <b>dihydrogenphosphate</b> buffer containing 1 -heptanesulphonic acid, methanol and acetonitrile. The calibration curves are linear from 0. 1 to 50 mg/ 1; the precision data show CV less than 2. 36 % for within-day assay and less than 2. 72 % for day-to-day assays. The mean recoveries for supplemented samples are 98. 2 to 102. 0 % for vanillylmandelic acid, 99. 6 to 103. 9 % for 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid and 98. 7 to 102. 0 % for homovanillic acid. In comparisons of the present method with Radjaipur's extraction method (Radjaipur M. et al., Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem 1994; 32 : 609 - 13) the slopes for the three analytes were nearly 1, and the confidence region of the in-tercepts was close to 0. In conclusion the technique seems to be suitable for routine determination of the three analytes, espe-cially for mass screening purposes...|$|E
40|$|A method using reversed-phase {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (RP-HPLC) is described for the measurement of the stabilized activated metabolite of ifosfamide, 4 -hydroxyifosfamide (4 -OHIF), in human plasma and erythrocytes. Immediately after sample collection and plasma-erythrocyte separation at 4 degrees C, 4 -OHIF was stabilized by derivatization with semicarbazide (SCZ). The sample pretreatment involved liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. RP-HPLC was executed with a C 8 column and acetonitrile- 0. 025 M <b>potassium</b> <b>dihydrogenphosphate</b> buffer (pH 7. 40) -triethylamine (13. 5 : 86 : 0. 5, v/v) as mobile phase. The analyte was determined with UV detection at 230 nm.

40|$|A {{packed-bed}} electroosmotic pump (EOP) {{was constructed}} and evaluated. The EOP {{consisted of three}} capillary columns packed in parallel, a gas-releasing device, Pt electrodes and a high-voltage power supply. The EOP could generate output pressure above 5. 0 MPa and constant flow rate {{in the range of}} nl/min to a few mul/min for pure water, pure methanol, 2 mM <b>potassium</b> <b>dihydrogenphosphate</b> buffer, the buffer-methanol mixture and the pure water-methanol mixture at applied potentials less than 20 W The composition of solvent before/after pumping was quantitatively determined by using a gas chromatograph equipped with both flame ionization detector and thermal conductivity detector. It was found that there were no apparent changes in composition and relative concentrations after pumping process for a methanol-ethanol-acetonitrile mixture and a methanol-water mixture. Theoretical aspect of the EOP was discussed in detail. An capillary HPLC system consisting of the EOP, an injection valve, a 15 cm x 320 mum i. d., 5 mum Spherigel C(18) stainless steel analytical column, and an on-column UV detector was connected to evaluate the performance of the EOP. A comparative study was also carried out with a mechanical capillary HPLC pump on the same system. The results demonstrated that the reproducibility of flow rate and the pulsation-free flow property of the EOP are superior to that of mechanical pump in capillary HPLC application.
