5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, <b>proinsulin</b> or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
25|$|Villa-Komaroff {{felt that}} these {{failures}} aided in her biggest victory: {{six months after}} {{she was able to}} return to Harvard (once the ban on recombinant DNA experiments was lifted in 1977), she became a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Walter Gilbert. Within 6 months, she was the first author of the landmark report from the Gilbert laboratory showing that bacteria could be induced to make <b>proinsulin</b> the first time a mammalian hormone was synthesized by bacteria. The research was a milestone in the birth of the biotechnology industry.|$|E
25|$|GH also stimulates, {{through the}} JAK-STAT {{signaling}} pathway, {{the production of}} {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to <b>proinsulin.</b> The liver is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects {{on a wide variety of}} tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte activity to promote bone growth.|$|E
25|$|Within vertebrates, {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} of insulin is strongly conserved. Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests {{that it has been}} conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of <b>proinsulin</b> (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has several}} isoforms, {{including}} C16:0, which is found {{primarily in the}} secretory granules and toward {{the surface of the}} membrane of β cells. Secretory granules and β cells are found in the islet of Langerhans and in rat β TC3 cells. Research has shown that in the pancreases of type II diabetic mouse models, there is a deficiency of C16:0. Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the pancreas secrete insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent exocytosis and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive potassium ion channels. Sulfatide can also stimulate <b>proinsulin</b> folding as well, as it can serve as a molecular chaperone for insulin.|$|E
2500|$|Insulin {{consists}} of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called preproinsulin in beta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). [...] The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming <b>proinsulin.</b> In the RER the <b>proinsulin</b> folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed. [...] About 5–10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, <b>proinsulin</b> is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Proinsulin</b> {{undergoes}} maturation into active insulin {{through the}} action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone convertases (PC1 and PC2), {{as well as the}} exoprotease carboxypeptidase E. [...] The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the C-peptide, and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds. [...] The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues (lysine-64 and arginine-65, and arginine-31 and −32). After cleavage of the C-peptide, these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the carboxypeptidase. [...] The C-peptide is the central portion of <b>proinsulin,</b> and the primary sequence of <b>proinsulin</b> goes in the order [...] "B-C-A" [...] (the B and A chains were identified on the basis of mass and the C-peptide was discovered later).|$|E
2500|$|IAPP is cosecreted with insulin. Insulin {{resistance}} in Type 2 diabetes produces a greater demand for insulin production {{which results in}} the secretion of <b>proinsulin.</b> [...] ProIAPP is secreted simultaneously, however, the enzymes that convert these precursor molecules into insulin and IAPP, respectively, {{are not able to}} keep up with the high levels of secretion, ultimately leading to the accumulation of proIAPP.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the beta}} cell {{produces}} insulin from <b>proinsulin,</b> a connecting peptide (or C-peptide) is also manufactured and {{released into the}} bloodstream. [...] Absence of C-peptide in the blood indicates that insulin has not been released from the pancreas, and this fact confirms the diagnosis of diabetes type 1. [...] C-peptide {{was believed to be}} only a by-product of natural insulin production; however, recent studies suggest that C-peptide exerts beneficial therapeutic effects on diabetic nociceptive neuropathy.|$|E
2500|$|Insulin and IAPP are {{regulated}} by similar factors since {{they share a}} common regulatory promoter motif. [...] The IAPP promoter is also activated by stimuli which do not affect insulin, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and fatty acids. One of the defining features of Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. This is a condition wherein the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively, resulting in increased insulin production; since <b>proinsulin</b> and proIAPP are cosecreted, this results {{in an increase in}} the production of proIAPP as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proinsulin</b> is the prohormone {{precursor}} to insulin {{made in the}} beta cells of the islets of Langerhans, specialized regions of the pancreas. In humans, <b>proinsulin</b> is encoded by the INS gene. The islets of Langerhans only secrete between 1% and 3% of <b>proinsulin</b> intact. However, because <b>proinsulin</b> has a longer half life than insulin, it can account for anywhere from 5-30% of the insulin-like structures circulating in the blood. There are higher concentrations of <b>proinsulin</b> after meals and lower levels {{when a person is}} fasting. Additionally, while <b>proinsulin</b> and insulin have structural differences, <b>proinsulin</b> does demonstrate some affinity for the insulin receptor. Due to the relative similarities in structure, <b>proinsulin</b> can produce between 5% and 10% of the metabolic activity similarly induced by insulin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proinsulin</b> is {{the final}} single chain protein {{structure}} secreted by cells before cleavage into mature insulin. <b>Proinsulin</b> was discovered by Professor Donald F. Steiner of the University of Chicago in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Preproinsulin is a biologically {{inactive}} {{precursor to}} the biologically active endocrine hormone insulin. Preproinsulin is converted into <b>proinsulin</b> by signal peptidases, which remove its signal peptide from its N-terminus. Finally, <b>proinsulin</b> is converted into the bioactive hormone insulin by removal of the C-peptide.|$|E
50|$|Postnatal <b>proinsulin</b> {{is crucial}} for {{metabolic}} regulation. However, <b>proinsulin</b> in neonates is important for normal development of the nerves of the eye, development of the heart, and general survival of embryonic cells. Regulation of the concentration of <b>proinsulin</b> during embryonic development is crucial, as {{too much or too}} little of the peptide can cause defects and death of the fetus. Thus far in the study of neonatal diabetes mellitus, only amino acid change mutations found in the B domain lead to the disease.|$|E
50|$|The C peptide {{is between}} the A and B chains of <b>proinsulin.</b> The {{connection}} between the A chain and C peptide is much more stable than the junction between the C peptide and B chain, with alpha helical features being exhibited near the C peptide-A chain connection. The C peptide-A chain junction occurs between residues 64 and 65 of <b>proinsulin.</b> These are lysine and arginine molecules, respectively. The C peptide-B chain connection is between two arginine residues at positions 31 and 32 of <b>proinsulin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Insulin {{granules}} mature {{in three}} steps: (1) the lumen of the granule undergoes acidification, {{due to the}} acidic properties of a secretory granule; (2) <b>proinsulin</b> becomes insulin {{through the process of}} proteolysis. The endoproteases PC1/3 and PC2 aid in this transformation from <b>proinsulin</b> to insulin; and (3) the clathrin protein coat is removed.|$|E

The term is composed of hyper - high, <b>proinsulin</b> - immature insulin molecule, and -emia - blood condition.|$|E

50|$|Increased {{levels of}} <b>proinsulin</b> in the circulatory system {{relative}} to mature insulin concentrations can indicate impending insulin resistance {{and the development}} of type 2 diabetes. Additional problems with <b>proinsulin</b> that can lead to diabetes include mutations in the number of cysteines present, which could affect correct folding. If the mutation causes only a mild change it could simply stress the endoplasmic reticulum’s ability to properly fold the protein. This stress, after a while, would lead to a {{decrease in the number of}} β-cells producing mature insulin, and would then lead to diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5000|$|Donald F. Steiner {{is known}} for his discoveries on <b>proinsulin,</b> the {{precursor}} of insulin which is a hormone that helps the body control the use of sugar. He found that insulin is synthesized from a larger precursor protein in the beta cells of the pancreas and this led the way to elucidation of how the islet cells function, and how peptide hormones are synthesized and metabolized. He and his colleagues discovered some of the enzymes that convert <b>proinsulin</b> into insulin, and also devised methods for measuring insulin and its precursors in human serum.|$|E
5000|$|The post {{translational}} {{modification of}} <b>proinsulin</b> to mature insulin only {{occurs in the}} beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. When <b>proinsulin</b> is transported through the Golgi apparatus the C-peptide is cleaved. This cleavage occurs {{with the aid of}} two endoproteases. Type I endoproteases, PC1 and PC3, disrupt the C peptide-B chain connection. PC2, a type II endoprotease, cleaves the C peptide-A chain bond. The resulting molecule, now mature insulin, is stored as a hexamer in secretory vesicles and is stabilized with [...] molecules until it is secreted.|$|E

The resulting mature insulin is packaged inside mature granules waiting for metabolic signals (such as leucine, arginine, glucose and mannose) and vagal nerve stimulation to be exocytosed from the cell into the circulation.|$|E
5000|$|When insulin was {{originally}} purified from bovine or porcine pancreata, all the <b>proinsulin</b> was not fully removed. When some people used these insulins, the <b>proinsulin</b> {{may have caused}} the body to react with a rash, to resist the insulin, or even to make dents or lumps in the skin {{at the place where}} the insulin was injected. This can be described as an iatrogenic injury due to slight differences between the <b>proinsulin</b> of different species. Since the late 1970s, when highly purified porcine insulin was introduced, and the level of insulin purity reached 99%, this ceased to be a significant clinical issue. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} in respect of their influence on insulin pharmacokinetics, moderate concentrations of certain insulin antibodies may, in fact, be of positive advantage to all diabetics without endogenous insulin secretion (e.g. people with type 1 diabetes) because insulin binding antibodies effectively increase the insulin's clearance rate and distribution space and therefore helps to prolong its pharmacological and biological half lives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proinsulin</b> is {{synthesized}} on membrane associated ribosomes {{found on}} the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is folded and its disulfide bonds are oxidized. It is then transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is packaged into secretory vesicles, {{and where it is}} processed by a series of proteases to form mature insulin. Mature insulin has 35 fewer amino acids; 4 are removed altogether, and the remaining 31 form the C-peptide. The C-peptide is abstracted {{from the center of the}} <b>proinsulin</b> sequence; the two other ends (the B chain and A chain) remain connected by disulfide bonds.|$|E
50|$|Preproinsulin is {{the primary}} {{translational}} product of the INS gene. It is a peptide that is 110 amino acids in length. Preproinsulin is a <b>proinsulin</b> molecule with a signal peptide attached to its N-terminus.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the focus}} of many insulin related {{metabolic}} diseases has focused on mature insulin. However, {{in recent years the}} importance of studying the structure and function of <b>proinsulin</b> in relation to these diseases has become increasingly clear.|$|E
