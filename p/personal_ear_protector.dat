At the 1988 Farm Progress Show farmers and spouses filled out a survey questionnaire, volunteered to have their hearing tested, and were given recommendations regarding hearing test results and hearing protection practices. One year later 506 questionnaires were mailed to these same individuals querying their attitudes toward the availability of hearing testing at the show, the hearing conservation brochure, and the use of ear protection. Attention was also focused on recommendations regarding further examination/ evaluation, and on the purchase of hearing aids. There were 239 of the 506 questionnaires completed and returned for a response rate of 47 %. Results indicated that 92 % valued the hearing test, and the hearing conservation brochure. Fifty- seven percent reported using the <b>ear</b> <b>protectors</b> provided them at the show, and 57 % indicated an increased usage of <b>ear</b> <b>protectors.</b> In 1988, 37 % of the males reported using <b>ear</b> <b>protectors,</b> whereas in 1989 usage had increased to 73 %. Use of <b>ear</b> <b>protectors</b> by females increased from 19 % in 1988 to 67 % in 1989. A x² analysis for each group revealed that the increase in <b>ear</b> <b>protector</b> usage was significant (p <. 01). Results also revealed that 5 % of the respondents had purchased amplification systems during the intervening year. Of those who had received a recommendation to see a doctor and/or audiologist, 24 % followed that instruction. It was concluded that this single intervention program focusing on hearing conservation in the agricultural population was effective in motivating farmers and spouses to increase their use of hearing protective devices when in noisy environments.

Background: The casting and forging industry provides employment to {{a significant portion of the}} population. Method: The level of hearing protection was assessed through questionnaire survey of 572 workers. Out of these workers, 165 and another control group of 57 participants were assessed by formal audiometry. Audiometric tests were conducted at frequencies of 1. 0 KHz to 8. 0 KHz. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined on the basis of a hearing threshold level with a low fence of 25 dB. Student’s test and ANOVA were used to compare the various groups; a p value <. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: More than 90 % of the workers sampled showed significant hearing loss at medium and high frequencies. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared with the workers associated with the other activities.

With {{the creation of the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in December 1970, the survey program was continued by the Noise Section of the NIOSH Physical Agents Branch. An {{occupational noise}} and hearing survey was made to characterize noise-exposure levels in a variety of industries, to describe the hearing status of workers exposed to such noise conditions, and to attempt to establish a relationship between occupational noise level and hearing loss that would be applicable to general industry. The four types of data collected during a typical survey at a given individual plant included noise measurements, background personal- occupational information, medical and otologic data, and audiometric data. The relationship between hearing-loss-risk and noise level has been roughly defined for employees who work eight hours a day in relatively simple, or "ordinary" noise environments.

40|$|Introduction: In the {{dentistry}} practice, dentists {{are exposed}} to harmful effects caused by several factors, such as the noise produced by their work instruments. In 1959, the American Dental Association recommended periodical hearing assessments {{and the use of}} <b>ear</b> <b>protectors.</b> Aquiring more information regarding dentists', dental nurses', and prosthodontists' hearing abilities is necessary to propose prevention measures and early treatment strategies. Objective: To investigate the auditory thresholds of dentists, dental nurses, and prosthodontists. Method: In this clinical and experimental study, 44 dentists (Group I; GI), 36 dental nurses (Group II; GII), and 28 prosthodontists (Group III; GIII) were included,, with a total of 108 professionals. The procedures that were performed included a specific interview, ear canal inspection, conventional and high-frequency threshold audiometry, a speech reception threshold test, and an acoustic impedance test. Results: In the 3 groups that were tested, the comparison between the mean hearing thresholds provided evidence of worsened hearing ability relative to the increase in frequency. For the tritonal mean at 500 to 2, 000 Hz and 3, 000 to 6, 000 Hz, GIII presented the worst thresholds. For the mean of the high frequencies (9, 000 and 16, 000 Hz), GII presented the worst thresholds. Conclusion: The conventional hearing threshold evaluation did not demonstrate alterations in the 3 groups that were tested; however, the complementary tests such as high-frequency audiometry provided greater efficacy in the early detection of hearing problems, since this population's hearing loss impaired hearing ability at frequencies that are not tested by the conventional tests. Therefore, we emphasize the need of utilizing high-frequency threshold audiometry in the hearing assessment routine in combination with other audiological tests...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background : Ahmad Yani  Airport Semarang has a noise {{intensity}} level over the limit value of 85 dB(A). The Workers work continuously 8 hour a day. They may {{be exposed to}} aircraft noise over limit value that can make the blood pressure increases. The Objective {{of this research was}} to determine the factors related to the increasing of the blood pressure on workers in Ahmad Yani Airport. Method : This was an observational research using cross sectional design. Population was the workers of Ahmad Yani Airport, consist of  security unit, cargo unit and PKP-PK unit (Aircraft Rescue & Fire Fighting). Number of respondent was 60 workers. Data were analyzed using Chi-Square test and multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Result : This research found that (1) 33 peoples (55 %) had systolic increased and 36 peoples (60 %) had diastolic increased; (2) 45 peoples (75 %) had noise exposed over 85 dB(A); (3) 22 peoples (36. 7 %) have been working over 10 years; (4) 18 peoples (30 %) work over 8 hours/day; (5) 54 peoples (90 %) are smoker; (6) 52 peoples (86. 7 %) did not wear <b>ear</b> <b>protector</b> equipment. Conclusions: (1). There are significant relationship between noise intensity, working duration, working hours and systolic blood pressure; (2). There are significant relationship between noise intensity,  working duration and diastolic blood pressure; (3). There are significant relationship between noise intensity and working duration  simultaneously and systolic blood pressure. Workers who has been working over 10 years and has noise exposere over 85 dB(A) has probability 68. 7 % for  systolic pressure increasing. Worker who has noise exposed over 85 dB(A) has probability 53. 7 % for diastolic pressure increasing. Key Words: Noise exposure, blood pressure, airport worker...|$|R
