40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the impacts of climate change on the behavior of phytoplankton, with a special emphasis on harmful cyanobacteria in the <b>peri-Alpine</b> <b>region.</b> It was hypothesized that in this highly sensitive region more important episodes of harmful cyanobacteria outbreaks under warmer climatic conditions could lead to negative impacts on water quality. The objectives were i) to analyze if air temperature is able to influence the cyanobacteria community, ii) to define the main drivers for the phytoplankton/cyanobacteria community, iii) to predict the cyanobacteria biomass under warmer climatic. Multivariate analysis and statistical modeling were applied on data from seven peri-Alpine lakes. Air temperature significantly influences the phytoplankton community, which is mainly driven by nutrients and temperature. Oscillatoriales, may be favored with increased water temperature and a longer stratification period. Planktothrix rubescens biomass was projected to increase in abundance and frequency thus potentially could induce a community function change...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch in the <b>peri-alpine</b> <b>regions</b> where they are consumed, the microcystin (MC) contamination of YOY perch was analysed both in field (Lake Bourget, France) and experimentally using force-feeding protocols with pure MCs. In-situ, schools of YOY perch present in the epilimnion of the lake were never found in direct contact with the P. rubescens blooms that were present in the metalimnion. However, MCs were detected in the muscles and liver of the fish and were thus assumed to reach YOY perch through dietary routes, particularly via the consumption of MC-containing Daphnia. Force-feeding experiment demonstrates the existence of MC detoxification/ excretion processes and suggests that in situ, YOY perch could partly detoxify and excrete ingested MCs, thereby limiting the potential negative effects on perch populations under bloom conditions. However, because of chronic exposure these processes could not allow for the complete elimination of MCs. In both experimental and in situ studies, no histological change was observed in YOY perch, indicating that MC concentrations that occurred in Lake Bourget in 2009 were too low to cause histological damage prone to induce mortality. However, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damages were observed for both the high and low experimental MC doses, suggesting that similar effects could occur in situ and potentially result in perch population disturbance during cyanobacterial blooms.
