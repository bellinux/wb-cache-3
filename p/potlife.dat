40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} {{and behavior of}} epoxy latex coatings are different from solvent-type ones. It is decided by the distinct curing mechanism. The solvent-type epoxy film obtained from epoxy resin and curing agent by homogeneous reaction, namely, the state of epoxy resin and curing agent is uniform. However, epoxy latex film made from epoxy resin emulsion or dispersion and water soluble amine by polyphase reaction. So the determination of <b>potlife</b> of epoxy latex can be showed by film gloss changes with residence time, dissimilar with solvent-type by the index of viscosity. The modern infrared spectrum measure shows that the epoxy groups in the dried epoxy latex film exist even if EEW to HAV proportion is 1. 2 : 1. This also testifies the incomplete polyphase reaction mechanism of epoxy emulsion coating curing at ambient temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two {{kinds of}} aqueous acrylic polyols (single step and multi step {{synthesis}} type) {{have been investigated}} for their performance in the two-component aqueous polyurethane application, by using more selective catalysts. The aliphatic polyfunctional isocyanates based on hexamethylen diisocyanates have been employed as suitable hardeners. The complex of zirconium, commercially known as K-KAT Â® XC- 6212, and manganese (III) complexes with mixed ligands based on the derivative of maleic acid {{have been used as}} catalysts in this study. Both of the aqueous polyols give good results, in terms of application and hardness, when elevated temperatures and more selective catalysts are applied. A more selective catalyst promotes the reaction between the isocyanate and polyol component. This increases the percentage of urethane bonds and the degree of hardness in the films formed from the two components of aqueous polyurethane lacquers. The polyol based on the single step synthesis route is favourable concerning <b>potlife</b> and hardness. The obtained results show that the performance of the two-component aqueous polyurethane coatings depends o...|$|E
40|$|Cast cure, {{extrusion}} cast, {{and paste}} extrudable explosives {{have not been}} designed for transferring through long tortuous paths or into fine three dimensional shapes. To allow the crystalline explosive to flow a lubricating fluid is required. The energetic liquid ethane trinitrate (TMETN) {{was used as the}} lubricant to maximize the explosive energy. TMETN is a liquid nitrate ester which requires stabilization with conventional free radical stabilizers such as 2 - nitrodiphenylamine, methyl-nitroanaline, or ethyl centrylite. Since these injection moldable explosives are expected to cure in place, a polyesterurethane binder based on polymeric isocyanate of hexamethylene diisocyanate and polycaprolactone polyols is dissolved in TMETN. The solubility of the polymer precursors in TMETN also reduces the energetic liquids sensitivity. The latent cure catalyst Dabco T- 131 was used to minimize shrinkage associated with thermal expansion, reduce cost associated with oven cures, to give 4 - 6 hour <b>potlife</b> and overnight cure to handling strength. The product RX- 08 -HD is a new, low-viscosity, injection moldable explosive that can be extruded into complex, void-free shapes. Combined with appropriate design and other aspects of weaponization, RX- 08 -HD has produced outstanding results...|$|E
40|$|Tin compounds, {{especially}} dibutyltin dilaurate, are in {{widespread use}} in coatings as catalysts for the isocyanate/hydroxyl reaction. Because {{of the high}} aquatic toxicity of some organotin compounds, {{there has been an}} attempt to ban organotin compounds from all coating applications. As a general rule organotin catalysts are not selective, they catalyze the reaction of isocyanates with both hydroxyl groups and water and also catalyze the hydrolysis of ester groups. We are interested in finding alternatives to these catalysts and in developing compounds which exhibit increased selectivity for the isocyanate/hydroxyl reaction. In addition, we are interested in developing materials which give a longer <b>potlife</b> and enhanced reaction rates. We will report on various metal salts and chelates we have investigated, the mechanism of catalysis and application characteristics in both high solids and water-borne applications. We found zirconium chelates activates the hydroxyl groups and catalyze the isocyanate-hydroxyl reaction by an insertion mechanism. This reaction is selective and preferred over the isocyanate-water reaction. This permits the use of this catalyst in waterborne isocyanate crosslinked two component coatings. In addition this catalyst permits very high reaction rate which suggests is use in plural component gun applications...|$|E
