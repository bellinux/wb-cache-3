50|$|A {{drop-down}} list (abbreviated drop-down; {{also known as}} a drop-down menu. drop menu, pull-down list, <b>picklist)</b> is a graphical control element, similar to a list box, that allows the user to choose one value from a list. When a {{drop-down list}} is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value. It is often used in the design of graphical user interfaces, including web design.|$|E

In addition, the GCP ontologies will be integrated with Plant Ontology (PO) and Gramene (Trait Ontology, TO; Environment Ontology, EO) to develop a common, internationally shared crop trait and anatomy ontology. The team will initiate collaboration with SONet (Scientific Observations Network) and OBOE (Extensible Observation Ontology), which proposed to integrate the GCP ontology as a study case. |$|R

40|$|Warehouse {{operations}} typically aggregate identical stock keeping units (SKU) {{into the}} same storage bin for easier bookkeeping and organizing of goods. With the emergence of automatic identification and tracking technologies like RFID, free-form storage of goods becomes a viable alternative. We consider the strategy of storing identical copies of an SKU in a fragmented manner and evaluate the operational characteristics that benefit from fragmented storage. Fragmented storage of identical SKUs creates {{a greater number of}} feasible <b>picklist</b> opportunities - with greater choice, greater optimization follows. We present an abstract warehouse model to evaluate the location assignment problem in warehouse systems. Specifically, we investigate picking operations that retrieve multiple items during a warehouse pass. We provide an analytical result for operations using a 'hybrid-cost' cost metric, and a brute force analysis for operations using the more common 'maximum-cost' picking metric. We show that fragmentation is more favorable when the number of copies picked for each SKU is small...|$|E
