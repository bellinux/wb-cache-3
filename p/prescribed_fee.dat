500|$|Between {{his coming}} of age in 366BC and the trials that took place in 364BC, Demosthenes and his guardians {{negotiated}} acrimoniously but were unable to reach an agreement, for neither side was willing to make concessions. At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. According to a story repeated by Plutarch, when Demosthenes was an adolescent, his curiosity was noticed by the orator Callistratus, who was then {{at the height of his}} reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance. According to Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philologist and philosopher, and Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, Demosthenes was a student of Isocrates; according to Cicero, Quintillian and the Roman biographer Hermippus, he was a student of Plato. Lucian, a Roman-Syrian rhetorician and satirist, lists the philosophers Aristotle, Theophrastus and Xenocrates among his teachers. These claims are nowadays disputed. According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed Isaeus as his master in rhetoric, even though Isocrates was then teaching this subject, either because he could not pay Isocrates the <b>prescribed</b> <b>fee</b> or because Demosthenes believed Isaeus's style better suited a vigorous and astute orator such as himself [...] Curtius, a German archaeologist and historian, likened the relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to [...] "an intellectual armed alliance".|$|E
