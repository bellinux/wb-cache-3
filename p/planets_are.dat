5|$|<b>Planets</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{divided into}} two main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|The <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> named alphabetically, {{starting}} with the innermost: b, c, d, e, f, and g, distinguishers that are tagged onto {{the name of their}} home star.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the middle}} <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> located in the system's {{habitable}} zone; however, they are giant planets believed to be analogous to Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, two <b>planets</b> <b>were</b> found transiting the star. These <b>planets</b> <b>were</b> {{confirmed}} through transit-timing variation method. A third <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> discovered through follow-up {{radial velocity}} measurements which was confirmed in January 2014.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} to be orbiting the star. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{found to have}} a minimum mass of 4.8 Jupiter masses and orbiting in a circular orbit that takes 186 days to complete. The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> one of the few known <b>planets</b> to <b>be</b> orbiting an evolved intermediate-mass star and one of the innermost (such <b>planets</b> have only <b>been</b> discovered in clump giants).|$|R
50|$|Oreo <b>is</b> an {{extinguished}} <b>planet,</b> <b>were</b> Deck {{was born}} and brought up. As Oreo was extremely advanced on technology, many Oreans managed to escape before the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> destroyed.|$|R
5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the outer planets, the inner <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> not thought to have migrated significantly {{over the age of}} the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.|$|E
5|$|None of the <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> in low-ratio orbital resonances, {{in which}} {{multiple}} planets gravitationally tug on and stabilize each other's orbits, resulting in simple ratios of their orbital periods. However, b and c {{are close to}} a 5:4 ratio.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{secondary}} transit of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported. Full {{observation of}} {{phases of the}} <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported in September 2014.|$|R
50|$|A {{coreless}} <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{a theoretical}} type of terrestrial planet {{that has no}} metallic core, i.e. the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> effectively a giant rocky mantle.|$|R
50|$|The {{method in}} which the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} {{is similar to the}} way that the <b>planet</b> Neptune <b>was</b> discovered, {{in which the}} newly discovered <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> known by its pull on another which is already known to exist.|$|R
5|$|The Solar System's {{planets and}} officially {{recognized}} dwarf <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> {{known to be}} orbited by 184 natural satellites, or moons. 19 moons in the Solar System are {{large enough to be}} gravitationally rounded, and thus would be considered planets or dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity. Although there are {{attempts}} {{to explain it}} partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.|$|E
5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
50|$|This <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 2007 on September 20 and published on March 1. This <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> typical {{as it was}} discovered spectroscopically using the radial velocity method.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, a {{group of}} astronomers working on the SWEEPS program {{announced}} {{the discovery of the}} planet SWEEPS-04 in the system. The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> a gas giant, who is close to the parent star at 0.05 AU. The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> classified as a hot Jupiter due to its proximity to the parent star. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> discovered through the transit method.|$|R
50|$|The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by observing {{the amount of}} stellar flux reaching the Earth. The existence of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by also observing the reflected starlight from the planet, {{the shape of the}} star due to gravitational tug from the planet and radial velocity method. Finally, part of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> found transiting the parent star with secondary occultation also being detected.|$|R
5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> formed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Wayâ€“Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
50|$|PSR B1257+12: The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} extrasolar <b>planets</b> <b>was</b> made in 1992 when {{a system of}} terrestrial-mass <b>planets</b> <b>was</b> announced to be present around the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12.|$|R
5000|$|Lord of the year: One of the <b>planets</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be the ruler of a particular year and this <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> assumed to significantly influence the events of the year.|$|R
50|$|Kepler-88's inner <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> Neptune-sized {{but almost}} half as dense. The outer <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> about 60% as massive as Jupiter but its radius {{is not known}} due to not transiting the planet.|$|R
5|$|More <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> {{possible}} {{within the}} stable zone, between f and d at 0.9 to 3.8 AU with eccentricities below 0.4. Given hypothetical planet g {{of up to}} 50 Earth masses, stable mean motion resonance regions lie at 3f:2g, 2g:1d, and 3g:2d. As for the space outside d's orbit, its stability zone begins beyond 10 AU, {{though there is a}} stability zone between 8.6 - 9 AU due to a 2:1 resonance.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> {{very close to the}} ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and the <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> Yin; {{they have}} shape but no light. This they receive {{only when the}} Sun {{illuminates}} them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had {{the nature of a}} mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.|$|E
50|$|This <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{assumed to}} be outside the {{habitable}} zone {{on the assumption that}} the star is K1IVa. Given the star's luminosity, the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> more likely on the zone's inner edge.|$|R
5|$|As the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the <b>planet</b> has <b>been</b> confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the <b>planet</b> <b>are</b> based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 a <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} orbiting 14 Herculis. The planet's eccentric {{orbital period}} is 4.8 years. In 2005, a possible second <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> proposed, designated 14 Herculis c. The parameters of this <b>planet</b> <b>are</b> uncertain, {{but a recent}} analysis suggests it {{may lie in the}} 4:1 resonance with the inner planet, with an orbital period of almost 19 years at an orbital distance of 6.9 AU.|$|R
5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} light-year.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Gliese 581c and its mass have been {{measured by the}} radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets. The mass of a planet is calculated by the small periodic movements around a common centre of mass between the host star Gliese 581 and its planets. When all six <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> fitted with a Keplerian solution, the minimum mass of the planet is determined to be 5.5 Earth masses. The radial velocity method cannot by itself determine the true mass, but it cannot be very much larger than this or the system would be dynamically unstable. Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system which assume the orbits of the <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> coplanar indicate that the planets cannot exceed approximately 1.6 to 2 times their minimum masses or the planetary system would be unstable (this is primarily due to the interaction between planets e and b). For Gliese 581c, the upper bound is 10.4 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|The four giant <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> also orbited by {{planetary}} {{rings of}} varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1998, an extrasolar <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} {{in orbit around}} Gliese876 by two independent teams led by Geoffrey Marcy and Xavier Delfosse. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> designated Gliese876b and was detected by Doppler spectroscopy.|$|R
25|$|The flame has burned {{continuously}} {{since it}} was lit in 1964, and will remain lit until all nuclear bombs on the <b>planet</b> <b>are</b> destroyed and the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> free {{from the threat of}} nuclear annihilation.|$|R
50|$|OGLE-TR-111b <b>is</b> an extrasolar <b>planet</b> {{approximately}} 5,000 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Carina (the Keel). The <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> currently the only confirmed planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-111 (though a possible second <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> plausible).|$|R
