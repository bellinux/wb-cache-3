5|$|One {{question}} of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that the <b>President</b> <b>might,</b> acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) by requiring {{the approval of the}} electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{widespread}} adoption of transcontinental air {{travel in the}} second half of the twentieth century, Congress began meeting year-round. Since that time, it has always been in session on every occasion when the <b>President</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have perceived the need to call Congress into extraordinary session.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{likewise}} {{held that}} Congress, not the President, possessed {{the power to}} act in emergencies because it had exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on whether the <b>President</b> <b>might,</b> in more extreme circumstances, have authority to act.|$|E

50|$|The only {{official}} reason {{given for}} the denial was that the Hungarian <b>president's</b> visit <b>might</b> have constituted a security risk.

25|$|Frankfurter {{avoided the}} {{sweeping}} {{condemnation of the}} administration's claims that Black and Douglas had offered. While he would {{not rule out the}} possibility that the <b>President</b> <b>might</b> acquire the power to take certain actions by a long course of conduct unobjected to by Congress, he found the statutory history persuasive evidence that Congress had not acquiesced, much less authorized seizure of private property in the absence of a formal declaration of war.|$|E
25|$|In this environment, Ross led a {{delegation}} to Washington in March 1834 {{to try to}} negotiate alternatives to removal. Ross made several proposals; however, the Cherokee Nation may not have approved any of Ross's plans, nor was there reasonable expectation that Jackson would settle for any agreement short of removal. These offers, coupled with the lengthy cross-continental trip, indicated that Ross's strategy was to prolong negotiations on removal indefinitely. There was {{the possibility that the}} next <b>President</b> <b>might</b> be more favorably inclined.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the posts}} of leader and party {{president}} of Fianna Fáil are separate, {{with the former}} elected by the Parliamentary Party and the latter elected by the Ardfheis (thus allowing for the posts to be held by different people, in theory), in practice {{they have always been}} held by the one person. However, as the Ardfheis may have already been held in any given year by the time a new leader is elected, the selection of the new party <b>president</b> <b>might</b> not take place until the next year.|$|E

25|$|In early June 2008, the White House {{signaled}} the <b>president</b> <b>might</b> {{be willing to}} sign {{a modified version of}} the Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added transferability provisions for continued military service, McCain said he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.|$|E
25|$|When the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Aberdeen, {{learned of}} the {{proposal}} rejected by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open negotiations. After the brief collapse of British Prime Minister Robert Peel's second ministry, Peel and Aberdeen sought closer relations with the United States {{as part of a}} re-orientation towards free trade. In March 1846, Polk allowed Buchanan to inform Louis McLane, the American ambassador to Britain, that Polk's administration would look favorably on a British proposal based around a division at the 49th parallel. In June 1846, Pakenham presented an offer to the Polk administration, calling for a boundary line at the 49th parallel, with the exception that Britain would retain all of Vancouver Island, and limited navigation rights for British subjects on the Columbia River. Polk and most of his Cabinet were prepared to accept the proposal, but Buchanan, in a surprising reversal, urged that the United States seek control of all of the Oregon Territory. After winning the reluctant approval of Buchanan and many of Polk's Senate allies, Polk submitted the full treaty to the Senate for ratification. The Senate ratified the treaty in a 41–14 vote. After years of negotiations, the United States and Great Britain had finally settled the Oregon question. Polk's willingness to risk war with Britain had frightened many, but his tough negotiation tactics may have gained the United States concessions from the British (particularly regarding the Columbia River) that a more conciliatory <b>president</b> <b>might</b> not have won.|$|E
500|$|Although Parr had {{requested}} a stretcher, none were ready at the hospital, {{and it did}} not normally keep a stretcher at the emergency room's entrance. Reagan exited the limousine and insisted on walking. Reagan acted casual and smiled at onlookers as he walked in. While he entered the hospital unassisted, once inside the president complained of difficulty breathing, his knees buckled, and he went down on one knee; Parr and others assisted him into the emergency room. The Physician to the President, Daniel Ruge, arrived with Reagan; believing that the <b>president</b> <b>might</b> have had a heart attack, he insisted that the hospital's trauma team, and not he himself or specialists from elsewhere, operate on him as it would treat any other patient. When a hospital employee asked Reagan aide Michael Deaver for the patient's name and address, only when Deaver stated [...] "1600 Pennsylvania" [...] did the worker realize that the President of the United States was in the emergency room.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Presidency of the European Commission {{as a political}} leadership position. It does so on three levels. First, it considers the relational nature of leadership, arguing that every leadership position is shaped by its "relationship network"- {{the relationship of the}} leader with his constituents, co-actors, and subordinates. Second, it develops a typology of leadership styles, that Commission <b>Presidents</b> <b>might</b> exercise within the limits of the Commission Presidency's highly constraining relationship network. The three main types (neo-functionalist, federalist and intergovernmentalist) integrate integration theory literature with existing knowledge of the activities of Commission Presidents. Third, these ideas, and a personality-assessment-at-a-distance technique, are employed in a case-study of Jacques Delors. The study shows that Delor's leadership cannot be understood in simple Euro-federalist terms. It also shows the ability of the concepts and methods used to advance comparative study of the Commission Presidency...|$|R

500|$|Considerable {{arrangements}} {{had been}} made for the President's security. [...] Exposition police were stationed at the doors; detectives from the Buffalo police guarded the aisle. In addition to McKinley's usual Secret Service agent, George Foster, two other agents {{had been assigned to}} the Buffalo trip because of Cortelyou's security concerns. Babcock was made nervous by a joke at lunch in an Exposition restaurant that the <b>President</b> <b>might</b> be shot during the reception. He had arranged for a dozen artillerymen to attend the reception in full-dress uniform, intending to use them as decoration. Instead, he had them stand in the aisle with instructions to close on any suspicious-looking person who might approach the President. These men were not trained in police work, and served to crowd the area in front of the President and obstruct the views of the detectives and Secret Service. [...] At such events, Foster usually stood just to the left and behind McKinley. Milburn wished to stand to McKinley's left to be able to introduce anyone he knew in the line to the President, and Foster and another agent instead stood across the aisle from McKinley.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Review of Books writer Greg LaGambina commented of the book's {{acknowledgement}} of Trump's win {{at the end}} of the election, [...] "Insane Clown President: Dispatches from the 2016 Circus, would have been a raucous good-time chuckle of a read had the ending not ruined the ride." [...] LaGambina concluded, [...] "Insane Clown <b>President</b> <b>might</b> not be the book he intended to write, but for anyone looking to get out of the maze we’ve stormed into blindly, Taibbi's dispatches might prove to be a good map." [...] San Francisco Chronicle book reviewer John Diaz said the work contained, [...] "a rich trove of sharply written essays from the campaign." [...] Diaz wrote that Insane Clown President, [...] "evokes a distinct aura of the gunslinging, spare-no-niceties outsider approach that Hunter S. Thompson brought to the 1972 Nixon-McGovern campaign in his seminal work, 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.'" [...] Diaz concluded, [...] "Insane Clown President is a breezy read and will bring knowing chuckles among liberals who will savor its wickedly clever shots at all the jesters in the clown car who constituted the Republican primary field." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 2, 1906, Saint-Gaudens {{wrote to}} Shaw, enquiring whether a high relief was {{practical}} on coins struck at the Mint. [...] Shaw {{did not immediately}} reply, but instead met with Roosevelt, who wrote {{that there was no}} objection to have the coins, many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated, [...] "as artistic as the Greeks could desire". Roosevelt secured Shaw's support for the redesign, although as the President wrote to Saint-Gaudens, [...] "of course he thinks I am a crack-brained lunatic on the subject". [...] Shaw wrote to the sculptor on , reproducing a copy of a letter from Roberts which warned, [...] "the judgement of the authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief", but as the President disagreed with Roberts's view, Saint-Gaudens could go ahead with a high-relief design. [...] Numismatic historian Roger W. Burdette commented, [...] "This is also one of those times when the compelling egos of artist and <b>President</b> <b>might</b> have paid greater attention to director Roberts' comments.

25|$|The Office of Censorship {{published}} {{a code of}} conduct for newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters. The office did not use government censors to preapprove all articles and radio programs.

2500|$|After Cuba {{shot down}} two unarmed Brothers to the Rescue planes in 1996, killing three Americans and a U.S. resident, a bi-partisan {{coalition}} in the United States Congress approved the Helms-Burton Act. The Title III {{of this law}} also states that any non-U.S. company that [...] "knowingly trafficks in property in Cuba confiscated without compensation from a U.S. person" [...] can be subjected to litigation and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This restriction also applies to maritime shipping, as ships docking at Cuban ports {{are not allowed to}} dock at U.S. ports for six months.

2500|$|Hoover was {{the only}} living former Republican {{president}} between his last day in office in 1933 and Eisenhower's last day in office in 1961.

In 1960, Hoover appeared at his final Republican National Convention. Joking to the delegates, he said, [...] "Apparently, my last three good-byes didn't take." [...] Although he lived to see the 1964 convention, ill health prevented him from attending, and his absence was acknowledged in presidential nominee Barry Goldwater's acceptance speech. In 1962, Hoover had a malignant intestinal tumor removed.

Some overlap between the roles of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, and the High Representative—notably in foreign policy—leaves uncertainty about how much influence the President of the European Council will acquire.
