5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, still under Vereker's guidance, Naim {{developed}} a new flagship power amplifier using computer simulation and the latest transistor technology. Search for a transistor with the desired sonic characteristics led Naim to Semelab, who had created a device working at a combination of higher current and lower operating voltage. To accommodate the operating parameters, Naim opted for a bridge-mode topology. The output devices chosen, rated at 350W-70amp, are used singly within the amplifiers well within safe operating parameters; the use of <b>protection</b> <b>relays,</b> detrimental to sound quality, is thereby avoided. However, having the power supply in the same case was found detrimental to the sound quality, so the PSU {{is located in a}} separate alloy enclosure, linked to the amplifier by sturdy cables with locking connectors. The NAP 500, capable of delivering in excess of 200 watts per channel into 4 ohms, was launched in 2000. The NAP 300, launched two years later, is very similar to the NAP 250, but with a separate box PSU, according to authoritative hobbyist website Acoustica.

50|$|The Flexible Plug and Play project, {{according}} to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network {{in order to improve}} its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line’s capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) <b>protection</b> <b>relays</b> which cannot handle reverse power flows. It’s said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses isolator switches at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.|$|E
