40|$|A high {{reduction}} ratio split torque gear train {{has been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} a planetary configuration for the final stage of a helicopter transmission. A split torque design allows a high ratio of power-to-weight for the transmission. The design studied in this work includes a <b>pivoting</b> <b>beam</b> that acts to balance thrust loads produced by the helical gear meshes in each of two parallel power paths. When the thrust loads are balanced, the torque is split evenly. A mathematical model was developed to study the dynamics of the system. The effects of time varying gear mesh stiffness, static transmission errors, and flexible bearing supports are included in the model. The model was demonstrated with a test case. Results show that although the gearbox has a symmetric configuration, the simulated dynamic behavior of the first and second compound gears are not the same. Also, results show that shaft location and mesh stiffness tuning are significant design parameters that influence the motions of the system...|$|E
50|$|The piston was {{attached}} by a chain {{to a large}} <b>pivoted</b> <b>beam.</b> When the piston pulled the beam, {{the other side of}} the beam was pulled upward.

At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.|$|R

It is hung within a steeple or belltower of a church or religious building, so the sound can reach a wide area. Such bells are either fixed in position ("hung dead") or hung from a <b>pivoted</b> <b>beam</b> (the [...] "headstock") so they can swing to and fro. A rope hangs from a lever or wheel attached to the headstock, and when the bell ringer pulls on the rope the bell swings {{back and forth and}} the clapper hits the inside, sounding the bell.

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} paper presents a novel controller design for one {{degree of freedom}} (1 -DoF) stabilizing platform using inertial sensors. The plant is a ball on a <b>pivoted</b> <b>beam.</b> Multi-loop controller design technique has been used. System dynamics is observable but uncontrollable. The uncontrollable polynomial {{of the system is}} not Hurwitz hence system is not stabilizable. Hybrid compensator design strategy is implemented by partitioning the system dynamics into two parts: controllable subsystem and uncontrollable subsystem. Controllable part is compensated by partial pole assignment in the inner loop. Prediction observer is designed for unmeasured states in the inner loop. Rapid control prototyping technique is used for compensator design for the outer loop containing the controlled inner loop and uncountable part of the system. Real-time system responses are monitored using MATLAB/Simulink that show promising performance of the hybrid compensation technique for reference tracking and robustness against model inaccuracies.

The wind tunnel dimension limitation makes a new command in miniaturization design of dynamic balance. The article describes a solution method {{which is based on}} the electromechanical motion modulation testing principle and mechanical structure of saddle-type dynamic balance. There is an II-type structure assembled by oil film bearing and elastic <b>pivot</b> <b>beam</b> on the outer tube to achieve motion modulation and measurement. The double variable cross-section vertical beams are placed in front of inner shaft to measure the five components of high load. The double saddle-type structure is applied to connect the intermediate part of inner shaft with outer tube together. A Scotch yoke mechanism is composed of the transmission eccentric cam of sting and a mullion structure which is designed at the rear part of inner shaft. According to the redesign and alteration, the effective lateral load signal output could be obtained from the miniaturized dynamic balance, in which the maximum longitudinal load bearing capacity is extended more than twice.

50|$|A beam {{engine is}} a type of steam engine where a <b>pivoted</b> {{overhead}} <b>beam</b> is used to apply the force from a vertical piston to a vertical connecting rod. This configuration, with the engine directly driving a pump, was first used by Thomas Newcomen around 1705 to remove water from mines in Cornwall. The efficiency of the engines was improved by engineers including James Watt who added a separate condenser, Jonathan Hornblower and Arthur Woolf who compounded the cylinders, and William McNaught (Glasgow) who devised a method of compounding an existing engine. Beam engines were first used to pump water out of mines or into canals, but could be used to pump water to supplement the flow for a waterwheel powering a mill.|$|R

It is also shown that for the joint with slot around, the yielding time of column bar will shift to a later time, while number of cracks on column becomes less.

50|$|Unlike {{the heavy}} masonry engine house {{used to support}} the <b>beam</b> and <b>pivot</b> of a {{conventional}} beam engine, the grasshopper <b>beam</b> was <b>pivoted</b> on a swinging link. The crankpin was carried directly by the beam and moved {{in a straight line}} vertically, the <b>beam</b> <b>pivot</b> moving slightly sideways on its link to allow this. This simplified the need for a parallel motion linkage on the piston rod. Grasshopper engines were thus lighter than conventional beam engines and could be built completely in factories, rather than requiring considerable erection work to be carried out on-site. This encouraged the use of grasshopper engines for smaller sized engines. Some makers, notably Easton & Amos of Southwark, specialised in such engines. Many were used for pumping, but not for powering large mills.|$|R

50|$|These engines were a {{development}} after the house-built engine.

Although {{the upper part of the}} frame only supports the <b>beam's</b> central <b>pivot</b> and any Watt's parallel motion gear, it also has an important function in stiffening the frame overall against vertical bending forces between the cylinder and crankshaft. Cast iron is weak against bending, and a shallow frame alone would need either rigid masonry support, or would soon fracture.|$|R

40|$|Work-Life balance {{stems from}} the fact that workers as human beings have other needs beside the {{economic}} ones. Individuals have to divide their time among various domains such as work, family, community, religion and recreation. To many people, especially those who are in gainful employment, work tends to be the central activity around which all other activities revolve. In other words the work schedule determines in one way or another how individuals fulfil their commitments in the non-work domains which consist mainly of family and social life. Life becomes a balancing act. In a balance an equilibrium is reached when the weights, placed on one pan, are equivalent to the weight of the substance on the other pan, so that the <b>beam</b> <b>pivoted</b> at the centre is in horizontal position. What this metaphor therefore implies is that there should be an equilibrium between the work and non-work domains.

40|$|AbstractThe {{radially}} retractable plate structures (RPS) are {{a family}} of new retractable structures consisting {{of a set of}} cover plates connected by revolute hinges. The concept evolves from the foldable bar structures (FBS) by replacing the beams in an FBS with cover plates. With a single degree of freedom, the structures close to form a covered enclosure and expand to reveal a large central opening space, which makes them ideal for use as retractable roofs. In designing the plates of an RPS, two primary requirements have to be met. First, the boundary of these plates must be designed such that they form an enclosure without any gaps or overlaps in both closed and open configurations, and the plates do not interfere with each other during deployment. Second, all of the <b>pivots</b> of a <b>beam</b> must remain within the boundary of its corresponding RPS plate. This paper tackles the second problem. To meet the requirement, an analytical method is proposed. A feasible design area, defined by closed and open angles of the corresponding FBS, can be identified under this approach. The designers are no longer limited to use the empirical or numerical means to determine whether all of the pivots of a multi-angulated beam are within its corresponding plate. The analytical approach can be used regardless of the boundary’s profile. The approach can be extended into both symmetrical and non-symmetrical structures. Physical models built to validate our approach have shown that the analysis is correct...|$|R
