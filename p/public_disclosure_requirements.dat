25|$|Since {{hedge funds}} are private {{entities}} and have few <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements,</b> this is sometimes {{perceived as a}} lack of transparency. Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.|$|E

There are, however, numerous situations where ill health with an adverse material corporate impact may have to be disclosed.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of {{political}} donations {{as a case study}} to examine the role of transparency in addressing concerns about undue influence and corruption. The article will explore three issues. The first is to understand what it means to say that a political donation is corrupt. There is considerable disagreement on the ethics of political fundraising and this article will show how public opinion has a role in setting the standards expected of politicians. The second issue is what role the <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of political donations plays in deterring and detecting corruption. While the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> were introduced to promote greater trust in politics, it will be argued that increases in transparency have fed a growing culture of mistrust. The logic of the transparency requirements also requires the free public discussion of particular political donations and related ethical issues. The third issue is how that process of free discussion can come into tension with rights to privacy and reputation. The article will explore how the attempts to reconcile the different areas of law both reflect and shape the political culture...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance reviews company filings {{and where}} appropriate, issues comment letters to elicit better {{compliance}} with applicable <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

50|$|The {{regulation}} and implementation process of hydraulic fracturing {{is a complex}} process involving many groups, stakeholders, and impacts. The EPA {{has the power to}} issue permits for drilling and underground injection, and to set regulations for the treatment of waste at the federal level. However, the scope of its authority is debated, and {{the oil and gas industry}} is considering lawsuits if guidance from the EPA is overly broad. States are required to comply with federal law and the regulations set by the EPA. States, however, have the power to regulate the activities of certain companies and industries within their borders - they can create safety plans and standards, management and disposal regulations, and <b>public</b> notice and <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements.</b> Land-use ordinances, production standards, and safety regulations can be set by local governments, but the extent of their authority (including their power to regulate gas drilling) is determined by state law. Pennsylvania’s Act 13 is an example of how state law can prohibit local regulation of hydraulic fracturing industries. In states including Ohio and New Mexico, the power to regulate is limited by trade secret provisions and other exemptions exist that preclude companies from disclosing the exact chemical content of their fluids. Other challenges include abandoned or undocumented wells and hydraulic fracturing sites, regulatory loopholes in EPA and state policies, and inevitable limitations to the enforcement of these laws.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a {{model of}} {{endogenous}} bank opacity. In the model, bank opacity is costly for society because it reduces market discipline and encourages banks to take on too much risk. This is true {{even in the absence}} of agency problems between banks and the ultimate bearers of the risk. Banks choose to be inefficiently opaque if the composition of a bank’s balance sheet is proprietary information. Strategic behavior reduces transparency and increases the risk of a banking crisis. The model can explain why empirically a higher degree of bank competition leads to increased transparency. Optimal <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> may make banks more vulnerable to a run for a given investment policy, but they reduce the risk of a run through an improvement in market discipline. The option of public stress tests is beneficial if the policy maker/nhas access to public information only. This option can be harmful if the policy maker has access to banks’ private information...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Competitors {{engage in}} product market {{predation}} when they lower prices or increase expenditures on non-price {{competition with the}} goal of forcing a rival to exit. This study provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that financially constrained firms avoid financial statement disclosure to mitigate the risk of product market predation. The empirical analysis examines German private firms, the majority of which failed to comply with financial statement <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> until a regulatory change in 2006 dramatically increased the cost of non-compliance. The evidence suggests the relation between financial constraint and disclosure avoidance is increasing at an increasing rate. Consistent with the risk of predation driving this relation, the results are substantially stronger for firms with other characteristics linked to predation risk. Additional and supplemental tests, including a falsification test and analyses of ex post performance, reinforce my interpretation of the results. The findings suggest an important link between disclosure and financing decisions and contribute to the broader literature on proprietary costs of disclosure...|$|E
