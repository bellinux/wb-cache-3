5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> of currencies' par values. The <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation.

30|$|With wind {{generation}} technology maturing and {{the cost}} decreasing close to grid <b>parity,</b> <b>grid</b> integration of wind {{on a large scale}} became a principal barrier for further deployment and has been receiving intensive attention across academia, industry, and government sectors. “Wind Monitoring 2011 ” [3] from China State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) says that while utilization time of wind was 2, 047  h in the year of 2010, it was 1, 252  h for the first 6  months in 2011. Over Jan. to Aug. in 2011 in China, there were 193 wind farm tripping events, including 12 events individually losing power > 500  MW. In Europe and the US, however, wind utilization was a more favorable situation due to close to load center deployment of wind and the grid interfacing performance of the turbine.

40|$|In {{the debate}} around solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV), {{the concept of}} ‘grid parity’ {{has emerged as the}} dominant benchmark for competitiveness, while some even argue that it will determine the point in time after which the PV industry will boom. But more recently, others have called into question the usefulness of the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> concept. Yet despite its pervasive use and increasing contestation, the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> concept has not been systematically interrogated to date. This paper makes two contributions towards that: first, to show how the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> concept emerged and how it is calculated and second, to explore the role of the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> debate in the solar PV field. The first contribution {{takes the form of a}} literature study of <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> studies. To arrive at a meaningful estimation of the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> point, assumptions made in each step of the calculations have to be articulated and carefully evaluated. Nevertheless, this is almost never done: the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> studies, presentations and reports we reviewed invariably used the simplest representation available. We argue that their authors chose a simplified model for strategic reasons, e. g. to obtain (material and/or non-material) resources. This assessment leads to our second contribution: a discourse analysis of the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> debate. We distinguished ten key storylines and six discourse coalitions, comprised of actors who share a specific set of these storylines. Analyzing these storylines and coalitions, we show that while these actors share a common goal of PV up-scaling, they can have drastically different ideas about strategies to achieve this goal. Opening the black box of <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> thus reveals tensions about preferred strategies in an otherwise seemingly homogeneous PV discourse.

40|$|The {{political}} economy of E. M. S. The economic issues underlying Britain's decision not to join the EMS at its inception are analysed. Technical difficulties {{were the most important}} factor in the short term. Britain had been following a successful policy of stabilising the effective rate whilst the Dollar and Deutschemark diverged. Opposition to the <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> system reflected the fear of a bias toward devaluation and/or deflation within Europe. Most economists stress the likely conflict between domestic policy objectives and EMS. Sortie focussed on the implied loss of monetary control and adjudtment costs. Others pointed to the likely loss of competitiveness and squeeze on profits. The crucial issues are difficult to resolve empirically. In the U. K. EMS tended to be seen as a move towards Monetary Union. Longer term issues are analysed in terms of the regional analogy. A country could face a « regional » type problem if it became uncompetitive. Costs of monetary union seem small if a country is already, in effect, a region of a larger area. Alternatively if real wages and competitiveness are unaffected by the exchange rate (as assumed by international monetarist there may be little loss. The costs may be large if neither of these spécial cases applies. For a low productivity country the costs may be balanced from integration if it is initially competitive and can remain so. A final section summarises the posotion of the U. K. vis a vis EMS and compares it with other European countries. A l'inverse, si les salaires réels et la compétitivité ne sont pas affectés par le taux de change (comme le présument les monétaristes internationaux), la perte pourrait n'être que minime. Les coûts pourraient être élevés en dehors de ces cas particuliers. Pour un pays à basse productivité, les coûts pourraient être équilibrés grâce à l'intégration si ce pays est initialement compétitif et peut le devenir. Le dernier paragraphe résume la position de la Grande-Bretagne vis-à-vis du SME et la compare à celle des autres pays européens. Allsopp Christopher. The {{political economy}} of EMS.

40|$|When the 1987 general {{elections}} brought a durable government to Portugal, the national environment was still inflationary. Nevertheless, {{thanks to the}} efforts of successive ministers of finance/central bank governor pairs, the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) were met and the seventh pair saw the euro conversion rate be set at 200 escudos. The agreed rate represents a depreciation of some 16 % over the one at which the escudo entered the ECU basket in 1989. As the change in regime towards stability-oriented macroeconomic policies was completed when the <b>parity</b> <b>grid</b> of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System (ERM) was under severe stress, escudo depreciations were agreed upon at realignments initiated by the peseta. The understanding by the Portuguese authorities of the ERM code of conduct as they prepared to join after the 1991 {{general elections}} made it possible to acquire financial reputation very quickly. But the enhanced national credibility abroad caused tension within several minister/governor pairs, especially with respect to the timing of ERM entry, the speed at which to move to full currency convertibility and whether the escudo should respond to peseta realignments. Moreover, both the opposition and the governing party initially resisted the stability-oriented policy, stalling structural reforms and allowing the opposition to win the 1995 general elections on a reformist platform. As a consequence, the stability-oriented policy was maintained until EMU qualification but there were no other major reforms, rasing the threat of a "euro hold-up". The weekly escudo-DMark rate reveals widely different volatility states which were accompanied by six successive exchange rate regimes. Before entering the ERM, a crawling peg was discreetly replaced by DMark shadowing with reinforced controls on capital inflows at the beginning of first stage of EMU. Yet, the escudo-DMark rate, even allowing for the last realignment, was more stable in the ERM than when it was inconvertible and the central bank controlled the currency. The comparison excludes the subperiod of crises before widening the bands and the one after volatility in prospective EMU qualifying currencies subsided. Markov switching autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (SWARCH) models with more than three states capture all regimes. The specification with five states is favored because it suggests the nature of the response of the central bank to speculative attacks during the crises regime.

40|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>parity</b> for {{alternative}} energy resources {{occurs when the}} cost of electricity generated from the source is lower {{than or equal to}} the purchasing price of power from the electricity grid. This thesis aims to quantitatively analyze the evolution of hybrid stand-alone microgrids in the US, Germany, Pakistan and South Africa to determine <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> for a solar PV/Diesel/Battery hybrid system. The Energy System Model (ESM) and NREL 2 ̆ 7 s Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software are used to simulate the microgrid operation and determine a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) figure for each location. This cost per kWh is then compared with two distinct estimates of future retail electricity prices at each location to determine <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> points. Analysis results reveal that future estimates of LCOE for such hybrid stand-alone microgrids range within the 35 - 55 cents/kWh over the 25 year study period. <b>Grid</b> <b>parity</b> occurs earlier in locations with higher power prices or unreliable grids. For Pakistan <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> is already here, while Germany hits parity between the years 2023 - 2029. Results for South Africa suggest a parity time range of the years 2040 - 2045. In the US, places with low grid prices do not hit parity during the study period. Sensitivity analysis results reveal the significant impact of financing and the cost of capital on these <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> points, particularly in developing markets of Pakistan and South Africa. Overall, the study helps conclude that variations in energy markets may determine the fate of emerging energy technologies like microgrids. However, policy interventions {{have a significant impact on}} the final outcome, such as the <b>grid</b> <b>parity</b> in this case. Measures such as eliminating uncertainty in policies and improving financing can help these grids overcome barriers in developing economies, where they may find a greater use much earlier in time...|$|R
