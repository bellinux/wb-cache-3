The official line was {{there was a strong}} public desire for further development of government, but there was no clear consensus timing or the extent of the introduction of direct elections. However, the White Paper promised that at least 10 of the 56 members of the Legislative Council would be directly elected in the 1991 Legislative Council Election. In the interim, two more functional constituencies, Accountancy and Health Care enlarged from Financial and Medical respectively, were suggested to be added in the 1988 Elections for the accountancy professions and nurses, midwives, pharmacists and five <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions.</b> The number of appointed members was recommended to reduce from 22 to 20. Furthermore, the preferential elimination system of voting was also favoured to be adopted in both the electoral college and functional constituency elections to the Legislative Council.|$|E

A {{chiropodist}} treats foot and nail problems or postural deviations which may be corrected by means of remedial foot therapy. There is no history of scientific research on chiropody. A necessary first step is a survey on professional practice, diagnosis and treatment. A requirement for a survey study is a reliable registration form. In this study a registration form that draws on the conceptual framework of the ICIDH (International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps) was tested on inter-observer reliability. A chiropodist and a trainee examined 49 patients. Reliability was determined using two measures: the percentage of agreement and Cohen's Kappa.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years there has been a {{significant}} differentiation of medical professions. At the same time their role and position has changed in the nursing process. Genesis of new professions and distribution of employees in the work field, based on their expertise, has led to changes in the work organization in individual departments. Therefore we can encounter highly specialized care in the intensive care departments, which places on its staff a number of specialized requirements. Aim of this thesis was to map the positions of individual workers and especially on the application of medical assistants. The thesis continues on with the issue of setting the optimal amount of nursing staff in the intensive care departments. Outcome of the thesis is that workers under supervision are currently not finding the proper use. However, in the future, we can count on more of these workers, in the intensive care units, to be more needed. Thesis conclusion is dedicated to available options of setting standards in order to calculate the necessary amount of nursing staff. keywords: competence, <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions,</b> headcount optimisation, scoring system in health care nurse, health assistant...|$|E

40|$|Disclosure: Lonnie Lowery is {{currently}} {{a member of the}} Board of Directors for the American Society of Exercise Physiologists and is a registered dietitian. Evelyn Taylor is a registered dietitian. Both authors are members of the American Dietetic Association. Obesity is an epidemic in developed countries. Its ramifications range from cardiovascular disease to cancer to musculo-skeletal disorders. The causes of obesity are not solely biological, as the brief time frame toward the current epidemic has been insufficient to allow for adequate alterations in the gene pool. It has been estimated that variation in body fat is approximately 25 % genetic (Bouchard 1998), with 45 % of the remaining variance explained by lifestyle factors. Additionally, in the United States, an ageing population of “baby boomers ” will compound the need for chronic disease prevention and treatment. No single health discipline/profession can solve the growing obesity-chronic disease problem. Thus, {{there is a need for}} “intellectual civility ” (Boone 2002) among the individuals and the governing bodies of central <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions</b> such as nutrition, exercise physiology and physical therapy. Unfortunately, overlapping scopes of practice can lead to legal contests and an expanding number of certifications that could leave the increasingly at-risk overweight public with inferior care when evidence-based interventions and standardized referral are needed.

40|$|Abstract Background Throughout {{the medical}} and <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions,</b> self-report health status {{questionnaires}} are used to gather patient-reported outcome measures. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate in individuals over 60 years of age the usability of a PDA-based barcode scanning system with a text-to-speech synthesizer to collect data electronically from self-report health outcome questionnaires. Methods Usability of the system was tested on a sample of 24 community-living older adults (7 men, 17 women) {{ranging in age from}} 63 to 93 years. After receiving a brief demonstration {{on the use of the}} barcode scanner, participants were randomly assigned to complete two sets of 16 questions using the bar code wand scanner for one set and a pen for the other. Usability was assessed using directed interviews with a usability questionnaire and performance-based metrics (task times, errors, sources of errors). Results Overall, participants found barcode scanning easy to learn, easy to use, and pleasant. Participants were marginally faster in completing the 16 survey questions when using pen entry (20 / 24 participants). The mean response time with the barcode scanner was 31 seconds longer than traditional pen entry for a subset of 16 questions (p = 0. 001). The responsiveness of the scanning system, expressed as first scan success rate, was less than perfect, with approximately one-third of first scans requiring a rescan to successfully capture the data entry. The responsiveness of the system can be explained by a combination of factors such as the location of the scanning errors, the type of barcode used as an answer field in the paper version, and the optical characteristics of the barcode scanner. Conclusion The results presented in this study offer insights regarding the feasibility, usability and effectiveness of using a barcode scanner with older adults as an electronic data entry method on a PDA. While participants in this study found their experience with the barcode scanning system enjoyable and learned to become proficient in its use, the responsiveness of the system constitutes a barrier to wide-scale use of such a system. Optimizing the graphical presentation of the information on paper should significantly increase the system's responsiveness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Evidence-informed {{decision}} making is a global initiative that promotes the systematic use of health research evidence in policy and {{decision making}}. It means promotion of national partnerships between policy-makers, researchers and civil society representatives {{in order to facilitate}} both policy development and policy implementation through the use of the best scientific evidence available. As a result, different sectors in the country jointly address specific priorities, develop and use specific skills to assess research evidence and to integrate them in policy briefs that provide for evidence-informed decisions by high-level decision makers at both national and local level Developing countries perceive this concept clearly, because the main aim is the same worldwide-efficient, effective health care of high quality. The health care has shifted from one to another model, with different transitional periods and duration in between. Starting from fee-for-services, through pay-per-performance to the newest model value-based approach. Fee-for-services is the among the oldest models, where payment generally has little to do whether their patients’ health improves. Over the last decade, Clinical guidelines are recognized as particularly important {{in the context of the}} current challenges facing the overall health care systems, such as the rising costs of health care, introduction of expensive new technologies, increased demand for care combined with an ageing population, the variations in clinical practice and service delivery patterns among health care professionals, institutions and geographical regions. Although target users of the clinical guidelines are usually considered the physicians, other groups may benefit too, including nurses and midwives, <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions,</b> health managers, policymakers and patients. All of them perceive increasingly clinical guidelines as relevant tools for making health care more efficient, consistent, safer and for eliminating the differences between what clinicians do and what scientific evidence has demonstrated. HTA acts as ‘a bridge’ between evidence and policy-making. It seeks to provide health policy-makers with accessible, useable and evidence-based information to guide their decisions about the appropriate use of technology and the efficient allocation of resources. Different sectors in the country jointly address specific priorities, develop and use specific skills to assess research evidence and to integrate them in policy briefs. ...|$|E
40|$|At Resuscitation Units and Intensive Care Units nurses {{face the}} issue of dying and death every day. Very often they are {{in contact with the}} dying and their {{immediate}} family and they are expected to have professional approach and provide comprehensive care. Stress that the nurses experience in these situations results into mental, emotional and physical exhaustion, and can be manifested by psychosomatic problems. Preparation of nurses to these situations and support of their management is therefore a key factor for the management of this demanding profession. The theoretical part of the thesis contains a description of {{the current state of the}} issue, characterizes resuscitation and intensive care, and deals with {{the issue of}} death and dying in Resuscitation Units nad Intensive Care Units, managing situations associated with death and the support of nurses in these situations. The work has four goals. The first objective is to determine what method of preparation of nurses is in practice ensured in Resuscitation Units and Intensive Care Units for the performance of high-quality nursing care for dying patients. Another objective is to determine whether and how the nurses are prepared and trained in the field of management of situations connected with the death of a patient in Resuscitation Units and Intensive Care Units. The third objective is, whether there is and what is the form of assistance to nurses in RU and ICU provided by the team and the management of the Department in case of deaths of patients, and the fourth objective is to determine what form and manner of support nurses expect and require. Research part of the thesis was carried out by quantitative investigation using an anonymous questionnaire. Respondents were answering 38 questions, 13 questions were closed, 21 half open and 4 were open.

40|$|With the {{accession}} of the Czech Republic to the European Union {{there has}} arisen a necessity of {{some changes in}} the Czech legislation. One of them is also a reform of competencies of health care professionals in <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions.</b> Creation of favourable all-society conditions for independent activities of nurses represents an effective trend of continuous improving of provided care quality. However, it is necessary {{to be aware of the}} fact that the independence is also connected with responsibility. Provision of nursing care requires knowledge of generally binding regulations and legislation, which reduce the number of critical incidents and errors. The theoretical part of the Bachelor´s degree thesis was dedicated to a detailed analysis of Decree No. 424 / 2004 Coll., and then it dealt with the responsibility of nurses within the legal, ethical and moral standards. The Bachelor´s degree thesis aims at the mapping out of the areas of activities of general nurses with the most frequent incidence of malpractice, and at the determining of the methods of forming the procedures that prevent the nurses from making the errors. Two hypotheses have been stipulated. One hypothesis presumes that the most frequent incidence of errors is connected with administration of medication. The other hypothesis presumes that general nurses are not familiarized with the exact wording of the Decree No. 424 / 2004 Coll. to the corresponding extent. In order that the objectives of the Bachelor´s degree thesis could be attained and the hypotheses verified, the inquiry method by means of a questionnaire was used. The sample was formed by nurses from the whole Czech Republic, who were finishing their specialization education in the National Centre of Nursing and Other Health Professions in Brno. According to the results of the study most of the errors occur during administration of medication. Although procedures have been formed that prevent the nurses from making the errors, it is clear that they do not quite fulfil their function. The results of the research have proved both the above-mentioned hypotheses. Among the suggested measures aiming at better preparation of general nurses for their professional careers there belongs, without doubt, the improvement of legal awareness within the framework of qualification education, especially concerning the acceptance of responsibility and consequences arising from the behaviour. It is also necessary to call upon the head workers to analyze (regularly and in detail) the past critical incidents, to determine the malpractice risks and to implement measures for minimizing adverse events occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Increasing the {{education}} of nursing staff is a society-wide issue, influenced by continuous development of medicine and medical technologies. The provision of nursing care is rightly demanding. The {{only way to keep}} up with new trends is lifelong nursing education. Nursing education in a particular workplace primarily aims at addressing current problems of the department and nurses? needs. The theoretical part deals with the influence of education on the quality of nursing care. We present a structure of education of <b>paramedical</b> <b>professions.</b> We define and clarify terms such as pedagogy, didactics, education and learning. We deal with the specifics of education, didactic principles and principles of adult education. In addition, we specify instructional strategies for nursing staff. For the purposes of this thesis, four objectives were set. In the first one we wanted {{to find out what the}} system and process of nursing education in the department looks like. The research showed that educational events are held in all departments. The organizing departments mostly report irregular or monthly frequency. The aim of the second objective was to obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of education in the department. We found disparity between the views of ordinary nurses and head nurses. The third objective was to answer the question of whether the organized educational events are initiated by the nurses? requests. Based on the answers of head nurses and ordinary nurses, we found out that this is not always the case. The last objective was to determine whether nurses implement the knowledge and skills gained to routine nursing care. The questionnaires showed that ordinary nurses try to incorporate the knowledge and skills to routine nursing care. For the purposes of this thesis, the combination of qualitative and quantitative research was selected. In order to carry out the qualitative part of the research, the method of questioning, using the technique of semi-structured interview with open questions was chosen. For the issue of quantitative research, the method of questioning, using the questionnaire technique with closed and semi-closed questions was used. For qualitative research, we set two research questions. In the first research question we wanted to find out what impetus the management uses when planning education in the hospital and the department. We found out that most often it is initiated by head nurses and ward nurses. In the second research question, we examined what obstacles the management sees to the effectiveness of education and implementation of the knowledge and skills gained into practice. Head nurses identify a problem in the actual participation in education in the department. For quantitative research, we set five hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 was: Nursing education in the workplace is an activity organized by the management regardless of the ordinary nurses? requests. The hypothesis was not confirmed. Hypothesis 2 was: Management, unlike ordinary nurses, sees the effectiveness of education in the workplace positively. The hypothesis was not confirmed either. The third hypothesis was: Education is seen as a necessary, routine activity, not as motivating factor for improving the quality of nursing care. The hypothesis was not confirmed. The last hypothesis was: Implementation of the knowledge gained from {{the education}}al events into nursing care is monitored by the management. The hypothesis was not confirmed, the implementation of knowledge is monitored, but not to the extent we expected. When evaluating the results we came across other very interesting facts, which we believe deserve more attention. Finally, it is surprising that the organization of educational events does not reflect nurses? shifts. One of the reasons for this might be the fact that some head nurses do not prepare the plan and time schedule for nursing education. We tried to propose the time schedule of nurses education in deparments...|$|E
