A morphological consensus tree shows that the Phalanger lullulae is related to the Mountain cuscus (Phalanger carmelatie), Phalanger interpositus, Stein's cuscus (<b>Phalanger</b> vestitus), <b>and</b> the Banggai cuscus (Strigocuscus pelengensis). This phylogenetic tree was created by Tim Flannery and his colleagues in 1987 but was also reanalyzed by Ruedas and Morales in 2005.

50|$|The family Phalangeridae {{originated}} from the Australian rainforests {{by the early}} Miocene epoch. Since then, cuscuses have successfully diversified from the Phalangerids. Current {{research has indicated that}} the Trichosurini (possums) separated from the cuscuses that comprised the extant Phalangerids approximately 23 to 29 million years ago. This split supports the surfacing of Sulawesi and New Guinea. The emergence of these land masses implies that the ancestors of the cuscuses traveled to the New Guinea region that appeared while the Trichosurini stayed in Australia. Shortly after this event, around 19 to 24 million years ago, the cuscuses divided into two groups. The first group consists of Ailurops and Strigocuscus celebensis, and the second consists of <b>Phalanger</b> <b>and</b> Spilocuscus, which currently has five species remaining.

40|$|DNA-hybridisation experiments, {{involving}} seven {{species of}} Phalangeridae and two outgroup taxa {{in a complete}} 9 x 9 matrix, unequivocally placed the bear cuscus, Ailurops ursinus, nearest to the Phalangerini (<b>Phalanger</b> <b>and</b> Spilocuscus), with Trichosurini (Trichosurus) sister to both; and confirmed earlier molecular studies indicating that the ground cuscus, Strigocuscus gymnotis, is not a trichosurin but is closest to Phalanger. Our results thus conflict with the most thorough cladistic-anatomical study of phalangerids, which placed the bear cuscus outside all other Phalangeridae as the sole living member of Subfamily Ailuropinae; instead, we suggest that Ailurops should be considered representative of a tribe of Phalangerinae, Ailuropini, while Trichosurus (and presumably Wyulda, which was not examined here, as well as fossil Strigocuscus) would be removed from Phalangerinae and be considered a second subfamily of Phalangeridae, Trichosurinae, limited to Australia. Our estimate {{of the time of}} divergence of Ailurops and other phalangerines is about 16 myrbp; of Trichosurinae and Phalangerinae, about 21 myrbp. Thus, a single Early Miocene vicariant event between Australia and Papua New Guinea, which isolated phalangerines in the latter region, followed by dispersal of the included ailuropins to (or vicariant separation on) Sulawesi, would be sufficient to account for family-level cladogenesis in Phalangeridae...|$|R
60|$|I {{have now}} {{given all the}} cases known to me of a {{difference}} in colour between the sexes of mammals. Some of these {{may be the result}} of variations confined to one sex and transmitted to the same sex, without any good being gained, and therefore without the aid of selection. We have instances of this with our domesticated animals, as in the males of certain cats being rusty-red, whilst the females are tortoise-shell coloured. Analogous cases occur in nature: Mr. Bartlett has seen many black varieties of the jaguar, leopard, vulpine <b>phalanger,</b> <b>and</b> wombat; and he is certain that all, or nearly all these animals, were males. On the other hand, with wolves, foxes, and apparently American squirrels, both sexes are occasionally born black. Hence it is quite possible that with some mammals a difference in colour between the sexes, especially when this is congenital, may simply be the result, without the aid of selection, of the occurrence of one or more variations, which from the first were sexually limited in their transmission. Nevertheless it is improbable that the diversified, vivid, and contrasted colours of certain quadrupeds, for instance, of the above monkeys and antelopes, can thus be accounted for. We should bear in mind that these colours do not appear in the male at birth, but only at or near maturity; and that unlike ordinary variations, they are lost if the male be emasculated. It is on the whole probable that the strongly-marked colours and other ornamental characters of male quadrupeds are beneficial to them in their rivalry with other males, and have consequently been acquired through sexual selection. This view is strengthened by the differences in colour between the sexes occurring almost exclusively, as may be collected from the previous details, in those groups and sub-groups of mammals which present other and strongly-marked secondary sexual characters; these being likewise due to sexual selection.|$|R

6000|$|The {{geological}} {{record is}} confessedly imperfect. At {{the time when}} Darwin first published the 'Origin of Species,' it had disclosed to our view comparatively few intermediate or transitional forms between the chief great classes of plants or animals; since that time, in singular confirmation of the Darwinian hypothesis, it has disclosed an immense number of such connecting types, amongst which may be more particularly noticed the 'missing links' between the birds and reptiles, the ancestors of the horses, the camels, and the pigs, and the common progenitor of the ruminants and the pachyderms, two great groups classed by Cuvier as distinct orders--all of which instances were incorporated by Darwin in later editions of his 'Origin of Species.' But, apart from these special and newly discovered cases, the whole general course of geological history 'agrees admirably with the theory of descent with modification through variation and natural selection.' The simpler animals of early times are followed by the more complex and more specialised animals of later geological periods. As each main group of animals appears upon the stage of life, it appears in a very central and 'generalised' form; as time goes on, we find its various members differing more and more widely from one another, and assuming more and more specialised adaptive forms. And in each country it is found, as a rule, that the extinct animals of the later formations bear a close general resemblance and relationship to the animals which now inhabit the same regions. For example, the fossil mammals from the Australian caves are nearly allied to the modern kangaroos, <b>phalangers,</b> <b>and</b> wombats; and the gigantic extinct sloths and armadillos of South America are reproduced in their smaller representatives at the present day. So, too, the moa of New Zealand was a huge apteryx; and the birds disentombed from the bone-caves of Brazil show close affinities to the toucans and jacanars that still scream and flit in countless flocks among Brazilian forests. The obvious implication is that the animals now inhabiting any given area are the modified descendants of those that formerly inhabited it. 'On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the succession of the same types within the same areas is at once explained.' ...|$|R
40|$|Currently, a {{musician}} working with digital technol-ogy {{is faced with}} a panoply of musical tools that can be roughly characterized by a split between ready-made music production software on the one hand, and audio-programming environments such as SuperCollider, CSound, Pure Data, Max/MSP, ChucK, or Audiomulch (to name but a few) on the other. Problems with the former lie in the concep-tual and compositional constraints imposed upon users by software tools that clearly define the scope of available musical expressions. It {{is for this reason}} that many musicians, determined to fight the fos-silization of music into stylistic boxes, often choose to work with programming environments that allow for more extensive experimentation. However, prob-lems here include the practically infinite expressive scope of the environment, sometimes resulting in a creative paralysis or in the frequent symptom of {{a musician}}-turned-engineer. Consequently, a common strategy can be detected, defined here as that of designing constraints, where the instru-ment designer, the composer, or the performer (a distinction often irrelevant in these systems; see Drummond 2009) devises a relatively high-level system of constraints, encapsulating a defined space for potential expression, whether of compositional or gestural nature. This article engages with this situation by ex-ploring the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts of affordances, constraints, and mapping. We examine how computational systems of musical expression always involve the establishment of a particular stratum that provides certain affordances to the musician, while concurrently posing impor-tant constraints. The article studies how constraints can serve as sources for creative explorations. For this purpose, three systems are analyzed: the mLog, <b>Phalanger,</b> <b>and</b> the ixi lang.

60|$|I {{have now}} {{given all the}} cases known to me of a {{difference}} in colour between the sexes of mammals. The colours of the female either do not differ in a sufficient degree {{from those of the}} male, or are not of a suitable nature, to afford her protection, and therefore cannot be explained on this principle.

60|$|Now, who {{and what}} are the {{marsupials}} as a family, viewed in the dry light of modern science? Well, they are simply one of the very oldest mammalian families, and therefore, I need hardly say, in the levelling and topsy-turvy view of evolutionary biology, the least entitled to consideration or respect from rational observers. For of course in the kingdom of science the last shall be first, and the first last; it is the oldest families that are accounted the worst, while the best families mean always the newest. Now, the earliest mammals to appear on earth were creatures of distinctly marsupial type. As long ago as the time when the red marl of Devonshire and the blue lias of Lyme Regis were laid down on the bed of the muddy sea that once covered the surface of Dorset and the English Channel, a little creature like the kangaroo rats of Southern Australia lived among the plains of what is now the south of England. In the ages succeeding the deposition of the red marl Europe seems to have been broken up into an archipelago of coral reefs and atolls; and the islands of this ancient oolitic ocean were tenanted by numbers of tiny ancestral marsupials, some of which approached in appearance the pouched ant-eaters of Western Australia, while others resembled rather the <b>phalangers</b> <b>and</b> wombats, or turned into excellent imitation carnivores, like our modern friend the Tasmanian devil. Up {{to the end of the}} time when the chalk deposits of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex were laid down, indeed, there is no evidence of the existence anywhere in the world of any mammals differing in type from those which now inhabit Australia. In other words, so far as regards mammalian life, the whole of the world had then already reached pretty nearly the same point of evolution that poor Australia still sticks at.|$|R
50|$|The common {{spotted cuscus}} is {{typically}} a solitary creature, feeding and nesting alone. Interactions with others, especially between competing males, can be aggressive <b>and</b> confrontational. Male <b>cuscuses</b> scent mark their territory to warn off other males, emitting a penetrating musk odor both from their bodies and scent gland excretions. They distribute saliva on branches and twigs of trees to inform others of their territory and mediate social interactions. If they encounter another male in their area, they make barking, snarling, and hissing noises, and stand upright to defend their territories. They are aggressive, and can scratch, bite, and kick potential predators.|$|R
50|$|From 1982 to 1990, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{stated that}} the species was “Rare”. This was until its status was changed to “Vulnerable” in 1994 and then to “Endangered” in 1996. According to the IUCN, the black-spotted cuscus has been {{classified}} as Critically Endangered since 2010. The population of this species is drastically declining due to human disruptions. The expansion of human populations {{has led to the}} conversion from forestry to cultivated land for agricultural purposes. For instance, there has been an influx of Javan people into Papua New Guinea, which destroys the habitats of the black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> <b>and</b> contributes to their decline.|$|R
60|$|After {{the deep}} belt of open sea was thus {{established}} between the bigger Australian continent and the Malayan region, however, the mammals {{of the great}} mainlands continued to develop on their own account, {{in accordance with the}} strictest Darwinian principles, among the wider plains of their own habitats. The competition there was fiercer and more general; the struggle for life was bloodier and more arduous. Hence, while the old-fashioned marsupials continued to survive and to evolve slowly along their own lines in their own restricted southern world, their collateral descendants in Europe and Asia and America or elsewhere went on progressing into far higher, stronger, and better adapted forms--the great central mammalian fauna. In place of the petty <b>phalangers</b> <b>and</b> pouched ant-eaters of the oolitic period, our tertiary strata in the larger continents show us a rapid and extraordinary development of the mammalian race into monstrous creatures, some of them now quite extinct, and some still holding their own undisturbed in India, Africa, and the American prairies. The palæotherium and the deinoceras, the mastodon and the mammoth, the huge giraffes and antelopes of sunnier times, succeed to the ancestral kangaroos and wombats of the secondary strata. Slowly the horses grow more horse-like, the shadowy camel begins to camelise himself, the buffaloes acquire the rudiments of horns, the deer branch out by tentative steps into still more complicated and more complicated antlers. Side by side with this wonderful outgrowth of the mammalian type, in the first plasticity of its vigorous youth, the older marsupials die away one by one in the geological record before the faces of their more successful competitors; the new carnivores devour them wholesale, the new ruminants eat up their pastures, the new rodents outwit them in the modernised forests. At last the pouched creatures all disappear utterly from all the world, save only Australia, with the solitary exception of a single advanced marsupial family, the familiar opossum of plantation melodies. And the history of the opossum himself is so very singular that it almost deserves to receive the polite attention of a separate paragraph for its own proper elucidation.|$|R

Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the suspensory apparatus of the dog <b>and</b> the <b>phalanger.</b> It has been found that the suspensory apparatus {{of the lens}} shows great morphological variability, although some features generally are more common in one species than in the others. For instance, in the dog there is a tendency to form fibrous bundles, an uneven distribution of fibres around the lens, and a fan-like arrangement of these fibres at their attachment to the lens. In the phalanger the fibres are evenly distributed around most of the circumference of the lens and the bundles, if formed, are slender. An area devoid of fibres, described as a diastema,is also present. The morphology of ciliary folds, and of the fibrous bundles and the various types of interconnections between them, have been described and illustrated, and the comparative morphology of the suspensory apparatus of the lens discussed. The reduction of the accommodative mechanism from that situated on both horizontal and vertical planes to that on a horizontal plane only has been discussed. The latter type is found in mammals. The mechanics of the suspensory apparatus of the lens has also been considered and attention given to the rotation of the ciliary folds and the twisting of the fibrous bundles, as observed in the dry specimens. A possible relationship of this finding to the adaptation of the lens has also been discussed. The suggestion has been put forward that the suspensory apparatus of the lens is not only suspensory but also regulatory in function, the regulation depending on its ability to disperse stresses between the ciliary muscle and the lens. The formation of bundles, the existence of interconnecting fibres and interconnecting nets, and the spreading of the fibres of a bundle at its attachment to the lens, are the main factors contributing to the regulation of stresses.

The gliding membranes with their associated musculature and cartilages and the musculature and bones of the pectoral appendages were dissected in the following fluid-preserved genera: Glaucomys, Pteryomys, Iomys, Petinomys, Petaurista, Anomalurus, Cynocephalus, Schoinobates, Petaurus, and Acrobates. Descriptions and figures of these anatomical structures are presented. Measurements of the forelimb and its parts were taken and are presented primarily as ratios. ^ Despite the tendency {{in recent years to}} split the Petauristinae into a number of groups on the basis of evidence from teeth, bacula, ear region, and immunology, evidence from the musculature of the patagia and pectoral limb, the osteology of the pectoral limb and the presence in all genera of a styliform cartilage with nearly the same structure suggests that this group may be monophyletic. The petauristines share 72 (67 %) osteological characters out of 109 studied that are different from Sciurus. All gliders share only 23 % of the same characters. Within the petauristines studied, various stages of primitive (Glaucomys) versus derived (Petaurista) characters are elucidated. Osteological characters which may prove useful in determining whether or not a fossil sciurid is a glider are listed. ^ The anatomy of the gliding <b>phalangers</b> <b>and</b> that of Pseudocheirus shows that all of the gliders could have evolved from a Pseudocheirus-type ancestor. The anatomy of Hemibelideus suggests that it should be considered as a separate genus rather than as a subgenus of Pseudocheirus. Schoinobates is convergent with the rodent genus Anomalurus {{in the presence of a}} styliform cartilage which articulates with the olecranon process. Osteological characters which may prove useful in determining whether or not a fossil phalanger is a glider are listed. ^ Special functional adaptations found in the pectoral limb of the gliding genera are: increased size of the M. supraspinatus providing increased force of outward rotation of the humerus at the shoulder joint, increased length of insertion of the pectoralis major providing a brace for the forelimb against the force of air hitting the ventral surface of the patagia, the metacromion of the scapula and the greater tubercle of the humerus act as a locking mechanism in the shoulder joint, and the coracoid process of the scapula and the muscles of the rotator cuff brace the shoulder joint. ^ The patagia of the gliders are edged with rope-like muscles which help maintain the shape of the membranes by isometric contraction. While not gliding, relaxation of these muscles and contraction of the humerodorsales I and III and of the flexor carpi ulnaris (Petauristinae) helps to pull the membranes and styliform cartilage toward the body. No mechanism for pulling the styliform cartilage of Anomalurus toward the body could be elucidated. During the glide, the humeroventralis, humerodorsales, and the transverse muscles are probably used to control the amount of upward billowing in the membrane caused by the force of the air and allow the animal to change its angle of attack during the glide. ^ The bones and muscles of the pectoral limb are more robust in the non-gliders indicating they climb up and down trees more frequently than do the gliders. The osteological and myological characters of Hemibelideus indicate that the members of this genus are probably capable of limited gliding. ...|$|R
60|$|Example, {{says the}} wisdom of our ancestors, is better than precept; so perhaps, if I take a single example to start with, I shall make the {{principle}} I wish to illustrate a trifle clearer to the European comprehension. In Australia, when Cook or Van Diemen first visited it, there were no horses, cows, or sheep; no rabbits, weasels, or cats; no indigenous quadrupeds of any sort except the pouched mammals or marsupials, familiarly typified to {{every one of us}} by the mamma kangaroo in Regent's Park, who carries the baby kangaroos about with her, neatly deposited in the sac or pouch which nature has provided for them instead of a cradle. To this rough generalisation, to be sure, two special exceptions must needs be made; namely, the noble Australian black-fellow himself, and the dingo or wild dog whose ancestors no doubt came to the country in the same ship with him, as the brown rat came to England with George I. of blessed memory. But of these two solitary representatives of the later and higher Asiatic fauna 'more anon'; for the present we may regard it as approximately true that aboriginal and unsophisticated Australia in the lump was wholly given over, on its first discovery, to kangaroos, <b>phalangers,</b> dasyures, wombats, <b>and</b> other quaint marsupial animals, with names as strange and clumsy as their forms.|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with a study of an extensive collection of prehistoric mammals from Toalian caves in Southwestern Celebes, {{a certain number of}} recent mammal species from Celebes and adjacent islands have been examined. In most cases the recent material for comparison available of a given species was adequate to determine the status of the corresponding cave form. Some of the cave animals (Phalanger celebensis (Gray), Macaca maura (Geoffr. et F. Cuvier), Macrogalidia musschenbroekii (Schlegel), Sus celebensis Müller et Schlegel, and Babyrousa babyrussa (L.)) could be shown to be subspecifically distinct from the living forms (Hooijer, 1950 a). In all of these cases the time that has elapsed since the deposition of the material in the prehistoric caves has been sufficient for a subspecific differentiation to have taken place. In some cases examined, however, the recent material available to me at the time was rather poor, and additional material was greatly needed. Since the preparation of the cave report (Hooijer, 1950 a) more recent specimens have been examined while visiting various natural history museums in the United States. It is a great pleasure to thank the curators of mammals, Dr. George H. H. Tate of the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. David H. Johnson of the United States National Museum, and Dr. Colin C. Sanborn of the Chicago Natural History Museum, for their kind cooperation and permission to study the material in the collections under their charge. The present paper contains observations on <b>Phalanger</b> ursinus (Temminck) <b>and</b> Lenomys meyeri (Jentink), two species which are represented in the cave collection and which I have dealt with before on the basis o...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive morphology-based taxonomic {{revisions}} {{are presented}} for four mammal genera endemic to the Australo-Papuan region. These include Pseudohydromys Rummler, 1934 and Mallomys Thomas, 1898, small- and large-bodied rodent genera, respectively, endemic to montane areas on mainland New Guinea; the marsupial genus Spilocuscus Gray, 1862, distributed throughout lowland areas of mainland New Guinea, on most adjacent island groups, and in tropical northern Australia; and Pteralopex Thomas, 1888, a genus of large-bodied fruit-bats endemic to the Solomon and Fijian Archipelagos of outer Melanesia. Museum specimens of “moss-mice” traditionally {{classified in the}} genera Pseudohydromys, Microhydromys Tate and Archbold, 1941, Neohydromys Laurie, 1952, and Mayermys Laurie and Hill, 1954 are here referred to three generic-level lineages, Pseudohydromys (11 species), Microhydromys (one recognized species), and Mirzamys new genus (for two newly-described species). The 11 species of Pseudohydromys recognized here include six that are newly described. Much of this newly-characterized biological diversity is sympatric diversity. For example, samples attributed {{in the past to}} Pseudohydromys murinus Rummler, 1934 include two species, P. berniceae n. sp. and P. eleanorae n. sp., which have been collected syntopically with true P. murinus. Likewise, samples attributed in the past to Pseudohydromys occidentalis Tate, 1951 are also shown to represent a number of “cryptic” lineages sympatric with true P. occidentalis, including P. patriciae n. sp. and Mirzamys louiseae n. sp., as well as an additional overlooked allopatric taxon, Mirzamys norahae n. sp. Within Mallomys, {{the nature and extent of}} sympatric interactions between the giant-rats M. rothschildi Thomas, 1898, M. aroaensis (De Vis, 1907), and M. istapantap Flannery, Aplin, and Groves, 1989 are reviewed and clarified. Subspecific boundaries within M. rothschildi are re-assessed, and in total seven species of Mallomys are recognized, including M. hercules Thomas, 1912, an allospecies endemic to the outlying mountain ranges of the Huon Peninsula, and two newly-described species from other outlying mountain blocks (the Arfak Mountains of western New Guinea and Mt. Bosavi in south-central New Guinea). The spotted cuscuses, genus Spilocuscus, are difficult to classify at species-level because most taxa in the genus are distributed allopatrically or parapatrically. A minimum of seven geographic “morphs” can be recognized in the genus on the basis of size and pelage characters. The oldest name in the genus, S. maculatus, is shown to refer to dark-spotted cuscuses from the Moluccas and southern New Guinea, not to the orange <b>and</b> white <b>cuscuses</b> from northern New Guinea, as traditionally applied. A review of craniometric and qualitative morphological traits confirms that each of these “morphs” (as delineated by external morphology) is characterized by other distinctive morphological attributes; this fact and the lack of evidence for introgression between any of these various taxa is used to argue that most of these seven morphologically-distinctive lineages should be recognized as distinct allospecies. Only two taxa in the genus co-occur sympatrically—the large-bodied, black-saddled/spotted taxon S. rufoniger and a smaller, orange and white species, both of which are shown to be widely distributed in both northern and western New Guinea. No scientific name is available for the latter taxon, which is newly designated as Spilocuscus tardus n. sp. Taxa traditionally classified in Pteralopex are referred here to two distinct genera, Pteralopex, comprising only those species endemic to the Solomon Archipelago, and Mirimiri Helgen, 2005, for the monotypic Fijian representative M. acrodonta (Hill and Beckon, 1978). Five species of Pteralopex are recognized in total. Museum specimens traditionally identified as “Pteralopex anceps” are shown to represent two sympatric species, P. anceps Andersen, 1909 and P. flanneryi Helgen, 2005 (the largest species in the genus), both of which are endemic to islands in the north-eastern Solomon Islands that were once part of a larger Pleistocene landmass; insular co-occurrence of P. atrata Thomas, 1888 and the recently-described P. taki Parnaby, 2002 on New Georgia is also newly documented. Each of these revisions highlights sympatric interactions and substantial undiagnosed biological diversity overlooked by previous reviewers, and illuminates intraregional biogeographic boundaries more accurately as a result. Before I began this study four years ago, a total of 17 mammal species were formally recognized within the genera Pseudohydromys, Neohydromys, Mayermys, Microhydromys, Mallomys, Spilocuscus, and Pteralopex (Flannery 1995 a, 1995 b). This thesis defends the recognition of 33 species within those same generic lineages, which suggests that the magnitude of biological diversity across the Melanesian mammal fauna could well be underestimated by fully one-half. Preliminary results reflecting complementary discoveries of overlooked sympatric diversity in other Melanesian mammal genera (Uromys, Microperoryctes, Myoictis, Pteropus, Nyctimene, Leptomys, and others) are also briefly discussed. Similar comprehensive reviews, analysing morphometric attributes and qualitative anatomical characters of all available museum specimens, are still needed for all remaining Melanesian mammal genera before any reasonable holistic portrayal of community ecology and historical biogeography can be developed for the Melanesian mammal fauna as a whole.
