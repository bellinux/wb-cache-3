40|$|For {{transverse}} impedance and pick-up measurements {{an image}} plane {{with an array}} of interleaved small probes and loops fed by delay lines was built. This set-up has been used to simulate the field of a slow particle beam with a beta of 0. 065. By varying the delay line length and the probe-and loop-power dividers, the beta value and the ratio of the transverse E and H-fields can be adjusted independently. We discuss the simulated and actual beam fields and present first results of bench measurements. We wish now to compare the fields of a coasting beam in a storage ring with the fields created by the simulator. We assume that the beam oscillates vertically, such that each particle at position s and time t is displaced by 505 ewe lank-~‘_i__i~‘-~‘,-~. ~~~ 7 p;, btroductiorl p’ck up plate frzzz- [...] _. _ [...] L- [...] D [...] The well known coaxial wire method [l] permits the simulation of the electromagnetic field of beams with beta close to unity. One may slow down the phase velocity of the simulator line by dielectric loading, but in this case the ratio of E and II does in general not correspond to that of the slow beam. In this paper, we discuss a set-up of small loop and probe antennas which has been developed for transverse pick-up measurements. beam Slm”lalo ‘-F-Tltp J, ’ /I+ ’ i fl m 2 m ’ rl 1 l-i. -’. ll*n~J., 31, v attestor r [...] T++.;. + 1 1 The loops and probes are lined up on an aluminium plate with a close spacing between adjacent elements (Fig I).

40|$|Slotline {{structures}} will be {{used both}} as pick-ups and kickers in the stochastic cooling system of the CR. A test device was measured {{by means of the}} field mapper with the aim of deriving an equivalent circuit with discrete elements [1]. This model circuit was taken as a base for deriving optimized geometrical parameters of the slotline. The new device is now integrated into a first mechanical prototype of a complete module containing 8 slotlines. As a final step the integration into a prototype vacuum tank with cooled, movable <b>pick-up</b> <b>plates</b> is foreseen.

40|$|We {{continued}} to investigate two-body beta decay of stored, highly-charged ions by single-ion decay spectroscopy at {{the example of}} H-like 140 Pr and 142 Pm ions. For this purpose bunches of 140 Pr 58 + and 142 Pm 60 + ions, containing on average two parent ions, were produced in the FRS (start of the ”clock”), in-flight separated and then injected into the ESR at an energy of 400 MeV per nucleon. Their velocity spread was reduced within 6 - 10 sec by stochastic and electron cooling to a value of ∆v/v ≈ 5 · 10 − 7.

40|$|A large-acceptance lead/gas {{sampling}} electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) {{was constructed}} for the CPLEAR experiment to detect photons from decays of π^ 0 s with momentum p_π^ 0 < 800 MeV/c. The {{main purpose of}} the ECAL {{is to determine the}} decay vertex of neutral-kaon decays →π^ 0 π^ 0 → 4 γ and →π^ 0 π^ 0 π^ 0 → 6 γ. This requires a position-sensitive photon detector with high spatial granularity in r-, φ-, and z-coordinates. The ECAL [...] - a barrel without end-caps located inside a magnetic field of 0. 44 T [...] - consists of 18 identical concentric layers.

But on August 21, Iván Ernesto Gonzalez was arrested and kinapped; the next day, Carlos Contreras Conde, leader of the University Student Movement (MEU), was abducted near the university. That same day Hugo Leonel Gramajo was abducted and introduced in a red <b>pick-up</b> with foreign <b>plates.</b> On 23 August, Victor Hugo Rodriguez Jaramillo and Silvia Azurdia Utrera founders of MEU, were kidnapped and taken violenty amid two cars that blocked their way.

40|$|Metal {{cutting process}} {{is defined as}} a process which used to change shape of a metal made product by cutting. One kind of the cutting method which usually used is lathe process, where the process is {{maintained}} toward work substance of cylindrical shape. This observation is aimed to determine the effect or response graphic of independent variable which determined (spindle rotation speed, feed motion, cutting depth and material hardness level) toward dependent variable (cutting force and surface coarseness) of dynamometer designed and built by Machine Technique of UNDIP. The Dynamometer is a set of measurement tool which used to estimate of cutting force by principle to change its tension to be cutting force. The Dynamometer which working is using principle of electric. Commonly, the resistance change which used to measure the tension of motion measurement (LVDT <b>pick-ups,</b> moving <b>plate</b> capacitance <b>pick-ups).</b> To gain the response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable in this observation is using two testing method, both testing with simple method and testing with Taguchi method. The estimation of simple testing method resulted response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable, that is cutting force which the greatest value gained at level : spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (1. 5 mm), feed motion by level 3 (0. 009 mm/rev) and the specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). By measuring with Taguchi method, the greatest value of cutting force yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). Whereas the best value on surface coarseness is yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth with level 1 (0. 5 mm), feed motion with level 1 (0. 045 mm / rev) and specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). From this observation can be concluded that the dynamometer which made and designed shows the cutting force will be greater if spindle rotation value is smaller, the value of cutting depth more bigger, feed rotation value more bigger and material coarseness level more higher. Meanwhile for the best value on surface coarseness is yielded if the spindle rotation is on low rotation, low feed motion, small cutting depth and iron specimen is DIN 34 CrNiMo 6.

40|$|The {{effects of}} field slope on planter seed spacing {{uniformity}} were evaluated for three different seed metering units (cell <b>plate,</b> finger <b>pick‐up,</b> and flat <b>plate)</b> operating with medium round corn seed {{in a laboratory}} using the University of Nebraska planter test stand with an opto‐electronic seed spacing sensor system. The metering units included a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the standard cell corn plate, a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the flat plate, and a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus row unit with the finger pick‐up metering system. Planter seed spacing uniformity was measured using three parameters: ISO Miss index, ISO Multiples index, and Coefficient of Precision (CP 3). Six replications for nine field slope treatments were conducted for each metering unit. The field slope treatments included: front‐up (front of planter unit), front‐down, right‐up (right side of planter unit), and left‐up (left side of the planter unit) each at field slope levels of 10 % and 20 %, and level. Slope and travel pattern had significant effects on the seed spacing uniformity {{for each of the}} three metering units tested. The finger pick‐up was the least affected by slope as only the treatment of front‐up at 20 % slope had significantly worse seed spacing uniformity than the level treatment. For the cell plate metering unit, seed spacing uniformity was best with the planter on a level surface, or with the uphill‐downhill travel pattern on a 10 % slope, and on a 20 % slope the uphill‐downhill travel pattern had better seed spacing uniformity than the on‐the‐contour travel pattern. The finger pick‐up metering unit had equally good seed spacing uniformity on a level surface and with either travel pattern on the 10 % slope. On a 20 % slope, the finger pick‐up metering unit had better seed spacing uniformity with the on‐the‐contour travel pattern than with the uphill‐downhill travel pattern. The flat plate metering unit had its best seed spacing uniformity with the front up on a 10 % slope, followed by equivalent seed spacing uniformity between right up on a 10 % slope and on a level surface. The flat plate metering unit had equivalent seed spacing uniformity between the travel patterns on a 10 % slope, while on a 20 % slope the uphill‐downhill travel pattern had better seed spacing uniformity than the on‐the‐contour travel pattern...|$|R
