5|$|On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, {{attempted}} a go-around when the crew experienced troubles with a gear indicator. When thrust was applied, the low pressure turbine disc in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; {{parts of the}} disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control <b>pushers</b> for both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.|$|E
5|$|She {{could carry}} five floatplanes and {{two to four}} regular, wheeled aircraft. The latter would {{have to return to}} land after launch, but the {{seaplanes}} would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier, lifted on and off the ship by the cranes. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight <b>Pushers,</b> three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control <b>pushers.</b> The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of replacing {{some of the}} AN/FRD- 10 Circular Disposed Antenna Array (CDAA) facilities with lower cost <b>PUSHER</b> type of CDAA is an option available to planners. It is generally assumed that {{the ability of the}} <b>PUSHER</b> to receive signals of interest (SOI) is only slightly less than that of the larger AN/FRD- 10 and AN/FLR- 9 types of CDAA. However, no specific analysis of the actual difference in performance is known to exist. This report provides a preliminary performance analysis of the two types of facilities. Detailed performance-related measurements have been made at a number of AN/FRD- 10 CDAA sites. These measurements were made {{as a part of the}} U. S. Navy's Signal-to-Noise-Enhancement Program (SNEP). The objective of the SNEP is to identify and mitigate all factors that degrade the ability of receiving sites to recieve SOI and process data from them. Similar measurements have also been made at <b>PUSHER</b> sites, although complete data is available from only a single <b>PUSHER</b> site. This report uses data accumulated from the AN/FRD- 10 sites and from one measured <b>PUSHER</b> site to examine the differences in their ability to receive SOI. The performance Evaluation Technique (PET) developed by the Naval Postgraduate School was used to evaluate the performance of each kind of CDAA. To simplify this initial analysis, the assumption was made that an AN/FRD- 10 site containing an RFSS type of RF switch would be replaced with a <b>PUSHER.</b> Only the technical properties of the two types of CDAA were considered. The additional adverse impact of internal and external sources of man-made noise on performance was not included. It was assumed that the impact of EMI would be the same for both types of systems. In addition, the effect of nighttime overloading and saturation of the R F-distribution systems (RFD) from the relatively high levels of total signal power collected by the antenna elements were not considered in this preliminary analysis.

25|$|When coupled, {{the power}} for the ramps, pumps, {{floodlights}} and other equipment on board the barge is taken from the pusher. When the power cables on the starboard side of the <b>pusher's</b> superstructure are disconnected, a 200 kVA Volvo Penta TD100CRC generating set starts automatically and provides power to operate the equipment when the barge is left alone for loading or unloading. To increase maneuverability in ports the barges are equipped with a 680kW controllable-pitch bow thruster which is powered by the <b>pusher's</b> shaft generator.|$|R
25|$|While usually {{connected}} to a barge, the <b>pushers</b> are also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the vessels, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the <b>pushers</b> very uncomfortable in severe weather. For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the papers}} of the late General William Odom, the INDRA {{facility}} was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made <b>PUSHER</b> CDAA antenna {{as part of an}} overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.|$|R
25|$|When the <b>pushers</b> and barges of the Finnpusku {{system were}} sold to ESL Shipping Ltd in 2003, Herakles {{continued}} her charter {{as part of the}} transport system until her demise in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there were}} two <b>pushers</b> in the Finnpusku system, Rautaruukki and Finn, built by Hollming in 1986 and 1987, respectively. After {{capsizing}} in 1990 Finn was rebuilt and returned to service as Steel in 1991.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s the {{ownership}} of the <b>pushers</b> and barges was transferred to a Finnish financial institution Suomen Asiakasrahoitus (later known as Merita Rahoitus and nowadays as Nordea Rahoitus) and by 1996 all vessels of the Finnpusku system were again under the Finnish flag.|$|E
25|$|As {{the cargo}} {{is carried on}} the main deck, the barges have {{considerable}} tank capacity belowdecks. In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of ballast water in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space {{in the middle of}} the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of heavy fuel oil that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of marine diesel oil for the <b>pusher's</b> auxiliary engines and the barge's own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.|$|R
50|$|The base {{apparently}} {{fell into}} disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery {{showed that the}} <b>PUSHER</b> CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At {{some point in the}} period since 9/11, the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.|$|R
50|$|Hitting a moonball to a <b>pusher's</b> backhand {{side will}} often {{force them to}} hit a lob, {{allowing}} a relatively leisurely overhead to end the point. In some cases, players {{may be able to}} outlast the pusher by hitting several cross-court strokes and waiting for the pusher to hit a ball that can be volleyed away. If a player does not put a lot of topspin on their shots, their opponent may well try to control the center court. This forces the pusher to go for more deeper and angled shots, which are harder to hit without topspin.|$|R
25|$|Being {{considerably}} less powerful than Rautaruukki and Steel, Herakles received new main engines and propellers in 1995. While the engine output was nearly doubled to 4060kW, she remained underpowered {{in comparison with}} the original Finnpusku <b>pushers.</b> She also had a lower Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1B.|$|E
25|$|Bed Races: Since 1980, {{hundreds}} of students have gathered to watch teams consisting of four <b>pushers</b> and a rider race {{against each other}} in a race just over the length of a football field. Teams consist of student organizations, Greek organizations, and residence halls from around UT Arlington.|$|E
25|$|Finn was rebuilt after {{capsizing}} {{and returned}} to service in 1991 as Steel under the ownership of a new jointly owned shipping company. Later the ownership of the <b>pushers</b> and barges was transferred to a Finnish financial institution Suomen Asiakasrahoitus, later known as Merita Rahoitus and nowadays as Nordea Rahoitus.|$|E
25|$|The Finnpusku {{system uses}} a unique rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the <b>pusher's</b> fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|R
50|$|On February 18, 1988, Ricci {{entered into}} Pietro De Negri's shop as usual, beating and {{slapping}} {{him as he}} had on previous occasions. De Negri had {{been a victim of}} Ricci's physical abuse before, but had conceived a plan to kill him. He told Ricci that a cocaine pusher was coming into the shop, and that if Ricci would hide himself into a dog cage, they could steal the <b>pusher's</b> cocaine and money. As soon as Ricci entered into the cage, De Negri locked him inside. He tortured Ricci for seven hours, left him tied with a chain, went to his daughter's school to take her home, and later returned to his shop.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the other}} <b>pushers</b> of the Finnpusku system, Rautaruukki {{has not been}} {{involved}} in a severe accident. Its sister vessel, Finn, capsized with the barge Baltic in 1990 with a loss of eight lives and Herakles, a salvage tug converted to a pusher in 1991, sank with the barge Bulk in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Pusher Rautaruukki and barges Kalla and Tasku, {{built by}} a Portuguese {{shipyard}} Estaleiros Navais de Setubal in Setúbal and outfitted in Rauma, were delivered to Rautaruukki on 31 October 1986. When the two <b>pushers</b> and five barges of the Finnpusku system entered service in 1986–1987, {{it was estimated that}} they would carry one third of the ten million tons of bulk cargo arriving in Finland by sea every year.|$|E
25|$|The infamous aborted Powder Ridge Rock Festival {{was to be}} held on Besek Mountain July 30, August 1 and August 2, 1970 at Powder Ridge Ski Area.

2500|$|In 1992 the Finnish Maritime Administration {{issued a}} wind limit of [...] for Herakles {{due to the}} <b>pusher's</b> low engine power and poor {{performance}} in heavy weather. The shipping company also had its own instructions regarding the safe operation of the pusher-barge combination. The wind limit was removed in 1993 for cargoes other than the ore concentrate by the Finnish Maritime Administration, but captains were obliged to follow the instructions given by the shipping company. The captain of Herakles-Bulk {{was aware of the}} limitations given in the past, but thought that they had been revoked after the engine upgrade in 1995.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} features of the pusher is the high superstructure rising [...] from the waterline. In addition to accommodation, mess and dayroom for the crew of nine, it initially housed two bridges at different levels. The lower bridge on the third deck was originally intended to be used when the pusher is operating on its own without a barge, allowing more comfortable conditions for the crew — the chairs in the upper bridge on the seventh deck were equipped with seatbelts due to the large motions of the vessel when operating independently. However, the lower bridge was rarely used and the space was converted to other uses when Steel was rebuilt. The upper bridge, with bridge wings extending beyond the <b>pusher's</b> breadth, is equipped to allow one man bridge operation.|$|R
25|$|Pusher Steel and barges Baltic, Board and Bulk, {{built by}} a Portuguese {{shipyard}} Estaleiros Navais de Setubal in Setúbal and outfitted in Rauma, were delivered to their respective joint shipping companies on 28 April 1987.

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{restructuring}} of the company Alfons Håkans converted two tugboats to become <b>pushers</b> and established a charter contract with Rautaruukki Oyj. In 1991 Herakles was refitted with a new bridge and coupling devices by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab in Turku, the same shipyard where she was originally built, and became the third pusher for the Finnish integrated tug barge system, Finnpusku, {{which is used to}} transport raw materials to the steel mills of Rautaruukki Oyj.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku is an {{integrated}} tug and barge system {{owned and operated}} by ESL Shipping, a Finnish shipping company that specializes in bulk cargo transports in the Baltic Sea. The system was developed in the 1980s by Finnlines, another Finnish shipping company that also managed the vessels until 2003, in co-operation with Rautaruukki to transport raw materials to the Raahe Steel Works. Two <b>pushers</b> and five barges, four of which remain in service, were delivered by Hollming in 1986–1987.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the <b>pusher's</b> fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{manipulation}} of a grasped object by pushing it against its environment. Relying on precise arm motions and detailed models of frictional contact, prehensile pushing enables dexterous manipulation with simple manipulators, such as those currently available in industrial settings, and those likely affordable by service and field robots. This paper {{is concerned with the}} mechanics of the forceful interaction between a gripper, a grasped object, and its environment. In particular, we describe the quasi-dynamic motion of an object held by a set of point, line, or planar rigid frictional contacts and forced by an external pusher (the environment). Our model predicts the force required by the external pusher to “break” the equilibrium of the grasp and estimates the instantaneous motion of the object in the grasp. It also captures interesting behaviors such as the constraining effect of line or planar contacts and the guiding effect of the <b>pusher’s</b> motion on the objects’s motion. We evaluate the algorithm with three primitive prehensile pushing actions—straight sliding, pivoting, and rolling—with the potential to combine into a broader in-hand manipulation capability.
