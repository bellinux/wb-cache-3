2500|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying airspeed are indicated airspeed ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density airspeed. [...] Indicated airspeed is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> system, calibrated airspeed is indicated airspeed adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. [...] True airspeed is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also {{the speed of}} the aircraft through the air in which it is flying. [...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of indicated airspeed, while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. [...] With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.|$|E

This modular design allows for a variety of probe tips to be used for a specific application. Here, the focus is on flow-field pressure measurements in supersonic flows, so we developed a cone-cylinder static pressure tip and a pitot pressure tip. Alternatively, probe tips optimized for subsonic and transonic flows could be used with this design. The pressure-sensing cartridge assembly allows the simultaneous measurement of steady-state and transient pressure which allows continuous calibration of the dynamic pressure transducer...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the flight test and data analysis techniques applied to calibrate the static pressure {{measured by the}} <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> systems and the flow angles measured by a five-hole probe mounted on a noseboom. Dynamic maneuvers with rapid variations in the aircraft motion are analyzed applying modern parameter estimation techniques based on the output error method to calibrate the angle of attack and angle of sideslip. A complementary approach based on the Kalman Filter technique is applied to wind-box maneuver to calibrate the flow variables. The tower fly-by maneuvers are analyzed using the classical approach of altitude determination through geometrical evaluation of photos; and accurate information is derived from redundant sources to calibrate the <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> system. The investigations showed that the static pressure measured by aircraft installed <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> system is accurate enough whereas that measured by an additional sensor mounted on the noseboom required speed dependent correction. The flight estimated sensitivity factors for the flow angles measured by the five-hole probe agreed reasonably well with the manufacturer's specifications subject to corrections for biases resulting from misalignment and time delays caused by the recording equipment...|$|E
