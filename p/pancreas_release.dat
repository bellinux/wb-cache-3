50|$|If {{the blood}} glucose level falls to {{dangerous}} levels (as in very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the Alpha cells of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>release</b> glucagon, a hormone whose effects on liver cells act to increase {{blood glucose level}}s. They convert glycogen into glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis). The glucose is released into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar. Hypoglycemia, the state of having low blood sugar, is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of dextrose or carbohydrate foods. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon.|$|E
50|$|On a high-carbohydrate diet, glucose {{is used by}} {{cells in}} the body for the energy needed for their basic functions, and about two-thirds of body cells require insulin to use glucose. Excessive amounts of blood glucose {{are thought to be}} a primary cause of the {{complications}} of diabetes, when glucose reacts with body proteins (resulting in glycosolated proteins) and change their behavior. Perhaps for this reason, the amount of glucose tightly maintained in the blood is quite low. Unless a meal is very low in starches and sugars, blood glucose will rise for a period of an hour or two after a meal. When this occurs, beta cells in the <b>pancreas</b> <b>release</b> insulin to cause uptake of glucose into cells. In liver and muscle cells, more glucose is taken in than is needed and stored as glycogen (once called 'animal starch'). Diets with a high starch/sugar content, therefore, cause release of more insulin, and so more cell absorption. In diabetics, glucose levels vary in time with meals and vary a little more as a result of high-carbohydrate meals. In nondiabetics, blood-sugar levels are restored to normal levels within an hour or two, regardless of the content of a meal. However, the ability of the body to store glycogen is limited. Once liver and muscular stores are filled to the maximum, adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral fat stores) becomes the site of sugar storage in the form of fat. The body's ability to store fat is almost limitless, hence the modern problem of morbid obesity.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is {{a common}} and potentially lethal acute inflammatory process. Although the majority of patients have a mild episode of AP, 10 %- 20 % develop a severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and suffer systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or pancreatic necrosis. The main aim {{of this article is}} to review the set of events, first localized in the pancreas, that lead to pancreatic inflammation and to the spread to other organs contributing to multiorganic shock. The early pathogenic mechanisms in SAP are not completely understood but both premature activation of enzymes inside the pancreas, related to an impaired cytosolic Ca 2 + homeostasis, as well as release of pancreatic enzymes into the bloodstream are considered important events in the onset of pancreatitis disease. Moreover, afferent fibers within the <b>pancreas</b> <b>release</b> neurotransmitters in response to tissue damage. The vasodilator effects of these neurotransmitters and the activation of pro-inflammatory substances play a crucial role in amplifying the inflammatory response, which leads to systemic manifestation of AP. Damage extension to other organs leads to SIRS, which is usually associated with cardiocirculatory physiology impairment and a hypotensive state. Hypotension is a risk factor for death and is associated with a significant hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors. This indicates that stabilization of the patient, once this pathological situation has been established, would be a very difficult task. Therefore, it seems particularly necessary to understand the pathological mechanisms involved in the first phases of AP to avoid damage beyond the pancreas. Moreover, efforts must also be directed to identify those patients who are at risk of developing SAP...|$|E

25|$|Under normal {{metabolic}} conditions, {{the human}} body relies on free blood glucose as its primary energy source. The level of blood sugar is tightly regulated; as blood glucose is consumed, the <b>pancreas</b> <b>releases</b> glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted {{before it can be}} replenished, the body enters hypoglycemia, and begins the starvation response.|$|R

50|$|Sleep is {{important}} in regulating metabolism. Mammalian sleep can be sub-divided into two distinct phases - REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, NREM sleep has four stages, where {{the third and fourth}} stages are considered slow-wave sleep (SWS). SWS is considered deep sleep, when metabolism is least active.In normal metabolic function, the <b>pancreas</b> <b>releases</b> insulin after blood glucose levels raise. Insulin signals muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose from food. As a result, blood glucose levels return to normal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pancreas</b> <b>releases</b> {{glucagon}} {{when the}} concentration of glucose in the bloodstream falls too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. High blood-glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin {{are part of a}} feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress. Glucagon belongs to the secritin family of hormones.|$|R

50|$|The exocrine {{role of the}} <b>pancreas</b> {{involves}} <b>release</b> {{of various}} digestive enzymes, including lipase and proteases, such as trypsin, in response to hormonal stimulation after eating.

5000|$|In addition, {{people with}} this {{syndrome}} often suffer from low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, because the rapid [...] "dumping" [...] of food triggers the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> excessive amounts of insulin into the bloodstream.

50|$|Normally, {{blood glucose}} levels {{increase}} slightly after eating. This increase causes the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> insulin, which assists {{the body in}} removing glucose from the blood and storing it for energy. People with diabetes may not produce or respond properly to insulin, which causes their blood glucose to remain elevated. Blood glucose levels that remain high over time can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels.|$|R
50|$|Osteocalcin is {{secreted}} {{solely by}} osteoblasts and thought {{to play a}} role in the body's metabolic regulation and is pro-osteoblastic, or bone-building, by nature. It is also implicated in bone mineralization and calcium ion homeostasis. Osteocalcin acts as a hormone in the body, causing beta cells in the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> more insulin, and at the same time directing fat cells to release the hormone adiponectin, which increases sensitivity to insulin.|$|R
50|$|Where {{there is}} a failure to produce, release, or convert trypsinogen—an {{inactive}} enzyme precursor or zymogen—muscle fibres are not properly digested and are therefore released in the feces.

40|$|Mechanisms {{of action}} of the neuropeptide galanin, a {{putative}} neuromodulator in the central and peripheral nervous systems, have been evaluated extensively in insulin-secreting cells isolated from pancreas and cell lines derived from pancreatic tumors. Galanin inhibits insulin secretion from these cells through several mechanisms, including activation of ATP-dependent K+ channels and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase leading to a decrease in cAMP. Here we report that galanin also inhibits a dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca 2 + current. Both electrophysiological actions by galanin would result in less Ca 2 + entry, as the action to increase K+ current would hyperpolarize the cells and the decrease in voltage-gated Ca 2 + current would decrease Ca 2 + influx at depolarized potentials where these channels are activated. These galanin actions would directly counter the two opposing electrophysiological responses to carbohydrate stimulation in RINm 5 f cells, which are to inhibit K+ current and to stimulate Ca 2 + current. Given that stimulation of presynaptic nerve terminals in <b>pancreas</b> <b>releases</b> galanin, {{these results suggest that}} Ca(2 +) -dependent insulin release from native pancreatic beta cells may also be regulated by similar neuropeptide effects...|$|R
50|$|After {{hours of}} {{mechanical}} and chemical digestion, food {{has been reduced}} into chyme. As particles of food become small enough, they are passed out of the stomach at regular intervals into the small intestine, which stimulates the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> fluid containing {{a high concentration of}} bicarbonate. This fluid neutralizes the gastric juices, which can damage the lining of the intestine, resulting in duodenal ulcer. Other secretions from the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and glands in the intestinal wall help in digestion.|$|R
50|$|The {{duodenum}} also {{regulates the}} rate of emptying of the stomach via hormonal pathways. Secretin and cholecystokinin are released from cells in the duodenal epithelium in response to acidic and fatty stimuli present there when the pylorus opens and releases gastric chyme into the duodenum for further digestion. These cause the liver and gall bladder to release bile, and the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> bicarbonate and digestive enzymes such as trypsin, lipase and amylase into the duodenum as they are needed.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the level}} of blood glucose is high, the <b>pancreas</b> <b>releases</b> insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin then causes the {{activation}} of PI3K, which subsequently phosphorylates Akt. Akt then phosphorylates FOXO1, causing nuclear exclusion. This phosphorylated FOXO1 is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 is irreversible; this prolongs insulin's inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose production. Transcription of glucose 6-phosphatase subsequently decreases, which consequently decreases the rates of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. FOXO1 also activates transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is required for gluconeogenesis. [...] The activity of FOXO1 is also regulated through CBP induced acetylation on Lys-242, Lys-245, and Lys-262. These lysine residues are located within the DNA-binding domain; acetylation inhibits the ability of FOXO1 {{to interact with the}} glucose-6 phosphatase promoter by decreasing the stability of the FOXO1-DNA complex. Additionally, this acetylation increases the rate of phosphorylation on Ser-253 by Akt. Interestingly, mutating Ser-253 to Ala-253 makes FOXO1 constitutionally active. SIRT1 reverses this acetylation process; however, the exact mechanism by which SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO1 is still under investigation; presently, acetylation is thought to mitigate the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and thereby provide an additional level of metabolic regulation that is independent of the insulin/PI3K pathway.|$|R

50|$|CCK mediates {{digestion}} in {{the small}} intestine by inhibiting gastric emptying. It stimulates the acinar cells of the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> a juice rich in pancreatic digestive enzymes (hence an alternate name, pancreozymin) that catalyze the digestion of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Thus, as the levels of the substances that stimulated the release of CCK drop, the concentration of the hormone drops as well. The release of CCK is also inhibited by somatostatin and pancreatic peptide. Trypsin, a protease released by pancreatic acinar cells, hydrolyzes CCK-releasing peptide and monitor peptide, in effect turning off the additional signals to secrete CCK.|$|R

40|$|The Goto-Kakisaki (GK) rat is {{a genetic}} model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes.

To investigate the beta cell function during fetal life we used a hyperglycemic clamp protocol applied to the mothers, which allowed us to obtain a steady-state hyperglycemia in the corresponding fetuses. At variance, with Wistar (W) fetuses, plasma insulin concentration in GK fetuses did not rise in response to hyperglycemia. In contrast, GK fetal <b>pancreas</b> <b>released</b> insulin in response to glucose in vitro {{to the same extent}} as W fetal pancreas. Such a discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro results suggests that the lack of pancreatic reactivity to glucose as seen in vivo is extrinsic to the fetal GK beta cell. Finally, the importance of gestational hyperglycemia was investigated by performing crosses between GK and W rats. Fetuses issued from crosses between W mother and GK father or GK mother and W father had a beta cell mass close to normal values and were still able to increase their plasma insulin levels in response to hyperglycemia in vivo. Our data suggest that hyperglycemia in utero does not influence the severity of the decrease of the beta cell mass or the lack of the insulin secretory response to glucose in the fetal GK rat.

Aim: This {{study focused on}} {{the analysis of the}} therapeutic approach for the treatment of acute pancreatitis in Italy. Patients: One thousand, one hundred and seventy-three patients were recruited: 1006 patients (85. 8 %) had mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) and 167 (14. 2 %) had the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP); 161 patients showed pancreatic necrosis at computed tomography; 121 patients (10. 3 %) had sequelae and 36 (3. 1 %) died. Results: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tramadol were used more frequently in patients with the MAP whereas opioids and the association schedules were used more frequently in patients with the SAP (P < 0. 001). Gabexate mesilate was utilised in 831 out of 1173 patients (70. 8 %); in particular, gabexate mesilate was used in 70. 6 % patients with MAP and in 73. 1 % of those with SAP (P = 0. 521). The duration of the drug administration was significantly shorter in those having MAP than in those having the SAP (P < 0. 001). The antibiotics most frequently used for the prophylaxis against infection from pancreatic necrosis (43. 1 %) were carbapenems. Only a small number of patients received enteral nutrition (4. 7 %). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was carried out in 344 of the 1173 patients (29. 3 %). Surgery was performed in 48 with SAP (19 had elective biliary surgery and 29 had pancreatic surgery).

50|$|The {{degree of}} blood sugar {{elevation}} does not worsen rapidly with age, and long-term diabetic complications are rare. In healthy children and adults, a high blood sugar level {{can be avoided}} by a healthy diet and exercise, primarily avoiding large amounts of carbohydrates. However, as people who have MODY2 enter their 50's and 60's, even though they continue to eat a healthy diet and exercise, they sometimes are unable to control a high blood sugar level with these measures. In these cases, many medicines for type II diabetes mellitus are not effective, because MODY2 does not cause insulin resistance. Repaglinide (Prandin) can help the body regulate the amount of glucose in the blood by stimulating the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> insulin before meals. In some cases, the baseline glucose levels are too high as well and insulin is required.|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} {{illustrated}} by the insulin receptor sites on target cells in a person with type 2 diabetes. Due to the elevated levels of blood glucose in an overweight individual, the &beta;-cells (islets of Langerhans) in the <b>pancreas</b> must <b>release</b> more insulin than normal to meet the demand and return the blood to homeostatic levels. The near-constant increase in blood insulin levels results from an effort to match the increase in blood glucose, which will cause receptor sites on the liver cells to downregulate and decrease the number of receptors for insulin, increasing the subject’s resistance by decreasing sensitivity to this hormone. There is also a hepatic decrease in sensitivity to insulin. This {{can be seen in the}} continuing gluconeogenesis in the liver even when blood glucose levels are elevated. This is the more common process of insulin resistance, which leads to adult-onset diabetes.|$|R

More commonly, the body is unable to use insulin {{as quickly as it}} should. This is known as ‘insulin resistance’ diabetes (type 2). How does insulin work? Your body requires energy to work.

All 30 patients with low IRT concentrations had clinical or biochemical evidence of malabsorption. Serum IRT concentration may thus be a useful diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis. In view of the recent observation that neonates with cystic fibrosis consistently have raised IRT concentrations, {{and the fact that the}} youngest two patients in our series also had markedly increased IRT, it would appear that the initial elevation of IRT reflects early damage to the <b>pancreas</b> with <b>release</b> of enzyme/zymogen; this is thereafter superseded by a progressive destruction of the pancreas resulting in low IRT concentrations in adults with cystic fibrosis...|$|R
50|$|Oral {{medications}} like Glipizide that {{stimulate the}} <b>pancreas,</b> promoting insulin <b>release</b> (or in some cases, reduce glucose production), are {{less and less}} used in cats, and these drugs may be completely ineffective if the pancreas is not working. These drugs have also been shown in some studies to damage the pancreas further or to cause liver damage. Some owners are reluctant to switch from pills to insulin injections, but the fear is unjustified; the difference in cost and convenience is minor (most cats are easier to inject than to pill), and injections are more effective at treating the disease.|$|R
50|$|A common {{argument}} in favor of high-carbohydrate diets is that most carbohydrates break down readily into glucose in the bloodstream, and therefore the body does not have to work as hard to get its energy in a high-carbohydrate diet as a low-carbohydrate diet. This argument, by itself, is incomplete. Although many dietary carbohydrates do break down into glucose, most of that glucose does not remain in the bloodstream for long. Its presence stimulates the beta cells in the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>release</b> insulin, which has the effect of causing about two-thirds of body cells to take in glucose, and causing fat cells to take in fatty acids and store them. As the blood-glucose level falls, the amount of insulin released is reduced; the entire process is completed in non-diabetics in an hour or two after eating. High-carbohydrate diets require more insulin production and release than low-carbohydrate diets, and some evidence indicates the increasingly large percentage of calories consumed as refined carbohydrates is positively correlated with the increased incidence of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.|$|R
