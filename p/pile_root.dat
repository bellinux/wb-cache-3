40|$|Over {{the past}} couple of decades, <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> as the new tool for {{addressing}} a number of tough problems have been gaining a continually increasing interest in tunnel, especially for complex geological conditions. Therefore, in order to promote the development and application of <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> in tunnel engineering, this paper systematically sorts out the research status and development prospect of <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> from the application in foundation underpinning to reinforcement of tunnel foundation. Firstly, the type and development process of <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> are discussed. Secondly, the reinforcement mechanism of the <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> in the tunnel base is refined and combed: the reinforcement mechanism analysis focuses on frictional resistance of soil around pile, soil among piles, and piles. Thirdly, the calculation method of reinforced tunnel foundation is studied from the bearing of vertical load, horizontal load and pile reinforcement design. And through the engineering case, the paper illustrates the reinforcement effect of the <b>root</b> <b>pile</b> in ensuring the stability of the tunnel and the concrete process of the <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> in the tunnel construction. Finally, the problem and development prospect of <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> are discussed, so as to provide new perspectives and fundamental data for the research on tunnel engineering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As an {{effective}} reinforce method, the <b>root</b> <b>pile</b> was {{widely used in}} the base of buildings for reinforcing. In this paper, the feasibility of application for the <b>root</b> <b>pile</b> to reinforce high embankment is analysed, its stability design and calculation is discussed, and its construction technology is studied. Taking the Peking-Kowloon line K 2155 + 700 ~+ 980 as an example, the reinforcement effect is assessed. The research result shows that it is feasible to reinforce high embankment with <b>root</b> <b>pile...</b>|$|R

60|$|Ellis did hold out. The {{elderberries}} {{tried to}} hold out too, but they were {{no match for the}} lad's perseverance. It was a hard piece of work, however, and Ellis never forgot it. Week after week he toiled in the hot summer sun, digging, cutting, and dragging out roots. The job seemed endless, and his progress each day was discouragingly slow. He had expected to get through in a month, but he soon found it would take two. Frequently Timothy Robinson wandered by and looked at the increasing <b>pile</b> of <b>roots</b> and the slowly extending stretch of cleared land. But he never spoke to Ellis and made no comment on the matter to anybody.|$|R

He obtained the first micropile patents in 1952, and has used micropiles in the restoration of many important and historic monuments internationally. As the [...] "father of micropiles", his creative vision has allowed the technology to blossom worldwide and has sewn the [...] "roots" [...] for its future and that of ISM.|$|R
50|$|Spawning occurs {{from late}} March through early August, with peak times being late May and Early June when water {{temperatures}} are between 18-29 Â°C. The Sacramento perch reaches breeding age at 2-3 years old. The perch gather in shallow waters usually {{where there are}} rock <b>piles,</b> submerged <b>roots,</b> or other substrates nearby. The males each defend their own small territories and dig nests for the females to lay their eggs in. These nest areas are vigorously defended from other males by chasing, biting, and flaring opercular flaps at each other. Females spawn by releasing their eggs into the nest followed by the male quickly fertilizing them, but spawning can also occur {{side by side with}} sperm and egg being released at the same time. The male cares for the fertilized eggs for several days until they hatch, defending them against predators. When the eggs hatch they are tiny planktonic fish which rise to the surface to feed and grow for a couple weeks before settling down into the vegetation at the bottom.|$|R

The building is founded on <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> on a sandy deposit. The analysisincludes relevant aspects concerning the structure modeling and the soil behavior. A comparison is madebetween the common design procedure in which the structure rests on fixed supports with a much realapproach considering the supports susceptible to settle. The last approach allows relevant aspects of soilstructure interaction to be accounted for, including the effect of load redistribution, tendency to settlementsequalization and a more realistic behavior of the foundation performance. Settlement monitoring also allowsthe adjustment of soil compressibility modulus and a direct comparison between predicted and real behavio...|$|R
40|$|In the {{analysis}} of the undrained loading of laterally loaded piles an important quantity is the ultimate lateral resistance at depth to purely horizontal movement. If the soil is modeled as a perfectly plastic cohesive material then the calculation of this quantity reduces to a plane strain problem in plasticity theory, in which the load is calculated on a long cylinder which moves laterally through an infinite medium. An exact calculation of the load on such a cylinder is presented. If this load is non-dimensionalized with respect to the soil strength and the diameter of the pile, it is found that the load factor varies between 6 plus 72 for a perfectly smooth <b>pile</b> and 4 <b>ROOT</b> 2 plus 2 eta for a perfectly rough pile.

On the evening of the day in which they took the town, the royalist peasants went in procession, and with many cheers hewed it to the ground; it was then treated with every possible contumely--it was chopped, and hacked, and barked; it was kicked, and cuffed, and spat upon; the branches were cut off, and on the bare top was placed a large tattered cap of liberty; the Vendean marksmen then turned out, and fired at the cap till it was cut to pieces; after that, all the papers and books, which had belonged to the municipality, every document which could be found in the Town-hall, were brought into the square, and <b>piled</b> around the <b>roots</b> of the tree; and then the whole was set on fire--and tree, papers, and cap of liberty, were consumed together.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Lizzi {{started to}} work for the company SACIF in 1947, but shortly {{afterwards}} was the first (and for some time, the only) civil engineer of the newly formed company, Fondedile, where he remained as Technical Director for nearly 50 years. During this time while, Italy specifically, and Europe generally, were being reconstructed, he developed the technology later named pali radice (<b>root</b> <b>pile,</b> micropile) for the restoration of damaged monuments and buildings at the Scuola Angiulli in Naples. The first international application of micropiles was seen in Germany in 1952 for the underpinning of Krupp, in Essen-Bochum and then the Kerkini Dam in Greece. The technique was later applied in hundreds of works by Fondedile in various countries. Pali radice have been used extensively in the restoration of monuments, e.g. Ponte Vecchio in Florence in 1966 and the stabilization of the Leaning Tower of Burano in Venice. He died in Naples on August 28, 2003.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{phenomenon}} of railway and road tunnel {{passing through the}} debris flow gully {{is more and more}} prevalent, for the rapid development of the construction of railways and highways. At present, the construction experience of tunnels passing through the debris flow gully is not rich enough, so the study on this part is necessary. The engineering geological conditions of Cangyuan Tunnel are complex and the construction of which is difficult. The three-step seven-step method, tunnel surface grouting and tunnel <b>root</b> <b>piles</b> reinforcement basis are used to ensure the stability of the tunnel surrounding rock, based on the characteristics of Cangyuan Tunnel which passes through the debris flow gully. The deformation is controlled within the specification range, which indicates that the construction effect of Cangyuan Tunnel is good. These construction measures solve the construction problems of tunnels which pass through the debris flow gully and ensure project quality and duration, therefore, these construction measures can be used in similar projects...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{structural}} {{transformations in}} the construction sector have created the need for building constructors to attend competitive criteria such as cost, time and quality. Therefore, construction companies are searching for new production philosophies to support their improvement efforts and are demanding from subcontractors a similar level of involvement and commitment to these goals. As participants of the construction productive chain, companies active {{in the field of}} foundation engineering are also being required by building firms to improve their work methods. However, because of the very nature of its work, geotechnical engineering presents peculiarities, which differentiate it {{from the rest of the}} building industry. These peculiarities are usually cited among the main causes for the slow development of its processes. This paper discusses the experience gained with the application of lean production principles to the <b>root</b> <b>pile</b> execution process. Recognizing the importance of performance measurement, the used methodology combined Work Sampling and SMED method concepts. Its application in a case study involved three phases: identification of current performance levels; development and implementation of improvement opportunities; and comparison with posterior performance levels. The methodology provided a set of coherent and related performance measures that showed how lower setup times can help increase foundation engineering productivity...|$|R
6000|$|In {{front of}} our house is a broad stretch of grass, dotted with cocoanuts, breadfruits, mangoes, and the strange {{pandanus}} tree. I wish you could have seen them, their lower branches glowing with the rich colours of the fruits hung upon them by Ori and his men, and great heaps lying <b>piled</b> against their <b>roots,</b> {{on the evening of}} our feast. From the bamboo poles that they were carried upon, a pen was made for the ten pigs, and a fowl house for the twenty-three fowls that were among the presents. But there was a day of reckoning at hand. Time after time we ran down to the beach to look for the Casco, until we were in despair. For over a month we had lived in Ori's house, causing him infinite trouble and annoyance, and not even his, at that. Areia (the chief--Areia means the Prince) went to Papeete and came back with a letter to say that more work had to be done upon the Casco, and it might be any time before she could get to Tautira. We had used up all our stores, and had only a few dollars of money left in Tautira, and not very much in Papeete. Could we stand the journey to Papeete, we could not live upon the yacht {{in the midst of the}} workmen, and we had not money enough left to live at an hotel. We were playing cards on the floor, as usual, when this message came, and you can imagine its effect. I knew perfectly well that Rui would force us to stay on with him, but what depressed me the most of all, was the fact of Louis having made brothers with him just before this took place. Had there been a shadow of doubt on our dear Rui's face, I should have fled from before him. Sitting there on the floor waiting for him was too much for my nerves and I burst into tears, upon which the princess wept bitterly. In the meantime the priest had dropped in, so that we had him and MoÃ«, and Areia, as witnesses to our humiliating position. First came Madame Rui, who heard the story, and sat down on the floor in silence, which was very damping for a beginning, and then Ori of Ori, the magnificent, who listened to the tale of the shipwrecked mariners with serious dignity, asking one or two questions, and then spoke to this effect. [...] "You are my brother: all that I have is yours. I know that your food is done, but I can give you plenty of fish and taro. We like you, and wish to have you here. Stay where you are till the Casco comes. Be happy--et ne pleurez pas." [...] Louis dropped his head into his hands and wept, and then we all went up to Rui and shook hands with him and accepted his offer. Madame Rui, who had been silent only as a dutiful wife, that her husband might speak first, poured forth manifold reasons for our staying on as long as we could possibly manage. During all this scene, an attendant of the princess had been sitting on the floor behind us, a baby in his arms, where he had ensconced himself for the purpose of watching the game. He understood nothing of what was going on; we wondered afterwards what he thought of it. Reduced as we were, we still had a few bottles of champagne left. Champagne being an especial weakness of our gigantic friend, it occurred to some one that this was a proper occasion to open a couple of bottles. Louis, the Princess, and I were quite, as the Scotch so well say, [...] "begrutten," [...] Areia's immense eyes were fairly melting out of his head with emotion, the priest was wiping his eyes and blowing his nose: and then for no apparent cause we suddenly fell to drinking and clinking glasses quite merrily: the bewildered attendant clinked and drank too, and then sat down and waited in case there should be any repetition of the drinking part of the performance. And sure enough there was, for in the midst of an animated discussion as to ways and means, Mrs. Stevenson announced that it was St. Andrew's day, so again the attendant clinked and drank with Ori's mad foreigners.|$|R
