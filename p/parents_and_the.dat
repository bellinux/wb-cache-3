5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of {{the wife of a}} head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups is regarded as a full-time job.|$|E

5|$|The National Trust for Scotland {{purchased}} {{the island in}} 2000 from a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company who had owned the island since 1955.

50|$|P.E.T. {{is neither}} authoritarian nor permissive, {{both of which}} are win-lose methods of child-rearing.

5|$|The {{first half}} of the story takes place {{primarily}} at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa's <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dormitory where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.|$|E
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|As a pupil at Dunfermline High School, Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and {{two other}} languages. He became a {{reluctant}} rugby player, {{under the guidance of}} retired Welsh international Ronnie Boon, while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys. By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, Hamilton Academical, and Partick Thistle. Liverpool manager George Kay became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish defender Matt Busby, who learned of the teenager from Manchester City's Alex Herd while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take Willie McAndrew, manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon. Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938 and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of £3. Negotiations between his <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.|$|E

The chapel was used as the main schoolroom while the other buildings were used to provide a library and accommodation for the master and boarding pupils. The arrangement continued until the 19th century, and today the building is used as the school chapel.|$|E

5|$|The band's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} grow over the coming years. As the younger band members completed their high school studies, they performed frequent concerts in Antananarivo, staying overnight in the student dorms with Raoul and Nono. Fafa moved to Antananarivo the shortly afterward {{to live with his}} <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> band often gathered at his family's home, where they composed many of their early songs.

Political party representatives often approached band members to request them to become official supporters and party members, but the band preferred to remain politically independent.Another young and emerging group, Lolo sy ny Tariny, was recruited by the political party MFM, who attempted to pit the two groups against each other. Although there were occasional arguments between Bekoto and members of Lolo sy ny Tariny that garnered publicity, the band remained largely above political disputes.|$|E
