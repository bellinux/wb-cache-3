50|$|During the Middle Ages most burghers and peasants had merchant's marks or house marks {{that were}} used for marking {{ownership}} and {{as a means of}} <b>personal</b> <b>identification.</b> These <b>marks</b> are older than heraldic tradition. They are mostly simple compositions of straight lines suitable for being scratched in wood or other materials. They have a similarity to runes and some marks consist of the initials of the owner. Later merchant's marks also incorporates Latin letters. In the beginning these marks were displayed without a shield but during the Middle Ages it became common to draw them inside a shield. Merchant's marks were used by burghers until the 18th century and for about a century longer by peasants.|$|R

40|$|This project aims {{to save a}} {{fingerprint}} in the database. Fingerprints contain many details, which are known as minutiae, {{that can be used}} for <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> in fingerprint verification. Fingerprint recognition is one of the biometric techniques. Each person has a different pattern of fingerprint make it unique and different from each other. Therefore, it can be used for <b>personal</b> <b>identification.</b> Using fingerprint recognition makes a guarantee to be more secure because of unchangeable fingerprint. There are many applications that used fingerprint recognition like fingerprint recognition to replace password and also used fingerprint recognition to recognize the individual identity card for a long period. This project needs the user to thumbprint their finger to be save in database and later their fingerprint is compared and match to retrieve the information...|$|R
40|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> is {{necessary}} and useful to prevent crime in our society. Biometric traits extracted from hand image are more secure to use for <b>identification</b> compared to <b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> Number (PIN) because these features cannot be stolen. Developing an effective hand vein based <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> system using robust feature with appropriate classifier is a serious task. Therefore this work incorporates new hand vein feature and two different classifiers to develop a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> system. Experiments were carried-out to affirm appropriateness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Euclidean Distance Measure (EDM) for the proposed system. The results obtained show that the proposed system give better result using SVM compared to EDM...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} {{studies of}} multi-modal and multi-view <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> focused on combining the outputs of multiple classifiers at the decision level. In this study, we investigated the fusion at the feature level to combine multiple views and modals in <b>personal</b> <b>identification.</b> A new similarity measure is proposed, which integrates multiple 2 -D view features representing a visual {{identity of a}} 3 -D object seen from different viewpoints and from different sensors. The robustness to non-rigid distortions is achieved by the proximity correspondence manner in the similarity computation. The feasibility and capability of the proposed technique for <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> were evaluated on multiple view human faces and palmprints. This research demonstrates that the feature-level fusion provides {{a new way to}} combine multiple modals and views for <b>personal</b> <b>identification.</b> 1...|$|R
