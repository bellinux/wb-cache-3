40|$|This paper characterizes polygons {{that are}} small-time locally controllableby stable <b>pushing</b> as a {{function}} of the polygon shape, the location of the center of friction, and the friction coefficient at the <b>pushing</b> contact.

Because the <b>pushes</b> are stable, <b>pushing</b> plans can be executed without feedback. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{formulate}} {{and address}} the problem of planning a <b>pushing</b> manipulation by a mobile robot which tries to rearrange several movable objects in its work space. We present an algorithm which, when given a set of goal configurations, plans a <b>pushing</b> path to the “cheapest ” goal or announces that no such path exists. Our method provides detailed manipulation plans, including any intermediate motion of the <b>pusher</b> while changing contact configuration with the <b>pushed</b> movables. Given a <b>pushing</b> problem, a <b>pushing</b> path is found using a two-phase procedure: a context sensitive back propagation of a cost function which maps the configuration space, and a gradient descent phase which builds the <b>pushing</b> path. Both phases are based on a dynamic neighborhood filter which constrains each step to consider only admissible neighboring configurations. This admissibility mechanism provides a primary tool for expressing the special characteristics of the <b>pushing</b> manipulation. It also allows for a full integration of any geometrical constraints imposed by the <b>pushing</b> robot, the <b>pushed</b> movables and the environment. We prove optimality and completeness of our algorithm and give some experimental results in different scenarios. Index Terms—Manipulation planning, <b>pushing</b> planning. I...|$|R
