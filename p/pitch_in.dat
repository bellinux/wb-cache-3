5|$|The 2013 season saw Bumgarner set career bests for ERA (2.77), walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (1.03) and strikeouts (199) in 31 starts, {{finishing}} with a 13–9 record. Bumgarner's WHIP {{was the lowest}} for a Giants' left-hander since Carl Hubbell's in 1933. Bumgarner was also selected by Giants manager Bruce Bochy and {{the manager of the}} National League team, to <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the All Star game for the first time. However, Bumgarner didn't <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|Zito's {{regular season}} {{performance}} with the Giants was less successful; he went 63–80 with a 4.62 ERA. However, he had significantly more playoff success with them. Aided by his contributions in 2010, the team won its first World Series since 1954. Zito did not <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the playoffs that year, but did <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the 2012 postseason, saving the Giants' season by pitching {{them to a}} Game 5 victory in the NLCS against the Cardinals, and then outdueling Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series. The Giants {{went on to win}} their second World Series in three years.|$|E
5|$|A half-way line, {{parallel}} to the back line, divides the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> two. The start of each period of play and resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. The line was also used for the obselete offside rule.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pitches</b> <b>in</b> Zimbabwe closely {{resemble}} those in South Africa. The only difference {{being in the}} nature of the bounce. The <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> South Africa provide fast bounce while the <b>pitches</b> <b>in</b> Zimbabwe tend to have a spongy, tennis ball type of bounce, which makes hitting on the up a risky proposition. Most pitches have slower bounce, hence batting is more favourable in Zimbabwe.|$|R
5|$|Daily's {{performance}} that season {{caught the eye}} of Major League teams, and he signed with the Buffalo Bisons for the 1882 season. Although he shared starts with future Hall of Famer Pud Galvin, he was able to <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> 29games, winning 15 of them.|$|E

5|$|On June 4, {{playing at}} Connie Mack Stadium against the Phillies, Koufax walked Richie Allen {{on a very}} close full-count <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the fourth inning. Allen, who was thrown out trying to steal second, was the only Phillie to reach base that day. With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second pitcher of the modern era (after Bob Feller) to pitch three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox {{suffered}} a collapse {{late in the}} 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning. A source among the Red Sox claimed that Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, and John Lackey spent games they did not <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer; some Red Sox teammates speculated that Youkilis {{was the source of}} this information, alienating him from his teammates.|$|E

5|$|When Strømmen IF were {{promoted}} to First Division {{ahead of the}} 1986 season, the team originally announced that they would play their fall games at Åråsen, as Strømmen Stadion {{was in need of}} a new <b>pitch.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Strømmen only played one of their matches at Åråsen, drawing 1–1 against Rosenborg on 10 August 1986 in front of 1,649 spectators.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} by the Rangers, Ramírez {{got a job at}} a Coca-Cola bottling plant while learning how to <b>pitch.</b> <b>In</b> 2000, he attended the Hiroshima Toyo Carp's academy in the Dominican Republic, and he appeared in two games for the Carp in 2002. He gave up one run in three innings while striking out three batters and walking two, and he was posted in 2003. The winning bid was placed by the New York Yankees, who signed him on March 5, 2003, and assigned him to their minor league system.|$|E
50|$|On November 30, 1964, the Detroit Tigers drafted Patterson in the 1964 first-year draft.

5|$|As a manager, Virdon led the Pirates to the 1972 NL East {{division}} title, but the Pirates {{lost the}} 1972 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Cincinnati Reds when Pittsburgh pitcher Bob Moose unleashed a wild <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the final inning of Game 5, allowing {{the winning run}} to score. The 1973 Pirates had to play without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with Ellis and Richie Hebner, and the Pirates fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E
5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E

5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{played only}} one more match for the club, {{two weeks after the}} Cup Final. Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, against Internazionale on a hard <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the San Siro, he played in their next, a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia.

On 17 August 1956, the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign, Boyd's contract with the club was terminated at his own request.|$|E
5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} toll on the <b>pitch.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, combined with an early start to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E
