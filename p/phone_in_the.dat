Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer leaves out any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals that he put a cell <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baby’s belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William.

5|$|In Tallahassee, Florida, on December 21, 1999, a {{memorial}} service is held for a former FBI agent named Raymond Crouch. His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a cell <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with a shovel. Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. Because of the presence of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{task for the}} midwife is following up mother-child interaction to facilitate mother-infant attachment. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore midwives’ perceptions of parents’ use of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternity ward. The research question was: Is the use of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternity ward a threat to patient safety? Two focus group interviews exploring midwives’ perceptions (n = 10) of parent’ use of mobile phones during and after the birth were conducted in January 2016. Systematic text condensation was used to analyse the data, revealing three themes pertaining to safety concerns: Interrupted communication due to parents’ excessive use of mobile phones during labour and postnatally, Unsafe care caused by lack of attention to the newborn baby’s signals as a result of being disturbed by the mobile phone and Unsafe care because of parents interrupting their conversation with the midwife by answering <b>the</b> mobile, acting <b>in</b> a disrespectful manner and failing to pay attention. The midwives’ descriptions of parents’ use of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternity ward included reflections on mobile phone usage as a permanent phenomenon. They were concerned that parents’ use of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternity ward could negatively affect the attachment process and considered that it interrupted their work. In conclusion, there is a need for increased awareness of parents’ use of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternity ward. Further research is required to gain greater insight into the consequences of mobile <b>phone</b> use <b>in</b> order to promote patient safety by ensuring effective communication between parents and midwives. In addition, research is needed to explore the safety discourse, clinical risks and/or health problems involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of infant-parent attachment in newborn babies...|$|R

Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to be real glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in a cup of tea for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and which one would be evicted.

5|$|Ten {{days after}} leaving Grimsby Town, Beharall {{was on the}} move again, this time to Oldham Athletic on a loan deal {{to the end of}} the season. Beharall made his dèbut in a 0–0 draw against Stoke City on 21 November 2001. He played 17 league games, two FA Cup and two Football League Trophy matches during his loan spell at Oldham, scoring one goal in the 89th minute in a 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic on 15 December 2001. Beharall was bought by Oldham Athletic on 6 March 2002 for £150,000 on a three-year {{contract}} after impressing during his loan deal. David played one more league game for The Latics during the 2001–02 season against Wigan on 9 March, a match which Wigan won 1–0. In the 2002–03 season Beharall played 32 league, 4 League and 3 FA Cup games for Oldham under the management of Iain Dowie, who replaced Mick Wadsworth in the summer of 2002. In the pre-season of the 2003–04 season, he suffered an injury which left him out of action until October 2003. During this time in August 2003 Beharall was a victim of a carjacking when he and team mate Adam Griffin were attacked when they stopped at a cash machine with Beharall leaving Grffin in the passenger seat and his £21,000 Mercedes-Benz R230 car parked at a Texaco garage in Oldham. Griffin was left defenseless with one of the attackers holding him at knifepoint and another man hit Griffin's left arm with an iron bar, then dragging and throwing Griffin to the ground. Beharall left his wallet and mobile <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car but was relieved that he and Griffin were OK. During the 2003–2004 season Beharall played 7 league, 2 FA Cup and 2 Football league games, he also scored 2 league goals against Plymouth Argyle on 1 November 2003. After playing only 6 league games during the 2004–05 season new manager Brian Talbot, Beharall left the club on 24 January 2005 after agreeing a settlement figure.|$|E

25|$|New spotter {{technologies}} and training techniques have been developing since the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, {{the vast majority}} of amateur radio communication relied on AM-modulated signals and the use of simplex. It was not uncommon for spotters to hear the distant net control station and not hear other mobile or base stations which were much closer. After 1960, amateurs adopted the use of FM repeaters which operated in the VHF spectrum. The use of FM repeaters was a huge advancement for storm spotters; spotters could now hear each other regularly. The low noise floor and greatly improved audio quality meant much better signal reception for all stations. By the 1970s, nearly all spotter radio activity consisted of half-duplex FM repeater use. The next major technology to aid spotters was the development of the cell <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s and early 1980s. It was then possible for non-amateur radio operators to directly report severe weather.|$|E
40|$|Abstract / In {{this article}} I examine the {{deployment}} of cell <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> two different contexts. The first {{is the use of}} cell <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> a protest movement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines that resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resignation of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. I then look at the marketing and consumption of cell <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (over) developed world, focusing on the USA. I argue that the Philippine protest movement, known as People Power II, indicates the medium’s progressive potential, while the marketing of cell <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USA indicates the medium’s reactionary potential, or, borrowing a term from Paul Virilio, the cell phone’s potential as ‘technological nanny’. The comparison tries to steer between two orientations in cultural studies – which I characterize as the optimism of techno-utopianism and the pessimism of techno-phobia – in order to appreciate the political potential of cell <b>phones,</b> <b>in</b> particular, and technology in general...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the number of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world has {{increased}} at an exponential rate with many developed countries reaching 60 % ownership rates. The reasons for this are numerous, however low prices {{and the availability of}} new technology mean that even children now own and regularly use mobile phones. Furthermore, the number of mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world has already passed the number of fixed land lines and the revenue from mobiles phones will soon exceed that of fixed land lines (ITU 2001). This paper explores the relationships between a number of key input factors and customers' overall satisfaction with their mobile phone, and develops a neural network model to predict the overall level of customer satisfaction derived from mobile <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. The final model uses eleven input factors, the most important of which are experience of product quality, level of service charges, level of call charges, and level of satisfaction with the service provider. The estimated neural network model predicted very well and appears to be very robust. Finally, the implications of these results for marketers are discussed...|$|R
