Long-term {{trends and}} spatial {{patterns}} of water quality at 5 {{stations in the}} upstream of the Daling River basin of North China were examined for 5 parameters—pH, suspended sediment (SS), dissolved oxygen (DO), <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand</b> (CODMn) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5). Analysis determined the trends of parameters of each station between 1987 and 2007. The variations in <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand</b> and biochemical oxygen demand showed increasing trends and the variations in dissolved oxygen were decrease in 1990 s. Multi-year average values of <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand</b> and dissolved oxygen in Chaoyang station and Jianping station were 2. 8 mg/L, 37. 6 mg/L and 9. 6 mg/L, 6. 1 mg/L, respectively. The parameter characteristics of water quality in flood and dry season showed significant heterogeneity at main stream and tributary. Correlations between parameters were analyzed using a regression analysis method. The correlations of each parameter determined there were linear negative correlation between dissolved oxygen and <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand,</b> dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand at Habaqi station, Dachengzi station and Chaoyang station. The <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand</b> and biochemical oxygen demand was significant positive correlation in 3 stations...|$|E

(Marking et al. 1994) examined two In the same event, (Rasowo et al. 2007) investigated the effect of formaldehyde, sodium chloride, potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide treatment for saprolegniosis in catfish (C. gariepinus) eggs and found that the best hatchability performance was when eggs treated with 2 ppm potassium permanganate for 30 min (96.7 %). (Darwish et al. 2009) evaluate the efficacy of KMnO 4 at a dose of 2.0 mg/L above the potassium <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand</b> for 2 h duration against Columnaris infection in channel catfish using different route of administration and found that using KMnO 4 simultaneously with challenge give 99 % survival while using KMnO 4 postchallenge enhanced survival (85 %) than positive control (78 %); which conclude overall efficacy of KMnO 4 as a treatment against skin infection. (Marking et al. 1994) reported that potassium permanganate at two concentrations 50 and 100 mg/l decreased fungal infection of rainbow trout eggs but rate of hatching didn’t increase. Our results were supported by (Thomas-Jinu and Goodwin 2004) who found that KMnO 4 reduced columnaris mortality from 100 % to 69 %.|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} {{have led to}} water quality deterioration {{in many parts of}} the world, especially in Northeast China. The current work investigated the spatiotemporal variations of water quality in the Taizi River by multivariate statistical analysis of data from the 67 sampling sites in the mainstream and major tributaries of the river during dry and rainy seasons. One-way analysis of variance indicated that the 20 measured variables (except pH, 5 -day biological oxygen <b>demand,</b> <b>permanganate</b> index, and chloride, orthophosphate, and total phosphorus concentrations) showed significant seasonal (p 0. 05) and spatial (p< 0. 05) variations among the mainstream and major tributaries of the river. Hierarchical cluster analysis of data from the different seasons classified the mainstream and tributaries of the river into three clusters, namely, less, moderately, and highly polluted clusters. Factor analysis extracted five factors from data in the different seasons, which accounted for the high percentage of the total variance and reflected the integrated characteristics of water chemistry, organic pollution, phosphorous pollution, denitrification effect, and nitrogen pollution. The results indicate that river pollution in Northeast China was mainly from natural and/or anthropogenic sources, e. g., rainfall, domestic wastewater, agricultural runoff, and industrial discharge. 2014 Springer International Publishing...|$|R
40|$|Microlayers {{are natural}} surface films derived from {{hydrophobic}} organic compounds that form on most lakes and streams. Holoarctic brown water lakes {{have been most}} commonly studied, with Australian research limited to marine microlayers. Artificial monolayers based on long-chain fatty alcohols have been applied to freshwater storages to reduce evaporative loss. As a water conservation strategy, monolayer technology was not widely adopted due to variable field performance. However, the role of natural microlayers in reducing monolayer performance has not previously been investigated. In this study, microlayer and subsurface samples from six water storages in Queensland were characterized for water quality indices including biochemical oxygen <b>demand,</b> <b>permanganate</b> index and ultraviolet light absorbance. Microlayer enrichment in southeast Queensland is comparable to or higher than holoarctic lakes. Results indicate that microlayer compounds {{have the potential to}} disrupt monolayers in at least three ways: As substrates for microbes capable of degrading monolayer compounds, as chromophores accelerating photodegradation, and as impurities disrupting the molecular packing required to reduce evaporative loss. The knowledge gained from studying natural microlayers {{can also be used to}} benchmark novel monolayer compounds, to minimize their environmental impact on freshwater ecosystems. ...|$|R

As an optimal method of testing adsorption characters jar testing was chosen. Again as an indicator of organic contamination, it was decided to use <b>permanganate</b> chemical oxygen <b>demand</b> (in Czech CHSKMn) will be used. In the second part of this thesis the adsorption characters of eight types of granular activated carbon were studied. Those granular activated carbon came from two world produces, from company NORIT five type of granular activated carbon were tested: NORIT GAC 1020, NORIT PK 1 - 3, NORIT GAC 1240, NORIT ROW 0. 8 SUPRA a TOD NORIT ROX 0. 8 and from company Chemviron Carbon three types of granular activated carbon were tested: F 100 FE 11120 A, F 400 FE 11210 A a TL 830 FE 2028 B. Batch kinetic tests of natural organic matter adsorption were conducted with all types of granular activated carbon at first. For description of sorption not only the batch kinetic tests and duration needed for setting equilibrium were observed, but also the process decreasing of concentration of natural organic matters to the value of equilibrium concentration known as adsorption equilibrium was followed...|$|R
40|$|Bench-scale {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the potassium <b>permanganate</b> <b>demand,</b> a key parameter for in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) system design, and its variation with depth in PAHs-contaminated site of a coking plant. The concentrations of permanganate decreased rapidly during the first 8 d of the reaction process. The reaction follows first order kinetics, with rate constant ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 3 /h. The total oxidant demand (TOD) is significantly higher for clayey silt fill than for soils of other lithology. The typical TOD is about 50 g MnO(4) (-) /kg soil for clayey silt fill, 20 - 40 g MnO(4) (-) /kg soil for silt, silty clay and 1 - 7 g MnO(4) (-) /kg soil for fine sand. Statistical analysis revealed that TOD {{was positively correlated with}} total organic carbon (TOC) content, clay content and PAHs concentrations, besides sand content, meanwhile TOC was the parameter with the strongest influence on oxidant demand. After 32 d duration of oxidation, PAHs in all tested soils were effectively removed, with total removal percent ranging from 78 % to 99 %, and small molecular weight PAHs were removed {{to a greater extent than}} high molecular weight PAHs. Parameters obtained in this study, combined with soil bulk density, soil porosity and soil moisture, can be used for full-scale ISCO system design and application in coking contaminated site.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{dependence of}} water quality parameters on flow rates in several profiles in the Vltava River catchment in the Czech Republic {{in the period}} 1997 - 2013. In  study, influence of low flow rates on the water quality is assessed on several examples of river profiles, tributaries and outflow of the Orlík Reservoir, which {{is located at the}} Vltava River in the Czech Republic. At these sites, we monitored changes in general parameters of the water quality - temperature (T), pH, dissolved oxygen (O 2), chemical oxygen <b>demand</b> <b>permanganate</b> (CODMn), chemical oxygen demand dichromate (CODCr), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) a suspended solids (SS), nutrients – nitrate nitrogen (N-NO 3 -), ammonia nitrogen (N-NH 4 +), total phosphorus (PT) and phosphate phosphorus (P-PO 43 -) and further quality parameters – dissolved solids (DS), dissolved inorganic salts (DIS), calcium (Ca 2 +), magnesium (Mg 2 +), potassium (K+), chlorides (Cl-), sulphates (SO 42 -) and qualitatively also non-polar extractive substance (NES) a anion-active surfactants. The assessed period was 1997 - 2013. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate relationship between mentioned parameters and the flow rates in days, when the samples were taken. Furthermore, ratios of average parameters values during low and high flows were calculated. The results show that in the monitored profiles, there is a direct relationship with flow rate in case of N-NO 3 -, suspended solids and O 2. Temperature shows an inverse relationship with the flow rate. Other parameters show different relationship with the flow rate in individual monitored profiles or do not show statistically significant relation...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{beneath the}} former Nebraska Ordnance Plant (NOP) is {{contaminated}} with the explosive hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX). Laboratory and pilot-scale experiments {{were performed to}} quantify the efficacy of permanganate to remediate RDX-contaminated groundwater. Laboratory investigations were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of permanganate concentrations and temperature on RDX destruction kinetics as well as to determine the <b>Permanganate</b> Soil Oxidant <b>Demand</b> (PSOD) and <b>permanganate</b> (Mn 04 -) transport properties. Batch and column experiments showed that the Todd Valley aquifer sands contained a low PSOD indicating that permanganate mass consumption by the aquifer would be minimal. PSOD experiments also showed that the PSOD of the aquifer increased as the permanganate concentration increased. Batch experiments showed that the presence of Todd Valley aquifer media had little effect on RDX destruction kinetics and that RDX destruction kinetics and RDX mineralization increased with increasing permanganate concentrations. Batch experiments were conducted using RDX contaminated groundwater from the permanganate injection site (Co = 210 μg/L) where there where no appreciable changes in RDX degradation kinetics. Additional batch studies were conducted to observe temperature effects on RDX degradation kinetics where it was shown that lower temperatures slow down RDX degradation. To evaluate the efficacy of permanganate to remove RDX under field conditions, a pilot-scale demonstration was performed in a 9 m by 15 m well field. Groundwater was extracted from a center extraction well, spiked with permanganate and bromide, and fed into two injection wells. Groundwater was then sampled biweekly for 8 weeks in monitoring wells down gradient of the injection zone. Results showed that RDX concentrations decreased 73 to 80 % following injection. Despite problems encountered in getting the permanganate uniformly distributed across the injection zone, pilot-scale results provide proof-of-concept that permanganate can be used for in-situ chemical oxidation of RDX-contaminated groundwater...|$|R
