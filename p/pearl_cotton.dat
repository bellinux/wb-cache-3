25|$|The Bengali Pala Empire was {{the last}} major Buddhist {{imperial}} power in the subcontinent, founded in 750 and becoming the dominant power in the northern Indian subcontinent by the 9th century, before being replaced by the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 12th century. Islam was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate. The Islamic Bengal Sultanate, founded in 1352, was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. The Mughal Bengal Subah province became a major global exporter, a center of worldwide industries such as muslin, silk, <b>pearl,</b> <b>cotton</b> textiles, and shipbuilding. It was conquered by the British East India Company in 1757 and became the Bengal Presidency, which experienced deindustrialization under British rule. Upon independence, the partition of Bengal (1947) split the region into West Bengal in India and East Pakistan, the latter becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Two weights of Pearl (perlé) cotton are {{generally}} used. On normal 22-count Hardanger fabric {{this is usually}} <b>Pearl</b> <b>cotton</b> #5, a heavier weight used for satin stitch Kloster blocks and motifs, and <b>Pearl</b> <b>cotton</b> #8, a thinner thread used for more delicate filling stitches and other surface details. On finer, higher count fabrics the combination of #8 and #12 threads is often more suitable.|$|E

2500|$|Ancient Tamilians {{were active}} traders in various commodities, both locally and outside Tamil country. The kingdoms of {{northern}} India sought <b>pearls,</b> <b>cotton</b> fabrics and conch shells from Tamilakam {{in exchange for}} woollen clothing, hides and horses. Locally most trading was in [...] food products [...] agricultural produce was supplemented by products from hunters, fishermen and shepherds [...] who traded in meat, fish and dairy products. In addition, people bought other goods such as items for personal hygiene, adornment and transportation. Mercantile transactions took place in busy market places. Traders used various modes of selling: hawking their goods from door to door, setting up shops in busy market places or stationing themselves at royal households. Sellers of fish, salt and grain hawked their goods, the textile merchants sold cloths from their shops in urban markets and the goldsmith, the lapidary and sellers of sandalwood and ivory patronised the aristocrats' quarters. Merchants dealt in conches and ivory.|$|R
5000|$|The Roman empire had a {{continuous}} trading {{connection with this}} region. Along with pepper, commodities such as pearls, muslin, ivory, diamond, silk and perfumes were exported using the maritime facilities of Kodungallur. Sulaiman, an Arab visitor to Mahodayapuram during this period, recorded the economic prosperity {{of the region and}} also testified to the high morals kept by its people. Also, he describes the Chinese traders in the city; they are described as purchasing articles such as pepper, cinnamon, ivory, <b>pearls,</b> <b>cotton</b> fabrics and teak wood, while selling fishing nets, silk and porcelain goods. [...] In the 11th century, Mahodayapuram (Now it is known as Kandanad) was captured by Rajendra Chola I of Chola dynasty. For the next few centuries, Kodungallur was a principality, named Padinjattedathu Swaroopam, under the control of a royal family, Kodungallur Kovilakam, allied either to kingdom of Cochin or to Calicut. Muziris is supposed to be destroyed by massive flooding of Periyar in the 14th century and consequently, the trade got diverted to other ancient ports of the Malabar coast, such as Kochi.|$|R

5000|$|Born in Cumberland, Maryland George W. Watts {{was the son}} of Gerard Snowden Watts and Ann Elizabeth Wolvington. He {{received}} his early education in private schools in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1871 with a degree in civil engineering. [...] After graduation, Watts joined his father's tobacco commission business in Baltimore. Becoming associated with Washington Duke of Durham, North Carolina in 1878, he helped organize and incorporate W. Duke Sons and Company, a tobacco business in which he became a stockholder and secretary and treasurer. In 1890 Watts helped to organize the American Tobacco Co. and in 1892 the Erwin Cotton Mills Company. Watts became one of the largest textile mills in the US Interested in the total welfare of his employees, Watts built libraries, parks, and playgrounds for them. He also built and endowed Watts Hospital in Durham, North Carolina. Among his other business involvement, Watts was president of the <b>Pearl</b> <b>Cotton</b> Mill at Durham, North Carolina, the Home Savings Bank and Trust, vice-president of the Locke Cotton Mills of Concord, North Carolina, a director of the Seaboard Air Line, the Durham and Southern Railway Company, the Virginia-Carolina Chemical Company, the Southern Cotton Oil Company, and the Fidelity Bank and Durham Loan & Trust Company, which he co-founded with his son-in-law, John Sprunt Hill. Watts was elected the first president of the Commonwealth Club of Durham, which made possible the transportation facilities required to make that city a prosperous and commercial center. Watts married twice: in 1875 to Laura V. Beall, who bore him one child, Annie Louise Watts; and in 1917 to Sara Virginia Ecker.|$|E

25|$|The territories still {{possessed by}} the Dutch on the island were {{formally}} ceded to the British in the 1802 treaty of Amiens, but the English Company still retained a monopoly on the colony's trade. Agents of the British were {{put in charge of}} lucrative <b>pearl</b> fisheries, <b>cotton</b> plantations, salt, and tobacco monopolies. In the first three years the government received £396,000 from pearl fisheries. This compensated for the lower price of cinnamon because of Dutch stocks in Amsterdam.|$|R
50|$|The poem {{is found}} solely in the <b>Pearl</b> {{manuscript}}, <b>Cotton</b> Nero A x. That manuscript also contains Pearl, Patience, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. None {{of the poems}} has a title or divisions of chapters, but the breaks are marked by large initial letters of blue, and there are twelve illustrations (or illuminations) contained within the manuscript, depicting scenes from the four poems. Each of these poems is entirely unique to this one manuscript. Cleanness (which is an editorial title) is also known by the editorial title Purity.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} Cotton's Library {{continues to be}} reflected in citations to manuscripts formerly in his possession. His library was housed in a room 26 ft long by six feet wide filled with bookpresses, each surmounted by the bust of a figure from classical antiquity. Counterclockwise, these are catalogued as Julius, Augustus, Cleopatra, Faustina, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. (Domitian had only one shelf, perhaps because it was over the door). Manuscripts are today designated by library, bookpress, and number: for example, the manuscript of Beowulf is designated Cotton Vitellius A.xv, and the manuscript of <b>Pearl</b> is <b>Cotton</b> Nero A.x.|$|R

40|$|Heliothis eggs {{found on}} cowpeas, mung beans, groundnut, maize, sorghum, <b>pearl</b> millet and <b>cotton</b> are parasitized by Trichogramma spp. and other egg parasites. Eggs found on pigeonpea, however, do not display {{high rates of}} parasitism. As a result, Heliothis armigera populations among pigeonpea plantings can become very high. Severe crop damage costs Indian farmers up to 40 % of their pigeonpea yield in some areas. Researchers at ICRISAT are seeking {{information}} on any biological agents which might help control reproduction of Heliothis on pigeonpe...|$|R
50|$|Other {{materials}} used are <b>pearl</b> (or perle) <b>cotton,</b> Danish flower thread, silk and Rayon. Different wool threads, metallic threads or other novelty threads are also used, sometimes {{for the whole}} work, but often for accents and embellishments. Hand-dyed cross stitch floss is created just {{as the name implies}} - it is dyed by hand. Because of this, there are variations in the amount of color throughout the thread. Some variations can be subtle, while some can be a huge contrast. Some also have more than one color per thread, which in the right project, creates amazing results.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} {{network of}} Dilmun lasted for almost 2,000 years, {{after which the}} Assyrians {{took control of the}} island in 700 BC for more than a century. This was followed by Babylonian and Achaemenid rule, which later gave way to Greek influence during the time of Alexander the Great's conquests. In the first century AD, the Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote of Tylos, the Hellenic name of Bahrain in the classical era, and its <b>pearls</b> and <b>cotton</b> fields. The island came {{under the control of the}} Parthian and Sassanid empires respectively, by which time Nestorian Christianity started to spread in Bahrain. By 410-420 AD, a Nestorian bishopric and monastery was established in Al Dair, on the neighbouring island of Muharraq. Following the conversion of Bahrain to Islam in 628 AD, work on one of the earliest mosques in the region, the Khamis Mosque, began as early as the seventh century AD. During this time, Bahrain was engaged in long distance marine trading, evident from the discovery of Chinese coins dating between 600-1200 AD, in Manama.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} domestication, by which only a choice few wild {{individuals}} are cultivated and selected against, {{often results in}} very strong selective pressures. This {{is evident in the}} genomes of these individuals as a lack of genetic diversity. In some cases this lack of diversity is seen as a selective sweep, whereby the variation at a particular locus of the genome is highly reduced while variation outside of this area is maintained or only partially reduced. In other cases, such as the coconut, genomic studies have revealed occurrences of a founder event, whereby the genetic diversity of an entire population is reduced due to a small number of individuals with low diversity being the isolated ancestors of a larger modern population. Bottlenecks, where variation is reduced throughout the entire genome, are also evident in crop species such as <b>pearl</b> millet, <b>cotton,</b> common bean and lima bean. With the identification of bottlenecks in these species, researchers are able to study the effects on an organisms' ability to evolve past a bottleneck, and what effects this may have on the genomes of both individuals and populations as well as their fitness.|$|R
5|$|On the Silk Road caravans with Chinese silk; pepper, ginger, cinnamon, {{and nutmeg}} {{came to the}} West from the Spice Islands via the transcontinental trade routes. Eastern diets were {{introduced}} to Europeans as well. Indian muslins, <b>cottons,</b> <b>pearls,</b> and precious stones were sold in Europe, as well as weapons, carpets, and leather goods from Iran. Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the near and far East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that {{was involved in the}} trade system. Μany of the cities participating in the 13th century world trade system grew rapidly in size.|$|R
