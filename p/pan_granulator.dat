30|$|The {{degree of}} {{ammoniation}} of phosphoric acid NH 3 :H 3 PO 4 (M) {{was determined by}} pH value of the 1 % by mass aqueous solution of the slurry obtained and using the reference source [12]. Ammonium sulfate and potassium chloride were introduced into the slurry in an amount necessary to obtain the desired grade, mixed thoroughly and dried at 65  °C. Then, the charge mixture was crushed {{and put in a}} <b>pan</b> <b>granulator</b> with diameter of 300  mm and length of 150  mm. Granules of 2 – 4  mm were finally dried at 65  °C to reach the required humidity. The product obtained was analyzed for content of basic elements.|$|E
40|$|The main {{parameters}} of dolomite phosphorization and the successive granulation {{of the product}} in a laboratory <b>pan</b> <b>granulator</b> were studied. The physico-chemical properties of granulated dolomite such as size of granules, moisture content, granules crushing strength and chemical composition (CaO, MgO and P 2 O 5) were measured. Dependence of granules size percentage distribution of product {{on the amount of}} dolomite treated by phosphoric acid under various granulation conditions was determined. The main {{parameters of}} phosphorization were determined and the main physico-chemical properties of granulated dolomite were examined too. The results of investigation allow optimizing the process of reaction of dolomite with phosphoric acid in order to obtain a granulated product containing calcium, magnesium and phosphorus for using in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrevious {{works have}} well {{demonstrated}} that particle {{size of the}} filler used in layered oxide formulation is the first important parameter and must be decreased below 5 μm (Agrafiotis, 1999 - 2000 [10]). But once the particle size is set what are the next formulation parameters to highlight as critical? How do we improve cohesion and adhesion of the coatings? To highlight the key parameters driving the quality of coating, a model layered oxide material was prepared inside a <b>pan</b> <b>granulator.</b> The model composite sol gel formulation is based on boehmite nanoparticles (binder) and amonomodal two micrometer grain size gamma alumina (filler) which is applied onto alpha alumina beads substrate. The influences of the wetting method and relative amount of filler and binderwere investigated. Extensive characterization and imaging of the layered materials (SEM, Cryo-SEM, EPMA, Washburn test, mechanical tests, Hg-porosimetry) were used in order to follow the microstructure evolution of coating during {{and at the end}} of drying. Several crack propagation schemes were observed and explained qualitatively. Overall quality of coating is mainly related to the sol-gel transition of the binder. It defines if prior to shaping, the binder primer will be able to improve the coating adhesion and it defines also the nature and extent of damages that the coating undergoes during drying. The mechanical properties of layered oxide materials obtained using composite sol-gel formulation are definitely correlated with the binder gel shrinkage during drying...|$|E
40|$|Development {{in science}} and {{technology}} today has been able to produce instant nutritious foods, such as imitation rice. The application of conventional technologies in the granulation process causes minimal quantity and quality of the imitation rice with corn feedstock generated. The purpose of this research was to design and to test its performance. This research was conducted at the Laboratory of Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Engineering Department, University of Lampung. This research procedures included several stage: design, assembly, testing, observation and data analysis. The corn rice granulator machine is designed to the specifications of length 140 cm, width 75 cm, and height 170 cm and comes also with other components, such as hopper, sprayer, sweeper, corn rice container, electric motors, gearboxes, pillow block, and couple units. Some of component settings in the testing of this machine: the slope of <b>granulator</b> <b>pan</b> at 35 °, discharge of hopper 0, 2 kg/sec, discharge of water sprayer 0, 54 mℓ/sec, speed of <b>granulator</b> <b>pan</b> rotation 28 RPM, and the clearance between corn rice container and <b>granulator</b> <b>pan</b> by 5 cm. The results showed that, this granulator machine had production capacity of wet corn rice up to 10, 92 kg/hour, and efficiency of granulation up to 78, 18 %, for the raw material with composition 75 % corn flour and 25 % tapioca flour...|$|R
