40|$|Proposition 132, {{also known}} as "The Marine Resources Protection Act", {{was passed by the}} California {{electorate}} in November 1990. One of the purposes of the Act was to prohibit the use of gill nets in an area referred to as the "Marine Resources Protection Zone" or MRPZ, which is roughly equivalent to all State waters south of Point Arguello, with some important exceptions such as additional fishing depth restrictions in the Los Angeles/Orange County area, and also around the Channel Islands. The Act instructed the Department to compensate displaced gill net fishermen for the loss of their fishery. Payment of compensation was contingent upon each applicant meeting certain conditions that were specified in the Act. Out of the original 136 applicants, the Department identified 86 who met all the requirements for further processing of their claims. The Act dictated that qualified claimants were entitled to compensation in an amount equal to the average annual value of their gill net catches (excluding rockfish) from within the area now closed to gill nets (the MRPZ), during the period of 1983 to 1987. Based upon our historical landing receipt and logbook databases, the Department reconstructed the <b>past</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>activities</b> of those qualified claimants. Data available to the Department were not originally intended to address the specific eligibility criteria that were specified in the Act, but we were able to calculate the amount of each claimant's compensation by using the fish receipt data to determine what each claimant caught (and the value), and the logbook data to determine where he/she caught it. The combined total amount of compensation paid the 86 claimants was 1. 2 million. This report describes the Department's activities with respect to the processing of claims and payment of compensation to displaced gill net fishermen. (19 pp. ...|$|E
40|$|Fish remains {{recovered}} from archaeological sites {{have been studied}} to reconstruct <b>past</b> human diet, <b>fishing</b> <b>activities,</b> techniques involved in <b>fishing</b> <b>activities,</b> trade and environment (Casteel, 1976; Wheeler, 1978; Brinkhuizen and Clason 1986; Wheeler and lones, 1989). Identification of fish bones can provide information on the species exploited {{while the number of}} individual species exploited can allow us to infer preference in human diet, or the relative contribution of individual species to the diet. A study of the habitats and ecology of fish can provide information on the season of capture, fishing areas and fishing techniques. Fish remains {{can also be used to}} estimate fish size, age and weight, season of capture, and so on. A study of selected elements of individual species can be used to infer fish processing techniques and trade activities. In this paper fish remains from the Konam-ri shell middens on Anmyun Island, Korea, will be studied which will focus on the aspects mentioned above. Sea bream (Chrysophrys major) is one of the species which will be discussed in detail. </p...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{ecological}} knowledge (TEK) {{has received}} great attention {{in respect to}} coral reef associated fisheries {{as a way to}} adapt modern management strategies to local environmental and cultural conditions. We analysed the social and cultural roles of TEK for resource management in traditional Melanesian communities in New Caledonia. A multidisciplinary survey of customary marine tenure and fishing regulations on Ouvéa, a raised limestone island in New Caledonia, was carried out in 2006. Informants from the main chiefdoms and clans were questioned about <b>past</b> and present <b>fishing</b> <b>activities,</b> maritime territory rights, taboo areas and place names, customary authority, socio-cultural practices and belief related to marine resources, and vernacular knowledge and taxonomy of marine organisms. Results showed that customary fishing rules were primarily related to cultural events and social organization rather than to ecological patterns or economic interests. The relationships between TEK, population needs and uses of the environment were still strong, but have changed since the 1860 s. An unquantifiable loss of indigenous knowledge has also occurred. Nowadays, to satisfy food and economic needs, modern users often abandon TEK and behave in relation to their own individual economic perceptions and needs. Better consideration of social and cultural aspects in resource management issues may therefore directly help to increase awareness of resource depletion and biodiversity loss as a basis for achieving long-term ecosystem and economic sustainability in Melanesian islands...|$|R
40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the National Park Service, the U. S. Geological Survey conducted a stream-sediment-based environmental geochemical study in and near Yellowstone National Park (the Park). The main goals {{of the study were}} to (1) determine background concentrations for as many as 49 elements in samples of rock and stream sediment, (2) establish a geochemical baseline during the 1990 s for future reference, (3) identify the source(s) of anomalies for selected elements, and (4) identify potential chemical impacts on the Park environment, especially on wildlife. Two areas of the Park containing identified environmental geochemical problems were selected for detailed study: (1) an area {{in the western part of}} the Park that includes the Gibbon, Firehole, and Madison River basins, and (2) an area in the northeastern part that includes the Soda Butte Creek and Lamar River basins and part of the Yellowstone River basin. The geology of the first area is characterized mainly by Quaternary felsic volcanic rocks. Localities with major geothermal activity are present in this area. The second area has more complex geology that consists primarily of Tertiary volcanic rocks of intermediate composition and Precambrian schists and gneisses. Also present are scattered exposures of Paleozoic clastic and carbonate rocks and Quaternary felsic volcanic rocks. Geothermal activity is very limited in this area. Both study areas contain extensive deposits of glacial, fluvial, or lacustrine origin. Analyses for as many as 49 elements in 393 samples of stream sediment collected from throughout the Park were evaluated statistically, including factor analysis. A five-factor model classified the elements on the basis of two lithologic factors, one mineral-deposit-related factor, one geothermal-process-associated factor, and one “miscellaneous” factor. Data from the factor analysis, when combined with the distributions of anomalies for the elements determined in this study, show that most (34) of the elements are best correlated with rock chemistry. Many of these elements can be used to discriminate between major lithologic units and can therefore be used to assist geologic mapping studies in the Park area. Anomalies of As, Cs, F, Hg, Mo, S, Sb, Tl, and W were determined to be associated with areas of geothermal activity. Of these nine elements, cesium is the best discriminator between anomalies related to geothermal activity and those related to outcrops of mineralized rock and to past mining activity near the Park. The effects of mineralization and past mining activity in the Cooke City, Mont., area, outside but near the northeastern boundary of the Park, are defined by anomalies of Ag, As, Au, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mo, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Te, Tl, W, and Zn, and possibly F. The effects are delineated best by anomalies of Au, Cu, and Te. Relatively weak anomalies of some of these elements extend as far as 18 km inside the Park. In the area of Slough Creek, in the northeastern area of the Park, the source for a high concentration of lead was determined to be anthropogenic because of the sample location and a lack of anomalies of other elements that commonly are associated with natural lead anomalies. This anomaly probably is related to <b>past</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>activity.</b> In high concentrations, a number of the elements associated with geothermal activity in the Park are potentially toxic to animals. Currently, only one of the 49 elements determined (fluorine) is known to affect the health and longevity of wildlife in the Park. Additional studies are needed to determine whether other elements are impacting the Park environment, including wildlife...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. This paper {{examines}} {{differences and}} changes in <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> among individual ports in a multi-species fishery using shift-share analysis. We describe overall trends in the fishing industry in north-central California and examine {{the extent to which}} different ports have fared differently. Trends in trips, boats, and revenue indicate that the level of <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> has declined dramatically in the region. We investigate whether all ports have been affected equally by this sector-wide decline; and if not, why not what factors make one port better able to support commercial fishing than another? We first identify and rank ports based on changes in <b>fishing</b> <b>activity</b> over time. We then explore some possible explanations for different levels of <b>fishing</b> <b>activity,</b> such as stock abundance conditions that vary over space, fishing regulations, supply chain issues (concentration of receivers or processors, idiosyncratic issues such as a sudden loss of a major receiver), and local policies including port infrastructure investments). We use a novel application of the shift-share method to perform the analysis. Shift-share, a non-parametric technique for visualizing trends, is a standard tool in regional science for describing changes in local communities, but it has not been applied to fisheries economics or fleet dynamics. Our results find evidence of fishing regulations as a strong driver of port-level <b>fishing</b> <b>activity,</b> and of both complementary and competitive relationships between nearby ports...|$|R
