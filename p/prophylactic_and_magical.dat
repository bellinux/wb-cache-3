40|$|Arenaviruses are enveloped, bipartite {{negative}} single-stranded RNA {{viruses that}} can cause {{a wide spectrum of}} disease in humans and experimental animals including hemorrhagic fever. The majority of these viruses are rodent-borne and the arenavirus family can be divided into two groups: the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex. Arenavirus-induced disease may include characteristic symptoms ranging from fever, malaise, body aches, petechiae, dehydration, hemorrhage, organ failure, shock, and in severe cases death. Currently, there are few <b>prophylactic</b> <b>and</b> therapeutic treatments available for arenavirus-induced symptoms. Supportive care and ribavirin remain the predominant strategies for treating most of the arenavirus-induced diseases. Therefore, efficacy testing of novel therapeutic <b>and</b> <b>prophylactic</b> strategies in relevant animal models is necessary. Because of the potential for person-to-person spread, the ability to cause lethal or debilitating disease in humans, limited treatment options, and potential as a bio-weapon, the development of <b>prophylactics</b> <b>and</b> therapeutics is essential. This article reviews the current arenavirus animal models <b>and</b> <b>prophylactic</b> <b>and</b> therapeutic strategies under development to treat arenavirus infection...|$|R
