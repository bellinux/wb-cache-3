Among Actinopterygii (mean tm ± SD = 2. 20 ± 1. 43 y, n = 215), tm ranged from 0. 3 y, for the common goby Pomatoschistus microps, to 12 y, for dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, while among Elasmobranchii (mean tm ± SD = 5. 94 ± 2. 47 y, n = 20), tm ranged between 2. 7 y, for brown ray Raja miraletus, and 12 y for <b>picked</b> <b>dogfish</b> Squalus acanthias. Overall, the tmax ranged between 1 y, for transparent goby Aphia minuta, and 70 y, for wreckfish Polyprion americanus. The mean tmax of Actinopterygii (tmax ± SD = 10. 14 ± 9. 42 y) was {{lower than that of}} Elasmobranchii (tmax ± SD = 14. 05 ± 8. 47 y). The tm exhibited a strong positive linear relation with tmax for both Actinopterygii (logtm = 0. 58 ´ logtmax – 0. 25, r 2 = 0. 51, P < 0. 001) and Elasmobranchii (logtm = 0. 67 ´ logtmax – 0. 006, r 2 = 0. 51, P = 0. 007). The mean tm/tmax did not differ significantly with sex within Actinopterygii (ANOVA: F = 0. 27, P = 0. 60, n = 90; females: mean ± SD = 0. 276 ± 0. 143; males: mean ± SD = 0. 265 ± 0. 138) and Elasmobranchii (ANOVA: F = 1. 44, P = 0. 25, n = 10; females: mean ± SD = 0. 499 ± 0. 166; males: mean ± SD = 0. 418 ± 0. 133). Finally, the dimensionless ratio tm/tmax was significantly lower (ANOVA: F = 31. 04, P < 0. 001) for Actinopterygii (mean ± SD = 0. 270 ± 0. 135, n = 180) than for Elasmobranchii, (mean ± SD = 0. 458 ± 0. 152, n = 20), when stocks with combined sexes were excluded from the analysis...|$|E
