25|$|The city's great {{significance}} for the frontier between the Second French Empire and the German Confederation led to the 1866 Luxembourg Crisis, almost resulting in a war between France and Prussia over possession of the German Confederation's main western fortress. The 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg's fortress to be torn down and for Luxembourg {{to be placed in}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>neutrality,</b> signalling the end of the city's use as a military site. Since then, the remains of the fortifications have become a major tourist attraction for the city. In 1994, the fortress remains and the city's old quarter were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|William III, {{king of the}} Netherlands, and {{sovereign}} of Luxembourg, {{was willing}} to sell the grand duchy to France's Emperor Napoleon III in order to retain Limbourg but backed out when Prussian chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, expressed opposition. The growing tension brought about a conference in London from March to May 1867 in which the British served as mediators between the two rivals. Bismarck manipulated public opinion, resulting in the denial of sale to France. The issue was resolved by the second Treaty of London which guaranteed the <b>perpetual</b> independence and <b>neutrality</b> of the state. The fortress walls were pulled down and the Prussian garrison was withdrawn.|$|R
40|$|The Treaty of Vienna in 1815, {{but also}} the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, each {{in its own way}} brought to an end a bloody chapter in European history. The {{treaties}} signed in 1648 concluded nearly a century of religious warfare by enshrining the principle of cuius regio, eius religio (“whose realm, his religion”). The Congress of Vienna reinstated the principle of the balance 	of power, {{based on the belief that}} all parties shared a common interest transcending their respective ambitions, and re-established the Concept of Nations, which for two generations stopped territorial and ideological revisionism of the type seen from 1789 to 1815. 	 After defeating Napoleon, European kings and statesmen met at the Vienna Congress in Austria in 1815 in order to arrange peace conditions. All great powers were interested in Swiss neutrality and agreed on a common declaration of guarantees for it. Winning powers were also interested in reducing French influence. 	 The Congress of Vienna in 1815 was a landmark in the history of the European international society. It introduced a novel method of diplomacy to the conventional balance of power concept of Europe. Thus, 2015 is a multiple commemoration year for Switzerland. It has been 700 years since the battle of Morgarten (1315) in which the Confederates for the first time successfully defended their freedom and independence with weapons; 500 years since the defeat at Marignano (1515), a real milestone for the further development of the Swiss Confederation and 200 	 years since the Congress of Vienna (1815) when, after the victory over Napoleon I, the European powers set the future map of Europe, confirmed the borders of Switzerland’s present-day territory and its <b>perpetual</b> armed <b>neutrality.</b> 	 Key words: Europe, history, politics, diplomacy, neutrality, freedom...|$|R

5000|$|These groups {{rejected}} the radical platform advanced by the Ghicas, leading Bosianu {{to withdraw from}} his alliance with the National Party. Before March 3 (New Style: March 15), he was talked into rejoining and awarded with {{a seat on the}} Unified Committees, alongside Costaforu. The party as a whole, co-chaired by C. A. Crețulescu and banker Lazăr (Lazaros) Kalenderoglu, issued a program demanding union under a foreign dynasty, with autonomy and <b>perpetual</b> <b>neutrality,</b> with extended suffrage and representative government. The extended agenda proposed equality before the law, a codified right to property, freedom of contract and the suspension of corvée. These principles were communicated to the local branches, which also organized in the open. While heading the National Party as a whole, C. A. Crețulescu also organized the Brăila County section, At Vlașca, Serrurie held a chair on the regional Committee, alongside State Ariton and Ioniță Gurki.

5000|$|The remilitarisation of the Rhineland, from 1936, {{reduced the}} safety buffer between France and Germany {{to the small}} {{territory}} of Luxembourg. The presence of foreign troops in the Grand Duchy {{in case of a}} Franco-German war once again became a probability. The other Western neighbour of Germany, Belgium, reacted by pulling out from the military agreement with France, and by adopting a [...] "policy of free hands". The Luxembourgish government also sought safety in a policy of neutrality. To consolidate the international position of Luxembourg, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joseph Bech, imagined a diplomatic operation: the signatory states to the Treaty of London of 1867 were to reaffirm the <b>perpetual</b> <b>neutrality</b> of Luxembourg by a common declaration. However, Belgium and the United Kingdom equivocated. In the absence of a multilateral agreement, Bech tried to obtain a simultaneous undertaking from France and Germany. While Germany had no problem in expressing towards Luxembourg all the promises that had been requested, France hesitated to commit itself. The French headquarters wanted to retain a right of passage across the Grand Duchy in case of German aggression. Thus, in spring 1939, with the spectre of war hovering over Europe, the government did not succeed in obtaining any formal guarantees. A surprise invasion without a reaction from the other powers became probable.|$|E
5000|$|Luxembourg {{took pride}} in the {{flattering}} historical epithet of the [...] "Gibraltar of the North" [...] {{as a result of}} its alleged impregnability. By 1443 it had only been taken by surprise by Phillip the Good. In 1795, the city, expecting imminent defeat and for fear of the following pillages and massacres, surrendered after a 7-month blockade and siege by the French, with most of its walls still unbreached. On this occasion, advocating to extend the revolutionary wars across the French borders, the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot explained to the French House of Representatives, that in taking Luxembourg, France had deprived its enemies of [...] "....the best fortress in Europe after Gibraltar, and the most dangerous for France", which had put any French movement across the border at a risk. Thus, the surrender of Luxembourg made it possible for France to take control of the southern parts of the Low Countries and to annex them to her territory. The city's great significance for the frontier between the Second French Empire and the German Confederation led to the 1866 Luxembourg Crisis, almost resulting in a war between France and Prussia over possession of the German Confederation's main western fortress.

40|$|The present European war {{has thrown}} into sharp relief {{the status of}} those smaller governments which, {{although}} in nowise shorn of attributes of sovereignty within their own borders, have nevertheless been placed by virtue of most solemn inter-national guarantees {{in a position of}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>neutrality</b> towards all other Powers. They are not to wage offensive warfare, nor, if the obligations resulting from these guarantees are faithfully observed, may their territories be in any degree the theatre of hostilities. While the chief examples of this peculiar status,- Belgium, Luxemburg and Switzerland,-are plainly, by reason of restricted area and population, in no condition to cope with the greater powers surrounding them, it is not alone their lack of size or strength that has marked them out for permanent neutrality or neutralization, but rather their essential relation to the map of Europe and the many conflicting interests innate in its geographical outlines which have seemed to make neces-sary their fixed withdrawal from plans of rivalry or territorial ambition and the creation in this manner of certain inter-spaces destined for peace whatever may be the fate of their more powerful neighbors...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedA changed security environment {{after the end}} of the Cold War forced Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden to reassess their security policy. New threats and challenges such as international terrorism, WMD, organized crime, the greater disparity of wealth and increased migration have replaced traditional military threats. Larger non-military concerns like peacekeeping operations, hu-manitarian support, and support to civil authorities have replaced territorial defense. All of which require international cooperation. Following a comprehensive security strategy, Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden aim to defend their territory, protect their population, and fostering international peace and security. Austria and Sweden focus on the integration and solidarity with the Euro-pean Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Switzerland retains its <b>perpetual</b> <b>neutrality,</b> but has shown increased international cooperation. Austria and Sweden model their Armed Forces after the EU Petersberg Tasks and have small peacetime organizations with a professional cadre and annual conscripts. The Swiss Armed Forces XXI focus on territorial defense and are organized in accordance with universal conscription and wartime organization policies. Traditional political, social, and economic aspects hinder Switzerland from following a straightforward strategy toward solidarity and fundamental change in its Armed Forces. Switzerland's new security policy and its Armed Forces XXI do not fully meet the requirements to fight new threats and challenges together with the international community.
