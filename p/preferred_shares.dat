Axam subsequently {{negotiated a}} further {{increase in the}} value of the shares, for which Olympus finally paid $620million in March 2010. According to a UK corporate filing for Gyrus, the value of the securities at the time was disclosed as $177million.

5|$|The company {{collected}} NOK73.5 {{million in}} tolls, {{in addition to}} accumulating NOK16.3 million in interest. Costs, mostly for running of the toll plaza, were NOK7.6 million, in addition to financial costs of NOK20.0 million. This gave a profit of NOK62.4 million, including the necessary repayments of the initial loan. Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the bank with a higher interest instead of paying off the bonds faster. The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> were repaid in 1980, while all bonds had been repaid by 1985. A/S Sotrabrua was formally liquidated on 9 February 1989.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Burger King {{announced}} its intent {{to acquire the}} Canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain Tim Hortons. 3G Capital purchased Tim Hortons at $65.50 per-share, and a new holding company was formed, based in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. 3G holds a 51% majority stake, Tim Hortons' existing shareholders owning 22%, and a 27% stake held by Burger King shareholders. Berkshire Hathaway partially funded the purchase by buying $3 billion worth of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares.</b> Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz became CEO of the company, with existing Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira becoming vice-chairman and director. The two chains retained separate operations post-merger, with Burger King remaining in its Miami headquarters. The deal was subject to approval by Tim Hortons shareholders and Canadian regulatory authorities. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth. The combined company became the third-largest international chain of fast food restaurants. From 1995 to 2005, Tim Hortons had been owned by Wendy's Restaurants, a competitor to Burger King.|$|E

5|$|To get {{satisfactory}} {{conditions for}} the loan, the company was recommended by banks to increase the ownership equity to 10% of the loan. The share capital was insufficient, so the company started issuing <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> to individuals and the companies, and managed to secure NOK1.7 million. An exception to the rules was made, and the company was allowed to start detailed planning before the loans had been finalized. An estimate from 1966 showed that the bridge itself would cost NOK27 million, while the auxiliary roads would cost NOK4 million, excluding inflation and interest during construction. On 23 November 1966, the county council supported a proposal that {{one third of the}} construction costs be covered by national road funds. On 10 August 1967, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Norway gave permission that the company could borrow up to NOK25 million. The loan was a bond sold by Bergens Privatbank and Samvirke Forsikring, consisting of one series valued at NOK15 million issued in 1968, and one valued at NOK10 million issued in 1970, with an interest of 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. There was a five years interest-only period, followed by ten years of repayment. The mortgage deed was secured in the right to collect tolls, supported by guarantees from the municipalities of Bergen, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, and the county municipality. In addition, the company was granted loans from Bergens Privatbank, Bergens Sparebank and Vestlandsbanken for NOK3 million, although these were never used. The state's part of the financing was through a loan from the Regional Development Fund.|$|E

25|$|Many {{commercial}} {{banks in the}} United States own Freddie and Fannie <b>preferred</b> <b>shares.</b> Those shares have had their dividends suspended, and are junior to the senior preferred stock issued to the Treasury in the restructuring of the two companies. The {{market value of the}} <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> plunged after the restructuring announcement and suspension of dividends. Banks were required to write down the value of Freddie and Fannie preferred stock held in their portfolios, compounding capitalization concerns for certain U.S. banks. Gateway bank agreed to be bought out by Hampton Roads Bankshares Inc. to make up for a writedown of $40 million on its stock in Fannie and Freddie, which put it below regulatory requirements to be considered adequately capitalized.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{mentioned}} that perpetuities, or securities with an indefinitely long maturity, are rare or unrealistic, and particularly {{those with a}} growing payment.

500|$|In 1929, Smythe decided, in {{the midst}} of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. Their then home, the Arena Gardens, which they shared with the Marlboros, had been built in 1912 and seated just 8,000, which the Maple Leafs were {{regularly}} filling. After considering various locations, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from The T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for $350,000, a price said to be $150,000 below market value. A new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald. To finance construction, Smythe got backing from Sun Life for half of the expected $1 million cost and launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a management company that would own both the Maple Leafs and the new arena, which was named Maple Leaf Gardens (MLG). A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at $10 each ($ in [...] dollars), with a free common share for each five <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> purchased. Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares. To fund construction of the building, workers were paid 20% of their salary in MLG stock.

2500|$|In 1901, George Gilman died {{without a}} will, {{starting}} {{a legal battle}} among his numerous heirs. The senior Hartford stepped into the battle by asserting that, in 1878, Gilman gave him half of the company in an unwritten partnership agreement. Evidence provided to the court established that Hartford received half of A's profits starting in 1878 and that the company's leases were in his name. The heirs realized that without Hartford, the firm would quickly become unprofitable. Therefore, in 1902 they agreed to a settlement where A was to be incorporated, with $2.1 million in assets. Under this agreement, the Gilman heirs received $1,250,000 in <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> at 6% interest, while Hartford received $700,000 in common stock and {{the remainder of the}} <b>preferred</b> <b>shares.</b> This gave Hartford control of the voting stock.
