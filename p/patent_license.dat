PDF was a proprietary format controlled by Adobe, until it was officially released as an open standard on July 1, 2008, and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 32000-1:2008, at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of volunteer industry experts. In 2008, Adobe published a Public <b>Patent</b> <b>License</b> to ISO 32000-1 granting royalty-free rights for all patents owned by Adobe {{that are necessary to}} make, use, sell, and distribute PDF compliant implementations.|$|E
25|$|In the Master Agreement, LGE {{required}} Intel to {{give its}} customers {{notice that the}} <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> does not extend to any product made by combining a licensed Intel microprocessor product with any other product (for example, a computer containing the Intel microprocessor products). The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would {{have no effect on}} the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel’s customers to combine the microprocessor products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This point is not discussed in the Court’s opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect trade secrets.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{superficial}} {{similarities to}} software licenses, most hardware licenses are fundamentally different: by nature, they typically rely {{more heavily on}} patent law than on copyright law, as many hardware designs are not copyrightable.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with {{the effect of}} discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market. Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple's ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case. In January 2012, Microsoft said they had signed <b>patent</b> <b>license</b> agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers, whose products account for [...] "70 percent of all Android smartphones" [...] sold in the US and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices. These include Samsung and HTC. Samsung's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system. Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees, {{while at the same}} time helping to promote its software lines.|$|E
