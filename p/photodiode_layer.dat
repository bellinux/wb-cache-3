Combining a-Si detectors with a scintillator in the detector’s outer layer, which is made from caesium iodide (CsI) or gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd2O2S), converts X-rays to light. Because of this conversion the a-Si detector is considered an indirect imaging device. The light is channeled through the a-Si <b>photodiode</b> <b>layer</b> where it is converted to a digital output signal.

40|$|Optical {{microscopy}} is {{an essential}} tool in biological science {{and one of the}} gold standards for medical examinations. Miniaturization of microscopes can be a crucial stepping stone towards realizing compact, cost-effective and portable platforms for biomedical research and healthcare. This thesis reports on implementations of bright-field and fluorescence chip-scale microscopes for a variety of biological imaging applications. The term “chip-scale microscopy” refers to lensless imaging techniques realized in the form of mass-producible semiconductor devices, which transforms the fundamental design of optical microscopes. Our strategy for chip-scale microscopy involves utilization of low-cost Complementary metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, computational image processing and micro-fabricated structural components. First, the sub-pixel resolving optofluidic microscope (SROFM), will be presented, which combines microfluidics and pixel super-resolution image reconstruction to perform high-throughput imaging of fluidic samples, such as blood cells. We discuss design parameters and construction of the device, as well as the resulting images and the resolution of the device, which was 0. 66 µm at the highest acuity. The potential applications of SROFM for clinical diagnosis of malaria in the resource-limited settings is discussed. Next, the implementations of ePetri, a self-imaging Petri dish platform with microscopy resolution, are presented. Here, we simply place the sample of interest {{on the surface of the}} image sensor and capture the direct shadow images under the illumination. By taking advantage of the inherent motion of the microorganisms, we achieve high resolution (1 µm) imaging and long term culture of motile microorganisms over ultra large field-of-view (5. 7 mm × 4. 4 mm) in a specialized ePetri platform. We apply the pixel super-resolution reconstruction to a set of low-resolution shadow images of the microorganisms as they move across the sensing area of an image sensor chip and render an improved resolution image. We perform longitudinal study of Euglena gracilis cultured in an ePetri platform and image based analysis on the motion and morphology of the cells. The ePetri device for imaging non-motile cells are also demonstrated, by using the sweeping illumination of a light emitting diode (LED) matrix for pixel super-resolution reconstruction of sub-pixel shifted shadow images. Using this prototype device, we demonstrate the detection of waterborne parasites for the effective diagnosis of enteric parasite infection in resource-limited settings. Then, we demonstrate the adaptation of a smartphone’s camera to function as a compact lensless microscope, which uses ambient illumination as its light source and does not require the incorporation of a dedicated light source. The method is also based on the image reconstruction with sweeping illumination technique, where the sequence of images are captured while the user is manually tilting the device around any ambient light source, such as the sun or a lamp. Image acquisition and reconstruction is performed on the device using a custom-built android application, constructing a stand-alone imaging device for field applications. We discuss the construction of the device using a commercial smartphone and demonstrate the imaging capabilities of our system. Finally, we report on the implementation of fluorescence chip-scale microscope, based on a silo-filter structure fabricated on the pixel array of a CMOS image sensor. The extruded pixel design with metal walls between neighboring pixels successfully guides fluorescence emission through the thick absorptive filter to the <b>photodiode</b> <b>layer</b> of a pixel. Our silo-filter CMOS image sensor prototype achieves 13 -µm resolution for fluorescence imaging over a wide field-of-view (4. 8 mm × 4. 4 mm).

To further improve the thermal limitations, the MUTC-PDs were flip-chip bonded on high thermal conductivity substrates such as Aluminum Nitride (AlN) and Diamond. Modules using chips with active area diameters of 40, 28, and 20 μm were developed. The modules demonstrated a 3 -dB bandwidth ranging from 17 GHz up to 30 GHz. In continuous wave mode of operation, very high RF output power was achieved with 25 dBm at 10 GHz, 22 dBm at 20 GHz, and 17 dBm at 30 GHz. In addition, the linearity of the modules was characterized by using the third order intercept point (OIP 3) as a figure of merit. Very high values of OIP 3 were obtained with 30 dBm at 10 GHz, 25 dBm at 20 GHz and more than 20 dBm at 30 GHz.

With respect to sensitivity and to such other characteristics as speed, geometric array format, radiation hardness, power demand of associated circuitry, size, weight, and robustness, NAPDs and arrays thereof are expected to be superior to prior photodetectors and arrays including CMOS active-pixel sensors (APSs), charge-coupled devices (CCDs), traditional APDs, and microchannelplate/ CCD combinations. Figure 1 depicts a conceptual NAPD array, integrated with APS circuitry, fabricated on a thick silicon-on-insulator wafer (SOI). Figure 2 presents selected aspects of the structure of a typical single pixel, which would include a metal oxide/semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) integrated with the NAPD. The NAPDs would reside in silicon islands formed on the buried oxide (BOX) layer of the SOI wafer. The silicon islands would be surrounded by oxide-filled insulation trenches, which, together with the BOX layer, would constitute an oxide embedding structure. There would be two kinds of silicon islands: NAPD islands for the NAPDs and MOSFET islands for in-pixel and global CMOS circuits. Typically, the silicon islands would be made between 5 and 10 m thick, but, if necessary, the thickness could be chosen outside this range. The side walls of the silicon islands would be heavily doped with electron-acceptor impurities (p+-doped) to form anodes for the <b>photodiodes</b> and guard <b>layers</b> for the MOSFETs.

40|$|The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) {{technique}} {{is a very}} flexible and robust means to solve problems spanning {{a broad range of}} applications (defense, communication, computing, semiconductor devices and biomedicine), especially where geometrical complexities, nonlinearities and multiphysics dominate. In this thesis, novel photodetectors are developed via FDTD having sub-wavelength active areas that yield enhanced optical absorption at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths by way of plasmonics or photonic nanojets. The response time of photodiodes is primarily limited by two factors: (1) the transit time of photo-generated carriers to the electrode and (2) depletion layer capacitance of the semiconductor. The former requires a thinner depletion layer, resulting in a large depletion layer capacitance. To suppress the increase of the depletion layer capacitance, it is necessary to decrease the active area of the <b>photodiode</b> with depletion <b>layer</b> thickness. However, the smaller the active area the lower the output of the photodiode under the constant optical power density. To overcome the trade-off between speed and responsivity, the incident light should be efficiently confined within a small active area. Surface plasmons {{play an important role in}} this phenomenon as surface plasmons can enhance the near-field when excited by a certain wavelength. Resonant surface plasmons can confine strong optical near fields in a sub wavelength volume, this has been demonstrated for near- infrared dipole antennas. As an alternative to plasmonics it is proposed here that photonic nanojets may be employed to focus light onto the small active region of a photodetector. A photonic nanojet is a narrow, high-intensity electromagnetic beam that propagates into the background medium from the shadow side surface of a plane-wave illuminated loss-less dielectric micro-cylinder or micro-sphere of diameter greater than the illuminating wavelength, λ. The transverse beam width of the nanojet can be as small as λ/ 3 and length can be as long as 20 λ, so we can use a photonic nanojet to concentrate the energy into a small region. By using the E-field enhancement in a sub-wavelength active area provided by the photonic nanojet and comparing it with the enhancement of the plasmonic structures, we may improve the responsivity and speed of the photodetector.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{development}} of near infrared (NIR) photodetectors on glass substrate at low temperatures for large area electronics applications. In {{the first part of}} this thesis we study the optical properties of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) prepared hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (uc-Si:H) material. We demonstrate that uc-Si:H film has absorption coefficient of 10 ^ 3 cm^- 1 at wavelength of 850 nm, which is more than three orders of magnitude higher than the absorption coefficient in conventionally used hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) material in large area electronics. However, in spite of its high absorption coefficient in NIR region, we demonstrate that metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detectors based on uc-Si:H have a weak dynamic range (DR) of operation of about 50 at wavelength of 850 nm per 1 mW/cm^ 2 of incident optical power density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NIR DR for uc-Si:H MSM detectors is very close to the one for a-Si:H MSM device and hence uc-Si:H detector is not efficient for NIR light detection. As a result, we focused on photodiodes instead of MSM detectors as an alternative device structure with high DR capability. For this purpose we developed and characterized doped uc-Si:H layers and fabricated an n type-intrinsic-p type (n-i-p) uc-Si:H <b>photodiode</b> with intrinsic <b>layer</b> thickness of 343 ~nm. This device shows an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2 % at 850 nm with a DR of almost 500 for 1 mW/cm^ 2 of incident optical intensity which is an order of magnitude higher than the one for uc-Si:H MSM detector. By increasing the intrinsic layer thickness to about 2 um we observed that the EQE was increased to 8 % without a notable change in DR due to proportional increase in dark current level as compared to the photocurrent level. By incorporation of 1 um thick textured AZO back reflector to the photodiode structure, however, we were able to reach EQE of 19. 2 % with DR of more than 1000 at 850 nm per mW/cm^ 2 of incident optical density, which is 20 times higher than the one for uc-Si:H MSM device. Furthermore, we developed HSpice circuit model parameter extraction method for our photodiode demonstrating a non ideality factor of 1. 54, reverse saturation current of 4. 94 10 ^- 11 A, shunt resistance of 1. 35 Gohm, series resistance of 191. 3 Kohm, and parallel capacitance of 40 pF for area of 500 * 500 um^ 2. In the second part of this thesis, we focused on development of a-Si:H thin film transistor (TFT) in order to fabricate pixel circuits based on our developed photodiode to test its feasibility for implementation of 2 D imaging arrays. During the design of our TFT fabrication process, integration of our uc-Si:H photodiode had been taken into consideration and hence a bottom gate structure was adopted compared to the top gate one. In order to design a hybrid TFT/photodiode pixel circuit we needed to come up with accurate HSpice model representation for our TFT. As a result we adopted the HSpice Level 61 transistor model and presented an step by step parameter extraction procedure for our TFT obtaining the 29 TFT parameters in this model. The HSpice simulation results accurately modeled the behaviour of the TFT in both above threshold and subthreshold regimes in comparison to the experimental TFT data. The fabricated TFT showed a very low threshold voltage of 3. 6 V with an on/off ratio of 10 ^ 6, and field-effect mobility of 0. 64 cm^ 2 /Vs, which is suitable for uc-Si:H photodiode pixel circuit design. In the third part of this thesis we focused on integration of the developed photodiode and TFT for realization of a hybrid photodiode/TFT pixel circuit for imaging arrays where we presented three different pixel designs and their fabrication processes based on the developed uc-Si:H photodiode and a-Si:H TFTs. We discussed the design, simulation, analysis, fabrication, and experimental measurements of conventional pixel with one TFT and one photodiode. We demonstrated that the conventional pixel suffers from saturation problem and signal drift due to high dark current flow of the uc-Si:H photodiode (compared to a-Si:H photodiode) during pixel wait time. In order to solve the saturation problem we presented a novel design with integrated capacitance underneath the photodiode to enhance pixel capacitance. However, the enhanced pixel capacitance comes at the cost of slower response and the pixel still suffers from signal drift during wait time. As a result, we proposed a new pixel design with two TFTs, one capacitor, and one photodiode which proved to reduce the signal drift of the pixel during the wait time. As a result the proposed pixel shows promising characteristics for large area NIR imaging on glass substrate which can be used in smart displays and wearable sensor applications...|$|R
