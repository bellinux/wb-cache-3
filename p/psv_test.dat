40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to help predict infield long-term skid resistance performance. The Polished Stone Value (<b>PSV)</b> <b>test</b> is the oldest and the most common test used worldwide to rank the skid resistance performance of road surfaces. Due to certain limitations of the <b>PSV</b> <b>test,</b> other laboratory test methodologies have been developed as potential alternatives. One of the limitations of the <b>PSV</b> <b>test</b> is that it only provides end of test results, whereas it is desirable to observe the skid resistance deterioration trend during the polishing process, in particular for research applications. This paper discusses the application of a mathematical model, originally developed for asphaltic concrete surfaces, to predict the skid resistance deterioration trend under polishing for a range of New Zealand chip seal aggregates. A laboratory skid resistance testing device, known as the Wehner/Schulze device, was used for this study since the model was originally derived based on test results obtained using this type of device. It was found that the model was capable of replicating the skid resistance deterioration trend under laboratory polishing of the chip seal aggregates used in this research. It was also found that the model coefficients were dependent on aggregate geological types, and thus suggested that a set of coefficients obtained for a specific aggregate source may be able to provide information on infield skid resistance performance of that specific aggregate type, if the model is found to be capable of replicating skid resistance deterioration trends in the field as well. As part of future research, the model will be calibrated against infield skid resistance...|$|E
40|$|The skid {{resistance}} performance of surface aggregates {{can be assessed}} in the laboratory by using a polishing device {{that is designed to}} simulate traffic polishing actions coupled with a {{skid resistance}} measuring device. The standard laboratory test has historically been the Polished Stone Value (<b>PSV)</b> <b>test</b> as specified in BS EN 1097 - 8 : 2009. However, as the technology has advanced and traffic volume and composition on our roads have changed, other devices and methodologies have been developed in an attempt to better assess the skid resistance performance of surface aggregates. This paper discusses the usage of two alternative laboratory tests, the Auckland Pavement Polishing Device (APPD) and the Wehner/Schulze (WS) devices, to assess the skid resistance performance of three different New Zealand Greywacke aggregates. The paper discusses the variations in APPD and its corresponding skid resistance measuring device, the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) and the effect of macrotexture in the APPD-DFT test. The results show that there is a good relationship between the APPD-DFT and the PSV tests, while there is no relationship between the WS and the PSV tests. However, the APPD and the WS tests correlate very well. There are only three Greywacke aggregates used in this research, and hence, no conclusive results can be drawn on the relationship between these laboratory tests as yet...|$|E
40|$|The V 3 loop of the HIV- 1 {{envelope}} (Env) glycoprotein gp 120 {{was identified}} as the "principal neutralizing domain" of HIV- 1, but has been considered too variable {{to serve as a}} neutralizing antibody (Ab) target. Structural and immunochemical data suggest, however, that V 3 contains conserved elements which explain its role in binding to virus co-receptors despite its sequence variability. Despite this evidence of V 3 conservation, the ability of anti-V 3 Abs to neutralize a significant proportion of HIV- 1 isolates from different subtypes (clades) has remained controversial. HIV- 1 neutralization experiments were conducted in two independent laboratories to test human anti-V 3 monoclonal Abs (mAbs) against pseudoviruses (psVs) expressing Envs of diverse HIV- 1 subtypes from subjects with acute and chronic infections. Neutralization was defined by 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)), and was statistically assessed based on the area under the neutralization titration curves (AUC). Using AUC analyses, statistically significant neutralization was observed by >or= 1 anti-V 3 mAbs against 56 / 98 (57 %) psVs expressing Envs of diverse subtypes, including subtypes A, AG, B, C and D. Even when the 10 Tier 1 <b>psVs</b> <b>tested</b> were excluded from the analysis, significant neutralization was detected by >or= 1 anti-V 3 mAbs against 46 / 88 (52 %) psVs from diverse HIV- 1 subtypes. Furthermore, 9 / 24 (37. 5 %) Tier 2 viruses from the clade B and C standard reference panels were neutralized by >or= 1 anti-V 3 mAbs. Each anti-V 3 mAb tested was able to neutralize 28 - 42 % of the <b>psVs</b> <b>tested.</b> By IC(50) criteria, 40 / 98 (41 %) psVs were neutralized by >or= 1 anti-V 3 mAbs. Using standard and new statistical methods of data analysis, 6 / 7 anti-V 3 human mAbs displayed cross-clade neutralizing activity and revealed that a significant proportion of viruses can be neutralized by anti-V 3 Abs. The new statistical method for analysis of neutralization data provides many advantages to previously used analyses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a laboratory test method for {{the prediction of}} the skit-resistance evolution due to the traffic. This work {{has been carried out}} at LCPC since 2004 and aims at providing road engineers and managers with tools to optimize asphalt mixes and forecast the road maintenance. Results are first presented on the test method simulating the polishing process on road specimens. The so-called Wehner/Schulze (WS) polishing and friction machine is briefly described. The polishing procedure is given. Simulated friction-time curves are compared to actual data obtained from trafficked roads. This step validates the relevance of the test method regarding its capability to reproduce actual skid-resistance evolutions. Comparisons are then performed between friction-time curves of respectively asphalt- and aggregate specimens. This step is important since results show to that extent polishing tests on aggregates could be used to assess the behaviour of asphalt mixes. The relationship between WS and <b>PSV</b> <b>tests</b> for the aggregate component is also discussed. The last part of the paper deals with the polishing test duration (N) necessary to reach a given friction value, and its relationship with the traffic (T). It is shown that a linear relationship N = k. T is a good approximation. Values of the "k" factor are presented and discussed. Attempts to predict actual skid-resistance evolutions with traffic from Wehner/Schulze tests are presented...|$|R
40|$|For a safe driving, {{pavement}} surface aggregates {{must have}} superior physical and mechanical properties. Although {{high rate of}} accidents is mainly due to drivers errors, pavement surface properties affect significantly occurance of traffic accidents. The {{most important factor in}} the highways leading to traffic accidents are the skid resistance. In this study, adherence test with Vialit plate, Nicholson stripping test, accelerated polishing <b>test</b> (<b>PSV)</b> were carried out on four aggregate samples which were used in seal coats and hot mix asphalt in Afyonkarahisar City. Results were compared with values of specification limits. The results showed that particularly limestone aggregates polishing stone values are poorer than volcanic aggregates sample. Especially, use of aggregates having a good polishing resistance, will be an important factor increasing driving safety...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review all recent studies publishedin regards to the noninvasive {{diagnosis}} of fetal anemia and to giverecommendations for the use of these techniques. The isoinmunizationred blood cells remains as the most common causes forfetal anemia. The amniocentesis and the cordocentesis have beenused for many years as a diagnostic tool for fetal anemia. Thesetechniques are all invasive and many of them have complications. The noninvasive diagnosis of fetal anemia has been made usingthe Doppler ultrasonography. Based on recent evidence, severalinvestigators recommend the use of middle cerebral artery peaksystolic velocity (MCA PSV) in the handling of the fetuses with riskof anemia due to isoinmunization Rh; besides, this test may allowus to diagnose fetal anemia due to other etiologies. MCA <b>PSV</b> is thebest <b>test</b> for noninvasive diagnosis of fetal anemia. It is important to emphasize the special training that the ultrasonographer physicianshould have, in order to achieve a correct diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Two western {{strains of}} peanut stunt cucumovirus (PSV), strains W and BV- 15, {{were unable to}} support the {{replication}} of 2 distinct PSV satellite RNAs (satRNAs), or infectious transcripts from full-length satRNA cDNA clones, in either tobacco or several leguminous host species. These 2 strains also {{did not support the}} replication of cucumber mosaic cucumovirus satRNAs in tobacco. However, all 10 eastern <b>PSV</b> strains <b>tested</b> efficiently supported <b>PSV</b> satRNA replication. Strains PSV-W and BV- 15 can be further differentiated from the eastern strain PSV-ER by Northern hybridization using cloned cDNA probes to PSV-ER RNAs 1, 2 and 3. Whereas the PSV-ER RNA-specific probes did not hybridize to any PSV-W RNAs, the PSV-ER RNA 3 probe hybridized strongly to PSV-BV- 15 RNAs 3 and 4, supporting the finding that strain BV- 15 is serologically closely related to the eastern strains. The PSV-ER RNA 2 -specific probe, but not the PSV-ER RNA 1 -specific probe, hybridized to the respective RNA of PSV-BV- 15. The results of Northern hybridization with strain PSV-BV- 15 support the contention that strain BV- 15 represents a reassortant between western and eastern strains. The lack of cross-hybridization between PSV-ER and PSV-W RNAs in Northern hybridization at high stringency is consistent with finding that the percentages of nucleotide identity between the RNAs of strains PSV-ER and PSV-W were 75, 73, 74 and 74 %, respectively, for RNAs 1, 2, 3 and 4. A procedure based on reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed that utilized primer specific for PSV-ER RNA 2. Restriction enzyme digestion of the RT-PCR products generated distinct restriction patterns that clearly differentiated western from eastern strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{licensed}} {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccines elicit type-restricted immunity {{but do not}} target cutaneous HPV types of the beta genus {{that are associated with}} non-melanoma skin cancer in immune-compromised patients, and it is unclear if these diverse types share a common mechanism of infection. Residues 11 - 88 of minor capsid protein L 2 contain cross-protective epitopes, and vaccination with concatamers of this region derived from as many as eight alpha HPV (L 2 a 11 - 88 x 8) is being developed as an alternative prophylactic vaccine with potentially broader efficacy. There is also interest in developing broadly protective topical microbicides, such as carrageenan or heparin that block HPV receptor interactions, or small molecule inhibitors of infection. Here we have examined several inhibitors of HPV infection and antisera to L 2 a 11 - 88 x 8 for their breadth of activity against infection by 34 HPV types from within both the alpha and beta families using pseudovirions (PsV) carrying a luciferase reporter as surrogates for native virus. We observed that both heparin and carrageenan prevented infection by mucosatropic HPV types, but surprisingly PsV of several epidermotropic alpha 4 and beta HPV types exhibited increased infectivity especially at low inhibitor concentrations. Furin and c-secretase inhibitors and L 2 a 11 - 88 x 8 antiserum blocked infection by all HPV <b>PsV</b> types <b>tested.</b> These findings suggest that the distinct tropism of mucosal and cutaneous HPV may reflect distinct cell surface receptor interactions, but a common uptake mechanism dependent upon furin and c-secretase proteolytic activities. Carrageenan, which is being tested as a vaginal microbicide...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyrotropin (TSH) -secreting {{pituitary}} adenoma (TSHoma) {{and resistance}} to thyroid hormone (RTH) are two forms of inappropriate TSH secretion. Thyroid blood flow is largely TSH dependent. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether thyroid blood flow may help to differentiate TSHoma and RTH. DESIGN: Intrathyroidal color flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) pattern and peak systolic velocity (PSV) were assessed at baseline and during T(3) suppression test on eight consecutive patients with TSHoma and 10 with RTH. MAIN OUTCOME: All controls had CFDS pattern 0. Three RTH patients had pattern I and seven had pattern II. Two TSHoma patients had pattern I, five had pattern II, and one had pattern III. PSV at baseline was 3. 8 +/- 1. 3 cm/s in controls, 8. 8 +/- 2. 5 cm/s in RTH, 11. 1 +/- 2. 7 cm/s in TSHoma (p < 0. 0003 vs. controls, p = 0. 087 RTH vs. TSHoma). After T 3 suppression <b>test,</b> <b>PSV</b> values were lower in RTH than in TSHoma (4. 6 +/- 1. 8 vs. 7. 7 +/- 2. 6 cm/s, p = 0. 008). PSV values and CFDS pattern normalized in nine and eight RTH patients, respectively, after T(3) suppression test; conversely, only one TSHoma patient had a normalization of PSV values, and none had a normalization of CFDS pattern (p < 0. 003 vs. RTH). CONCLUSIONS: Both RTH and TSHoma have increased CFDS pattern and PSV values; however, after T(3) both parameters normalized in most patients with RTH but not in those with TSHoma. Accordingly, CFDS pattern and PSV are adjunctive tools to differentiate these two forms of inappropriate TSH secretion...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the long term performance of the selected surface friction treatments, including high friction surface treatment (HFST) using calcined bauxite and steel slag, and conventional friction surfacing, in particular pavement preservation treatments such as chip seal, microsurfacing, ultrathin bonded wearing course (UBWC), and diamond grinding. This study also attempted to determine the correlation between vehicle crash and pavement surface friction, which {{makes it possible to}} quantitatively establish the so-called crash modification factors (CMFs) that are extremely useful in selecting a cost-effective solution to reduce wet pavement vehicle crashes. In-depth reviews were conducted to identify the aspects of the properties for aggregates used in HFST, including aggregate abrasion value (AAV), Los Angeles abrasion (LAA), Micro-Deval abrasion, and polished stone value (<b>PSV).</b> Extensive laboratory <b>testing</b> was conducted to examine the LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, and PSV, and to provide first-hand data on the calcined bauxite and steel slag that may be used for HFST and friction surfacing in Indiana. Laboratory accelerating polishing was carried out {{to evaluate the}} effect of aggregate gradation and identify the HFST systems with satisfactory friction performance with respect to surface macro-texture and friction. Test strips were installed in the pavement on a real-world road to further evaluate the friction performances of the promising HFST systems under the true traffic polishing and assess the potential effect of winter and snow plough. Pull-off testing was also conducted to examine the bonding between the proposed HFST systems and the substrate surface. Field friction test data was utilized to evaluate the long-term friction performances of pavement preservation treatments, including chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding. Statewide vehicle crash data between 2010 and 2014 was examined to determine the crash statistics associated with pavement friction. The crash data was also matched to the annual pavement inventory friction data to quantify the probabilistic association between vehicle crash and pavement friction with respect to interstate, US, and state highways, respectively. Specification requirements were established for the properties of calcined bauxite and steel slag for HFST and friction surfacing with respect to LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, PSV, Al 2 O 3 content, and fine aggregate angularity (FAA). Specification requirements were also developed for HFST aggregate gradation and surface friction performance. Regression models were developed for predicting the friction numbers of chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding over their service lives. Regression models were also provided to quantify the effectiveness of friction surfacing for interstate, US, and state highways, respectively...|$|R
