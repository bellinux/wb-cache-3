25|$|IBM and Remington Rand {{electric}} typewriters {{were the}} leading models until IBM introduced the IBM Selectric typewriter in 1961, which replaced the typebars with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly {{smaller than a}} golf ball, with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate {{the ball into the}} correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary <b>print</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

50|$|Sometimes {{a printer}} output line {{transistor}} would fail, {{resulting in a}} blank <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> If you knew your way around inside the 1130, {{it was possible to}} swap circuit cards so as to move the bad <b>print</b> <b>position</b> to near the right end of the printed line. This kept the 1130 usable until the repair person showed up.|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} drum printer design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> As the desired character for each column passes the <b>print</b> <b>position,</b> a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|E
5000|$|Print entries, one hub {{for each}} <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> Impulses to these entries {{controlled}} {{the motion of}} print bars or wheels to place the correct type element under the print hammers. The 407 also had exits from each print wheel that could then feed the counters for addition or subtraction. This insured that totals always matched what was printed.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the model 1403, IBM printers utilized technology originally developed for their line of accounting machines. Models 402 and 405 used type bars. These were vertical bars, one for each <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> Each bar was one character wide with either the entire alphabet, including numerals and symbols, or just numerals & symbols only, molded into the front surface, in a single column. In printing, each bar was raised up until the correct character for that <b>print</b> <b>position</b> was opposite the paper, whereupon the bar was pushed toward the paper, so that the correct numeral or letter pressed against the ribbon, striking the paper much the way type slugs leave an impression on paper in a standard typewriter. This action was relatively slow, as it took time for each bar to be brought up into the correct position and then drop back down in preparation to print the next line.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), <b>print</b> <b>position,</b> counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|E

50|$|Printing control {{characters}} were first {{used to control}} the physical mechanism of printers, the earliest output device. An early implementation of this idea was the out-of-band ASA carriage control characters. Later, control {{characters were}} integrated into the stream of data to be printed.The carriage return character (CR), when sent to such a device, causes it to put the character {{at the edge of}} the paper at which writing begins (it may, or may not, also move the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the next line).The line feed character (LF/NL) causes the device to put the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> on the next line. It may (or may not), depending on the device and its configuration, also move the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the start of the next line (whichever direction is first—left in Western languages and right in Hebrew and Arabic). The vertical and horizontal tab characters (VT and HT/TAB) cause the output device to move the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the next tab stop in the direction of reading. The form feed character (FF/NP) starts a new sheet of paper, and may or may not move to the start of the first line. The backspace character (BS) moves the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> one character space backwards. On printers, this is most often used so the printer can overprint characters to make other, not normally available, characters. On terminals and other electronic output devices, there are often software (or hardware) configuration choices which will allow a destruct backspace (i.e., a BS, SP, BS sequence) which erases, or a non-destructive one which does not. The shift in and shift out characters (SO and SI) selected alternate character sets, fonts, underlining or other printing modes. Escape sequences were often used to do the same thing.|$|R

50|$|Henderson is {{a notable}} {{opponent}} of the Lancaster County Convention Center Authority's controversial $170 million hotel/convention center in downtown Lancaster {{on the site of}} the former Watt & Shand building. The project's supporters believe it would promote the revitalization of the city's center. Its opponents, however, feel it poses an unacceptable risk to taxpayers.The hotel portion of the project is owned 50% by Lancaster Newspapers, Inc. which have been accused of using their monopoly <b>print</b> <b>position</b> in the County to promote the project and stifle opposition. Henderson has been referenced in more than 2,200 newspaper articles, over 700 of which concern the Lancaster County Convention Center project, many of them attacking her position.|$|E
5000|$|Tabulators {{built by}} the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1910 census could print their results. Prior to that, {{tabulator}} operators had to write down totals from counter wheels onto tally sheets. IBM developed a series of printing accounting machines, beginning in 1920. The 285 Numeric Printing Tabulator could read 150 cards per minute. The 405, introduced in 1934, could print at 80 lines per minute. It had 88 type bars, one for each <b>print</b> <b>position,</b> with 43 alphanumeric bars on the left, followed by 45 numeric-only bars. The IBM 402 series, introduced after World War II, had a similar print arrangement and was used by IBM in early computing devices, including the IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator.|$|E
5000|$|For printing, the 407 used type wheels, an {{improvement}} over earlier tabulators that used print bars. The 48-character wheels were stationary until a character impulse was to be printed; the wheel then rotated in two steps. the first step rotated each wheel to one of 12 groups of characters based on the digit impulse associated with that <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> Digit impulses included the digits 1 through 9 (in reverse order), the 8-3 and 8-4 combination punches and a group (N) for no digit impulse. One of four characters in each group was then selected based on the zone impulse (0, 11, 12 or none) for that character position. This selection happened {{at the same time}} the type wheel was driven against the ribbon. The timing of the zone impulse selection was controlled by a complex set of linkages and electromagnets called the Analyzer, one for each of the 120 print positions. Each type wheel also emitted an impulse (called [...] "echo") for the character actually printed. The control panel could be wired so the echo impulses were accumulated for totals; report totals then reliably reflected what had actually been printed.|$|E
50|$|On 20 and 21 October 2012, {{the pilot}} Andrea Palma, {{during the trial}} and race in the {{national}} racetrack in Monza, displayed {{a copy of a}} portrait painted by Salvati, a color <b>print</b> <b>positioned</b> on the bonnet of the Ferrari 430.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 IBM {{introduced}} the IBM 407 Accounting Machine with a wheel print mechanism that could print 150 alphanumeric lines a minute. Each of the 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions</b> {{had its own}} type wheel which rotated under electromechanical control. Once all were in <b>position,</b> <b>print</b> hammers struck the wheels against a ribbon and the paper. The 407 or its wheel line printer mechanism was attached {{to a variety of}} early IBM computers, including the IBM 650, most members of the IBM 700/7000 series and the IBM 1130, the last introduced in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|... (U+008D REVERSE LINE FEED, ISO/IEC 6429 8D, decimal 141) {{is used to}} {{move the}} <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> back one line (by reverse feeding the paper, or by moving a display cursor up one line) so that other {{characters}} may be printed over existing text. This may be done to make them bolder, or to add underlines, strike-throughs or other characters such as diacritics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{terminal}} interface provided by Seventh Edition Unix and UNIX/32V, and also presented by BSD version 4 {{as the old}} terminal driver, was a simple one, largely geared towards teletypewriters as terminals. Input was entered a line at a time, with the terminal driver in the operating system (and not the terminals themselves) providing simple line editing capabilities. A buffer was maintained by the kernel in which editing took place. Applications reading terminal input would receive {{the contents of the}} buffer only when the [...] key was pressed on the terminal to end line editing. The [...] key sent from the terminal to the system would erase ("kill") the entire current contents of the editing buffer, and would be normally displayed as an '@' symbol followed by a newline sequence to move the <b>print</b> <b>position</b> to a fresh blank line. The [...] key sent from the terminal to the system would erase the last character {{from the end of the}} editing buffer, and would be normally displayed as an '#' symbol, which users would have to recognize as denoting a [...] "rubout" [...] of the preceding character (teletypewriters not being physically capable of erasing characters once they have been printed on the paper).|$|E

5000|$|The 407 was {{the central}} {{component}} of many unit record equipment shops which were the mainstay of IBM's business at the time. It rented from $800 to $920 per month ($ to $ per month in [...] dollars), depending on the model. It could print digits, letters and several special characters in any of 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions,</b> spaced 0.1 in.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, [...] (U+008B PARTIAL LINE FORWARD, decimal 139) and [...] (U+008C PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD, decimal 140) {{can be used}} {{to advance}} or reverse the text <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> by some {{fraction}} of the vertical line spacing (typically, half). These can be used in combination for subscripts (by advancing and then reversing) and superscripts (by reversing and then advancing), and may also be useful for printing diacritics.|$|R
5000|$|Counter total exits. A counter's Total {{entry hub}} caused that counter to emit total pulses {{which could be}} wired to <b>print</b> <b>positions.</b> After a total was printed, the counter was reset. Special {{circuits}} allowed negative values to be printed correctly, not as nines complements, and a special exit was provided to allow an appropriate symbol ("cr" [...] or [...] "-") to be printed next to the number when it was negative.|$|R
50|$|The {{line printer}} could print 600 lines of 120 {{characters}} per minute. It used a print barrel {{made up of}} 120 print wheels each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions</b> had a <b>print</b> hammer which when fired squeezed the paper and an inked ribbon between itself and the rotating print barrel {{for a fraction of}} a second. It is reputed to be the first commercially produced barrel printer.|$|R

50|$|In 1972, Marttila joined Joe Biden's {{campaign}} for the United States Senate in Delaware against Republican J. Caleb Boggs. Marttila {{was one of the}} few paid political consultants on Biden's 1972 campaign, in which advertising was primarily done through <b>printed</b> <b>position</b> papers that were hand-delivered. Marttila's company oversaw the strategy and advertising for the campaign. Biden won the election by 3,162 votes in an upset victory. Marttila has continued to be a close political advisor to Biden throughout the Vice President’s career, including as a senior advisor on Biden's most recent presidential campaign.|$|R
50|$|In old chess writings, {{the sides}} are often called Red and Black, because {{those were the}} two colors of ink then {{commonly}} available when hand-drawing or <b>printing</b> chess <b>position</b> diagrams.|$|R
5000|$|To {{simplify the}} design of {{peripheral}} devices, these relied on the processor. The card reader had no memory buffers, but instead gave the CPU a level-zero (highest priority) interrupt after each individual column of the card had been read. If the CPU did not respond and store the twelve bits of data before another such interrupt indicated that the next column had been read, data would be lost. Similarly, the 1132 printer relied on software on the 1130. When a letter such as [...] came into position, the CPU had to analyze a buffered line of text and assemble an array of bits that would indicate to the 1132 which <b>print</b> <b>positions</b> should be <b>printed</b> with [...] If the CPU could not respond before the [...] rotated out of <b>position,</b> <b>print</b> speed would be severely degraded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{device was}} made by linking two 28-key piano-style {{keyboards}} by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A [...] "shift" [...] key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the <b>printing</b> <b>position,</b> in a way similar to the daisy wheel printer. It was thus {{an example of a}} synchronous data transmission system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of this}} character was like NOP - when sent to a printer or a terminal, it does nothing (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more null characters were sent {{at the end of}} each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> on the next line. On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be [...] "inserted" [...] at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.|$|R
