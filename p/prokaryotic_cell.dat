5|$|Although {{probable}} <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> fossils date {{to almost}} 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot {{be used to identify}} them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth.|$|E
25|$|All the {{structural}} genes of an operon are turned ON or OFF together, {{due to a}} single promoter and operator upstream to them, but sometimes {{more control over the}} gene expression is needed. To achieve this aspect, some bacterial genes are located near together, but there is a specific promoter for each of them; this is called gene clustering. Usually these genes encode proteins which will work together in the same pathway, such as a metabolic pathway. Gene clustering helps a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> to produce metabolic enzymes in a correct order.|$|E
25|$|Prokaryotic {{cells were}} the first form of life on Earth, characterised by having vital {{biological}} processes including cell signaling and being self-sustaining. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus. Prokaryotes include two of the domains of life, bacteria and archaea. The DNA of a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> consists of a single chromosome that is {{in direct contact with}} the cytoplasm. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0µm in diameter.|$|E

The {{major difference between}} the two is the presence and/or absence of organelles. Other factors such as size, {{the way in which they}} reproduce, and the number of cells distinguish them from one another. Eukaryotic cells include animal, plant, fungi, and protozoa cells which all have a nucleus enclosed by a membrane. <b>Prokaryotic</b> <b>cells,</b> lacking an enclosed nucleus, include bacteria and archaea. <b>Prokaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> are much smaller than eukaryotic <b>cells,</b> making <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> the smallest form of life.

50|$|It {{was thought}} that {{compartmentalization}} is not found in <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells.,</b> but the discovery of carboxysomes and many other metabolosomes revealed that <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> are capable of making compartmentalized structures, albeit these are in most cases not surrounded by a lipid bilayer, but of pure proteinaceous built.|$|R
25|$|Around this time, {{the first}} proto-mitochondrion was formed. A {{bacterial}} cell related to today's Rickettsia, which had evolved to metabolize oxygen, entered a larger <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell,</b> which lacked that capability. Perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed (possibly {{due to the}} evolution of prey defenses). The smaller cell may have tried to parasitize the larger one. In any case, the smaller cell survived inside the larger cell. Using oxygen, it metabolized the larger cell's waste products and derived more energy. Part of this excess energy was returned to the host. The smaller cell replicated inside the larger one. Soon, a stable symbiosis developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it. Over time, the host cell acquired some genes from the smaller cells, and the two kinds became dependent on each other: the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller ones, and these, in turn, could not survive without the raw materials provided by the larger cell. The whole cell is now considered a single organism, and the smaller cells are classified as organelles called mitochondria.|$|E

50|$|De Duve {{work has}} contributed to the {{emerging}} consensus that the endosymbiotic theory is correct; the idea which proposes that eukaryotic cell oraganelles originated as <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells,</b> which came to live inside eukaryotic cells as endosymbionts.

50|$|Organisms in {{the domains}} of Archaea and Bacteria {{reproduce}} with binary fission. This form of asexual reproduction and cell division is also used by some organelles within eukaryotic organisms (e.g., mitochondria).

40|$|The {{theory of}} serial endosymbiosis states that {{eukaryotic}} cells, of which {{plants and animals}} are composed, evolved from the symbiosis of smaller aerobic and autotrophic <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> (bacteria) living within larger <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells.</b> Unlike plant and animal <b>cells,</b> <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> contain no membrane bound organelles or an organized nucleus. Based on this theory, organelles such as the mitochondria in modern eukaryotic cells would be the evolutionary descendents of the aerobic <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cells</b> engulfed by the larger prokaryotes. Mitochondria have a few minor characteristics {{that are similar to}} bacteria, such as their size, lack of introns in the mitochondrial genome, and a bi-layer cell covering that have been used to support the theory of serial endosymbiosis. However, there are also significant differences that make the transition of a bacterium into a eukaryotic mitochondrion impossible. Mitochondria and bacteria both have ribosomes, made of protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA), to catalyze the synthesis of proteins. When the theory of serial endosymbiosis was first proposed, it was assumed that ribosomes occurred in only two forms; a smaller 70 S variety found in prokaryotes, and a larger 80 S ribosome found in the cytosol of plant and animal cells (eukaryotes).

50|$|Calcium {{chloride}} (CaCl2) {{transformation is}} a laboratory technique in prokaryotic (bacterial) cell biology. It increases {{the ability of}} a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> to incorporate plasmid DNA allowing them to be genetically transformed. The addition of calcium chloride to a cell suspension promotes the binding of plasmid DNA to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Positively charged calcium ions attract both the negatively charged DNA backbone and the negatively charged groups in the LPS inner core. The plasmid DNA can then pass into the cell upon heat shock, where chilled cells (+4 degrees Celsius) are heated to a higher temperature (+42 degrees Celsius) for a short time.|$|E
50|$|In prokaryotic sex, DNA {{from one}} {{prokaryote}} is {{released into the}} surrounding medium, is then taken up by another prokaryote and its information integrated into the DNA of the recipient prokaryote.

Transformation is hypothesized to be the ancestral mechanism, in which DNA from one prokaryote is released into the surrounding medium and then taken up by another <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell.</b> One theory on how meiosis arose is that it evolved from transformation.

5000|$|When {{genes from}} one {{organism}} {{are expressed in}} another organism the resulting protein sometimes forms inclusion bodies. This is often true when large evolutionary distances are crossed: a cDNA isolated from Eukarya for example, and expressed as a recombinant gene in a prokaryote risks {{the formation of the}} inactive aggregates of protein known as inclusion bodies. While the cDNA may properly code for a translatable mRNA, the protein that results will emerge in a foreign microenvironment. This often has fatal effects, especially if the intent of cloning is to produce a biologically active protein. For example, eukaryotic systems for carbohydrate modification and membrane transport are not found in prokaryotes. The internal microenvironment of a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell</b> (pH, osmolarity) may differ from that of the original source of the gene. Mechanisms for folding a protein may also be absent, and hydrophobic residues that normally would remain buried may be exposed and available for interaction with similar exposed sites on other ectopic proteins. Processing systems for the cleavage and removal of internal peptides would also be absent in bacteria. The initial attempts to clone insulin in a bacterium suffered all of these deficits. In addition, the fine controls that may keep the concentration of a protein low will also be missing in a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>cell,</b> and overexpression can result in filling a cell with ectopic protein that, even if it were properly folded, would precipitate by saturating its environment.{citation needed} ...|$|E
