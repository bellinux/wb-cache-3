40|$|Although {{decades of}} {{research}} has examined the association between cortisol regulation and <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome/premenstrual <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorder</b> (PMS/PMDD), no review exists to provide a general set of conclusions from the extant research. In the present review we summarize and interpret research that has tested for associations between PMS/PMDD and cortisol levels and reactivity (n = 38 original research articles). Three types of studies are examined: correlational studies, environmental-challenge studies, and pharmacological-challenge studies. Overall, {{there was very little}} evidence that women with and without PMS/PMDD demonstrate systematic and predictable mean-level differences in cortisol, or differences in cortisol response/reactivity to challenges. Methodological differences in sample size, the types of symptoms used for diagnosis (physical and psychological vs. only affective), or the type of cortisol measure used (serum vs. salivary), did not account for differences between studies that did and did not find significant effects. Caution is recommended before accepting the conclusion of null effects, and recommendations are made that more rigorous research be conducted, considering symptom-specificity, within-person analyses, and multiple parameters of cortisol regulation, before final conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine whether}} acute changes in {{cognitive}} empathy might mediate {{the impact of}} light therapy on mood, we assessed {{the effects of a}} single light-therapy session on mood and cognitive empathy in 48 premenstrual women, including 17 who met Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool criteria for moderate-to-severe <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome/premenstrual <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorder</b> (PMS/PMDD). Using a participant-blind between-groups design, 23 women underwent 30 min of morning light therapy (5, 000 lx; blue-enriched polychromatic light, 17, 000 K) while 25 women had a sham session (200 lx, polychromatic light, 5, 000 K). We administered the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule and the Affect Grid right before and after the intervention, and 60 min later upon completion of a computerized empathic accuracy task. There were no significant effects of light condition on cognitive empathy as assessed using the computer task. Nonetheless, bright light reduced negative affect, specifically in women not using hormonal contraceptives. No effects of bright light on mood were observed in women who were using contraceptives. If a single light-therapy session does not alter cognitive empathy, then cognitive empathy may not mediate the impact of light therapy on mood in premenstrual women...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} if a single blue light application {{can improve the}} mood of healthy women and women with premenstrual symptoms during the luteal phase and whether the effect is related to a melatonin suppression. In total, 33 women were examined. In order to distinguish between and ensure the diagnoses of <b>premenstrual</b> <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorders</b> (PMDD, n= 7), premenstrual syndrome (PMS, n= 7) or asymptomatic findings (n= 19), mental and physical condition was documented daily (based on Daily Record of Severity of Problems by Endicott and Harrison, 2004) {{on at least two}} consecutive menstrual cycles. The patients’ chronotypes, social activities and moods were determined by questionnaires in both cycle phases. All morning- or normaltype patients (n= 29) were treated in the evening hours from 7. 00 pm to 10. 00 pm. On day 1 (three hours of darkness) and day 2 (darkness 7. 00 pm to 8. 30 pm and 9. 30 pm to 10. 00 pm; blue light from 8. 30 pm to 9. 30 pm), blood was taken every 30 minutes and plasma melatonin levels were recorded. Mood changes were assessed from 7. 00 pm to 10. 00 pm based on a standardized scale (“Befindlichkeitsskala” Bf-S; von Zerssen) and questionnaire (“Multidimensionale Befindlichkeitsfragebogen” MDBF; Steyer et al.) on the mental state. Also, an analog scale for fatigue was applied. The testing was conducted both in the follicular and the luteal phase. The evening studies have the following primary results and conclusions: 1. Increases in melatonin levels from 7. 00 pm to 10. 00 pm were significantly lower in the PMDD group than in healthy or PMS group under the "no light" condition in both cycle phases. This could either be caused by a delayed melatonin onset or an overall reduced melatonin synthesis in PMDD patients. 2. Surprisingly, none of the three study groups (health, PMS and PMDD) showed a significant reduction in melatonin levels by exposure to blue light. This could be attributed to the very low irradiance (12. 1 μW/cm²) of the binocular LEDs used to generate the blue light. 3. While three hours of darkness led to deterioration of mental state scores on all test days in healthy women and women with PMS, the darkness had a significant positive effect on the condition of PMDD women, but only in the luteal phase. 4. Blue light treatment has triggered major mood improvements throughout the luteal phase in the PMDD group. Women with PMS have also benefited from blue light in the luteal phase: The overall mood changed from “mildly depressed” to “well”. 5. Although asymptomatic patients showed good mental condition scores on all days of testing, only the final score at 10. 00 pm from the luteal phase measurements was significantly better after blue light treatment than compared to the control condition "darkness". This result indicates a generally higher sensitivity of women in the luteal phase to blue light treatment. 6. The visual fatigue scale suggested that all subjects were more tired after darkness at 10. 00 pm than before testing at 7. 00 pm. In the luteal phase, the fatigue grade at 10. 00 pm was significantly higher in women with PMS and PMDD than it was in healthy women at this time. It was significantly reduced in both cycle phases after blue light treatment. Despite the small sample size, {{results of the present study}} suggest that blue light treatment could improve the mood of women with premenstrual symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Psychiatric {{disorders}} are frequent among patients with epilepsy. Data {{in the literature}} have shown a heterogeneous clinical presentation of psychiatric disorders in patients with epilepsy.

25|$|SSRIs, {{including}} sertraline, {{reduce the}} symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Side effects such as nausea are common. Sertraline is effective in alleviating {{the symptoms of}} <b>premenstrual</b> <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorder</b> (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began {{during the first week}} of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14days before menses, was shown to work as well as continuous treatment.|$|E

2500|$|The formal medical {{description}} of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) {{and the more}} severe, related diagnosis of <b>premenstrual</b> <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorder</b> (PMDD) goes back at least 70 years to a {{paper presented at the}} New York Academy of Medicine by Robert T. Frank titled [...] "Hormonal Causes of Premenstrual Tension". The specific term premenstrual syndrome appears to date from an article published in 1953 by Dalton and Green in the British Medical Journal. Since then, PMS has been a continuous presence in popular culture, occupying a place that is larger than the research attention accorded it as a medical diagnosis. It has been argued that women are partially responsible for the medicalization of PMS. [...] By legitimizing this disorder, women have contributed to the social construction of PMS as an illness. [...] It has also been suggested that the public debate over PMS and PMDD was impacted by organizations who had a stake in the outcome including feminists, the American Psychiatric Association, physicians and scientists. Until the 1950s, there was little research done surrounding PMS and it was not seen as a social problem. [...] By the 1980s, however, viewing PMS in a social context had begun to take place.|$|E

40|$|Sixty {{women from}} the {{community}} were {{used in this study}} to identify a profile of women who experience premenstrual dysphoria. Women with prospectively confirmed premenstrual dysphoria (PMD +;N= 24) were compared to women with prospectively unconfirmed premenstrual dysphoria (PMD-; N= 15) and controls (PMD control; N= 21). Over one menstrual cycle daily records of physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms were completed on the Daily Ratings Form. Other self report measures obtained were the Premenstrual Assessment Form, Rotter 2 ̆ 7 s Internal External Locus of Control, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A psychiatric history was obtained during an interview. Analyses showed that premenstrually, PMD+and PMD - groups could be significantly differentiated from controls on reports of <b>premenstrual</b> <b>dysphoric</b> changes and levels of state and trait anxiety. Postmenstrually, they could be significantly differentiated from controls firstly, by history of affective disorder and locus of control and secondly, by <b>premenstrual</b> <b>dysphoric</b> changes. There {{were no significant differences between}} the PMD + and PMD - women on most of the self report measures either at pre or post menstrual assessments. The present findings suggest that the characteristic profile of PMD+and PMD - women is one of being symptomatic premenstrually in relation to dysphoric changes and levels of state and trait anxiety. Postmenstrually these symptoms appear to be superimposed on a background of a history of affective disorder and an external locus of control orientation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{migrants}} form a {{large part}} of the Austrian population, information about mental health of migrants in Austria is scarce. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorders</b> (depression and anxiety) and the corresponding utilization of health care services of Eastern European, western and other migrants with the non-migrant population in Austria. METHODS: We performed a telephone survey on a random sample of the general population of Austria aged 15 years and older (n= 3509) between October 2010 and September 2011. Depression and anxiety were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire- 4 and utilization of health care services in the last 4 weeks was inquired. RESULTS: 15. 0 % of our sample had a migration background. Female migrants from Eastern Europe, first and second generation, had a higher prevalence of <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorders</b> (29. 7 % and 33. 4 % respectively) than Austrian women (15. 2 %) (p< 0. 001). The prevalence in the other migrant groups did not differ significantly from the Austrian population. There was no gender difference in <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorders</b> in the Austrian population. After adjustment for age and chronic diseases, having a <b>dysphoric</b> <b>disorder</b> was associated with a higher utilization of health care services among migrant and Austrian women, but not among men. LIMITATIONS: Because of the explorative nature of the study multiple testing correction was not performed. The reason for health care utilization was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health of female migrants from Eastern Europe should be studied in more detail; men could be an underserved group, both in migrants and Austrians...|$|R
