5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ <b>punning,</b> as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E

When {{reporting}} the story, the media satirised Chaponda's statement with <b>punning</b> headlines. Later, the minister withdrew his statement.|$|E
25|$|His comedy {{combines}} the mock-Gothic with the Aristophanic. He suffers from that dramatist's faults and, {{though not as}} daring in invention or as free {{in the use of}} sexual humour, shares many of his strengths. His greatest intellectual love is for Ancient Greece, including late and minor works such as the Dionysiaca of Nonnus; many of his characters are given <b>punning</b> names taken from Greek to indicate their personality or philosophy.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} {{from the game}} in 1997 Haynes has served as Chairman of Selectors of the Barbados Cricket Association, President of Carlton Cricket Club, Secretary of the West Indies Players Association and is currently a Director of the West Indies Cricket Board. He is a former Government Senator and was Chairman of the National Sports Council. His main relaxation is golf. A biography Lion of Barbados was published about him, <b>punning</b> on his middle name 'Leo'.|$|E
25|$|Gemma died around 1578 in an {{epidemic}} of the plague, to which {{a third of the}} population at Leuven also succumbed. Although he had already proven to be a prolific writer, he was only in his mid-forties. His epitaph consists of two elegiac couplets in Latin, <b>punning</b> on lapis ("stone, precious stone, tombstone") and Gemma ("precious stone, gem"). He was survived by two sons: Raphael, who entered the priesthood, and Philip, who followed family tradition as a medical doctor.|$|E
25|$|Only his son William Theobald Wolfe Tone {{survived to}} adulthood. Raised in France {{by his mother}} after Tone's death, William was {{appointed}} a cadet in the Imperial School of Cavalry in 1810 on Napoleon's orders. He was naturalised a French citizen on 4 May 1812. In January 1813 he was made sub-lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs and joined the Grand Army in Germany (his nom de guerre was the <b>punning</b> le petit loup – the little wolf. He was at the battles of Löwenberg, Goldberg, Dresden, Bauthen, Mühlberg, Aachen, and Leipzig. He received six lance wounds at the Battle of Leipzig, was promoted to lieutenant and aide-de-camp of General Bagneres and was decorated with the Legion of Honour.|$|E
500|$|Anglo-Latin {{suffered}} a severe {{decline in the}} ninth century, {{partly due to the}} Viking invasions, but it began to revive in the 890s under Alfred the Great, who revered Aldhelm. Asser's Life of King Alfred has a hermeneutic flavour. Alfred was assisted by scholars he brought in from continental Europe. One of them was a German, John the Old Saxon, and in Lapidge's view a poem he wrote praising the future King Æthelstan, and <b>punning</b> on the Old English meaning of Æthelstan as [...] "noble stone", marks an early sign of a revival of the hermeneutic style: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{negative}} review {{came from}} The Independents Andy Gill who considered [...] "Shampain" [...] and [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] as [...] "every bit as annoying as their <b>punning</b> titles, with queasy, prancing piano and synth figures". He found certain vocal techniques in [...] "Mowgli's Road" [...] and [...] "I Am Not a Robot" [...] to be [...] "infantile", and evaluated {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Girls" [...] and [...] "Hollywood" [...] as shallow. Gill added that the content of [...] "Rootless", [...] "Obsessions" [...] and [...] "The Outsider" [...] did not match with what would be expected from the titles.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} lampooned by The Goon Show as [...] "Goosy and Borks" [...] in their episode, [...] "Lurgy Strikes Britain", {{as well as}} by musical parodist Peter Schickele who named one of the friends of fictional {{composer}} P.D.Q. Bach Jonathan [...] "Boozey" [...] Hawkes, and claimed him as a vital link in the chain whereby manuscripts of PDQ Bach's works had survived. Somewhat more recondite was the <b>punning</b> reference delivered in one of Gerard Hoffnung's parody concerts: [...] "If Boosey's will Hawk it, Schott's will Tippett" [...] (from Punkt Contrapunkt at Hoffnung Interplanetary Music Festival with John Amis, Royal Festival Hall, 21 and 22 November 1958) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} {{translating}} Tintin into British English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen, Hergé's British publishers. [...] It was a joint operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, {{working closely with}} Hergé to attain an accurate translation as true {{as possible to the}} original work. Due in part to the large amount of language-specific word play (such as <b>punning)</b> in the series, especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus' partial deafness, it was always the intention not to translate literally, instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right. Despite the free hand Hergé afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Hergé's intentions.|$|E
500|$|The matter {{became public}} {{knowledge}} on 2 December 1936 when the Bishop of Bradford made an indirect {{comment on the}} king's [...] "need for Divine Grace". By then the king had unalterably {{decided that he would}} abdicate rather than give up Wallis Simpson. All attempts to dissuade him failed, and on 11 December he gave up his throne in favour of his brother, George VI. Two days later Lang broadcast a speech, in which he said: [...] "From God he received a high and sacred trust. Yet by his own will he has... surrendered the trust." [...] The king's motive had been [...] "a craving for private happiness" [...] that he had sought [...] "in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles of marriage". The speech was widely condemned for its lack of charity towards the departed king and provoked the writer Gerald Bullett to publish a satirical <b>punning</b> rhyme: ...|$|E
500|$|In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare employs several {{dramatic}} {{techniques that}} have garnered praise from critics; {{most notably the}} abrupt shifts from comedy to tragedy (an example is the <b>punning</b> exchange between Benvolio and Mercutio just before Tybalt arrives). Before Mercutio's death in Act three, the play is largely a comedy. After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes serious and takes on a tragic tone. When Romeo is banished, rather than executed, and Friar Laurence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo, the audience can still hope that all will end well. They are in a [...] "breathless state of suspense" [...] by {{the opening of the}} last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved. These shifts from hope to despair, reprieve, and new hope, serve to emphasise the tragedy when the final hope fails and both the lovers die at the end.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} in the United States proved to be less favourable. In a review published in Virginia in January 1983, Edward Jones of The Free-Lance Star offered praise for the [...] "novel touch" [...] of casting a would-be-mother as the principal villain, commenting, [...] "In {{what has to be}} a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach. What a time to have twins!" [...] Nevertheless, Inseminoid is discarded as [...] "no more than a mix of everything-you've-ever-seen-in-a-horror-movie-and-didn't-particularly-want-to-see-again." [...] In a November 1983 edition of the Floridian newspaper Boca Raton News, Skip Sheffield branded the film [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "cheapo", suggesting that his readers [...] "Imagine Alien without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, and you have a picture of Horror Planet." [...] He added his opinion that brutal violence does not guarantee narrative suspense, <b>punning</b> on the name Run Run Shaw in his downbeat conclusion that [...] "Horror Planet is a film to run, run away from—fast." ...|$|E
500|$|Internationally, {{the sale}} of gravity bongs is often {{prohibited}} in countries where marijuana is illegal due to its association with the herb. In the United States, under the Federal Drug Paraphernalia Statute, {{which is part of}} the Controlled Substances Act, it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia, meaning that the bong is illegal. Since Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have legalized recreational use of the herb, gravity bongs (along with other related paraphernalia) can be legally sold to anyone over the age of 21. In countries and states where use of cannabis is illegal, some retailers insist that bongs are intended for use with tobacco in an attempt to circumvent laws against selling drug paraphernalia. While technically the term [...] "bong" [...] does not mean a device used for smoking mainly marijuana, drug-related connotations have been formed with the word itself (partly due to <b>punning</b> with Sanskrit bhangah, meaning [...] "hemp"). Thus for fear of the law some head shops will not serve customers who use the word [...] "bong" [...] or [...] "bongs", typically insisting instead on the term [...] "water pipe".|$|E
500|$|When {{creating}} a Devil Fruit, Oda thinks {{of something that}} would fulfill a human desire; {{he added that he}} does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it. The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of <b>punning</b> in which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of Luffy, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, and Franky's techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; some of them look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is Onigiri, which is rendered as demon's cut but may also mean rice ball. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they [...] "might have cut down the laughs by about half". Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators [...] "made the anime pretty close to the manga".|$|E
500|$|Stephen King {{called the}} series [...] "a feat of which only a {{superior}} imagination is capable", and declared [...] "Rowling's <b>punning,</b> one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" [...] to be [...] "remarkable". However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner {{made the}} {{skeleton}} the holotype specimen {{of a new}} genus and species: Baryonyx walkeri. The genus name derives from ancient Greek; βαρύς (barys) means [...] "heavy" [...] or [...] "strong", and ὄνυξ (onyx) means [...] "claw" [...] or [...] "talon". The specific name honours Walker, for discovering the specimen. At that time, the authors {{did not know if}} the large claw belonged to the hand or the foot (as in dromaeosaurs, which it was then assumed to be). Due to ongoing work on the bones (70 percent had been prepared at the time), they called their article preliminary (a [...] "Letter to Nature") and promised a more detailed description at a later date. Baryonyx was the first large Early Cretaceous theropod found anywhere in the world by that time. Before the discovery of Baryonyx the last significant theropod find in the United Kingdom was Eustreptospondylus in 1871, and in a 1986 interview Charig called Baryonyx [...] "the best find of the century" [...] in Europe. It was widely featured in international media, and its discovery {{was the subject of a}} 1987 BBC documentary. Baryonyx was nicknamed [...] "Claws" [...] by journalists <b>punning</b> on the title of the film Jaws. The skeleton is mounted at the Natural History Museum in London, and in 1997 Charig and Milner published a monograph describing the holotype skeleton in detail.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{his most}} notable works, however, were those he created for himself, often with the {{proceeds}} of the winning of an architectural competition. Examples include the Elephant Inkstand, which Crook considers [...] "the very epitome of its creator's special genius", the pair of jewelled decanters paid for with the fees for the plans of the Crimea Memorial Church and for his series of lectures, Art Applied to Industry, and the Cat Cup, created by Barkentin in commemoration of the Law Courts competition, of which Crook writes: [...] "Its technical virtuosity sets standards for the Arts and Crafts phase. But the overall conception, the range of materials, the ingenuity, the inventiveness, the sheer gusto of the design, is peculiarly, triumphantly Burges." [...] Burges also designed more utilitarian articles which were nonetheless imbued with his love of allusion and <b>punning,</b> including silverware featuring mermaids, spiders and other creatures {{and a set of}} knives and forks for the Tower House, with the handles, carved by Nicholls, showing symbols of [...] "meat and vegetables, veal, venision, onion, pea and so on." [...] He was also a knowledgeable critic, referred to by a contemporary as [...] "one of the best judges of armour in Europe." [...] His large collection of armour, parts of which came from the famed collection of Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, was bequeathed to the British Museum upon his death.|$|E
500|$|William of Malmesbury {{wrote that}} Alfred the Great honoured his young {{grandson}} with a ceremony {{in which he}} gave him a scarlet cloak, a belt set with gems, and a sword with a gilded scabbard. Medieval Latin scholar Michael Lapidge and historian Michael Wood see this as designating Æthelstan as a potential heir {{at a time when}} the claim of Alfred's nephew, Æthelwold, to the throne represented a threat to the succession of Alfred's direct line, but historian Janet Nelson suggests that it should be seen in the context of conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s, and might reflect an intention to divide the realm between his son and his grandson after his death. Historian Martin Ryan goes further, suggesting that at the end of his life Alfred may have favoured Æthelstan rather than Edward as his successor. An acrostic poem praising prince [...] "Adalstan", and prophesying a great future for him, has been interpreted by Lapidge as referring to the young Æthelstan, <b>punning</b> on the old English meaning of his name, [...] "noble stone". Lapidge and Wood see the poem as a commemoration of Alfred's ceremony by one of his leading scholars, John the Old Saxon. In Michael Wood's view, the poem confirms the truth of William of Malmesbury's account of the ceremony. Wood also suggests that Æthelstan may have been the first English king to be groomed from childhood as an intellectual, and that John was probably his tutor. However, Sarah Foot argues that the acrostic poem makes better sense if it is dated to the beginning of Æthelstan's reign.|$|E
500|$|Number 1 Regency Square, later {{known as}} St Albans House and now {{numbered}} 131 King's Road, is [...] "historically {{the most interesting}} house in the square". [...] Amon Henry Wilds designed it for the Duke and Duchess of St Albans, and William Izard laid out the interior in 1829. [...] The house {{was one of the}} most important social venues in Brighton between 1830 and the Duchess's death in 1837. [...] She was born Harriet Mellon in 1777, became an actress, married banker Thomas Coutts in 1815, and inherited his fortune when he died in 1822—thereby becoming England's richest woman. [...] After being courted by many men, she met and married William Beauclerk, the 9th Duke of St Albans, and they became regular visitors to Brighton. [...] In 1830, they moved permanently to 1 Regency Square and renamed it St Albans House. [...] For the next seven years, it was the venue for lavish balls with hundreds of upper-class guests, extensive feasts and falconry displays by the Duke, who was the Grand Falconer of England. [...] St Albans House had an adjacent riding school which supposedly had the second largest unsupported interior space and the second largest dome in England, behind Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral respectively. [...] (Part of the Bedford Hotel now occupies the site.) [...] Two other famous characters paid an unintentional visit to Regency Square at the end of the 19th century: Oscar Wilde and his lover Lord Alfred Douglas crashed their horse and carriage into the railings of the gardens. [...] Local newspapers reported the story with interest, but Wilde dismissed it as [...] "an accident of no importance"—possibly a <b>punning</b> allusion to one of his best-known plays.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 F won {{its first}} Hugo Award for Best Magazine, and when Mills became editor that year he {{maintained}} the high standards Boucher had set, winning the award again in 1959 and 1960. [...] Mills continued {{to publish a}} broad range of material without limiting the magazine to particular subgenres. [...] Ashley cites John Collier, Robert Arthur, Allen Drury, and Ray Bradbury, all authors with mainstream reputations who appeared in F in 1960, as evidence of the magazine's diversity. [...] Daniel Keyes had been unable to sell [...] "Flowers for Algernon" [...] until Mills bought it in 1959; it went on to win several awards and according to Clute and Nicholls is [...] "arguably the most popular sf novel ever published". [...] Rogue Moon, a novel about a deadly artifact left by aliens on the moon, is often considered Algis Budrys's best novel; it appeared in 1960, and the following year saw Brian Aldiss's [...] "Hothouse", the first in that series. [...] Zenna Henderson's stories of The People, a group of refugee humanoid aliens hiding on Earth, were published through the 1950s and 1960s and became a [...] "central feature" [...] of the magazine according to sf critic John Clute. [...] Boucher published Damon Knight's [...] "The Country of the Kind", described by Ashley as [...] "one of his most potent stories from the fifties", in 1956, and the same year, under the pseudonym [...] "Grendel Briarton", Reginald Bretnor began a series of <b>punning</b> stories known as [...] "Feghoots" [...] that lasted until 1964. [...] At the end of the 1950s, during Mills' tenure as editor, Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers was serialized in F, under the title Starship Soldier; this was intended to be a juvenile novel but was rejected by Scribner's for being too violent. [...] It won the Hugo Award in the novel category the following year, and proved to be one of Heinlein's most controversial books.|$|E
500|$|Burges was {{a notable}} {{designer}} of Gothic-inspired metalwork and jewellery, {{and he has}} been cited as [...] "Pugin's successor in the Gothic revival style." [...] Although Burges was foremost an architect, Edmund Gosse described his buildings as [...] "more jewel than architecture", and Crook states that [...] "Burges's genius as a designer is expressed to perfection in his jewellery and metalwork." [...] He began with religious artifacts (candlesticks, chalices, pectoral crosses) as individual commissions or as part of the decorative scheme for buildings over which he had complete artistic control. Examples include the chalices for St Michael's Church, Brighton, the statue of the Angel which stands above St Fin Barre's and which was his personal gift to the cathedral, and the Dunedin Crozier. This item, carved in ivory and depicting St George slaying the dragon, was made for the first Bishop of Dunedin. In 1875 Burges published the design in a French magazine as a thirteenth century original, an example of his delight in tricks and jokes. Similarly inventive were his designs for fish plates for Lord Bute, in which a service of eighteen plates is decorated with <b>punning</b> illustrations, such as a skating skate, and a winged perch seated on the branch of a tree. He also undertook commissions for other patrons, including the Sneyd dessert service. On 3 April 1872, Burges produced a gothic-style brooch for the marriage of the Marquess of Bute to Lady Bute. In September 1873, he produced another brooch for the Marchioness, {{in the shape of a}} gothic G, a gold heraldic shield in enamel, encrusted with gems and pearls. He followed this with a necklace and earrings, an attempt to [...] "design in Castellani's archeological style." [...] Another example of the works that Burges created for Lady Bute as a present for her husband, was a silver cruet set, in the form of two medieval retainers carrying tiny barrels of salt and pepper; the answer to the question of [...] "what to give a man who (could) afford everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her <b>punning</b> attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E
