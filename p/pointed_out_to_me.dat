5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{one of the}} midshipmen in the boat, {{of the name of}} Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E

I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that many [...] protesters are non-white and/or [...] "communists." [...] Well {{my answer to}} that is: [...] "Who cares?!" [...] They are against the same evil, corrupted, {{degenerate}} capitalist elitists that we are against! ...Seriously people, just who is our enemy? [...] The unemployed left-wing 25-year-old holding up a sign, or the Judeo-capitalist banksters who swindled the American taxpayers out of a trillion dollars in the [...] "bailout" [...] scam and continue to oppress the white working class?!? ... We need to utilize and support every movement of dissent against this evil American empire, regardless of which end {{of the political spectrum}} it originates from. ...The fact that it's these [...] "lefties" ... who are picking up the ball and running with it â€“ only shows how much more in tune they are with the fed up masses of white workers, than the fossilized, reactionary [...] "right-wing". ... My heart is right there with these people, perhaps someday the [...] "movement" [...] will show the same courage and dedication that these people out there fighting are showing! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{benefited from}} it. Now <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the various movements. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this large French battery must have galled the whole line terribly; but, {{on the other}} hand, it is itself very exposed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Besides, some {{of these}} villages are very strong, and we might suffer a good deal before we could carry it if they had notice of our coming.
