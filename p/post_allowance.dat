(2) Cost-of-Living Allowances: The cost-of-living {{allowances}} {{are those}} allowances {{that are designed}} to reimburse employees for certain excess costs that they incur {{as a result of their}} employment overseas. This group includes the <b>Post</b> <b>Allowance</b> (more commonly referred to as the COLA), Foreign Transfer Allowance, Home Service Transfer Allowance, Separate Maintenance Allowance, Education Allowance, and Educational Travel. Cost-of-living allowances are not considered a part of taxable income.|$|E
50|$|Personnel based {{outside the}} United States (e.g. U.S. territories, foreign {{overseas}} areas) receive a lower locality adjustment (4.76 percent for 2010). However, {{they may also}} receive certain non-taxable allowances such as cost-of-living <b>allowances,</b> <b>post</b> <b>allowances</b> and housing allowances in accordance with other laws, such as the Foreign Service Act. Federal civilian workers based in CONUS do not normally receive housing allowances or government-furnished housing. Also, some civilian personnel stationed overseas do not receive housing allowances; this may include military dependents working in federal civilian positions overseas, military members that left the service while overseas and were hired into an overseas position, and U.S. citizens hired into overseas positions while traveling abroad.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempted}} {{to educate the}} reader about the shortage of nursing staff and how it affects Bayelsa State’s health sector. Bayelsa State like any other state in Nigeria has enormous health challenges associated with manpower shortage. Bayelsa’s situation is unique because of its terrain. Some factors such as cost of river transport, insecurity of lives and properties due to incessant attacks from sea pirates, poor housing, lack of portable water, deplorable state of hospitals and health centres, erratic or lack of power supply, inadequate nursing personnel, and uneven distribution of the few nurses available, were identified to be peculiar with Bayelsa terrain. This consequently resulted in increased nurse- patient load, risk for error, infection spread, high mortality rate, quackery and chances of nurses being over stressed. Recommendation such as increase in the rural <b>posting</b> <b>allowance</b> for nurses, provision of social amenities in rural areas, employment of more nurses from various states of the federation among others were made...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: General practitioners' (GPs') {{attendance}} at {{continuing medical education}} (CME) events has increased since {{the introduction of the}} <b>Post</b> Graduate Educational <b>Allowance</b> (PGEA) in 1990. However, few studies have examined doctors' perceptions about their continuing education, and explored their views in depth. AIM: To investigate general practitioners' experience of CME events, what personal impact they had, and how the GPs perceived the influence of CME in their professional practice and patient care. METHOD: A qualitative study, with in-depth semi-structured interviews, of a purposive sample of 25 general practitioners in Dorset was conducted. Content analysis was used to identify major themes from the transcripts. RESULTS: GPs perceived CME events as beneficial. Confidence levels rose, and the events provided a break from practice that refreshed and relaxed, thus indirectly benefiting patients. The opportunities provided by formal events for informal learning and exchange of ideas, with both peers in general practice and consultant colleagues, were highly valued. The relevance of the subject to general practice, and the appropriateness of the educational format, were considered of paramount importance. Few responders identified major changes in their practice as a result of formal CME events, and information was seldom disseminated among practice colleagues. CONCLUSION: The results of this study challenge GP educators to provide CME that is relevant, to recognize the value of peer contact, and to facilitate the incorporation of new information into practic...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{behaviour}} influences {{dry matter}} intake, but is highly variable between animals. It {{is a key}} factor to explain the interindividual variation {{in the evolution of}} rumen pH, and therefore of occurrence of acidosis which differs from one animal to another, even when fed the same diet. Phenotyping feeding behaviour is thus of interest for quantifying some of the variation in digestive efficiency, and therefore in feed efficiency, especially in intensive systems with a high proportion of acidogenic ingredients in the diet. The aim of this work was to look for repeatable and pertinent criteria to evaluate this trait. Feeding behaviour was assessed at three different periods (1 st lactation, 2 nd gestation + lactation, 2 nd lactation) on thirty-five goats born at the same time. They were housed in individual crates with automatic measurement of the quantity of feed eaten every 2 min, and fed ad libitum a complete ration adapted to requirements. One third of the feed was delivered after the morning milking and two thirds after the afternoon milking according to the intervals between milkings. The evolution of feed intake during 15 hours after the afternoon allowance was measured on 3 or 4 days in each period. Two phenotypes were automatically measured and analysed: Q 90 (quantity of diet consumed by 90 min <b>post</b> afternoon feed <b>allowance),</b> P 90 (Q 90 /Total quantity of feed consumed after the afternoon feed allowance). In earlier work, these two parameters were highly linked with the occurrence of acidosis. Intra-period individual repeatabilities were very high. The value for one period was highly correlated with that of a preceding one for the P 90 criteria, but only tended to be correlated for the Q 90 criteria. Given this repeatability, it is possible to characterise the feeding behaviour of a goat during its first lactation and, for example, to adjust the feeding of the animals with the lowest P 90 or Q 90 in the following lactations, in order to decrease the occurrence of acidosis in the herd. These results on the variability of intake rate show that simple criteria could be found to phenotype goats on intake rate in precision livestock farming systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to (1) quantify milk production and urinary N excretion from dairy cows grazing irrigated lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and perennial ryegrass (Loluim perenne L.) -white clover (Trifolium repens L.) pastures {{at different stages of}} lactation and herbage allowances, (2) determine herbage production and composition of irrigated lucerne and perennial ryegrass-white clover pastures managed under irrigation, and (3) model the productivity and profitability of using lucerne on an irrigated dairy farm in Canterbury New Zealand. The first experiment measured milk production, milk composition and N excretion of dairy cows fed pure lucerne (L), perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture (G) or a temporal sequence where lucerne was offered in the morning and perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture in the afternoon (GL). Three trials were conducted in early and mid-lactation (November and then January). Milksolid (MS) production was unaffected by pasture treatment in all three trials, averaging, 2. 31, 1. 90, and 1. 68 kg MS/cow/d for early lactation, mid lactation (November) and mid lactation (January) respectively. Although milk yield was higher in L than G during Mid-Nov lactation (22. 7 vs 20. 2 litres/cow/day respectively) this was offset by lower milk protein percentage in L (3. 67 % versus 4. 03 % for G) so that total milksolid production was similar across treatments. It was believed the lack of difference was due to similar estimated DM intake and diet metabolisable energy (ME) between L and G. Despite no differences in milk production, there was consistently higher urine N concentration and estimated urinary N output g/day in L (359 to 408 g/d) and GL (234 - 312 g/d) than G (146 to 263 g/d). The second experiment measured dry matter (DM) intake, diet composition, milk production and milk composition of cows in mid lactation (October) fed G and L at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kg DM/cow/d above ground level. Milk yield and milksolids production increased with herbage allowance in both G and L treatments but was unaffected by pasture treatment or by the interaction of pasture treatment and herbage allowance. The average marginal response (kg milk per extra kg DM eaten) was 0. 63 for L and 0. 56 for the G. The increase in milk production in both G and L treatments with herbage allowance was due to an increase in DM intake from low to high herbage allowances. Cows feeding on both L and G at the lowest herbage allowance (20 kg DM/cow/d) substituted lower DM intakes and low feed value by mobilising energy reserves which helped maintain milksolids production. Post grazing herbage mass increased with increasing herbage allowance as utilisation of above ground dry matter decreased from 81 - 42 % in L and 78 - 46 % in G. The third experiment measured apparent DM intake, diet composition, milk production and botanical composition in the re-growth from different herbage allowances in the second experiment. Cows were fed a constant herbage allowance of 30 kg DM/cow/d above ground level. Herbage allowance from the second experiment and subsequent <b>post</b> grazing herbage <b>allowance</b> had no effect on milksolids production in either L or G when grazed at a constant herbage allowance. The lack of an effect of previous post grazing herbage mass {{may be due to the}} differences in DM intake and diet quality being negligible between G and L, or that energy may have been partitioned away from milk production to liveweight gain. The fourth experiment measured seasonal and annual herbage DM production, herbage quality and botanical composition of G and L under irrigation. The total annual DM production was non-significant in L (18, 483 t DM/ha) and G (17, 626 t/DM/ha) under full irrigation. However, herbage growth rates in L were greater than in G from November- March averaging 18. 6 kg DM/ha/d more. The herbage quality of G was fairly consistent throughout the year (11. 8 to 12. 7 MJ ME/kg), while L quality declined considerably (12. 2 to 9. 2 MJ ME/kg DM) with an increase in herbage mass during times of peak growth in summer. The effect of incorporating lucerne into an irrigated dairy farm was modelled using FARMAX Dairy Pro. Data from experiment 1 to 4 was incorporated into the model and the effect of different proportions of lucerne on farm (0 to 50 %) and stocking rate (3. 6 to 4. 2 cows/ha) on profitability was modelled. The most profitable system at a $ 6. 50 /kg MS was 40 % lucerne on the milking platform. This system did not have the highest milk production per ha but the lowest cost per kg MS ($ 3. 6 /kg MS). Herbage production increased from 17. 3 t DM/ha at 0 % to 17. 6 t DM/ha at 50 % lucerne. The increased herbage production at 3. 6 cows/ha allowed more feed to be conserved over summer and used in spring and autumn. This resulted in less purchased feed required, decreasing cost per kg MS. Also contributing to the lower cost per kg MS in the high proportion lucerne systems was the lower N use which reduced from 259 kg/ha to 173 kg/ha. Results shown that despite there being no difference in diet quality or milk production between lucerne and perennial ryegrass-white clover, there could still be some advantages of using lucerne with greater diet selection and liveweight gain at certain herbage allowances. Lucerne could also have some advantages for increasing overall herbage production and shifting the growth curve to allow more feed to be conserved in summer, reducing purchased feed on the shoulders of the season and reducing costs per kg MS...|$|R
