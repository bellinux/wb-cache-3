40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this research is}} the observation that tutors in the Computing Sciences (CS) Department at NMMU require more support than they currently receive in order to be effective. This research project investigated how technology could be used to support tutors during practical sessions. Focus group discussions with tutors in the CS Department revealed that challenges exist which hinder them from effectively assisting students during practical sessions. Through analysis of focus group discussions and literature regarding the use of technology in education, it was determined that a tablet PC could be used to support tutors by providing on-demand access to practical content and answers to frequently asked questions. Existing models using technology in education to support either students or tutors in learning were investigated. A conceptual model using technology to support tutors during practical sessions was designed and proposed based on features of the existing models which were considered relevant to the CS context, and ways in which they could support tutors. Relevant features of the conceptual model include the system, purpose, boundary, key variables and best practices applied to the technological component of the model. During development of the model, these features were considered. In the context of the CS Department, a tablet <b>PC</b> <b>tool</b> was used by tutors as a means to support themselves and assist students during practical sessions. The tool is a component of the model which provides practical information. Each layer of the model’s three layer architecture was tested to ensure that the correct information is provided, on demand, to tutors during practical sessions. Positive results from a field study evaluation revealed that the conceptual model, using a tablet <b>PC</b> <b>tool,</b> could be applied to the CS context with the intention of supporting tutors during practical sessions...|$|E

40|$|Virtual Reality {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} tools in the development of new methods for neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation. Neuropsychological assessment is typically carried out by administering paper-and-pencil tests to patients. However, these tests have some limitations, due to the fact that they are not effectively able to evaluate the subject's performance of daily activities. To cope with this void, neuropsychologists base their evaluation on their clinical experience, often successfully. Nevertheless, this is not an evidence-based practice, thus it is not considered optimal from a medical decision-making perspective. More recently, however, the increasing accessibility of advanced technology such as virtual reality has opened new possibilities for neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation. Starting with this frame, the chapter explores the changes that have occurred over time in the neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation up to the most recent VR-based tools. In particular, we will present a VR-based <b>PC</b> <b>tool</b> for the assessment of executive functions, and a VR-based mobile tool for the assessment and rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect.

40|$|Criteria for {{monitoring}} {{the quality of}} rainfall forecasts employed in support of flood warning are required to assess their reliability in use and to provide feedback aimed at providing an improved service. The rainfall forecasts of main concern here are the quantitative component of the Daily Weather Forecast, the Evening Update and the Heavy Rainfall Warning. These three products are produced by the Met Office as a service to the Environment Agency in support of their flood warning responsibilities. This report, commissioned jointly by the Environment Agency and the Met Office, first reviews current methodology and practice in monitoring the performance of rainfall forecasts. The content, format and delivery mechanisms {{of each of the}} three forecast products are also reviewed and recommendations for revision made. The report proceeds to develop a framework for assessment, addressing issues such as selection of performance measures, choice of “ground truth”, and sources of comparative forecasts such as rainfall forecasts obtained directly from the Mesoscale Model and from the Nimrod radar-based product. New methods for assessing the accuracy of performance measures - as determined by a given rainfall forecast, ground-truth and comparative forecast dataset -are introduced. Rainfall forecasts for case study storms are used to trial the assessment procedure employing a selection of performance measures. The case study storms were chosen by the Environment Agency to be of flooding interest to a number of its regions. Suitable ground truth available for assessment, including raingauge and Nimrod quality-controlled radar data, are identified and processed to a form suitable for application in the analysis. The analysis of the case study dataset is used to develop practical experience {{in the use of the}} assessment procedure leading to recommendations for operational implementation. These recommendations concern both the automated assessment of forecasts and the use of a <b>PC</b> <b>tool</b> with manual data-entry for assessing the Heavy Rainfall Warnings. The development of the <b>PC</b> <b>tool</b> features as an important operational output of the project. The report concludes with a summary of the study, encompassing its main conclusions and recommendations. In particular, this points out the advantages of using a small and rather simple set of performance measures. The mean absolute error provides an easily understood and stable measure of the “typical size of error”, in the same units as the rainfall forecast. For a categorical measure of rainfall threshold exceedence, the Critical Success Index and False Alarm Rate provide a useful pairing that are widely used and easily understood. For assessing probability forecasts, the Continuous Brier Score provides a simple measure analogous in form to the mean absolute error. Measures of forecast bias are also included in the selected set of performance measures considered important. ...|$|E
40|$|Device-to-device (D 2 D) {{communication}} {{integrated into}} cellular networks is an advanced tool {{to take advantage}} of the proximity of devices and allow for reusing cellular resources and thereby to increase the user bitrates and the system capacity. However, the introduction of D 2 D in legacy long term evolution (LTE) cellular spectrum requires to revisit and modify the existing radio resource management and power control (PC) techniques in order to fully realize the potential of the proximity and reuse gains and to limit the interference to the cellular layer. In this paper, we examine the performance of the legacy LTE <b>PC</b> <b>tool</b> box and benchmark it against an utility optimal iterative scheme. We find that the open loop PC scheme of LTE performs well for cellular users both in terms of the used transmit power levels and the achieved signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio distribution. However, the performance of the D 2 D users as well as the overall system throughput can be boosted by the utility optimal scheme, by taking better advantage of both the proximity and the reuse gains. Therefore, in this paper we propose a hybrid PC scheme, in which cellular users employ the legacy LTE open loop PC, while D 2 D users exploits the utility optimizing distributed PC scheme. We also recognize that the hybrid scheme is not only nearly optimal, and can balance between spectral and energy efficiency, but it also allows for a distributed implementation at the D 2 D users, while preserving the LTE PC scheme for the cellular users.

However, when D 2 D (in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project also called Long Term Evolution (LTE) Direct) communication in cellular spectrum is supported, there is a need to revisit and modify the existing radio resource management (RRM) and power control (PC) techniques to realize the potential of the proximity and reuse gains and to limit the interference at the cellular layer. In this paper, we examine the performance of the flexible LTE <b>PC</b> <b>tool</b> box and benchmark it against a utility optimal iterative scheme. We find that the open loop PC scheme of LTE performs well for cellular users both in terms of the used transmit power levels and the achieved signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution. However, the performance of the D 2 D users as well as the overall system throughput can be boosted by the utility optimal scheme, because the utility maximizing scheme takes better advantage of both the proximity and the reuse gains. Therefore, in this paper we propose a hybrid PC scheme, in which cellular users employ the open loop path compensation method of LTE, while D 2 D users use the utility optimizing distributed PC scheme. In order to protect the cellular layer, the hybrid scheme allows for limiting the interference caused by the D 2 D layer at the cost of having a small impact on the performance of the D 2 D layer. To ensure feasibility, we limit the number of iterations to a practically feasible level. We make the point that the hybrid scheme is not only near optimal, but it also allows for a distributed implementation for the D 2 D users, while preserving the LTE PC scheme for the cellular users.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Literature {{suggests}} that many palliative home care patients wish to die at home. This study investigated determinants of caregiver burden among palliative home care patients, with particular interest in its relationship with place-of-death. Previous research has examined how patient care, health conditions, and characteristics of informal support relate to caregiver burden or place of death in palliative home care. However, none of the existing literature {{has focused on the}} role of caregiver burden on place of death or congruency between the patients’ preferred vs. actual place of death. It seems likely that, in light of the high dependence on informal care during the last days of life, that caregiver burden plays a significant role in place of death. A number of factors may contribute to the incongruence between preferred versus actual place of death. For example, informal caregivers may lack the necessary skills and/or knowledge to provide adequate care to terminally ill loved ones. They may also be unable to cope with the type of care required by his or her loved one. Longitudinal studies indicating increasing home death rates among palliative home care patients. Research attributed the increased rate of home death to expanding home care programs rather than improving home care services. The goal {{of this study was to}} provide home care agencies the means to increase rates of home death among home care patients who wish to die at home by better directing existing types of services to lessen caregiver burden and improving congruency between preferred versus actual place-of-death. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the research was four fold. First, it validated the caregiver burden items in the interRAI Palliative Care (interRAI PC) with self-report caregiver scales. The second section examined the determinants of caregiver burden. The third section examined the determinants of place of death and congruency between preferred vs. actual place-of-death. The final section examined the role of caregiver burden and place-of-death. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study that employed the Caregiver Burden Scale, the Burden Inventory, and the interRAI <b>PC</b> <b>tool.</b> The sample included all palliative home care patients and their caregivers who received formal care from one Ontario community care access centre. Health information was collected by case managers during regular assessment intervals. RESULTS: The three interRAI PC items measuring caregiver burden are an adequate measure of subjective stress burden. The sum of these items can be used to construct a caregiver burden scale. Determinants of caregiver burden were limited to unstable health and higher levels of self-reported depression, anxiety, and anhedonia. Patients who preferred to die at home were more likely to suffer IADL impairment, but not ADL impairment, and they were more likely to have completed a do-not-hospitalize order or do-not-resuscitate order. Patients whose caregiver was not a spouse or child relative were less likely to prefer home death. Further analyses showed a high level of agreement between preferred versus actual place of death. Overall, 57 % of patients died at home, 68 % of those patients who wished to die at home had managed to do so. Determinants that increased the likelihood of home death included completion of a do-not-hospitalize order, preference to die at home, and excessive sleep. However, the presence of a caregiver who was unable to continue providing care decreased the likelihood of home death. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this study was to examine the role of caregiver burden in place of death among recipients of palliative home care. Studies such as this are important to the patients, caregivers, and the agencies that provide home care. Results of this study confirm many of the determinants of home death reported by earlier research. It is unique in that it identifies the caregiver’s ability to continue providing care as an important determinant of home death. These results support that notion that the needs of the caregiver should also be examined when determining the needs of the patient and that the patient and caregiver should be considered a unit of care. It also illustrates the important role of advanced directives, more specifically do-not-hospitalize orders, among patients receiving palliative home care...|$|E
