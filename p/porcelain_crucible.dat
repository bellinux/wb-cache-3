I endeavoured to {{experiment}} upon the oxide of lead obtained by fusion and ignition of the nitrate in a platina crucible, but found great difficulty, {{from the high}} temperature required for perfect fusion, and the powerful fluxing qualities of the substance. Green-glass tubes repeatedly failed. I at last fused the oxide in a small <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucible,</b> heated fully in a charcoal fire; and, as it is was essential that {{the evolution of the}} lead at the cathode should take place beneath the surface, the negative electrode was guarded by a green-glass tube, fused around it in such a manner as to expose only the knob of platina at the lower end (fig. 70.), so that it could be plunged beneath the surface, and thus exclude contact of air or oxygen with the lead reduced there. A platina wire was employed for the positive electrode, that metal not being subject to any action from the oxygen evolved against it. The arrangement is given in fig. 71.|$|E
50|$|For {{completely}} accurate results, {{the crucible}} is handled with clean tongs because fingerprints can add weighable mass to the crucible. Porcelain crucibles are hygroscopic, i. e. they absorb {{a bit of}} weighable moisture from the air. For this reason, the <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucible</b> and lid is also pre-fired (pre-heating to high temperature) to constant mass before the pre-weighing. This determines {{the mass of the}} completely dry crucible and lid. At least two firings, coolings, and weighings resulting in exactly the same mass are needed to confirm constant (completely dry) mass of the crucible and lid and similarly again for the crucible, lid, and sample residue inside. Since the mass of every crucible and lid is different, the pre-firing/pre-weighing must be done for every new crucible/lid used. The desiccator contains desiccant to absorb moisture from the air inside, so the air inside will be completely dry.|$|E

Dry ashing was used for destroying the organic matrix and a <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucible</b> was used as container. The recovery of copper in dry ashing and the leaching of copper from the internal glazing of a <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucible</b> were investigated. A complexing antioxidant buffer was used in order to minimise the interfering effect of iron(III) on the determination of copper(II).

The samples were collected in a liming experiment, with different base saturation levels, laid out in the field with planted erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil.), located at Pinhais County, Paraná State. The evaluated methods were as follows: Wet digestion with nitro-perchloric acid, dry ashing in <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles,</b> dry ashing in platinum crucibles, wet extraction (non digestion) with 1 mol/L HCl and wet extraction (non digestion) with 1 mol/L HCl+d (d=further 1 : 3 dilution of the extract). In the laboratory, the samples were ordered according a split plot design, being factor A, the five tested methodologies and as factor B, the different base saturation levels of the field. All tested variables presented statistical significance (P 0, 01) for variation source and methods. High solubilizations were achieved for most of the tested elements with the nitro-perchloric, dry ashing in <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles,</b> and both HCl wet extractions methods. The non digestion methods with HCl showed to be highly promising. High significance was observed for the correlation among methods for K, Mg and Al.

A glass system {{according}} to the molar formula (35 % mole SiO 2 - 40 % mole B 2 O 3 -(25 -x) Li 2 O), where x= 0, 1, 2 and 3 % mole Fe 2 O 3, was prepared by melting the pure powder chemicals at <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles</b> at 1200 Co for three hours until the homogenous glass was obtained. The samples were heat treated at 600 and 700 Co for 10 hours. The density, the molar volume, the electrical conductivity and magnetic properties were measured {{before and after the}} heat treatment. Replacing the lithium oxide with the iron oxide increases the density, the electrical and magnetic properties.

50|$|Crucibles {{and their}} covers {{are made of}} high temperature-resistant materials, usually porcelain, alumina or an inert metal. One of the {{earliest}} uses of platinum was to make crucibles. Ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and especially magnesia will tolerate the highest temperatures. More recently, metals such as nickel and zirconium have been used. The lids are typically loose-fitting to allow gases to escape during heating of a sample inside. Crucibles and their lids can come in high form and low form shapes and in various sizes, but rather small 10-15 ml size <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles</b> are commonly used for gravimetric chemical analysis. These small size crucibles and their covers made of porcelain are quite cheap when sold in quantity to laboratories, and the crucibles are sometimes disposed of after use in precise quantitative chemical analysis. There is usually a large mark-up when they are sold individually in hobby shops.|$|R
40|$|Glasses of {{the systems}} Bi 2 O 3 -SiO 2, Bi 2 O 3 -PbO-Ga 2 O 3, Bi 2 O 3 -PbO-Ga 2 O 3 -GeO 2 and Bi 2 O 3 -GeO 2 -Li 2 O have been {{prepared}} and the interaction of their melts with crucibles of different materials has been analytically determined. Silica and <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles</b> were very strongly corroded and the glass composition was noticeably altered. Instead platinum crucibles are not affected if the Bi 2 O 3 content is not too high. The color of the glasses changes in all cases from pale yellow to deep brown when the melting temperature reaches approximately 1000 °C. The higher the temperature and the Bi 2 O 3 content the darker the brown color, independently {{of the nature of}} the employed crucible. The addition of oxidizing ions (Sb 5 +, As 5 + or Ce 4 +) to the glass batch prevents darkening. Nanoparticles of elementary bismuth Bi 0 are observed by transmission electron microscopy in the glasses melted above 1000 °C. The partial thermoreduction of the Bi 2 O 3 during the heating of the glass melt is proposed as the mechanism responsible for the observed darkening. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the screening of serum samples for contamination with iodine. It is extremely rapid, obviates any cross-contamination problem, {{and is not}} influenced by the organic compounds of raw serum or filtrates. Studies indicate that the open-combustion technic is a reliable screening system for the handling of large numbersof samples. SEVERAL TESTS have been proposed for determining the gross contami-nation sometimes encountered in serums submitted for protein-bound iodine analysis (1 - 5). These screens are all l) ased {{on the use of}} the coupled Ce(IV-As(III)) reaction as a detection device. However, ceric ions in strong acid solution represent a powerful oxidation system for many organic compounds (6). There is, therefore, a good possibility that these compounds are capable of reducing Ce(IV) to give the ap-pearance of the presence of iodine. It is impossible to differentiate simple Ce(IV) reduction from the iodine catalyzed Ce(IV) and As (III) reaction by measurement of loss of Ce(IV) color alone. Our own experiences with several of these preliminary semiquantitative con-tamination-exclusion tests has indicated that too many samples were eliminated which subsequent analysis showed to be uncontaminated. We attempted to develop a simple procedure which would yield a re-liable screen test with an open-alkaline-combustion technic employing ordinary burners and <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles.</b> This extremely rapid proc-ess could be used to destroy the organic precipitate containing the iodine without apparent loss of the latter in the conversion to high melting potassium iodide. An important feature of such a system would be the ability to screen large numbers of samples without cros...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: This study {{researched}} {{on different}} physical and optical properties of Nd 3 + doped soda-lime-silicate glass. The glasses containing Nd 3 + in (65 -x) SiO 2 : 25 Na 2 O: 10 CaO: xNd 2 O 3 (where x = 0. 0 - 5. 0 mol%) {{had been prepared}} by melt-quenching method. The density and molar volume increase with increasing of Nd 2 O 3 concentration due to increasing of Non Bridging Oxygen (NBOs) in glass matrix. The optical spectra were measured and evaluated their optical band gap and found to decrease with increasing of Nd 2 O 3 concentration. Moreover, these {{results showed that the}} refractive index of glass does not only depend on the density but also depend on the electronic polarizability of the glass. The values of polarizability of oxide ions, theoretical optical basicity were also determined. Approach: This study investigated the effect of Nd 2 O 3 content on optical band gap, density, molar volume, optical basicity and polarizability in soda-lime silicate glass. Series of Nd 3 + doped soda-lime silicate glasses (in mol%) : (65 -x) SiO 2 - 25 Na 2 O- 10 CaO-xNd 2 O 3 (x = 1 - 5 mol%) were prepared by the normal melt-quenching technique.

This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analysis of the heat transfer during the melting process of a high-temperature (> 800 degrees C) phase-change material (PCM) encapsulated in a vertical cylindrical container. The energy contributions from radiation, natural convection, and conduction {{have been included in}} the mathematical model in order to capture most of the physics that describe and characterize the problem and quantify the role that each mechanism plays during the phase-change process. Numerical predictions based on the finite-volume method have been obtained by solving the mass, momentum, and energy conservation principles along with the enthalpy porosity method to track the liquid/solid interface. Experiments were conducted to obtain the temperature response of the thermal energy storage (TES) cell during the sensible heating and phase-change regions of the PCM. Continuous temperature measurements of <b>porcelain</b> <b>crucibles</b> filled with ACS grade NaCl were recorded. The temperature readings were recorded {{at the center of the}} sample and at the wall of the crucible as the samples were heated in a furnace over a temperature range of 700 - 850 degrees C. The numerical predictions have been validated by the experimental results, and the effect of the controlling parameters of the system on the melt fraction rate has been evaluated. The results showed that the natural convection is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. In all the experimental study cases, the measured temperature response captured the PCM melting trend with acceptable repeatability. The uncertainty analysis of the experimental data yielded an approximate error of 65. 81 degrees C. U. S.

In both multiple donor and depletion studies, fingermarks were split in two halves (by applying two porcelain crucibles) and each halve developed using nanocarbon and commercial black powder, respectively. Whole fingermarks deposited on clean surfaces were weathered/aged in hot air oven to simulate the environmental exposure within a shorter time frame.

40|$|Before 1782 {{little more}} than a ‘partial agglomer-ation ’ of {{platinum}} had been achieved, mainly by hot forging from the powder which, although it sufficed to make many platinum artefacts, did not produce homogeneous molten metal (1 – 3). The first to melt impure platinum may have been Henrik Theophil Scheffer (1710 – 1759) who in 1751 melted platinum with copper, and later arsenic, in a furnace (4). Franz Achard (1753 – 1821) similarly melted the metal with arsenic (5). In both cases alloys of platinum, rather than pure platinum, are likely to have been melted.
