5|$|The dog conch {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and {{seagrass}} beds on insular and continental shores. It usually <b>prefers</b> major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although {{this is not an}} absolute rule. L.canarium <b>prefers</b> areas of mixed seagrasses (with a predominance of Halophila), and also <b>prefers</b> sediment with high levels of organic matter. This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water to a depth of 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University, Psychology, 2009 This study {{explored}} Extraversion personality {{differences among}} people who <b>prefer</b> dogs, people who <b>prefer</b> cats, people who <b>prefer</b> both, and people who <b>prefer</b> neither. Participants were 120 students from the Psychology Department Participation Pool at Humboldt State University. Personality was evaluated using the NEO-PI-R Extraversion Scale. Also, participants were given a list of personality trait adjectives and asked to assign them to either people who <b>prefer</b> dogs or people who <b>prefer</b> cats. Results showed significant differences in Extraversion among the pet preference groups. People who <b>preferred</b> dogs scored higher than people who <b>preferred</b> cats on the overall domain of Extraversion and the facets Excitement-Seeking and Gregariousness. People who <b>preferred</b> dogs also scored higher than people who <b>preferred</b> both on Extraversion and the facets Warmth, Excitement-Seeking, and Gregariousness. Results also showed {{that there are certain}} personality traits that people tend to assign to those who <b>prefer</b> dogs vs. those who <b>prefer</b> cats. The top personality traits chosen for people who <b>prefer</b> dogs were Sociable, Friendly, Excitement-Seeking and High-Spirited. The top personality traits chosen for people who <b>prefer</b> cats were Quiet, Shy, and Independent. All of the traits predominantly chosen for people who <b>prefer</b> dogs were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring higher in Extraversion. All of the traits predominantly chosen for people who <b>prefer</b> cats were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring lower in Extraversion...|$|R

50|$|Assuming {{no option}} is <b>preferred</b> to itself i.e. the {{relation}} is irreflexive, a preference relation with a loop is not transitive.

Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is <b>preferred</b> to B and B is <b>preferred</b> to C, also A is <b>preferred</b> to C. But then, since C is <b>preferred</b> to A, also A is <b>preferred</b> to A.|$|R

5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house sparrow in {{temperate}} agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it <b>prefers</b> oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it <b>prefers</b> raw seeds. The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} visual {{preference and}} value for fresh beef steaks differing in marbling level and color, consumers in Chicago and San Francisco (n = 124 per city) evaluated {{two pairs of}} steaks in a retail case. Steaks differing in marbling level (Modest/Moderate vs. Slight) and color (bright, cherry-red vs. dark red) were purchased at retail stores in each city. Consumers selected their <b>preferred</b> steak in each pair, described their selection criteria, and provided the price {{they were willing to}} pay {{for each of the four}} steaks. There was a difference in visual preference in each city, with most consumers <b>preferring</b> (P < 0. 01) low (Slight) over high (Moderate/Modest) marbling; however, more (P < 0. 01) consumers in Chicago (86. 7 %) <b>preferred</b> low marbling than in San Francisco (67. 0 %). Selection criteria were categorized into five groups: marbling, fat, color, appearance, and palatability. Marbling was mentioned by 65. 4 % of consumers who <b>preferred</b> high marbling, whereas 64. 9 % of consumers who <b>preferred</b> low marbling mentioned fat as a selection criterion. Bright, cherry-red color was <b>preferred</b> by a higher (P < 0. 01) percentage of consumers in both Chicago and San Francisco (67. 6 and 76. 5 %, respectively). Color was mentioned both by consumers who <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color (64. 8 %) and those who <b>preferred</b> dark red color (63. 9 %). All preference groups were willing to pay more for their <b>preferred</b> steak (P < 0. 01), but consumers who <b>preferred</b> low marbling were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their <b>preferred</b> steak than consumers who <b>preferred</b> high marbling. Consumers who <b>preferred</b> bright, cherry-red color were willing to pay more (P < 0. 01) for their <b>preferred</b> steak than consumers who <b>preferred</b> dark red color. Consumers who <b>preferred</b> low marbling seemed to desire lean products, and consumers who <b>preferred</b> high marbling seemed to desire products with high eating quality. In this study, consumers were willing to pay more to purchase their <b>preferred</b> product; however, most consumers <b>preferred</b> low marbling and bright, cherry-red color...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>preferred</b> stock on the credit ratings {{assessed}} by professional credit analysts. <b>Preferred</b> stock inherently contains both features of debt and equity financing. Hence, the nature of <b>preferred</b> stock has presented a puzzle {{to the efforts of}} accounting regulators such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consistently classify within the existing framework established by financial reporting standards. I find evidence that the association of <b>preferred</b> stock with credit analysts' assessments of credit risk depends on two factors. First, the association of <b>preferred</b> stock with credit ratings varies by the type of <b>preferred</b> stock. <b>Preferred</b> stock that is redeemable is negatively associated with credit ratings, while nonredeemable <b>preferred</b> stock bears no consistent association with credit ratings. Second, the negative association of redeemable <b>preferred</b> stock with credit ratings is sensitive to the firm's financial condition. For those firms in poor financial health, the negative association dissipates. This is in line with <b>preferred</b> stock's inability to drive an insolvent firm into bankruptcy...|$|R
