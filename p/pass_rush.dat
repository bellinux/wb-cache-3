5|$|Youngblood {{played in}} 201 {{consecutive}} games, a Rams team record; he only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He was the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the recipient Dan Reeves award three times, which is {{awarded to the}} team's most valuable player. He had 151.5 career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmer's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> opportunities {{to make sure the}} opponent's running game was handled. His highest single-season sack total was 18 in 1979.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana {{completed}} 32 of 46 {{passes for}} 356 yards {{before leaving the}} game with an injury in the fourth quarter. The injury, {{similar to the one}} that ended Lee Roy Selmon's career, would require season-ending surgery and threaten Montana's football future. Steve DeBerg's 31-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Carter in the third quarter brought the Buccaneers to within a touchdown, but they would not score again. The 49ers' seven interceptions of DeBerg were a team record, and one short of the NFL record. DeBerg placed blame for the loss on himself, but teammates defended him, pointing out that he was under constant pressure from the 49ers' <b>pass</b> <b>rush.</b> Opposing safety Ronnie Lott said that DeBerg was predictable as to where he would throw the ball when pressured. James Wilder rushed for 81 yards and caught five passes. Selmon's number 63 was retired in a halftime ceremony.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E

5|$|In January 1962, Tittle stated his {{intention}} to retire following the 1962 season. After an off-season quarterback competition with Ralph Guglielmi, Tittle played and started in a career-high 14 games. He tied an NFL record by throwing seven touchdown passes in a game on October 28, 1962, in a 49–34 win over the Washington Redskins. Against the Dallas Cowboys {{in the regular season}} finale, Tittle threw six touchdown passes to set the single-season record with 33, which had been set the previous year by Sonny Jurgensen's 32. He earned player of the year honors from the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club, UPI, and The Sporting News, and finished just behind Green Bay's Jim Taylor in voting for the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award. The Giants again finished first in the Eastern Conference and faced the Packers in the 1962 NFL Championship Game. In frigid, windy conditions at Yankee Stadium and facing a constant <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> from the Packers' front seven, Tittle completed only 18 of his 41 attempts in the game. The Packers won, 16–7, with New York's lone score coming on a blocked punt recovered in the end zone by Jim Collier.|$|E
5|$|The Bears defense vastly {{improved}} {{in comparison to}} the previous two seasons; after allowing the two most points in franchise history in 2013 (478) and 2014 (442), the 2015 defense allowed 397, which ranked 20th in the league. The defense gained 26 places in the pass defense category to end the season fourth in the ranking. While the unit also allowed only 225 passing yards per game, the number is skewed due to opposing offenses' frequency to run the ball; Bears opponents passed 512, the fourth-least in the NFL. Yardage-wise, the defense allowed an average of 345.1, gaining 16 spots to finish 14th. Statistically, the Bears allowed 7.5 yards per pass and a 62.9 completion percentage, 20th- and 14th-ranked in the league, respectively. The pass defense also allowed a passer rating of 99.2 passer rating (26th), 31 touchdowns (25th), while recording only eight interceptions, the second-least in the NFL. In total, the Bears forced only 17 turnovers (28th-ranked), failing to record one in seven games, and twice in only two games. In the red zone, the Bears allowed 27 touchdowns and 14 field goals on 45 attempts (60 percent), which ranked 21st in the league. Meanwhile, the <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> recorded 35 sacks (22nd in the NFL), 20 of which occurred in the last seven games of the year, the seventh-most in the league.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the Bears {{traveled}} to Lambeau Field {{to play the}} Green Bay Packers in the 189th meeting between the two rivals. The Bears had struggled regarding scoring against Green Bay in the last nine games between the two prior to 2013, and including the 2010 NFC title game, had scored 127 points, an average of 14.11 points. The two teams entered with among the top three scoring offenses, with Chicago and Green Bay ranked second and third, respectively, with 30.4 and 30.3 points per game, both of which rank behind the Denver Broncos. Among the weapons of the Packers offense that the Bears must attempt to hinder was the running game, as Green Bay's rookie running back Eddie Lacy has recorded over 100 yards per game in the previous six during the season, along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers. One of Rodgers' skills is passing balls longer than 20 yards, and was 16 of 32 on these attempts, which was tied with Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks for the highest percentage in the league; the Bears allowed 57 percent of opponents to throw for the aforementioned distance, the second-worst score in the NFL. However, both teams ranked in the bottom five in the NFL in <b>pass</b> <b>rush,</b> with the Bears being in last with only nine sacks. For Chicago, Matt Forté had gained 533 yards along with averaging 4.6 yards per run, while Josh McCown filled in for Jay Cutler. Since 2009, Bears quarterbacks besides Cutler had thrown a combined eight touchdowns and 21 interceptions against the Packers; in McCown's last start in 2011 against the Packers, he threw for 242 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions in a 35–21 losing effort.|$|E

5|$|The Chiefs won the toss and {{deferred}} {{until the}} second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points {{late in the first}} quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17–3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} season, the Bears visited Kansas City, who trailed the Bears 5–6 in the all-time series; the game {{was the first in}} Kansas City since 2003, which the Chiefs won 31–3. Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be {{cautious}} of Bob Sutton's 3–4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive.|$|E
25|$|In {{two games}} against Tampa Bay, Vick has {{completed}} just 16 passes for 162 yards, one touchdown and one interception. On October six, Vick completed just four of 12 passes for 37 yards before sustaining an injured shoulder on a third-down Simeon Rice sack. He was hit hard several times on this Sunday as well, as the Bucs’ <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> was relentless, but {{never left the}} game.|$|E
50|$|The 3-4 {{also has}} {{two types of}} OLBs. The Joker, Jack, Buck, or Elephant is usually the primary <b>pass</b> <b>rusher.</b> Depending on the scheme, the Joker can be {{on either side of}} the {{defensive}} formation. He must be an excellent <b>pass</b> <b>rusher,</b> and has to be able to beat both stronger right tackles and rangier left tackles off the edge of the formation. The other 3-4 OLB, The Sam, does not have a specific designation. Like a Sam linebacker in a 4-3 scheme, the other 3-4 OLB must be able to cover, blitz, and play the run.|$|R
50|$|To date, Tracy is {{the only}} player to ever score 4 or more <b>passing,</b> <b>rushing</b> and {{receiving}} touchdowns in a single NFL season, having done so in 1960 {{as a member of}} the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|R
50|$|Dean {{was also}} a key player on the 49ers 1984 Super Bowl team, mostly used as a {{situational}} <b>pass</b> <b>rusher.</b> During the 1984 season, Dean was reunited with his Charger teammates, Johnson, Kelcher and Billy Shields.|$|R
25|$|The Chargers {{had three}} {{turnovers}} and, perhaps more embarrassing, gave up three sacks to the NFL's worst <b>pass</b> <b>rush.</b> Tamba Hali had two sacks and caused two fumbles for a Chiefs defense that hadn't gotten a sack since playing San Diego four games ago. The three sacks pushed Kansas City's season total to a league-low nine, and the Chiefs need five {{in their last}} two games to avoid tying the NFL record for fewest in a season. Five of the sacks from the season have come against San Diego.|$|E
25|$|Jeb Blount {{inspired}} teammates with {{a courageous}} {{performance in the}} face of a strong San Francisco <b>pass</b> <b>rush,</b> despite that he was named the starter only two days previously. Wilbur Jackson and Delvin Williams each ran for a touchdown, and Ray Wersching kicked a pair of field goals to give the San Francisco 49ers a lead that the Buccaneers would not overcome. The Buccaneers rallied in the fourth quarter. Blount led a drive that ended with a 5-yard Louis Carter touchdown run, and was followed by an onside kick which the Buccaneers recovered. Dave Green threw a 45-yard completion to Danny Reece on a fake punt, but the offense stalled at San Francisco's 1-yard line.|$|E
25|$|In the offseason, the Seahawks {{looked to}} bolster their <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> through free agency, signing DL Michael Bennett from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Cliff Avril of the Detroit Lions. They also {{acquired}} WR Percy Harvin in a trade with the Minnesota Vikings for Seattle's first-round draft pick in the 2013 draft. Despite not having a first-round pick, the Seahawks managed to make 11 picks in the draft, including RB Christine Michael in the 2nd round, TE Luke Willson in the 5th round, and OT Michael Bowie in the 7th round. Departures included RB Leon Washington who was released in the offseason, and FB Michael Robinson who was cut during training camp, but {{would return to the}} team after injuries to Derrick Coleman and Spencer Ware.|$|E

25|$|Newly {{acquired}} Packers receiver John Jefferson fell on {{his rear}} end while showing off for the crowd during pregame introductions, a display that inspired the Buccaneer defense. After the Packers took an early 7–0 lead on a Gerry Ellis touchdown run, the Buccaneers scored 21 unanswered points. Doug Williams completed 15 of 23 passes for 199 yards, a career-best 65.2% completion percentage. Green Bay attempted a late rally, as George Cumby's 68-yard return of a James Wilder goal-line fumble set up a field goal to bring the score to 21–10. After the Buccaneers were forced to punt on the following possession, the Packers drove {{all the way to}} the Tampa Bay 7-yard line before Scot Brantley intercepted a Lynn Dickey pass to kill the drive. Dickey, under the pressure of a constant <b>pass</b> <b>rush,</b> was also intercepted by Hugh Green, Cecil Johnson, and Neal Colzie.|$|E
25|$|LSU took a 7–3 lead in {{the third}} quarter when Rabb threw a nine-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Robinson that capped a 67-yard drive. Cannon then scored on a 12-yard touchdown run to his right in the fourth quarter. Down by ten and the game winding down, Alabama turned to its passing game but were unable to find success. LSU's <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> did not give Alabama quarterback Bobby Smith any time to throw the ball. The Tide completed three passes in the game for a net of zero yards. In total, LSU compiled 253 yards of offense in the game to Alabama's 100. Billy Cannon was the game's leading rusher with 86 yards and a touchdown on twelve carries. The victory over Bryant proved to be a rare one for LSU, as the Tigers won only three more games against Alabama in the next 24 seasons.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive of the game, a heavy <b>pass</b> <b>rush</b> by Oilers {{defensive}} tackle Glenn Montgomery caused Montana {{to throw a}} rushed pass that was intercepted by Steve Jackson, who returned it 14 yards to the Chiefs 23-yard line. Houston went three-and-out, including Lewis' 9-yard sack of Moon on third down, but Al Del Greco kicked a 49-yard field goal {{to put them on}} the board. Then after forcing a punt, Moon led the Oilers 80 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed just 6:37, starting if off with a 16-yard completion to Gary Wellman and later completing a 30-yard pass to Wellman deep in Chiefs territory. Once inside the red zone, Moon threw an incompletion on third down, but Thomas was penalized for being offsides, and Moon threw a first down completion to Haywood Jeffires at the 2-yard line on the next play. Running back Gary Brown took the ball into the end zone from there, increasing Houston's lead to 10–0.|$|E
