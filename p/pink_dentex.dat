40|$|This work {{describes}} and {{identifies the}} macroscopic, and corresponding microscopic, changes of gonads through the annual reproductive cycle of <b>pink</b> <b>dentex,</b> Dentex gibbosus, from the Madeira Archipelago. This new contribution focused on validating a macroscopic maturity scale for this species using a histological technique. A total of 906 individuals {{were collected from}} waters around the Madeira Archipelago between September 1997 and December 2008. A six-stage maturity scale based on macroscopic characteristics was used to classify the gonads. The overall ratio of males to females was 1 : 1. 12. The annual gonad development, together with the analysis of monthly indices (gonadosomatic and hepatoso-matic) and complementary histological observations allowed us to conclude that spawning takes place during the summer months, with a peak in May-June...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 146 {{otoliths}} were extracted for age readings from 68 females (23. 2 - 90. 1 cm TL), 76 males (22. 0 - 81. 3 cm TL) and 2 undetermined (30. 3 - 38. 0 cm TL), between April 2004 and December 2007. The maximum age obtained from whole otoliths was 11 years. Differences {{in the growth}} rhythms were observed between the sexes (females: L∞= 134. 4, K= 0. 092 and t 0 =− 0. 406; males: L∞= 135. 9, K= 0. 078 and t 0 =− 0. 894; and all fish were: L∞= 149. 8, K= 0. 078 and t 0 =− 0. 784). <b>Pink</b> <b>dentex</b> attain 50 % of their maximum theoretical length during their fourth year of life. The weight-length relationship (W = q Lfb) were determined separately for each sex and for all fish: for females q= 0. 01094 and b= 3. 033, for males q= 0. 10002 and b= 3. 047 and for all, q= 0. 01027 and b= 3. 046. According to the F-test, {{there were no significant}} differences between the weight-length relations obtained for females and males (F-test, F= 2. 2526, p= 0. 06646) ...|$|E
