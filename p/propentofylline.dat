40|$|Neuropathic pain is an {{intractable}} clinical problem. Drug treatments such as tramadol {{have been}} reported to effectively decrease neuropathic pain by inhibiting the activity of nociceptive neurons. It has also been reported that modulating glial activation could also prevent or reverse neuropathic pain via the administration of a glial modulator or inhibitor, such as <b>propentofylline.</b> Thus far, there has been no clinical strategy incorporating both neuronal and glial participation for treating neuropathic pain. Therefore, the present research study was designed to assess whether coadministration of tramadol and <b>propentofylline,</b> as neuronal and glial activation inhibitors, respectively, would exert a synergistic effect on the reduction of rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) -induced neuropathic pain. Rats underwent SNL surgery to induce neuropathic pain. Pain behavioral tests were conducted to ascertain the effect of drugs on SNL-induced mechanical allodynia with von-Frey hairs. Proinflammatory factor interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) expression was also detected by Real-time RT-PCR. Intrathecal tramadol and <b>propentofylline</b> administered alone relieved SNL-induced mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Tramadol and <b>propentofylline</b> coadministration exerted a more potent effect in a synergistic and dose dependent manner than the intrathecal administration of either drug alone. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated IL- 1 b up-expression in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn after the lesion, which was significantly decreased by tramadol and <b>propentofylline</b> coadministration.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Propentofylline</b> is a {{xanthine}} derivative that depresses {{activation of}} glial cells, whose responses contribute to neural tissue damage during inflammation. Ethidium bromide injection {{into the central}} nervous system induces local oligodendroglial and astrocytic loss, resulting in primary demyelination, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Surviving astrocytes present a vigorous reaction around the injury site with increased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>propentofylline</b> administration on astrocytic response following gliotoxic injury. Method Wistar rats were injected with ethidium bromide into the cisterna pontis and treated or not with <b>propentofylline</b> (12. 5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal) during the experimental period. Brainstem sections were collected from 15 to 31 days after gliotoxic injection and processed for GFAP immunohistochemistry.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} common and {{aggressive}} primary brain cancer, with a median survival of less than 2 years after diagnosis with current available therapies. The tumor microenvironment serves a critical role in tumor invasion and progression, with microglia as a critical player. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that <b>propentofylline,</b> an atypical methylxanthine with central nervous system glial modulating and anti-inflammatory actions, significantly decreases tumor growth in a GBM rodent model by preferentially targeting microglia. In the present study, we used the CNS- 1 rat glioma model to elucidate the mechanisms of <b>propentofylline.</b> Here we demonstrate that <b>propentofylline</b> targets TROY, a novel signaling molecule up-regulated in infiltrating microglia, and not macrophages, in response to CNS- 1 cells. We identify Pyk 2, Rac 1 and pJNK as the downstream signaling molecules of TROY through western blot analysis and siRNA transfection. We demonstrate that inhibition of TROY expression in microglia by siRNA transfection significantly inhibits microglial migration towards CNS- 1 cells similar to 10 µM <b>propentofylline</b> treatment. These results identify TROY as a novel molecule expressed in microglia, involved in their migration and targeted by <b>propentofylline.</b> Furthermore, these results describe a signaling molecule that is differentially expressed between microglia and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment...|$|E

Aware of the efficacy limits of existing antidepressant drugs and the potential anti-inflammatory properties of <b>propentofylline,</b> we sought {{to evaluate the use}} of <b>propentofylline</b> as a depression treatment. We used a rat model of depression induced by repetitive lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administrations. We have studied sickness behavior, by assessing daily body weight, open field behavior, and TNF-α plasmatic levels. Anxiety-like behavior (light-dark test), depressive-like behavior (forced swim test), plasmatic levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, depression biomarker), and central glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression (an astrocyte biomarker) were also evaluated. LPS induced body weight loss, open field behavior impairments (decreased locomotion and rearing, and increased immobility), and increased TNF-α levels in rats, compared with control group. Thus, LPS induced sickness behavior. LPS also increased the immobility and reduced climbing in the forced swim test, when compared with the control group, i. e., LPS induced depressive-like behavior in rats. <b>Propentofylline</b> prevented sickness behavior after four days of consecutive treatment, as well as prevented the depressive-like behavior after five days of consecutive treatments. <b>Propentofylline</b> also prevented the increase in GFAP expression induced by LPS. Neither LPS nor <b>propentofylline</b> has influenced the anxiety and BDNF levels of rats. In conclusion, repetitive LPS administrations induced sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior in rats. <b>Propentofylline</b> prevented both sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior via neuroinflammatory pathway.

40|$|AbstractThe {{toxicity}} {{of the five}} methylxanthine derivatives, caffeine, pentoxifylline, A 802710, <b>propentofylline</b> and A 802715, was determined against the two human melanoma lines, Be 11 and MeWo, and against the two human squamous cell carcinoma lines, 4197 and 4451, by vital dye staining assay. Pentoxifylline and A 802710 emerge as the least toxic showing TD 50 (toxic dose of 50 %) levels of 3. 0 – 4. 0 mM. <b>Propentofylline</b> and caffeine take an intermediate position. A 802715 has a TD 50 of 0. 9 – 1. 1 mM and is the most toxic. Subtoxic concentrations (<TD 50) added after irradiation at maximum expression of the G 2 /M block show that pentoxifylline and A 802710 effectively abrogate the G 2 /M block, whereas A 802715 and <b>propentofylline</b> prolong the G 2 /M block or remain ineffective depending on the p 53 status of the cell line. In p 53 wt cells BrdU incorporations show that the irradiation-induced suppression of S-phase entry is marginally enhanced by pentoxifylline but strongly enhanced by <b>propentofylline</b> and A 802715. This effect was not seen in p 53 mutant cells. Since <b>propentofylline</b> and A 802715 prolong the G 2 /M block and effectively suppress BrdU incorporation these two drugs emerge as antagonists to pentoxifylline, caffeine and A 802710. Common structural features of <b>propentofylline</b> and A 802715 are a propyl substituent at the N 7 position in contrast to pentoxifylline, caffeine and A 802710 where the N 7 substituent is a methyl group.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that prolonged morphine treatment in vivo induces the translocation of delta opioid receptors (δORs) from intracellular compartments to neuronal plasma membranes and this trafficking event is correlated with an increased functional competence of the receptor. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown; however chronic morphine treatment has been shown to involve the activation and hypertrophy of spinal glial cells. In the present study we have examined whether activated glia may be associated with the enhanced δOR-mediated antinociception observed following prolonged morphine treatment. Accordingly, animals were treated with morphine with or without concomitant administration of <b>propentofylline,</b> an inhibitor of glial activation that was previously shown to block the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance. The morphine regimen previously demonstrated to initiate δOR trafficking induced the activation of both astrocytes and microglia in the dorsal spinal cord as indicated by a significant increase in cell volume and cell surface area. Consistent with previous data, morphine-treated rats displayed a significant augmentation in δOR-mediated antinociception. Concomitant spinal administration of <b>propentofylline</b> with morphine significantly attenuated the spinal immune response as well as the morphine-induced enhancement of δOR-mediated effects. These results complement previous reports that glial activation contributes to a state of opioid analgesic tolerance, and also suggest that neuro-glial communication is likely responsible in part for the altered functional competence in δOR-mediated effects following morphine treatment...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{plasticity}} {{within the}} spinal nociceptive network may be {{fundamental to the}} chronic nature of neuropathic pain. In the present study, the spatiotemporal expression of growth-associated protein- 43 (GAP- 43), a protein which has been traditionally implicated in nerve fiber growth and sprouting, was investigated in relation to mechanical pain hypersensitivity. An L 5 spinal nerve transection model was validated {{by the presence of}} mechanical pain hypersensitivity and an increase in the early neuronal activation marker cFos within the superficial spinal dorsal horn upon innocuous hindpaw stimulation. Spinal GAP- 43 was found to be upregulated in the superficial L 5 dorsal horn from 5 up to 10 days after injury. GAP- 43 was co-localized with calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), but not vesicular glutamate transporter- 1 (VGLUT- 1), IB 4, or protein kinase-γ (PKC-γ), suggesting the regulation of GAP- 43 in peptidergic nociceptive afferents. These GAP- 43 /CGRP fibers may be indicative of sprouting peptidergic fibers. Fiber sprouting largely depends on growth factors, which are typically associated with neuro-inflammatory processes. The putative role of neuropathy-induced GAP- 43 expression in the development of mechanical pain hypersensitivity was investigated using the immune modulator <b>propentofylline.</b> <b>Propentofylline</b> treatment strongly attenuated the development of mechanical pain hypersensitivity and glial responses to nerve injury as measured by microglial and astroglial markers, but did not affect neuropathy-induced levels of spinal GAP- 43 or GAP- 43 regulation in CGRP fibers. We conclude that nerve injury induces structural plasticity in fibers expressing CGRP, which is regarded as a main player in central sensitization. Our data do not, however, support a major role of these structural changes in the onset of mechanical pain hypersensitivity...|$|E

40|$|Pain, {{especially}} chronic pain, {{is a major}} clinical problem. Pain {{therapy has}} proven to be complicated and the results are often unsatisfactory. Despite many years of research, the number of available pain therapeutics remains relatively small. The available therapeutics are often not efficient enough and associated with adverse effects, which may be problematic when treating pain both in the short and long term. In order to develop new and improved pain therapeutics the identification of novel pharmaceutical drug targets is of crucial importance. This thesis investigates the protein mTOR as a new potential drug target to treat inflammatory pain. In addition, methodological approaches to obtain reliable in vitro spinal astrocyte cell cultures were studied. To determine whether spinal mTOR plays a role in inflammatory pain processing, activation of spinal mTOR in rats was measured following the induction of a peripheral inflammation. An increased activation of the mTOR pathway was seen in spinal dorsal horn neurons following injection of carrageenan into the hindpaw. Inhibition of spinal mTOR with rapamycin resulted dose-dependently in decreased nociceptive behavior, further supporting a role for mTOR in inflammatory pain signaling. In vitro model systems are important tools to study cellular signaling events. In order to obtain reliable cell cultures from rodent tissue with properties similar to human tissue cultures, the culture conditions are of vital importance. Using a variety of specific markers to identify astrocytes, the culture conditions were studied in astrocyte cultures generated from spinal cord samples taken from human tissue, as well as two genetically different rat substrains. Culturing rat astrocytes in medium optimized for astrocytes, results in lower contamination and cells with a more astrocyte-like phenotype. In addition, the choice of rat substrain can also affect the characteristics of the cultured astrocytes. Microglia and astrocytes have received much attention in central pain processing research. Preclinical studies have demonstrated an important role for these cells in pain signaling. To examine the possible role of mTOR in astrocyte activation, two glia inhibitors, the methyl xanthines pentoxifylline and <b>propentofylline,</b> were used. Both substances inhibited astrocyte activation in vitro as demonstrated by reduced astrocyte proliferation and growth, and an altered morphology. Further, pentoxifylline and <b>propentofylline</b> counteracted TNF-induced mTOR activation in cultured astrocytes but did not affect EGF-induced mTOR activation. These data suggest that pentoxifylline and <b>propentofylline</b> act in an mTOR- and stimulus-dependent fashion to inhibit astrocyte activation. In addition to targeting mTOR directly, pharmacological interference with factors associated with mTOR signaling, that can indirectly regulate activation of mTOR and other signaling pathways may prove useful as potential drug targets. One such factor that may be linked to mTOR regulation is caveolin- 1, a protein that can act as a regulatory factor in several disease states. Although the importance of caveolin- 1 in pain signaling is not yet clarified, links to TNF signaling indicated in the present thesis, suggest a possible role in inflammatory pain processing and further studies are required to determine if caveolin- 1 is an important regulator of mTOR signaling. As a whole, this thesis provides insight into the role of mTOR in spinal pain processing. Further studies of the molecular function of mTOR in neurons and glial cells in the dorsal horn may provide a basis for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory pain...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} family physicians in the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. To provide an update on the diagnostic workup of people with suspected dementia and on the pharmacologic management of cognitive impairment and disease progression in AD. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE and Psychological Abstracts were searched using the terms "cognitive enhancers" or a specific drug name and "dementia (exp). " Evidence is generally limited but promising. Methodologic flaws in existing research likely to affect clinicians are briefly reviewed. MAIN MESSAGE: Increasing evidence suggests that early intervention can delay the progression of AD and improve the symptoms and function of those affected. Available treatments have modest but important effects on the outcome of patients with AD; some patients respond dramatically. Most currently available treatments are relatively safe in carefully selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic workup of most cases of dementia can at least be initiated in family physicians' offices. Beginning the workup is important because, for treating AD, the earlier you start, the better.

40|$|Activation of {{intracellular}} signaling pathways involving p 38 and p 42 / 44 MAP kinases {{may contribute}} importantly to synaptic plasticity underlying spinal neuronal sensitization. Inhibitors of p 38 or p 42 / 44 pathways moderately attenuated responses of dorsal horn neurons evoked by mustard oil but not brush and alleviated the behavioral reflex sensitization seen following nerve injury. Activation of p 38 and p 42 / 44 MAP kinases in spinal cord ipsilateral to constriction injury was reduced by antagonists of NMDA, VPAC 2 and NK 2 (but not related) receptors, the glial inhibitor <b>propentofylline</b> and inhibitors of TNF-α. A VPAC 2 receptor agonist enhanced p 38 phosphorylation and caused behavioral reflex sensitization in naïve animals {{that could be}} blocked by co-administration of p 38 inhibitor. Conversely, an NK 2 receptor agonist activated p 42 / 44 and caused behavioral sensitization that could be prevented by co-administration of p 42 / 44 inhibitor.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} neuromodulator adenosine is neuroprotective against damage {{induced by}} cerebral ischemia. Its vasodilator effects add to its suitability {{as a possible}} anti-stroke agent, but also account for unwanted side effects following systemic administration of adenosine receptor agonists. ATP breakdown during ischemia produces adenosine which effluxes out of the neuron. This review will focus on endogenously produced adenosine and its subsequent protection against ischemia-induced neuronal damage in some stroke models, but will also highlight possible disadvantages to increasing adenosine concentrations. In the advantages column, therapeutic benefits have been obtained by enhancing synaptic concentrations of endogenous adenosine using the adenosine uptake inhibitor <b>propentofylline,</b> but not dipyridamole. There is an emerging role for endogenous adenosine in preventing delayed cell death, e. g. following hypoxic pre-conditioning. One of the cons associated with enhancing the synaptic concentration of adenosine is the appearance of adenosine receptor desensitization over time. Thus, there is a therapeutic window of opportunity during which activation of an adenosine A 1 receptor is beneficial to an ischemic neuron.

A 37 -year-old, nulliparous, female Eurasian brown bear hosted at the Falconara Parco Zoo in Italy, showed neurological clinical signs including bilateral blindness {{and signs of}} hemiparesis involving both limbs of the left side. A therapy based on fluid, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, ranitidine, ceftriaxone, <b>propentofylline,</b> and a vitamin B complex administration was started after the onset of sintomatology.

Because of the scattered distribution pattern of neoplastic nodules, the involvement of the brain and lombo-aortic lymph node was considered to be metastatic. Only few reports of neoplasms in Ursidae can be found in scientific literature and these include lymphosarcoma, osteoma, osteosarcomas, chondrosarcoma, squamous cell, biliary, thyroid, mammary, and hepatocellular carcinomas.

Transient forebrain ischemia was produced in 81 Mongolian gerbils by occluding both carotid arteries. The necessary surgery was performed under anesthesia with intraperitoneal pentobarbital/ chloral hydrate 2 days before occlusion. We tested the parameters delayed selective hippo-campal nerve cell damage, generation of seizures, and survival. Determination of the dose-response relation revealed the optimal dose of HWA 285 to be 10 mg/kg i. p.

In the absence of PPF, acute ischaemia led to a decrease in energy-rich phosphates in parietotemporal cortex and hippocampus which correlated with an increase in AMP and adenosine concentrations measured by high-performance liquid chromatography technique. The concentrations of cortical cytokines TNFα and IL 1 β were increased 12 and 19 fold, respectively. PPF had a neuroprotective action after 20 [*]min of BCCAO, reducing the deleterious effect of acute ischaemia on rat brain energy state and microglial reaction. Simultaneously, PPF treatment increased cyclic-AMP 3 fold. Three weeks of permanent BCCAO did not significantly disturb brain energy metabolism, microglial reaction or histopathology. However, a significant reduction of 30 [*]–[*] 50 % in rat memory capacities and a locomotor hyperactivity were obtained. Continuous PPF-application, however, led to a marked increase in rat working memory and to reduced locomotor activity, which were returned nearly to control levels by 1 week after permanent BCCAO. In summary, PPF showed a clear neuroprotective effect on cerebral energy state and pro-inflammatory cytokines under conditions of acute global ischaemia. Continuous administration of PPF led to memory improvement during permanent BCCAO.

40|$|Some {{anti-inflammatory}} medications reduce {{alcohol consumption}} in rodent models. Inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) increases cAMP and reduces inflammatory signaling. Rolipram, an inhibitor of PDE 4, markedly reduced ethanol intake and preference in mice and reduced ethanol seeking and consumption in alcohol-preferring fawn-hooded rats (Hu et al., 2011;Wen et al., 2012). To determine if these effects were specific for PDE 4, we compared nine PDE inhibitors with different subtype selectivity: <b>propentofylline</b> (nonspecific), vinpocetine (PDE 1), olprinone, milrinone (PDE 3), zaprinast (PDE 5), rolipram, mesopram, piclamilast, and CDP 840 (PDE 4). Alcohol intake {{was measured in}} C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice using 24 -hour two-bottle choice and two-bottle choice with limited (three-hour) access to alcohol. Only the selective PDE 4 inhibitors reduced ethanol intake and preference in the 24 -hour two-bottle choice test. For rolipram, piclamilast, and CDP 840, this effect was observed after the first 6 hours but not after the next 18 hours. Mesopram, however, produced a long-lasting reduction of ethanol intake and preference. In the limited access test, rolipram, piclamilast, and mesopram reduced ethanol consumption and total fluid intake and did not change preference for ethanol, whereas CDP 840 reduced both consumption and preference without altering total fluid intake. Our results provide novel evidence for a selective role of PDE 4 in regulating ethanol drinking in mice. We suggest that inhibition of PDE 4 may be an unexplored target for medication development to reduce excessive alcohol consumption...|$|E

In such experimental model, <b>propentofylline</b> (PPF) recently showed to improve myelin repair, probably due to its neuroprotective, antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of PPF administration in diabetic rats submitted to the EB-demyelinating model. Materials and methods Adult male rats, diabetic or not, received a single injection of 10 microlitres of 0. 1 % EB solution into the cisterna pontis. For induction of diabetes mellitus the streptozotocin-diabetogenic model was used (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal route &# 8211; IP). Some diabetic rats were treated with PPF (12. 5 mg/kg/day, IP route) during the experimental period. The animals were anesthetized and perfused from 7 to 31 days after EB injection and brainstem sections were collected for analysis of the lesions by light and transmission electron microscopy. Results Diabetic rats injected with EB showed larger amounts of myelin-derived membranes in the central areas of the lesions and considerable delay in the remyelinating process played by surviving oligodendrocytes and invading Schwann cells after the 15 th day. On the other hand, diabetic rats that received PPF presented lesions similar to those of non-diabetic animals, with rapid remyelination at the edges of the lesion site and fast clearance of myelin debris from the central area.

40|$|Abstract: Our {{recent studies}} {{indicate}} that the prototypic proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1 is upregulated in astroglial cells in the trigeminal interplolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition zone, a region of the spinal trigeminal complex involved in trigeminal pain processing, after masseter muscle inflammation. Here we investigated the effect of microinjection of IL- 1 into the Vi/Vc transition zone on orofacial nociception. The mechanical sensitivity of the orofacial site was assessed with von Frey microfilaments. The EF 50 values, defined as the von Frey filament force (g) that produces a 50 % response frequency, were derived and used {{as a measure of}} mechanical sensitivity. A significant reduction in EF 50 indicates the occurrence of mechanical hyperalgesia/allodynia. Unilateral intra-Vi/Vc IL- 1 (0. 016 - 160 fmol) produced hyperalgesia/allodynia dose-dependently, which appeared at bilateral facial sites. The hyperalgesia was detectable as early as 30 min and lasted for 2 - 6 h (n= 6, p< 0. 01). Intra-Vi/Vc pretreatment with an IL- 1 receptor antagonist (1 nmol) attenuated the IL- 1 -induced hyperalgesia (p< 0. 01). Pre-injection of AP- 5 (10 pmol) and MK- 801 (20 pmol), two NMDA receptor antagonists, significantly attenuated IL- 1 -induced hyperalgesia (p< 0. 05). Pretreatment with glial inhibitors fluorocitrate (120 pmol), minocycline (200 pmol) and <b>propentofylline</b> (10 pmol) did not attenuate IL- 1 -induced hyperalgesia. Excitotoxic lesions of the rostral ventromedial medulla with ibotenic acid (2 μg) abolished IL- 1 -induced contralateral hyperalgesia, suggesting a contribution of descending facilitatory drive. These results suggest that the IL- 1 -produced effect on nociception was downstream to glial activation and involves interaction with NMDA receptors...|$|E

C 57 BL/ 6 mice were subjected to different hypoxic preconditioning protocols: a single episode of HPC or five identical episodes at intervals of 3 days (E 3 d HPC) or 6 days (E 6 d HPC). Three days after the last hypoxic exposure, temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced. The effects of these HPC protocols on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) regulated gene mRNA expression were measured by quantitative PCR. Changes in extracellular adenosine concentrations, known to exert neuroprotective effects, were also measured using in vivo microdialysis and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Neuroprotection was provided by E 6 d HPC but not E 3 d HPC. HIF-regulated target gene expression increased significantly following all HPC protocols. However, E 3 d HPC significantly decreased extracellular adenosine and reduced cerebral blood flow in the ischemic region with upregulated expression of the adenosine transporter, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT 1). An ENT 1 inhibitor, <b>propentofylline</b> increased the cerebral blood flow and re-established neuroprotection in E 3 d HPC. Adenosine receptor specific antagonists showed that adenosine mainly through A 1 receptor mediates HPC induced neuroprotection. Our data indicate that cooperation of HIF-regulated genes and extracellular adenosine is necessary for HPC-induced neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundAn {{alarming}} {{portion of}} patients develop persistent or chronic pain following surgical procedures, but the mechanisms underlying {{the transition from}} acute to chronic pain states are not fully understood. In general, endocannabinoids (ECBs) inhibit nociceptive processing by stimulating cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB 1) and type 2 (CB 2). We have previously shown that intrathecal administration of a CB 2 receptor agonist reverses both surgical incision-induced behavioral hypersensitivity and associated over-expression of spinal glial markers. We therefore hypothesized that endocannabinoid signaling promotes the resolution of acute postoperative pain by modulating pro-inflammatory signaling in spinal cord glial cells. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis, rats receiving paw incision surgery were used {{as a model of}} acute postoperative pain that spontaneously resolves. We first characterized the concentration of ECBs and localization of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors in the spinal cord following paw incision. We then administered concomitant CB 1 and CB 2 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists (AM 281 and AM 630, 1 mg. kg− 1 each, i. p.) during the acute phase of paw incision-induced mechanical allodynia and evaluated the expression of glial cell markers and phosphorylated p 38 (a MAPK associated with inflammation) in the lumbar dorsal horn. Dual blockade of CB 1 and CB 2 receptor signaling prevented the resolution of postoperative allodynia and resulted in persistent over-expression of spinal Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP, an astrocytic marker) and phospho-p 38 in astrocytes. We provide evidence for the functional significance of these astrocytic changes by demonstrating that intrathecal administration of <b>propentofylline</b> (50 µg, i. t.) attenuated both persistent behavioral hypersensitivity and over-expression of GFAP and phospho-p 38 in antagonist-treated animals. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that endocannabinoid signaling via CB 1 and CB 2 receptors is necessary for the resolution of paw incision-induced behavioral hypersensitivity and for the limitation of pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes following surgical insult. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to enhance endocannabinoid signaling may prevent patients from developing persistent or chronic pain states following surgery...|$|E
