The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.|$|E
5|$|While AIB patrols {{continued}} {{to report that}} no Japanese troops were located in the Jacquinot Bay area, the Australian command decided that the landing there would be made by a combat-ready force protected by naval vessels. This was intended both as a precaution against a sudden Japanese offensive and to <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> experience for the units involved. The landing was designated Operation Battleaxe.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E

5|$|Smallpeice {{formally}} joined BOAC on 1 January 1950, {{taking the}} title and role of financial comptroller. The title reflected his intention to <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> financial information to managers within the company, allowing them to take informed decisions, rather than dictating what the company would be doing from head office. The financial comptroller position became a board position in 1953, and accordingly Smallpeice {{was appointed to the}} board. He would then be promoted to the additional position of deputy chief executive in June 1954.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer than a century. Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source. The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor was a white dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E

5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could <b>provide</b> <b>useful</b> music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E
