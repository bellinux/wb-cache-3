5|$|PADESM has had {{a lasting}} impact on {{political}} life in Madagascar. Philibert Tsiranana, leader of the PSD, {{went on to become}} Madagascar's first president upon independence in 1960. Many other major political figures in Madagascar have connections to PADESM and PSD, including former president Didier Ratsiraka and former prime minister Jacques Sylla. More broadly, the formation of PADESM cemented ethnic rivalries within Malagasy politics, linking the interests of specific ethnic groups with <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
5|$|The {{programming}} on C-SPAN3 from Monday through Friday features uninterrupted live {{public affairs}} events, in <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> events from Washington, D.C. Each weekend since January 8, 2011, {{the network has}} broadcast 48 hours of programming dedicated {{to the history of}} the United States, under the umbrella title American History TV. The programming covers the history of the U.S. from the founding of the nation through the late 20th century. Programs include American Artifacts, which is dedicated to exploring museums, archives and historical sites, and Lectures in History, featuring major university history professors giving lectures on U.S. history. In 2009, C-SPAN3 aired an eight-installment series of interviews from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, which featured historian Richard Norton Smith and Vice President Walter Mondale, among other interviewees.|$|E

25|$|In social psychology, {{attitudes are}} defined as learned, global {{evaluations}} of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action.

Political prophecy in this style remained popular for at least 400 years. It was subversive, and {{the figure of the}} prophetic Merlin was strongly identified with it.|$|E
25|$|The main Irish {{publications}} {{are often}} strongly {{identified with a}} political agenda.

25|$|Supporters of LGBT sex {{education}} argue that encompassing all gender and sexual identifications provides LGBT {{students with the}} health information pertinent to them, such as STD prevention for same-sex intimacy. Furthermore, these teachings could help prevent low self-esteem, depression, and bullying, as indicated through research. Opponents of LGBT-friendly {{sex education}} claim that teaching health topics in this way could be disrespectful to some religious beliefs and potentially inflict <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> views on students.|$|E

25|$|Told {{partly in}} flashback, {{it is the}} story of Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). Their {{differences}} are immense: she is a stridently vocal Marxist Jew with strong anti-war opinions, and he is a carefree WASP with no <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> bent. While attending the same college, she is drawn to him because of his boyish good looks and his natural writing skill, which she finds captivating, although he does not work very hard at it. He is intrigued by her conviction and her determination to persuade others to take up social causes. Their attraction is evident, but neither of them acts upon it, and they lose touch after graduation.|$|E

25|$|A {{large and}} active private press functioned {{throughout}} the country, {{and a large}} number of daily newspapers were licensed to publish. The transitional government required every newspaper to pay a $500 (265,000 Congolese francs) license fee and complete several administrative requirements before publishing. Many journalists lacked professional training, received little if any salary, and were vulnerable to manipulation by wealthy individuals, government officials, and politicians who provided cash or other benefits to encourage certain types of articles. While many newspapers remained critical of the transitional government, many showed bias toward it or <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> parties. Although there was no official newspaper, the government press agency published the Daily Bulletin, which included news reports, decrees, and official statements.|$|E
25|$|Many of the creoles {{known today}} {{arose in the}} last 500 years, {{as a result of}} the {{worldwide}} expansion of European maritime power and trade in the Age of Discovery, which led to extensive European colonial empires. Like most non-official and minority languages, creoles have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or dialects of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become extinct. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of creoles, both as living languages and as object of linguistic study. Some creoles have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> territories.|$|E
25|$|Political {{ideology}} is {{not found to}} be correlated with social class; however, a statistical relationship is seen between the level of one's educational attainment one's likelihood of subscribing to a <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> ideology. In terms of income, liberals tend to be tied with pro-business conservatives. Most mass affluent households tend to be more right-leaning on fiscal issues but more left-leaning on social issues. The majority, between 50% and 60%, of households with incomes above $50,000 overall, not all of whom are upper middle class, supported the Republican Party in the 2000, 2004, and 2006 elections. Nevertheless, those with postgraduate degrees overall statistically favour the Democratic Party. In 2005, 72% of surveyed full-time faculty members at four-year institutions, the majority of whom would be considered upper middle class, identified themselves as liberal.|$|E

50|$|An agrarian {{system is}} the dynamic set of {{economic}} and technological factors that affect agricultural practices.

25|$|Candidates {{for whom}} no {{party has been}} {{identified}} are classified as Non Partisan. The candidate might {{have been associated with}} a party or faction in Parliament or considered himself to belong to a <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> tradition. Political parties before the nineteenth century were not as cohesive or organised as they later became. Contemporary commentators (even the reputed leaders of parties or factions) in the eighteenth century did not necessarily agree who the party supporters were. The traditional parties, which had arisen in the late seventeenth century, became increasingly irrelevant to politics in the eighteenth century (particularly after 1760), although for some contests in some constituencies party labels were still used. It was only {{towards the end of the}} century that party labels began to acquire some meaning again, although this process was by no means complete for several more generations.|$|E
25|$|The {{authorization}} {{system was}} against Article 21 {{of the constitution}} that guarantees {{the freedom of speech}} and expression. Writing and publication of history textbook is a form of speech that is protected by the Constitution; however, the system of school textbook authorization as it was practiced in 1965 conducted thought control and prohibited publication and use of textbooks at schools that were deemed inappropriate according to a <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> ideology held by the government. According to Ienaga this falls under the category of censorship (検閲) that is prohibited by Section 2, Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan. Article 21 specifically prohibits censorship in an independent section because it is the principle of the democratic constitution of Japan that the people are guaranteed the opportunities to freely enjoy the results of scholastic researches, be exposed to all sorts of ideas and opinions, and know socio-political reality and historical truth through various media such as press, radio, and television.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism {{goes far beyond}} the issue of inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood {{in the sense of}} the 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any <b>particular</b> <b>political</b> ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. This, to him, inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, he emphasizes again and again that human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite beside the point, can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E
