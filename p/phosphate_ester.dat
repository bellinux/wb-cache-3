25|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> hydrolysis by TRAP {{is through a}} nucleophilic attack mechanism, whereby, catalysis occurs with the binding of a phosphate-substrate to the Fe2+ in the active site of TRAP. This is then followed by a nucleophilic attack by a hydroxide ligand on the bound phosphorus atom, resulting in cleavage of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> bond and production of an alcohol. The exact identity and {{mechanism of}} the hydroxide ligand is unclear, but it {{is thought to be}} either a hydroxide that bridges the metal ions within the active site or a terminal hydroxide bound to Fe3+, with conflicting reports for both mechanisms.|$|E

500|$|Eukaryotic cells feature {{compartmentalized}} membrane-bound organelles {{that carry}} out different biological functions. The glycerophospholipids {{are the main}} structural component of biological membranes, such as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles; in animal cells, the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid-derived [...] "tails" [...] by ester linkages and to one [...] "head" [...] group by a <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> linkage. While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes, other non-glyceride lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols (mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes) are also found in biological membranes. In plants and algae, the galactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae and certain bacteria.|$|E

2500|$|Flavoproteins {{were first}} {{discovered}} in 1879 by separating components of cow’s milk. [...] They were initially called lactochrome {{due to their}} milky origin and yellow pigment. It took 50 years for the scientific community to make any substantial progress in identifying the molecules responsible for the yellow pigment. [...] The 1930s launched the field of coenzyme research {{with the publication of}} many flavin and nicotinamide derivative structures and their obligate roles in redox catalysis. German scientists Warburg and Christian discovered a yeast derived yellow protein required for cellular respiration in 1932. [...] Their colleague Hugo Theorell separated this yellow enzyme into apoenzyme and yellow pigment and showed that neither the enzyme alone or the pigment was capable of oxidizing NADH on their own but mixing them together would restore activity. Theorell confirmed the pigment to be riboflavins <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester,</b> flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in 1937, which was the first direct evidence for enzyme cofactors. [...] Warburg and Christian then found FAD to be a cofactor of D-amino acid oxidase through similar experiments in 1938. Otto Warburg’s work with linking nicotinamide to hydride transfers and the discovery of flavins paved the way for many scientists in the 40s and 50s to discover copious amounts of redox biochemistry and link them together in pathways such as the citric acid cycle and ATP synthesis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMammalian {{glucokinase}} {{regulatory protein}} (GKRP), a fructose 6 -phosphate and fructose 1 -phosphate sensitive inhibitor of glucokinase (GK), {{appears to have}} resulted from the duplication of a gene similar to bacterial N-acetylmuramate 6 -phosphate etherase (MurQ). In the present work, we show that several genomes of primitive eukaryotes encode a GKRP-like protein with two MurQ repeats. Recombinant Haemophilus influenzae MurQ and the GKRP homologue of the amoebaflagellate Naegleria gruberi both behaved as excellent N-acetylmuramate 6 -phosphate etherases, with Kcat values (83 and 20 sec- 1) at least as high as that reported for Escherichia coli MurQ. By contrast, rat and xenopus GKRP displayed much lower etherase activities (Kcat = 0. 08 and 0. 05 sec- 1, respectively). The etherase activity of rat GKRP was inhibited by ligands (fructose 6 -phosphate, fructose 1 -phosphate, sorbitol 6 -phosphate) known to regulate its interaction with GK and by mutations affecting the binding of these <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters.</b> This indicated that these <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> all bind to a single regulatory site, which evolved from the original catalytic site. Sorbitol 6 -phosphate and other <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> also inhibited the etherase activity of xenopus GKRP, but did not affect its ability to inhibit GK. Thus, unlike what was previously thought, xenopus GKRP has a binding site for <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters,</b> but this site is uncoupled from the GK binding site. Taken together, these data indicate that duplication of the murQ gene led to a eukaryotic type etherase, which subsequently evolved to GKRP by acquiring a new binding specificity whilst losing most of its etherase activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to provide a}} means for separating and identifying <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> involved in glycolysis in higher plants. Paper chromatography of <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> has been employed by several workers, most notably Benson et at. (1) and Hanes and Isherwood (2). Benson’s procedures were not primarily designed for the identification of <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> and gave low Rp values for the phosphate compounds of particular interest to us. The unidimensional methods of Hanes and Isherwood do not result in adequate resolution of the complex mixtures such as are obtained from our plant materials. The present procedure is based on two-dimensional chromatography with successive development in an acid and in a basic solvent. The sol-vents finally selected gave the best over-all resolution of the intermediates involved in plant glycolysis. Undoubtedly the resolution of certain pairs of compounds may be improved by suitable modifications. We have in addition made certain improvements in the procedure for locating the chromatographed materials. EXPERIMENTAL Reagents and Materials-Acid solve&.

40|$|Fructose, {{sorbitol}} and D-glyceraldehyde {{stimulate the}} rate of glucose phosphorylation in isolated hepatocytes. This effect is mediated by fructose 1 -phosphate, which releases the inhibition exerted by a regulatory protein on liver glucokinase. In the presence of fructose 6 -phosphate, the regulatory protein binds to, and inhibits, liver glucokinase. Fructose 1 -phosphate antagonizes this inhibition by causing dissociation of the glucokinase-regulatory protein complex. Both <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> act by binding to the regulatory protein, and by presumably causing changes in its conformation. The regulatory protein behaves as a fully competitive inhibitor. It inhibits liver glucokinase from various species, and rat islet glucokinase, but {{has no effect on}} hexokinases from mammalian tissues or from yeast, or on glucokinase from microorganisms. Kinetic studies indicate that the regulatory protein binds to glucokinase at a site distinct from the catalytic site. Several <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters,</b> mainly polyol-phosphates, were found to mimick the effect of fructose 6 -phosphate. The most potent is sorbitol 6 -phosphate, suggesting that fructose 6 -phosphate is recognized by the regulatory protein in its open-chain configuration. Other <b>phosphate</b> <b>esters</b> and Pi have a fructose 1 -phosphate-like effect. The stimulatory effect of fructose on glucose phosphorylation is observed not only in isolated hepatocytes but also in the livers of anesthetized rats. This suggests that fructose could be a nutritional signal causing an increase in the hepatic glucose uptake...|$|R
