40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the relationship of managerial compensation to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. This study discusses the arguments that have made the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses an intuitively appealing concept within the broad agency literature, and, based on these arguments, conducts empirical tests aimed at determining whether managerial compensation does relate to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. ^ The most current means of studying the income-compensation relationship, the compensation coefficients, makes finding a good understanding of managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan loss reserves an important goal. The loan loss provision is hypothesized to be a function of loan quality and managerial compensation. If internal and external parties interested in bank performance and reporting better understand the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses, more efficient labor contracts can be written and financial performance and reporting should be improved. ^ The structure of the empirical tests flows from the argument that earnings management represents a cost to shareholders. This argument rests {{on the assumption that the}} <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses specifically plays a central role in managerial compensation at financial institutions. Recent work in agency theory is utilized to construct the setting in which the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses is tested for its ability to influence earnings. The empirical model constructed is a multiple regression equation with the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan loss as the dependent variable, and asset equity, income and compensation item as independent variables. ^ The empirical results show that the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses is much like the arguments would suggest. Although assets, equity and income are the dominant factors in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses, managerial compensation plays a role in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan losses. ...|$|R
