50|$|Electric heat tracing, heat tape or surface heating, is {{a system}} used to {{maintain}} or raise the temperature of pipes and vessels. Trace heating {{takes the form of}} an electrical heating element run in physical contact along the length of a pipe. The pipe must then be covered with thermal insulation to retain heat losses from the pipe. Heat generated by the element then maintains the temperature of the pipe. Trace heating may be used to <b>protect</b> <b>pipes</b> from freezing, to maintain a constant flow temperature in hot water systems, or to maintain process temperatures for piping that must transport substances that solidify at ambient temperatures. Electric trace heating cables are an alternative to steam trace heating where steam is not available or unwanted.|$|R

50|$|Technologies {{developed}} and improved by Mueller Co. and its subsidiaries throughout its history {{are used in}} and have improved infrastructures around the world. United States Patent #251726A was issued to Hieronymus Mueller in 1892 for a water pressure regulator.

Today, as many as 95 valves based on Mueller's original design are still used to protect the canal's system of locks. Pressure regulators are also considered vital components of plumbing and water infrastructure systems, as they are instrumental in <b>protecting</b> <b>pipes</b> from wear-and-tear caused by pressure fluctuations, preventing leaks caused by pressure that is too high, and protecting the drinking water supply by preventing contamination caused by untreated groundwater when pressure is too low.|$|R

40|$|On an {{increasingly}} crowded planet, shorebirds and humans are frequently found {{sharing the same}} ecosystems. This development requires that the managers of these human-wildlife ecosystems address human dimensions challenges {{in addition to those}} associated with species biology. To better understand such challenges, we evaluated impact perceptions and overall acceptance capacity in visitors on public beaches of Lake McConaughy, Nebraska, USA towards a federally- <b>protected</b> shorebird, the <b>Piping</b> Plover Charadrius melodus. Overall acceptance capacity for these birds was relatively high and perceptions of inconvenience caused by the presence of the birds were low. However, acceptance capacity and impact perceptions varied depending on whether the visitor supported, was neutral or opposed <b>protecting</b> <b>Piping</b> Plovers. Awareness of the presence of Piping Plovers was the most important variable associated with negative attitudes towards the birds; the more aware visitors were of the birds, the more negative were their attitudes. The specific type of recreational activity a visitor was engaged in was not associated with their impact perceptions or acceptance capacity. Our study serves as an important baseline which can be used to determine whether awareness, impact perceptions, and acceptance capacity at this site change as recreational use, efforts to protect the species, and educational and management practices evolve...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} optimal air vessel sizing tools, in <b>protecting</b> large <b>pipe</b> {{networks}} from undue transient pressures is well known. Graphical and other heuristic methods reported in literature {{are limited to}} sizing the air vessels for simple rising mains. Although {{attempts have been made}} to utilize optimization techniques, they have been largely unsuccessful due to their impractical computational requirements. This research work proposes a robust framework for developing surge protection design tools and demonstrates the usefulness of the framework through an example air vessel sizing tool. Efficiency and robustness of the proposed framework are demonstrated by developing a design aid for air vessel sizing for <b>protecting</b> large <b>pipe</b> network systems against excessive high pressures generated by rapid valve closures. The essence of the proposed framework is in identification of key transient response parameters influencing air vessel parameters from seemingly unmanageable transient response data. This parameterization helps in exploiting the similarity between transient responses of small pipe networks and sub-sections of large pipe networks. The framework employs an extensive knowledge-base of transient pressure and flow scenarios defined from several small network model...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} consisted in {{the investigation}} of the flame-sprayed layers and their suitability to <b>protect</b> <b>pipe</b> joints under building site conditions against corrosion. Furthermore, a technical equipment had to set up to ensure a reproducible coating process. Therefore, a device has been assembled that allows programmed coating sequences of sheets and pipe parts. An external powder feeder was constructed to transport the polymer powder to the spray gun for a stable and adjustable feeding process as well. In coordination with the feeding rate, the coating velocity and the number of single coating steps, the layer thickness can be varied. The mechanical investigation of sprayed layers revealed that lower tension strengths will be obtained compared to the non-sprayed material. Besides, a general impairment of the properties was measured, such as the decrease of the elongation after break and the raise of the young's modulus. Voids and interfaces between embedded particles within the layer as well as a higher surface roughness have been seen as the cause of these effects. Yet, comparisons between sprayed and non-sprayed sintered layers have shown that for equal void contents still different mechanical properties were measured. (orig.)

40|$|Protective coating {{corrosion}} {{failure is}} a complicated process that involves various phenomena which are hard to test for separately. An adequately <b>protected</b> <b>pipe</b> can be in service for a relatively long time without exhibiting any signs of corrosion failure, {{and then all of}} a sudden it corrodes over a short period of time. Failure will definitely happen if the interface between the pipe surface and its protective coating system is somehow compromised or exposed to the environment. While corrosion reactions have quite a bit of variability in terms of time, the situation is further complicated when corrosion is coupled with the protective coating mechanical failure. Similar to materials fracture, corrosion failures are governed by the laws of probability, where multiple variables control the ultimate outcome. The coating system needs to be adequately tested before placing it in service, so there is a strong need for a meaningful corrosion test. A typical test would incorporate exposing scratched coating surface to certain corrosive environments for a fixed amount of time, trying to simulate the real conditions as close as possible. Sometimes, a so-called “freeze ” step is introduced to “stress ” the coating prior to exposing it to the test environment, ultimately causing its failure. Due to the differences in thickness, elastic, thermal and adhesion properties, various coatings would exhibit different results when exposed to a fixed freeze temperature. One needs to understand the mechanics of the freeze in order to properly utilize it. This paper considers the coating delamination and fracture mechanics, including the freeze step mechanics in terms of the strain energy release rate, and coating sub-critical debonding. Thi...|$|R
