25|$|Although {{theories}} of intelligence {{have been discussed}} by philosophers since Plato, intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident {{with the development of}} that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single factor known as general intelligence, multiple factors (e.g., Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the Stanford-Binet IQ test and the WISC are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as gifted are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness.</b> In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality traits are also important, with people higher in conscientiousness and hope attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness,</b> auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E

Findings indicate that (1) phonological processing and RAN both account for significant amounts of unique variance in literacy attainment in all five orthographies.

2500|$|Literacy is {{communication}} in all forms such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing. [...] Literacy development begins in infancy {{and continues to}} mature into adulthood. Literacy {{plays an important role}} in the success of academic, social, and professional development. Literacy skills are not a prerequisite to utilizing a semantic compaction system, however this system can be used to promote the development of literacy skills. [...] Essential components of literacy development include <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness,</b> vocabulary development, phonics, word identification, and comprehension. [...] Semantic compaction is a rule driven system that supports the development of literacy through vocabulary development, morphology development, and comprehension. [...] In addition, the icons can be used to help teach <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness.</b> [...] For example, when teaching <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> and segmenting initial sounds the instructor will say a phoneme and visually present the phoneme at the same time. [...] Then the student will point to a picture that starts with that phoneme.

2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness,</b> {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] {{has no effect}} on {{implicit}} processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production. They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading). Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process. [...] Implicit knowledge involves <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness,</b> understanding of the morphology, and a semantic understanding of written words. This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production. Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics. For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a lexical decision task with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and phonics to process the words. Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology. These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud). They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level. This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from Expressive aphasia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> is an {{important}} determiner of success in learning to read and spell. For most children, strong readers have strong <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness,</b> and poor readers have poor <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> skills. <b>Phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> skills in the preschool and kindergarten years also strongly predict how well a child will read in the school years. In addition, interventions to improve <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> abilities lead to significantly improved reading abilities. <b>Phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> instruction improves reading and spelling skills, but the reverse is also true: literacy instruction improves <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> skills. The relationship between <b>phonological</b> <b>awareness</b> and reading abilities changes over time.
