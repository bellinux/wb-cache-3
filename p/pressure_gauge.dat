5|$|Most diving {{cylinders}} do {{not have}} a dedicated <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> but this is a standard feature on most diving regulators, and a requirement on all filling facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} pressure of a diving cylinder is measured at several stages during use. It is checked before filling, monitored during filling and checked when filling is completed. This {{can all be}} done with the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> on the filling equipment.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> and the brake pipe vacuum <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|The four-engined {{chartered}} propliner departed Columbia, South Carolina, at 15:24 EST, {{and landed}} in Newark, New Jersey, at 17:37, where it picked up its first group of 26 passengers. It departed at 18:22 for Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where it picked up 31 additional passengers. At 19:12 it departed for Baltimore, Maryland, where it picked up a final group of 17 passengers and departed for South Carolina at 20:30. During these flight segments, as he would later testify at the CAB hearing, the flight engineer opened the cross feed valves between the number three and four engines, since {{he had seen a}} drop in fuel pressure on the number 3 fuel <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> after the initial takeoff from Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} twin-hose regulators {{usually had}} no ports for accessories, though some {{has a high}} pressure port for a submersible <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Some later models have one or more low-pressure ports between the stages, {{which can be used}} to supply direct feeds for suit or BC inflation and/or a secondary single hose demand valve, and a high pressure port for a submersible <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> The new Mistral is an exception as {{it is based on the}} Aqualung Titan first stage. which has the usual set of ports.|$|E

25|$|A scuba diver {{should always}} {{be aware of the}} {{remaining}} breathing gas supply, and the duration of diving time that this will safely support, taking into account the time required to surface safely and an allowance for foreseeable contingencies.

25|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure.

25|$|Although {{there is}} no universally {{accepted}} standard, at least one agency recommends the use of two non-freezing regulators arranged as follows: primary first stage with primary second stage, BCD inflation hose, and submersible <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> (SPG); secondary first stage with secondary second stage (octopus), dry suit inflation hose, and SPG, although only one SPG is needed for a single cylinder or manifolded twins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vacuum system set-up is {{presented}} {{and used for}} calibration of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> {{in the region of}} rough vacuum, from 103 mbar to 10 - 1 mbar, with dry air. The capacitance manometer is used for the calibration of piezoresistant manometer, oil, mercury and mercury micrometers U manometers. The applicability of the experimental set-up and obtained results for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> calibration in the medium and high vacuum region is approved. It was shown how calibration of some cheaper <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> might be performed and reliable measurements of the pressure may be made in the region that is of interest for atomic and molecular collision physics and low-pressure gas discharges. It was also shown that mentioned calibration procedure could be used for calibration of different U manometer types in order to renormalize older atomic and molecular collision data.

25|$|In {{least one}} version of Russian twin-hose aqualung, the {{regulator}} {{did not have an}} A-clamp but screwed into a large socket on the cylinder manifold; that manifold was thin, and meandered somewhat. It had two cylinders and a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> There is suspicion that those Russian aqualungs started as a factory-made improved descendant of an aqualung home-made by British sport divers and obtained unofficially by a Russian and taken to Russia.|$|E
25|$|A pneumofathometer gauge is {{connected}} to the pneumo line. This is a high resolution <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> calibrated in feet sea water (fsw) and/or metres sea water (msw). and is used to measure the depth of the diver by allowing air to flow through the pneumo hose and out the end attached to the diver. When the air supply is shut off, and the flow stops, the gauge indicates the pressure at the open end at the diver.|$|E

25|$|A {{submersible}} <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is used {{to indicate}} the remaining gas pressure in a diving cylinder. The amount of available gas remaining can be calculated from the pressure and the cylinder internal volume, and {{the time that he}} diver can dive on the available gas depends on the depth and work load, and the fitness of the diver. Breathing rates can vary considerably, and estimates are largely derived from experience. Conservative estimates are generally used for planning purposes.|$|E
