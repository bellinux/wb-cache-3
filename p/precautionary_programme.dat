5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a <b>precautionary</b> <b>programme</b> rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E

In regards of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, they {{on the other hand}} have not yet regained complete market access, and thus do not yet qualify for OMT support.|$|E

40|$|Stewardship {{programs}} {{are an important}} element of agroecosystems management. These {{programs are}} confronted with the difficult challenges of demonstrating their positive impacts on the environment. This paper argues that under the precautionary principle, evaluation of stewardship programs should be aimed at identifying risks mitigated, as opposed to actual changes in environmental conditions. The Ontario Environmental Farm Plan Program is presented as a case study. A pathways model is developed and applied to the case. It demonstrates the types of risks mitigated, a way to account for preventative actions, and insights into how future evaluations based on the precautionary principal can be undertaken.

50|$|In {{order to}} further help {{increase}} the financial {{stability of the}} eurozone, the ECB decided on 6 September 2012 to automatically run a free unlimited amount of yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT support programme) for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout or <b>precautionary</b> <b>programme</b> from EFSF/ESM, if -and for as long as- the country is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only {{at the point of}} time where the country possesses/regain a complete market funding access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed MoU-agreement.

In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which the ECB define as the moment when the state succeeds to issue a new ten-year government bond series at the private capital market.|$|E

The aim is for the private market to subscribe to 50% of the bond auction while ESM cover the remaining 50%. If the participation of the private market proves to be insignificant the PMSF will be cancelled, and replaced by an extra transfer of funds from the macro-economic/precautionary programme. There will be no additional MoU agreement for this support package, as the conditions will be identical to the pre-existing Sovereign bailout loan / Precautionary programme." ...|$|E

40|$|Countries {{can make}} a clean exit from {{financial}} assistance, or enter a new programme or a <b>precautionary</b> <b>programme,</b> depending on the sustainability of their public debt and their vulnerability to shocks. • Ireland made a clean exit in December 2013, supported by significant budgetary and current-account adjustment and signs of economic recovery. But Irish debt sustaina-bility is not guaranteed and prudence {{will be needed to}} avoid future difficulties. • A clean exit for Portugal is not recommended when its programme ends in May 2014, because compared to Ireland it faces higher interest rates, has poorer growth pros-pects and has probably less ability to generate a consistently high primary surplus. A precautionary arrangement would be advisable. In case debt sustainability proves dif-ficult to achieve later, some form of debt restructuring may prove necessary. • It is unlikely that Greece will be able to exit its programme in December 2014. A third programme should be put in place to take Greece out of the market until 2030, accom-panied by enhanced budgetary and structural reform commitments by Greece, a Euro-pean boost to economic growth in the euro-area periphery and willingness on the part of lenders to reduce loan charges below their borrowing costs, should public debt levels prove unsustainable despite Greece meeting the loan conditions. • Even assuming all goes well, the three countries will be subject to enhanced post-pro-gramme surveillance. Managing such decades-long relationships will be a key challenge...|$|E
