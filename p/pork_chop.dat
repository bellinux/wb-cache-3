5|$|The {{division}} continued patrol activity around Old Baldy Hill and <b>Pork</b> <b>Chop</b> Hill into 1953, digging {{tunnels and}} building a network of outposts and bunkers on and around the hill. In April, the North Korean Army began stepping up offensive operations against UN forces. During the Battle of Porkchop Hill, the Chinese 67th and 141st divisions overran <b>Pork</b> <b>Chop</b> Hill using massed infantry and artillery fire. The hill had been {{under the control of}} the 31st Infantry. The 31st counterattacked with reinforcements from the 17th Infantry and recaptured the area the next day. On 6 July the North Koreans and Chinese launched a determined attack against <b>Pork</b> <b>Chop</b> resulting in five days of fierce fighting with few meaningful results. By the end of July, five infantry battalions from the 31st and 17th were defending the hill, while a Chinese division was in position to attack it. During this standoff, the UN ordered the 7th Infantry Division to retreat from the hill in preparation for an armistice, which would end major hostilities.|$|E

Troops of the Turkish Brigade, attached to the 25th Infantry Division, defended Outposts Berlin, Vegas, Carson, and Elko in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They were ordered to evacuate all but the Berlin position {{at the end of}} May. The 1st British Commonwealth Division ejected the Chinese after their assault on the Hook. The 1st ROK Division troops were ordered off the positions on Queen, Bak, and Hill 179 when heavy enemy assaults divested them of their tactical value. The closing days of the fighting saw the 7th Infantry Division withdrawn from <b>Pork</b> <b>Chop</b> and the 1st Marine Division ordered to evacuate the Berlin positions for the same reason.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} was first activated in December 1917 in World War I, and based at Fort Ord, California {{for most of}} its history. Although elements of the division saw brief active service in World War I, it is best known for its participation in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II where it took heavy casualties engaging the Imperial Japanese Army in the Aleutian Islands, Leyte, and Okinawa. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the {{division was}} stationed in Japan and South Korea, and with the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 {{was one of the first}} units in action. It took part in the Inchon Landings and the advance north until Chinese forces counter-attacked and almost overwhelmed the scattered division. The 7th later would fight in the Battle of <b>Pork</b> <b>Chop</b> Hill and the Battle of Old Baldy. From 1953 to 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main garrison was Camp Casey, South Korea. During these occupation duties, the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan. The division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The 14th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. In 1965 the division received its distinctive unit insignia, which alluded to its history during the Korean War. On 2 April 1971, the division returned to the United States and was inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington. In October 1974 the 7th reactivated at its former garrison, Fort Ord. [...] In the late 1980s, it briefly saw action overseas in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras and Operation Just Cause in Panama. In the early 1990s, it provided domestic support to the civil authorities in Operation Green Sweep and during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. In 1994, the division was inactivated at Ft.
