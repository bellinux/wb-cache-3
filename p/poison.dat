5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to <b>poison</b> centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US <b>poison</b> centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian <b>poison</b> center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales <b>poison</b> center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to <b>poison</b> control centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} <b>poison</b> dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many <b>poison</b> dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other <b>poison</b> frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. <b>Poison</b> frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. <b>Poison</b> frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E

40|$|Marine <b>poisoning</b> {{results from}} the {{ingestion}} of marine animals that contain toxic substances and causes substantial illness in coastal regions. Three main clinical syndromes of marine <b>poisoning</b> have important neurological symptoms-ciguatera, tetrodotoxin <b>poisoning,</b> and paralytic shellfish <b>poisoning.</b> Ciguatera is the commonest syndrome of marine <b>poisoning</b> and is characterised by moderate to severe gastrointestinal effects (vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal cramps) and neurological effects (myalgia, paraesthesia, cold allodynia, and ataxia), but is rarely lethal. Tetrodotoxin <b>poisoning</b> and paralytic shellfish <b>poisoning</b> are less common but have a higher fatality rate than ciguatera. Mild gastrointestinal effects and a descending paralysis are characteristic {{of these types of}} <b>poisoning.</b> In severe <b>poisoning,</b> paralysis rapidly progresses to respiratory failure. Diagnosis of all types of marine <b>poisoning</b> is made from the circumstances of ingestion (type of fish and location) and the clinical effects.
