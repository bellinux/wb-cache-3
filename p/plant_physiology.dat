5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E

Although {{its role in the}} <b>plant's</b> <b>physiology</b> is not clear, evidence was adduced that it is the product of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase previously shown to occur in this and other plants.

5|$|In India simple {{artificial}} plant classification {{systems of}} the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical {{with the work of}} Parashara (c. 400 – c. 500 AD), the author of Vṛksayurveda (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (Fabaceae), Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.|$|E
5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in <b>plant</b> <b>physiology,</b> Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E

5|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>physiology</b> {{encompasses}} all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower plant {{serves as}} the type species for its large genus. Linnaeus picked the name Commelina in honour of the two Dutch botanists of the Commelijn family, using the two large showy petals of Commelina communis to symbolise them. Linnaeus {{described}} the species in {{the first edition of}} his landmark work, Species Plantarum, in 1753. Long before the plant was studied in Europe, however, it had been used for generations in traditional Chinese medicine. The flowers have also been used in Japan to produce a dye and a pigment that was used in many world-renowned Ukiyo-e woodcuts from the 18th and early 19th centuries. In the modern era the plant has found limited use as a model organism in the field of <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> due to its complex pigment chemistry and the ease of viewing its stomata.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E

40|$|Abstract To {{keep track}} of {{fluctuations}} in spectral composition and intensity of incoming sunlight, plants engage a plethora of photosensory pigments. Absorp-tion of light by these photoreceptors sets in motion signaling cascades that ultimately influence the <b>plant’s</b> <b>physiology.</b> Many light-controlled processes are based on modulation of gene activity in response to changes in irradiation. The molecular basis of this regulation and the downstream components transducing signals from the photoreceptors are not fully understood yet, but recent evidence suggests {{that some of those}} routes are rather short. The phytochrome photoreceptors have been found to influence light-responsive promoters by direct contact with transcription factors. Additionally, the cryptochrome blue-light receptors directly interact with a key repressor of photomorphogenesis, suggesting that light activation of photoreceptors could initiate photomorphogenesis through posttranslational regula-tion. This review focuses on recent insights into photo-sensory transduction mechanisms as well as on our current understanding of light entrainment of the en-dogenous clock...|$|R

25|$|Sir Francis Bacon {{published}} one of {{the first}} <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> experiments in 1627 in the book, Sylva Sylvarum. Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. Jan Baptist van Helmont published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in <b>plant</b> <b>physiology</b> in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, John Woodward published experiments on growth of spearmint in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.|$|E
