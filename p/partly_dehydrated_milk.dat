Mechanical and swelling measurements of hagfish threads were consistent with both of these predictions, suggesting that an elastomeric keratin matrix resists IF swelling and keeps IF stiffness and yield stress high. The elastomeric nature of the matrix is indirectly supported by the inability of matrix-free IFs (i. e. slime threads) to recover from post-yield deformation.

Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the energetics of Na+ and Ca 2 + transport through the channel. Single ion profiles show that Ca 2 + experiences a large barrier midway through the selectivity filter that is not seen by Na+. This barrier is caused by the need for Ca 2 + to <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrate</b> to pass through this region and the lack of compensating interactions with the protein.

40|$|Slag and fly ash {{originating}} from processing lateritic Ni-ore in {{the districts of}} Niquelândia and Barro Alto in Brazil are enriched with potentially toxic elements (PTEs). Higher contents of Ni and Co were observed in case of the fly ash (25 g/kg and 462 mg/kg, respectively), whereas higher concentration of Cr was observed in the slag (7, 58 g/kg). Mineralogical investigations indicate that slag mainly consists of olivine, pyroxene and glassy matrix. High content of glass corresponds to the product of quenching of slag melt in water basins during granulation. In contrast, the fly ash was mineralogically more complex with olivine, pyroxene, glassy phase and <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrated</b> serpentine phase, spinel, SiO 2 and the furnace feed residues. Contaminant leaching was highly pH-dependent with the highest releases of PTEs from the fly ash at pH 3 : up to 5, 42 g/kg Ni, 112 mg/kg Co and 4, 3 mg/kg Zn. Slag was significantly more stabile; only 47, 9 mg/kg Ni was released at pH 3, but compared to the fly ash higher release of Cr was reported (up to 25. 6 mg/kg).

The experimental data were obtained calorimetrically by titrating a concentrated surfactant solution into a micellar solution of nonionic surfactant. The composition {{and the size of}} the mixed nonionic/ionic micelles at different surfactant concentrations were also determined. Pronounced differences in both composition and excess enthalpy were found between the anionic and the cationic mixed system. For both systems, the excess enthalpies become more exothermic with increasing temperature, but for the anionic mixed system an additional exothermic contribution was found which was much less temperature dependent. Temperature dependence of the excess enthalpy was attributed to the effect of the ionic headgroup on the hydration of the ethylene oxide (EO) groups in the mixed corona. Ionic headgroups located in the ethylene oxide layer cause the dehydration of the EO chains resulting in an additional hydrophobic contribution to the enthalpy of mixing. A high affinity of sodium dodecyl sulfate for nonionic micelles and an extra exothermic and less temperature dependent contribution to the excess enthalpy found for the SDS-C 12 E 6 system might be attributed to specific interactions (hydrogen bonds) between the sulfate headgroup and the <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrated</b> EO chain...|$|R

The work was aimed at investigating the suitability of using P 123 as bile salt sequestrant beside the fundamental aspects of PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer-bile salt interactions. Various experimental techniques including dynamic and static light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed in combination with electrophoretic mobility measurements. The system was investigated at a constant P 123 concentration of 1. 74 mM and with varying bile salt concentrations up to approximately 250 mM NaGDC (or a molar ratio n(NaGDC) /n(P 123) = 144). In the mixed P 123 -NaGDC solutions, the endothermic process related to the self-assembly of P 123 was observed to gradually decrease in enthalpy and shift to higher temperatures upon progressive addition of NaGDC.

Previous evidence has outlined the importance of SP-C palmitoylation to sustain the proper dynamics of lung surfactant, but the mechanism by which this posttranslational modification aids SP-C to stabilize the interfacial surfactant film along the compression–expansion breathing cycles, is still unrevealed. In this work we have compared the structure, orientation and lipid–protein interactions of a native palmitoylated SP-C with those of a non-palmitoylated recombinant SP-C (rSP-C) form in air-exposed multilayer membrane environments, by means of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Palmitoylation {{does not affect the}} secondary structure of the protein, which exhibits a full α-helical conformation in <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrated</b> phospholipid multilayer films. However, differences between the Amide I band of the IR spectrum of palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated proteins suggest subtle differences affecting the environment of their helical component. These differences are accompanied by differential effects on the IR bands from phospholipid phosphates, indicating that palmitoylation modulates lipid–protein interactions at the headgroup region of phospholipid layers. On the other hand, the relative dichroic absorption of polarized IR has allowed calculating that the palmitoylated protein adopts a more tilted transmembrane orientation than the non-palmitoylated SP-C, likely contributing to more compact, dehydrated and possibly stable multilayer lipid–protein films. As a whole, the behavior of multilayer films containing palmitoylated SP-C may reflect favorable structural properties for surfactant reservoirs at the air–liquid respiratory interface...|$|R

However, for some important cell types, including some mammalian oocytes, it has not. For the latter, there are increasing attempts to cryopreserve them by vitrification. However, even if intracellular ice formation (IIF) is prevented during cooling, it can still occur during the warming of a vitrified sample. Here, we examine two aspects of this occurrence in mouse oocytes. One took place in oocytes that were <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrated</b> by an initial hold for 12 min at − 25 °C. They were then cooled rapidly to − 70 °C and warmed slowly, or they were warmed rapidly to intermediate temperatures and held. These oocytes underwent no IIF during cooling but blackened from IIF during warming. The blackening rate increased about 5 -fold for each five-degree rise in temperature. Upon thawing, they were dead. The second aspect involved oocytes that had been vitrified by cooling to − 196 °C while suspended in a concentrated solution of cryoprotectants and warmed at rates ranging from 140 °C/min to 3300 °C/min. Survivals after warming at 140 °C/min and 250 °C/min were low (< 30 %). Survivals after warming at ≥ 2200 °C/min were high (80 %). When warmed slowly, they were killed, apparently by the recrystallization of previously formed small internal ice crystals.

This paper focuses on key sociological factors that might predict the frequency and duration of breastfeeding and weaning patterns. The data analysed below, collected during semi-structured interviews with 278 women presenting at Maternal and Child Health Clinics in Peninsular Malaysia, are in part confusing. They suggest that the women most likely to bottle feed only or to breast feed for a short period, and to use commercial baby foods, are young, with one child only, who reside in urban or peri-urban areas and have a reasonable household income. Higher educated women, and women whose husbands are in non-traditional occupations, are also less likely to breastfeed or to do so for an extended period.

Four field experiments were analyzed (Alternative Buffer Material experiment, ABM 1, ABM 2; Temperature Buffer Test, TBT; and Prototype) with focus on Fe- redox chemistry and formation of trioctahedral smectite. The techniques used were mainly synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In ABM 1 and Prototype the Fe(II) /Fe-total ratio had increased. In TBT no significant increase in Fe(II) was found; instead the corrosion products were dominated by Fe(III). Formation of trioctahedral clays was found in the iron-bentonite experiments (ABM 1, ABM 2, TBT), but not in Prototype where the heater instead was of copper. In swelling experiments, Ca-Wyoming montmorillonite was shown to expand and partly form a four-water-layer hydrate at lower temperatures in water. This was studied in more detail, and the influence of divalent interlayer cation, temperature, layer charge, salt and irradiation was investigated.

Extraframework K and Na cations are ordered at two fully occupied sites. Above 75 °C amicite was found to <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrate</b> into two separate but coherently intergrown phases, both of space group I 2 /a, one K-rich ∼K 8 (Al 8 Si 8 O 32) · 4 H 2 O (at 75 °C: a = 10. 038 (2), b = 9. 6805 (19), c = 9. 843 (2) Å, β = 89. 93 (3) °, V = 956. 5 (3) Å 3) and the other Na-rich ∼Na 8 (Al 8 Si 8 O 32) · 2 H 2 O (at 75 °C: a = 9. 759 (2), b = 8. 9078 (18), c = 9. 5270 (19) Å, β = 89. 98 (3) °, V = 828. 2 (3) Å 3). Upon further heating above 75 °C the Na- and K-phases lost remaining H 2 O with only minor influence on the framework structure and became anhydrous at 175 °C and 375 °C, respectively. The two anhydrous phases persisted up to 425 °C. Backscattered electron images of a heated crystal displayed lamellar intergrowth of the K- and Na-rich phases.

40|$|AbstractTime-resolved {{infrared}} difference {{spectra of}} the ATP-induced phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase {{have been recorded}} in H 2 O and 2 H 2 O at pH 7. 0 and 1 °C. The reaction was induced by ATP release from P 3 - 1 -(2 -nitro) phenylethyladenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (caged ATP) and from [γ- 18 O 3]caged ATP. A band at 1546 cm− 1, not observed with the deuterated enzyme, can be assigned to the amide II mode of the protein backbone and indicates that a conformational change associated with ATPase phosphorylation takes place after ATP binding. This is also indicated between 1700 and 1610 cm− 1, where bandshifts of up to 10 cm− 1 observed upon protein deuteration suggest that amide I modes of the protein backbone dominate the difference spectrum. From the band positions it is deduced that α-helical, β-sheet, and probably β-turn structures are affected in the phosphorylation reaction. Model spectra of acetyl phosphate, acetate, ATP, and ADP suggest the tentative assignment {{of some of the}} bands of the phosphorylation spectrum to the molecular groups of ATP and Asp 351, which participate directly in the phosphate transfer reaction: a positive band at 1719 cm− 1 to the CO group of aspartyl phosphate, a negative band at 1239 cm− 1 to the νas(PO 2 −) modes of the bound ATP molecule, and a positive band at 1131 cm− 1 to the νas(PO 32 −) mode of the phosphoenzyme phosphate group, the latter assignment being supported by the band’s sensitivity toward isotopic substitution in the γ-phosphate of ATP. Band positions and shapes of these bands indicate that the α- and/or β-phosphate(s) of the bound ATP molecule become <b>partly</b> <b>dehydrated</b> when ATP binds to the ATPase, that the phosphoenzyme phosphate group is unprotonated at pH 7. 0, and that the CO group of aspartyl phosphate does not interact with bulk water. The Ca 2 + binding sites seem to be largely undisturbed by the phosphorylation reaction, and a functional role of the side chains of Asn, Gln, and Arg residues was not detected...|$|R

Nutrient composition of khoa {{is important because it}} goes into the preparation of several indigenous sweet-meats. In the present study the nutrient composition of market khoa samples were analysed. These were compared with the nutrient composition of laboratory khoa samples prepared from pure cow milk or buffalo milk. MATERIALS AND METHODS Market samples-A total of 6 market samples of khcsa were purchased (1 sample from the local area i. e. Vallabh Vidyanagar, 2 samples from the neighbouring Anancl city, 1 sample from Barocla city and 2 samples from Ahmedabad city). These were analysed for the nutrient content. Laboratory samples-Laboratory samples of khoa were prepared from pure cow milk as well as from pure buffalo milk. Preparation of khoa in the laboratory essentially included boiling of SOOgms of whole milk in a stainless steel vessel on a gas stove with constant stirring (approx. 45 minutes) until a solid mass was formed. The samples were cooled and used freshly for analysis. Nutrient composition-The 6 market samples and 2 laboratory samples (one-from cow milk and the other from buffalo milk) of khoa were analysed for their proximate composition, mineral and vitamin content. Moisture was analysed by the standard AQAC (1984) 1 method while total solids was calculated as 100 minus moisture content.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the optimal cooling rate and extender for epididymal sperm of outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) and inbred Fischer 344 (F 344) rat strains. The epididymal sperm from 10 to 12 weeks old sexually mature SD and F 344 strains were suspended in five different freezing extenders, namely HEPES buffered Tyrode’s lactate (TL-HEPES), modified Kreb’s Ringer bicarbonate (mKRB), 3 % <b>dehydrated</b> skim <b>milk</b> (SM), Salamon’s Tris-citrate (TRIS), and tes/tris (TES). All extenders contained 20 % egg yolk, 0. 75 % Equex Paste and 0. 1 M raffinose or 0. 1 M sucrose. The sperm samples in each extender were cooled to 4 °C and held for 45 min for equilibration before freezing. The equilibrated sperm samples in each extender were placed onto a shallow quartz dish inserted into Linkam Cryostage (BCS 196). The samples were then cooled to a final temperature of − 150 °C by using various cooling rates (10, 40, 70, and 100 °C/min). For thawing, the quartz dish containing the sperm samples were rapidly removed from the Linkam cryo-stage and placed on a 37 °C slide warmer and held for 1 min before motility analysis. Sperm membrane and acrosomal integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed by SYBR- 14 /Propidium iodide, Alexa Fluor- 488 -PNA conjugate and JC- 1, respectively. The total motility, acrosomal integrity, membrane integrity and MMP values were compared among cooling rates and extenders. Both cooling rate and type of extender had significant effect on cryosurvival (P< 0. 05). Sperm motility increased as cooling rate was increased for both strains (P< 0. 05). Highest cryosurvival was achieved when 100 °C/min cooling rate was used in combination with TES extender containing 20 % egg yolk, 0. 75 % Equex paste and either 0. 1 M sucrose or raffinose (P< 0. 05). This study showed that TES extender containing 0. 1 M raffinose or sucrose with 70 °C/min and 100 °C/min cooling rate improved post-thaw motility of rat sperm...|$|R
40|$|Milk is an {{essential}} source of macronutrients and among lipophilic vitamins is significant source of retinol. The contribution of milk to the reference daily intake for retinol varies from 11 % to 16 %, worldwide. The most consumed dairy products are fresh, <b>dehydrated</b> and condensed <b>milk</b> in which the amonuts of retinol are not modified to those of in whole milk. Retinol is essential to ensure a good functionality {{of the immune system}} and plays a critical role in vision, reproduction, cell differentiation as well as growth and development and is found only in animal tissues. The aim of our study was to evaluate the interspecies differences in the retinol concentration of whole raw bovine, caprine and ovine milk and to observe seasonal variation of retinol in bulk tank milk samples. Samples of raw milk were colleceted on different farms in the Czech Republic between 2013 and 2014. Retinol was measured by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (325 nm) in isocratic mode after alkaline saponification with methanolic potassium hydroxide solution and liquid-liquid extraction into non polar organic solvent of whole raw milk. To avoid vitamin losses or degradation during the procedure, antioxidants were added to the sample extraction media. Our results indicate significant interspecies differences between bovine and ovine milk and caprine and ovine milk. Concentration of retinol is very similar in bovine and caprine milk 0. 96 ± 0. 11 mg/L, 0. 94 ± 0. 25 mg/L, respectively. The mean concentration in sheep´s milk is 1. 75 ± 0. 24 mg/L. The seasonal variation of retinol in raw bovine milk was detected as high significant, with the highest concentration during winter. These results contribute to the nutrition evaluation of milk in the Czech Republic and indicate, that the sheep´s milk is the best source of retinol among the milks of ruminants kept in the Czech Republic, however it is not used in its fluid form for human consumption. <!

40|$|Cryopreservation of boar {{spermatozoa}} {{is as yet}} sub-optimal, presumably {{owing to}} variation in dehydration and membrane intactness among boars. This thesis work investigated, using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM), how cooling rates below – 5 oC/min affect the frozen structure of boar semen in four different packages/volumes (maxi-straws and medium straws, FlatPacks [FPs] and MiniFlatPacks [MFPs]). The hypothesis tested was {{that the degree of}} dehydration differs between containers, as well as by cooling rate, which would explain differences in post-thaw viability among boars. Cryo-SEM allows the study of the fully hydrated ultrastructure of frozen sperm samples without introducing artefacts caused by fixation or processing. It further allows visualisation of the topography of the sample, including the distribution and amount/area of the frozen water which, when sublimated, leaves the <b>partly</b> or fully <b>dehydrated</b> extender and the spermatozoa intact. Furthermore, the thesis work investigated the effect of cooling/re-warming on the localisation of the hexose substrate carriers GLUT- 3 and GLUT- 5 and water/cryoprotectant channels (Aquaporin 7 [AQP 7]) in the plasma membrane. Use of different cooling speeds and containers clearly affected the degree of (de) hydration of the extender/spermatozoa, thus explaining recorded differences in post-thaw sperm survival, but not inter-boar variation. The degree of dehydration was most favourable for the MFPs owing to their cryogenic properties. Ultrastructural analyses by SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of immunolabelling clearly showed that boar spermatozoa express the hexose/glucose transporters GLUT- 3 and GLUT- 5 in both the outer and the inner plasmalemma. Their distribution in the plasma membrane changed during the process of cryopreservation, particularly for GLUT- 3, whose labelling decreased dramatically post-thaw. Likewise, the channel protein AQP 7, involved in the transport of water and glycerol through the plasma membrane, is present in boar spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymides and from different fractions of the ejaculate. The domain localisation changed in ejaculated spermatozoa during cryopreservation, with a clear redistribution and increasing intensity following freezing-thawing. Both hexose (GLUT-) transporters and AQP 7 are markers of interest for non-empirical studies of boar semen cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{and known}} metal organic {{frameworks}} with copper(II), sodium and 1, 2, 4, 5 -benzenetetracarboxylate were prepared by ambient precipitation, solvothermal and gel-synthesis methods, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetry with FTIR evolved-gas analysis. Some of these complexes were investigated for guest inclusion properties with water (the original guest species), methanol, ethanol and pyridine. The gel-synthesis products {{were the most}} interesting. The novel threedimensional metal-organic framework complex Cu₂ Na(OH) L· 7 H₂O (where L= 1, 2, 4, 5 -benzenetetracarboxylate) -formed by gel-synthesis- is a covalent three-dimensional metal organic framework polymer with open channels containing both guest water molecules and water molecules coordinated to sodium. The structure collapsed on dehydration, but was essentially restored to the original structure on rehydration in moist air. On exposure of the dehydrated material to methanol and ethanol vapour, significant uptake of these solvents was observed, and the resolvated structures closely resembled that of the parent material. On heating in dry nitrogen, small amounts of methanol and ethanol remained until about 280 °C, when loss of the remaining guest triggered decomposition of the framework. The related complex, Cu₂¼(OH) ½ L· 7 ½H₂O (or possibly Cu₂⅓ (OH) ⅔L· 8 H₂O) -formed by gel-synthesis- had a different physical appearance to Cu₂Na(OH) L· 7 H₂O above, but had nearly identical X-ray diffraction pattern, mid-infrared spectrum and thermal behaviour. The novel complex Cu₄Na₄L₃· 14 H₂O -formed by gel-synthesis- is a covalent three-dimensional metal-organic framework with small channels containing both guest water molecules and water coordinated to sodium and copper. Upon dehydration the structure collapsed, but on rehydration in moist air the original structure was <b>partly</b> restored. The <b>dehydrated</b> material did not absorb methanol. Known two-dimensional polymeric complexes [Cu₂L· 6 H₂O]· 4 H₂O and [Cu₂L· 4 H₂O]· 2 H₂O were also obtained by gel-synthesis, and were characterized and investigated for guest inclusion properties. The structures of these complexes collapsed on dehydration, and were only partly restored on rehydration in saturated water vapour. The dehydrated materials did not absorb methanol. The two-dimensional polymeric mixed-ligand complex Cu₂(pyridine) ₄· 6 H₂O -formed very slowly by gel-synthesis- was characterized by TG-FTIR, and was shown to undergo a complicated decomposition involving the loss of water and pyridine, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in various stages. Solvothermal synthesis did not yield materials suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies or inclusion studies, producing only an anhydrous or hemihydrate complex with the formula Cu₂L· 0. 65 H 2 O. Ambient precipitation syntheses did not yield materials suitable for singlecrystal diffraction studies, forming products approximately equivalent to the complexes [Cu₂L· 6 H₂O]· 4 H₂O and Cu₂¼(OH) ½L· 7 ½H₂O above. During {{the course of the}} above study it was discovered that, on changing the DSC purge from nitrogen to argon, the normally exothermic carboxylate decompositions appeared to become endothermic. The effects of the supposedly inert atmospheres of argon and nitrogen on the decomposition-mechanism of copper(II) oxalate -a well-studied copper carboxylate- were therefore studied by DSC, TG, TG-FTIR and XRPD. DSC experiments were performed in nitrogen and argon at different flow-rates, in various mixtures of nitrogen and argon, and at various heating rates. Regardless of the proportions of nitrogen and argon, the DSC residues consisted mainly of copper metal, a small amount of copper(I) oxide (cuprite) and, in some circumstances, traces of copper(II) oxide (tenorite). Also, regardless of whether TG-FTIR experiments were performed under argon or nitrogen, the gaseous decomposition products consisted mainly of carbon dioxide, with traces of carbon monoxide being detected over part of the decomposition period. Various explanations for the thermal behaviour are discussed, and it is possible that small amounts of O 2 or monatomic oxygen were given off during the decomposition under argon. The design and implementation of a low-cost prototype X-ray proportional counter detector system, consisting of a hybrid analog-digital computer built using commonly available electronic components, is presented. This system was designed to replace ageing discrete-transistor designs still in use in earlier X-ray diffractometers. The prototype performs the functions of pulse-shaping, pulseheight discrimination, counting and scaling, and provides both digital and scaled analog outputs. ...|$|R
