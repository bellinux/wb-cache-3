40|$|Abstract. Side {{emitting}} <b>plastic</b> <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> {{can be used}} in textile {{structures for}} some special optical activities due to the light leaking out from their surface. One significant characteristic of <b>plastic</b> <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> is their tendency to weaken side emitting capability under mechanical deformation, which can be simulated as repeated bending cycles under prescribed pretension. The principle of evaluation of flex fatigue was based on the repeated bending cycles until break. Q-Q plot and three-parameter Weibull distribution were used for estimation of numbers of bending cycles of <b>plastic</b> <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> with different diameters. The relationship between flex fatigue and flexibility were analyzed and compared with logarithmic values...|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} the Schleuniger Group {{as it is known}} today started in 1991 when Dr. Gerhard Jansen (Chairman BOD until 2009) and Martin Strehl (CEO until 2009) {{acquired}} Sutter Electronic AG located in Thun, Switzerland. At that time Sutter Electronic AG had 30 employees and generated a revenue of 5 million CHF with wire processing machines and other processing equipment. In 1993 the new owners acquired Schleuniger Productronic AG, which had been founded in Solothurn, Switzerland. This company also produced wire processing machines, but additionally had access to the international market. Both companies were then integrated into a group under the already internationally established name [...] "Schleuniger". In 1999, the Schleuniger Group took over their previously independent distributor [...] "L+H Kabeltechnik" [...] and secured direct access to Germany - its most important European market. Taking over the Swiss-based Kirsten AG in 2000 opened the crimping market for the Schleuniger Group and two years later Schleuniger entered the market for <b>Plastic</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Fiber</b> (POF) and Flat Foil Cables (FFC / FPC) with the foundation of Schleuniger Flexon AG in 2002. Another 2 years later, Schleuniger took over the activities of the German [...] "Grote+Hartmann Engineering GmbH" [...] (GHWE) from the American Lear Corporation Inc., and developed fully automatic crimping machines, which are now produced by Schleuniger Automation GmbH in Radevormwald, Germany. Having been active in China through an independent representative for many years, Schleuniger opened a representative office in Shanghai in 2005, which was transformed into a trading company in 2007. In 2008, the Swiss Metall Zug Group took over the Schleuniger Group. The same year, Schleuniger took over PAWO Systems AG which became Schleuniger Solutions in 2009. In August 2009, Christoph Schüpbach succeeded Martin Strehl as CEO and Calvin Grieder succeeded Gerhard Jansen as Chairman in November 2009. A substantial investment was made in 2013 with the acquisition of the former Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd. headquartered in Tianjin, China. The new owners integrated the newly founded Schleuniger Haofeng (Tianjin) Machinery Co., Ltd. into the Schleuniger Group. Schleuniger Haofeng produces high-quality machinery for the wire processing industry. Prior to their acquisition, Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment's 2012 posted sales were the equivalent of approx. 5 million Swiss Francs. Another acquisition was completed in Spring 2015 when the Cirris Solutions GmbH, headquartered in Jettingen/Germany became part of the Schleuniger Group. Due to its fully automated testing systems, Cirris Solutions is one of the global leaders in the field of applied testing technology and testing automation. Cirris Solutions GmbH has approximately 40 employees and generated translated sales of 7.2 million Swiss Francs in 2014 (currency exchange rate from Dec. 31, 2014).|$|E
