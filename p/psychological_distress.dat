Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, <b>psychological</b> <b>distress,</b> concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E

Participants completed pre-, mid-, and post-assessments for delay discounting, <b>psychological</b> flexibility, <b>distress</b> tolerance, overall <b>psychological</b> symptoms, behavior change, and valued living. Data were analyzed with multilevel modeling of growth curves. Significant interaction effects of time and condition were present for <b>psychological</b> flexibility, <b>distress</b> tolerance, <b>psychological</b> symptoms, and the obstruction subscale of valued living. No significant interaction effect was found for two delay discounting tasks nor the progression subscale of valued living. The ACT condition had a significantly larger reduction of problem behavior at post-, but not mid-assessment. Treatment was provided in a competent and ACT-consistent manner and was rated as highly satisfactory by treatment completers. The results support use of ACT as a transdiagnostic treatment.

Children with eczema not only suffer from physical and emotional disturbances, their parents may also experience various kinds of social and <b>psychological</b> <b>distresses</b> in the caregiving process which will subsequently challenge their core values, philosophies and attitudes towards life. OBJECTIVE: To understand lived experiences of {{parents of children with}} eczema. METHOD: Ten parents of children with eczema were invited for a semi-structured interview. In addition to the parental stress and coping strategies, the sense-making and benefit-finding mechanism in their eczema caregiving experience were explored. Data were examined by adopting the Constructivist Grounded Theory. RESULT: A vicious cycle emerged as most representative of their caregiving experiences: 1) affective apprehension, 2) caregiving related concerns, and 3) relationship dynamics. Some parents, however, were still able to identify the benefits in the stressful journey by revisiting their core beliefs and values. CONCLUSION: Despite parental stress from various dimensions in the caregiving process, some parents were able to go through a meaning reconstruction process which resulted in a spiritual growth and a positive attitude in facing the challenges. This highlights the importance of maintaining psychosocial wellbeing of parents of children with eczema...|$|R

In Study 1, there were indirect effects of mindfulness and symptom distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and social role difficulties through non-acceptance of emotions. There were indirect associations between mindfulness and symptom distress, interpersonal distress, social role difficulties, depression, anxiety, and stress through {{lack of access to}} emotion regulation strategies.
