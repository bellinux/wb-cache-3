40|$|Differences in {{extent and}} nature of {{newspaper}} media reporting {{before and after the}} introduction of the Serious Sex Offender Monitoring Act 2005 in Victoria were investigated, critically exploring the interface between <b>psychological,</b> <b>media</b> and criminological disciplines. Forty-three news items before the Act and 90 after the Act were analysed using a thematic and discursive framework. A significant {{increase in the number of}} items was found after the Act but other discursive and thematic findings were mixed. Several indicators of sensationalism such as headline size, tone, and theme did not differ between time frames, while there was a significant increase in the incidence of case-based and high-profile case reporting after the introduction of the Act. Hence, although the discourse and frames within which serious sex offenders are reported has remained similar over time, the introduction of the Act has dramatically impacted on the frequency of reporting in such cases. The findings are congruent with the extant literature on the newsworthiness of child sexual offending, indicating a need for media outlets to be more responsible in their reporting, and for legislators to enact legislation based upon empirical evidence...|$|E

40|$|Attractiveness is a {{phenomenon}} that is highly prioritised in society and {{has a variety of}} implications on the health, mental health, occupational, judicial and economic spheres. The media is known {{to have an impact on}} how certain norms, expectations and beliefs in society are formed, including, but not limited to, the creation of beauty ideals. Despite this importance, little research has been done on how men have come to perceive the attractiveness of women as a consequence of daily exposure to the media and photoshopped images of women. This study therefore attempts to address this gap in research by studying the impact that media and the use of photoshopping might have on males' perception of female attractiveness. A mixed-method approach was followed. Accordingly, both qualitative and quantitative data was collected during this study. The quantitative data entailed a comparison of heart rate, breathing rate, heart rate variability and viewing time for 24 participants between non-photoshopped and photoshopped images. The qualitative section comprised eye tracking data and a questionnaire for 25 male participants on the topic of media, photoshopping, features of attractiveness and what impact these three constructs might have on each other. The results indicate that on a physiological level there are limited and sporadic changes in how men view, and respond to, photoshopped images of women. Despite this finding, most participants report that on a <b>psychological</b> level <b>media</b> and photoshopping has an impact on their perceptions of beauty and their experience of interpersonal attraction.

Prior to the campaign, telephone {{interviews were conducted with}} 628 randomly selected women aged 45 - 70, 285 in central Sydney (where the screening programme operated) and 343 from the rest of Sydney. A second cross-sectional survey was conducted two years after the campaign commenced. The campaign achieved an estimated 21 % attendance rate in an eligible population of 43, 000 women over a period of 22 months. Overall the campaign reached a large section of the eligible community, with 70 % of women being aware of the van's existence. In addition, the proportion of women who reported being exposed to 'a moderate amount' or 'quite a lot' of information about screening increased by almost 20 %. However, two thirds of women still reported being exposed to 'only a little' or no information at all. Attendance was achieved largely in the absence of improvements in knowledge and attitudes. Where change did happen, it occurred in the community overall, rather than being confined to the campaign's target area. Changes were most likely due to general electronic and print media messages, which were largely positive in their tone of reporting on screening. The campaign in one area of central Sydney, Drummoyne, which was much more intense, was successful in encouraging greater awareness of the van and mammography screening, plus greater attendance than in the rest of central Sydney, but had no impact on knowledge or attitudes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study was to}} {{investigate}} an indigenous form of stone play as a projection medium in child psychological assessment. My theoretical framework was grounded in indigenous psychology. My literature study consulted theory relating to indigenous psychology, indigenous knowledge, play, assessment, asset-based approach and positive psychology. I followed a qualitative research approach, guided by an interpretivist epistemology. I employed an intrinsic case study design and purposefully selected the participant. My data collection methods consisted of interviews with the participant’s mother and observations of the participant during the Masekitlana sessions. I relied on audio-visual methods and a self-reflective journal as methods of data documentation. Six main themes emerged as the result of thematic analysis and interpretation that I have completed. Firstly, I found that during the Masekitlana sessions, the participant mentioned a desire or a huge need for food. Secondly, the participant also experienced conflict in the neighbourhood as a result of living conditions and poverty. This included experiences of peer conflict as well as indirect conflict among adults in the community. Thirdly, environmental factors in the informal settlement came to the foreground, like infrastructure, water supply and housing. In the fourth instance the participant expressed her daily routine of bathing, going to school, doing school work and going home. Fifthly, the participant projected her belief system by mentioning indigenous concepts, such as ‘Naka’ which refers to a sangoma (traditional healer). Lastly positive qualities within the participant are identified as a theme. Masekitlana poses to be a valid projection medium to conduct a psychological assessment with the participant because it provides an authentic psychological image. The standardization of Masekitlana as an assessment medium is suggested.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the mid- 1960 s saw a {{dramatic}} shift in how 'brainwashing' was popularly imagined, reflecting Anglo-American developments in the sciences of mind as well as shifts in mass media culture. The 1965 British film, The Ipcress File (dir. Sidney J. Furie, starr. Michael Caine) provides a rich case for exploring these interconnections between mind control, mind science, and media, as it exemplifies the era's innovations for depicting 'brainwashing' on screen: the film's protagonist is subjected to flashing lights and electronic music, pulsating to the 'rhythm of brainwaves'. This paper describes the making of The Ipcress File's brainwashing sequence, and shows how its quest for cinematic spectacle drew on developments in cybernetic science, multimedia design and modernist architecture (developments that were also influencing the 1960 s' psychedelic counterculture). I argue that often interposed between the disparate endeavours of 1960 s mind control, <b>psychological</b> science, and <b>media</b> was {{a vision of the}} human mind as a 'cybernetic spectator': a subject who not only scrutinizes how media and other demands on her sensory perception can affect consciousness, but seeks to consciously participate in this mental conditioning and guide its effects...|$|R

Recent socioeconomic interventions and development in the region have occurred in tandem with the growing popularity of violent action films among young people, which has been cause for concern among their parents and guardians. The ambivalent responses of Gorongosa residents toward this trend indicate the need to analyze the implications of film violence in the context of evolving local rituals of revelation and multiple legacies of the civil war (1976 – 1992) as well as emerging postwar challenges. The results significantly contrast with <b>psychological</b> studies of <b>media</b> violence that link consumption of film violence to serious negative effects on young viewers. In Gorongosa, film violence is implicated in expanding relations of domination and submission and violence and its containment, which enhance ongoing processes of self-assertion among young people in unpredictable ways, without, however, inciting violence in the communities.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{provision}} of Open Educational Resources (OER) means that learning horizons {{are no longer}} restricted by time and space. However, if the learning potential of OER is to be fully realised, educators and students must have the media literacy skills to select, use and produce information in a judicious and useful way. A consideration of the <b>psychological</b> dimensions of <b>media</b> literacy skills is crucial to maximise the learning opportunities offered by OER. Although learning platforms may be shifting to online content, the fundamental issues remain: How do we learn? How can learning be facilitated? These core psychological issues are key to the appropriate deployment and use of OER. The authors highlight how psychological theory and research has contributed {{to our understanding of}} technology-mediated interactions and the learning process, and consider how psychology can contribute to our understanding and application of OER as a learning facilitator. They discuss how advances in Web 2. 0 technology may help maximise participation in learning and consider the potential psychological barriers and enablers to the uptake and use of OER.

The scope of media has broadened dramatically over the last few decades, particularly with the advent of digital technology, and the resultant increase in exposure to media in all its forms.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis, I explore the construction of lesbian and gay parenting in psychology (Part 1), in the media (Part 2), and in lesbian and gay parents' talk (Part 3). My research brings together a diverse range of influences and ideas from lesbian and gay psychology, feminist psychology, and constructionist and discursive research. I draw on varied data sources: the psychological and lesbian feminist literature on lesbian (and gay) parenting, television talk shows, documentaries and newspaper articles, and research interviews with lesbian and gay parents. These data are analysed within a feminist constructionist framework, using discourse analysis. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. In Part 1. 1 present my analysis of the psychological and lesbian feminist literature on lesbian (and gay) parenting. In this part of the thesis, I treat the literature as data and explore what it reveals about the social construction of lesbian and gay parenting. First, I provide a historical overview of the literature on lesbians and parenting over the last one hundred years. Then, I focus in detail on how discourses of sameness and difference and discourses of science inform the construction of lesbian (and gay) parenting in the literature. In Part 2, I analyse media constructions of lesbian and gay parenting. First, I identify arguments against lesbian and gay parenting in talk shows and in newspaper articles. Second, I focus specifically on talk show debates and analyse how these debates are constructed and identify the key themes informing pro-lesbian/gay parenting discourse on talk shows. In Part 3, I focus in detail on lesbian and gay parents' talk about two issues that significantly inform <b>psychological</b> and <b>media</b> debates about their fitness to parent: homophobic bullying and male role models. I explore how lesbian and gay parents engage with anti-lesbian/gay claims about homophobic bullying and male role models, {{and the ways in which}} they construct bullying and role models in the process of discursively managing their identity as 'bad' parents. In the final chapter, I discuss the contributions and implications of my research, and indicate some future developments for research on lesbian and gay parenting and for lesbian and gay psychology...|$|R
40|$|Although {{wellness}} {{has become}} a declared priority within education, a thorough exploration of the factors responsible for student wellness has yet to occur. There have been many studies {{with a focus on}} adolescent problems; however, wellness research is limited and non-holistic in its approach. This dissertation sought to explore the adolescent wellness phenomenon and the factors influencing its enhancement through the experiences of adolescents and teachers. The primary purpose of the research was to explore adolescents’ perceptions of wellness in two mid-sized Western Canadian high schools. The second purpose was to use a theoretical framework to describe the relationship between adolescent perceptions of wellness and the developmental dimensions of adolescent lives, the perceived influences on adolescent wellness, and the links between professional support (teachers) and students’ perceived levels of wellness (low, medium and high-level wellness). To accomplish this, two hundred and eighty grade eleven students completed a wellness survey. Additionally, subgroups of 22 students and 6 teachers were asked to participate in focus group discussions. It was found that wellness was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. The study revealed that there were at least four dimensions contributing to the balance of wellness: physical (physical activity, nutrition, smoking, drugs and alcohol), <b>psychological</b> (self-esteem, <b>media),</b> spiritual and social (parents, teachers and peers). For many students, the dimensions were not considered equally important, but wellness was seen to involve maintaining a balance in life. The findings of the study indicated that modifications to particular areas of educational practice should be considered when working to promote adolescent wellness and the some of the suggested change areas include: additional professional development, school health programming and committing to school partnerships with health care professionals such as nurses. Implications for educational policy included the support for professional development related to health education, policies that fiscally support the hiring of school health nurses, and policies that are reflective of adolescent developmental stages. Among the implications for research are a need to further explore the conceptualization of adolescent wellness in youth of all ages and in schools across the Canada, as well as the need for longitudinal studies which would allow for further investigation of wellness, and its validity beyond this study...|$|R
40|$|How are {{perception}} and lived space "produced," how are these productions linked with social and material power, {{and how does}} "aesthetic" production fit into this picture? For its first half, this study traces {{the history of the}} joint production of {{perception and}} space, chiefly in the United States and Britain, through the twentieth century, as that was carried out by dominant scientific, military and industrial institutions, and also in the arts. For its second half it explicates the production of common social space through architecture, ambient sound, light and vibration, and the distribution and playback of recordings, which construct sensory fields operating so as to calibrate bodily energies with productive processes. In its conclusion, it attempts to show the intermeshed functioning of produced space and perception with war and with everyday life.
