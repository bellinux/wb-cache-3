50|$|Wasit University {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} academic institutions in Iraq. Since its establishment on 13th. Jan. 2003, it has moved in consistent steps towards achieving its goals to build a decent academic base. It aims at elevating its scientific standard to occupy a distinguished status among other outstanding Iraqi and Arab universities. It has been established in Wasit Governorate to be a center for knowledge، culture and science for all those who graduate from secondary schools in the governorate.Wasit University aims at achieving high level academic criteria through active contribution to the scientific progress. It has provided the social and economic sectors with scientifically، administratively and technically qualified staff. It intends to cope with world cultural and technological progress to raise its standard.There is no doubt that the achieved success of the University is the fruit of genuine efforts exerted by the University Board، the teaching staff and administrative and technical personnel along with the continual support of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.Wasit University has started with only two colleges: College of Education and College of Administration and Economics. There has been expansion in the colleges themselves to contain some extra departments along with scientific centers. Now it includes fifteen colleges with 55 scientific and humane departments. Moreover، it contains the Continuing Education Center، IT Center and Ibn Sina Center along with the Central Library and the Scientific Virtual Library. It is expected that the university will establish other colleges and departments. We hope that our university will gain an esteemed status among other Arab and world universities as it has gained that status among other Iraqi universities. This depends on the cooperative efforts and insistence to achieve success and <b>progress</b> <b>scientifically</b> <b>and</b> practically.|$|E
40|$|The Ottoman Empire {{entered an}} era of {{development}} and enlightenment beginning from {{the second quarter of}} the XIXth century, that is the period of the Ottoman reformation (Tanzimat Era), and the Western culture and way of thinking started to be transferred to the Ottoman Turkish society. However, the political, economic and military situation of the Ottoman Empire caused it not fulfill this policy of enlightenment properly and settlement of this effect in a particular group. Directing education especially to military field and preparing the sources according to this field again caused the information to be caught in a narrow field and it also prevented the public from accessing the information they need, furthermore the efforts of literature and the press (newspapers and magazines) could not reach the desired level. Turkish Republic, which entered a new developing and progressive period with the republic period, have given great importance to education while it has been fulfilling its privileged policies in economy and moreover many important works were carried on in every field of education in this period. However, the planned works and applications have not been completed properly because of the negativities such as wars, economic distress, wrong education policies, religious views, {{and not being able to}} use scientific and new information production methods. In today’s Turkey, there are deficiencies in both quality and quantity in need of society for information and conscious of this need, access to information, use and production of information. There are also lacks of legal, political, economic and cultural plans and policies, which can meet these deficiencies. It is also seen that there are problems in our society’s reading habit, critical thinking ability, objective interpretation and desire to learn. The Ottoman Empire and Turkish society entered a new period with the declaration of reformation in 1839. This period signifies a period when a new economic, social, political, cultural, scientific and legal structuring period, which composes the society and determines the locations of individuals in the state, came. Although political and legal characteristics of the reformation era were in foreground, the above-mentioned fields started to be affected in later periods. The Ottoman society acquainted with many new concepts and systems. In this study, transfer ways and methods of information to the public such as literature, religion, education, printing and mass communication will be comparatively examined by considering the effects of science and scientific information on scientific, social, politic and cultural fields, their development, importance and usage in the society in Europe and the Ottoman Empire beginning from the period of reformation till today. Furthermore, several subjects such as the methods used in transferring of the information to the society since the republic period, the need of society for information, the methods used in meeting the information need, dimensions of information production in Turkey, the problems in information production and transfer, and the role of information institutions in socializing of information, are dealt in the basis of education - science - culture and politics and appropriate conditions are tried to be put forward. The basic purpose of the study is to discuss and explain the negativities in socializing of information, that is the reason why Turkey cannot <b>progress</b> <b>scientifically</b> <b>and</b> technically, why it cannot contribute to the world science as much as Europe, North America and some Far Eastern countries, and why it cannot produce and transfer information to a wider public mass, in a historical process from the period of reformation to the period of republic since information has become a world view because of its great successes in social, politic, economic and cultural fields and has gained a quality being a direction indicator in daily life. Furthermore, it is to put forward strategy, planning, programme and solutions for bringing Turkey in the mentioned position, and informing Turkish society and transferring the information created in various fields to the public since the mentioned period in the context of role taken by the information centers. Development process of information centers, their role in socializing of the information and their place in education system are also tried to be scrutinized by associating it with the science history and philosophy benefiting from the interdisciplinary characteristic of Library and Information Sciences...|$|E

40|$|The proper {{pre-drilling}} preparation, on-site {{acquisition and}} post-drilling preservation of high-quality subsurface samples {{are crucial to}} ensure significant <b>progress</b> in the <b>scientifically</b> <b>and</b> societally important areas of subsurface biosphere and paleoclimate research. Two of the four research themes of IODP and ICDP {{and one of the}} four research areas of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) focus on the subsurface biosphere. Increasing understanding of paleoclimate is a central goal of IODP and incorporated within the scope of the IMPRESS program, the successor of the IMAGES program. Therefore, the goal of our IODP–ICDP–DCO–J-DESC–MagellanPlus-sponsored workshop was to help advance deep biosphere and paleoclimate research by identifying needed improvements in scientific drilling planning and available technology, sample collection and initial analysis, and long-term storage of subsurface samples and data. Success in these areas will (a) avoid biological and other contamination during drilling, sampling, storage and shipboard/shore-based experiments; (b) build a repository and database of high-quality subsurface samples for microbiological and paleoclimate research available for the scientific community world-wide over the next decades; and (c) standardize, as much as possible, microbiological and paleoclimate drilling, sampling and storage workflows to allow results and data to be comparable across both space and time. A result of this workshop is the development and suggested implementation of new advanced methods and technologies to collect high-quality samples and data for the deep biosphere and paleoclimate scientific communities to optimize expected substantial progress in these fields. The members of this workshop will enhance communication within the scientific drilling community by crafting a handbook focused on pre-drilling, drilling and post-drilling operations...|$|R
