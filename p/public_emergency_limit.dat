40|$|Zika {{virus is}} a mosquitoborne flavivirus {{that is the}} focus of an ongoing {{pandemic}} and <b>public</b> health <b>emergency.</b> Previously <b>limited</b> to sporadic cases in Africa and Asia, the emergence of Zika virus in Brazil in 2015 heralded rapid spread throughout the Americas. Although most Zika virus infections are characterized by subclinical or mild influenza-like illness, severe manifestations have been described, including Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers. Neither an effective treatment nor a vaccine is available for Zika virus; therefore, the public health response primarily focuses on preventing infection, particularly in pregnant women. Despite growing knowledge about this virus, questions remain regarding the virus's vectors and reservoirs, pathogenesis, genetic diversity, and potential synergistic effects of co-infection with other circulating viruses. These questions highlight the need for research to optimize surveillance, patient management, and public health intervention in the current Zika virus epidemic. 27070380 PMC 491817...|$|R

Census data for men show that in urban-industrial centers, self-employment reduced the demand for <b>public</b> <b>emergency</b> work by absorbing displaced workers into the entrepreneurial sector. Census data for women reveal that, in these centers, self-employment and <b>public</b> <b>emergency</b> work coexisted due to mutually beneficial relations between women who were self-employed and those women who worked on government projects. The results suggest that, contrary to popular theoretical and ideological views, there is no inherent conflict between private- and public-sector responses to stagnant labor markets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Microblog plays a very {{important}} role in the process of public opinion dissemination after the occurrence of <b>public</b> <b>emergencies.</b> As a Micro blogging platform based on user information sharing, dissemination and access, it is suitable for using social network analysis method to analyze because of forming a network structure between the microblogging users. In this paper, we use the social network analysis method to explore the network structure, node position and key nodes feature such as the missed Malaysia Flight Mh 370. The research shows that the network structure of the microblogging public opinion about <b>public</b> <b>emergencies</b> is loose, and the key nodes are more important that makes the public opinion spread quickly. Users participating in the dissemination of public opinion have obvious domain features. The relevant regulatory authorities need to focus on the key nodes (opinion leaders) of public opinion-prone areas.

50|$|Subtitle A {{amended the}} Public Health Service Act to add Title XXVIII: National Preparedness for Bioterrorism and Other <b>Public</b> Health <b>Emergencies.</b> It {{directed}} the DHHS, through the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to coordinate {{a strategy for}} preparing for and responding to bioterrorism and other <b>public</b> health <b>emergencies,</b> including the preparation {{of a plan to}} ensure that the activities of the Secretary regarding bioterrorism and other <b>public</b> health <b>emergencies</b> are coordinated with state and local governments.|$|R
30|$|However, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} from the purpose of derogation clauses {{that at least some}} economic, social and cultural rights are non-derogable. According to Müller, this would extend to subsistence rights (Müller 2009, 593). The purpose of derogations is not to allow states to decrease their attention to the rights, but (following the criteria of Article 4 ICCPR) must be to ensure that the state is in a position where it is capable of ensuring human rights and to restore a situation of normalcy (United Nations Human Rights Committee 2001, para 1). This is evident from the requirement that a state be in a “time of <b>public</b> <b>emergency</b> that threatens the life of the nation” before it may make derogations. Whilst it may be true that a non-international armed conflict may cause such a situation of <b>public</b> <b>emergency,</b> it cannot reasonably be expected that derogating from rights such as the right to food, water and healthcare, could help to restore the state to a situation of normalcy. On the contrary, reducing access to essential resources would aggravate, rather than ameliorate, a situation of <b>public</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|R
