40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} key {{observations on}} the role of limestone in preventing bed agglomeration during combustion of a high-phosphorous fuel in CFB boilers. Composition of the bed material samples was analyzed using X-ray fluorescence, and scanning electron microscope combined with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM/EDXA). It has been demonstrated that during combustion of the high-phosphorous fuel in CFB conditions, addition of limestone reduces or prevents bed agglomeration and formation of slag by interfering with the ash chemistry, and not by simple dilution of the reacting system. The role of limestone can be summarized as: 1) to provide calcium for the reaction with phosphorous forming high-temperature-melting calcium phosphates instead of low-temperature-melting <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> and 2) to coat silica particles preventing the reaction of potassium (calcium) phosphates and silica from fluidizing sand, which can form low-temperature-melting potassium (calcium) silicates, especially relevant for fluidized bed combustion conditions...|$|E

Some work has shown zinc addition by alternative synthesis routes, but the level of incorporation has not been reassessed. This work uses a newly developed approach whereby zinc is included in an amorphous phase and subsequently crystallized. Different phosphate reactants (ammonium, sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphates)</b> were mixed together with calcium salts (calcium nitrate or calcium acetate) and the pH level adjusted (with ammonia or KOH) to investigate the ease of forming an amorphous phase and the inclusion of zinc. X–ray diffraction revealed that all reactants showed a tendency to form an amorphous phase, supporting the requirement of a high pH to prevent crystallization. X–ray fluorescence showed higher inclusion {{in the absence of}} ammonia. Potassium phosphate led to the highest zinc incorporation, accompanied by inclusion of potassium. Crystallization at 700 oC indicated that zinc levels close to 20 % replacement of calcium were the highest possible before inclusion of a secondary phase.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that {{administration}} of inorganic <b>potassium</b> <b>phosphates</b> (Pi) to patients with severe diabetic ketoacidosis was able to increase the P 50 (the PO 2 necessary to achieve a hemoglobin saturation of 50 %) by a non diphosphoglycerate (DPG) mediated effect. This suggests that the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) may be determined not only by pH, temperature, CO 2 content and DPG but also by plasmatic ions. In order {{to test this hypothesis}} we have determined the ODC on whole blood in two groups of subjects, 49 control subjects with matching age and sex and 49 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis, septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patients had many ionic disorders induced either by their diseases or by the applied treatment. The mean ODC of the patients did not differ from the normal values. In contrast, the dispersion of PO 2 around the saturations values was increased from 5 to 80 % saturation. A forward regression analysis showed that the DPG level and the levels of inorganic phosphates and natrium (Na+) {{played a significant role in}} determining the position of the ODC according to the following equation: P 50 (mmHg) = 34. 5 + 0. 225 DPG + 0. 62 Pi- 0. 09 Na+, where DPG is in micromol. gHb- 1 and Pi and Na+ in mEq. l- 1.

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{geographical}} {{position of the}} Jukskei River in the built-up and densely populated landscape, it has been historically subject to many water quality problems, particularly of bacterial nature, {{as well as from}} other pollution sources. At one stage, between 1995 and 2005, this river was subject to increasing pH levels and variable concentrations of sulphates, <b>potassium,</b> <b>phosphates</b> and nitrates. The potential for flooding and changes in water quality are expected to have a direct correlation to the changes in surface coverage of the built environment surrounding the Jukskei River. Major storm water management concerns have arisen in urban areas as a result of increased severity and frequency of flooding, with detrimental consequences for society and the environment. There is therefore a dire need to constantly monitor water quality, as the pollution loads gathered in the Jukskei channel ultimately reach the Hartbeespoort Dam, which is already in a state of high eutrophication. In responding to these water management challenges, it is crucial to understand the relationship between land use change, rainfall trends and water quality, so that storm water runoff can be managed effectively and efficiently. Data which was obtained from the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) for the 28 year period from 1986 to 2014, shows overall concentrations of pollutants for three sites (Site A, Site B and Site C) along the Jukskei River. This correlates inversely to the increases in average water flows at these sites. The increased water flow and increased urban land use coverage over the period may be responsible for the decrease in pollutant concentrations at these sites. The reasons for the more marked decrease in pollutant concentrations at Site A than Site B may be that Site A is located downstream of Site B. This could be due to the increased incidence of development-related impermeable surfaces occurring in close proximity to Site B, whereas Site A is further from the urban edge. It appears that an increase in the area of impermeable surfaces over time is negatively correlated with pollutant concentrations. This would imply that increased impermeable surfaces provide increased flow into the Jukskei River and therefore allow for the dilution of pollutants entering this river. This negative correlation is expected to continue into the future and the dilution effect may possibly be enhanced with increased development of impermeable surfaces within Johannesburg, depending on other water quality inputs.
