Though in the first stages of the Eighty Years' War both parties had mercilessly executed prisoners of war (a practice that continued {{for a long time}} in the war on sea), this practice was soon recognized as a waste of money, as prisoners were often ready and able to offer large sums of money to regain their freedom. The practice of ransoming had long been customary in medieval wars and there was no reason to forgo its <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> in this conflict. Informal ransoming was soon formalized in a so-called Cartel between the high commands of the two belligerents, first in 1599, and more definitely in 1602. This cartel was a formal treaty that enumerated the rates of exchange for different grades of prisoners and other conditions of treatment (and compensation for housing and feeding). The advantage for the commanders of both armies was that the losses due to the taking of prisoners could be replenished relatively cheaply and speedily. The cartel with Spain remained in force for the remainder of the war. Similar cartels were concluded in later wars.|$|E

The window being hidden by the dingy tapestry, the only light in the room came from a starved-looking candle, which was fixed in the foot of the skeleton of a child, attached to a string from the ceiling, and dangling just over the table, where a ponderous volume lay open before a large crystal globe and two skulls.|$|E

6000|$|... 333 In {{his last}} {{edition of his}} “Manual,” Professor Fawcett thus [...] {{describes}} a co-operative experiment in agriculture: “The one that [...] has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since [...] by Mr. Gurdon, on his estate at Assington, near Sudbury, in Suffolk. [...] Mr. Gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the [...] agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate, that he was [...] prompted to do something on their behalf. When, therefore, one of [...] his farms became vacant, he offered to let it at the ordinary rent, [...] £150 a year, to the laborers who worked upon it. As they, of course, [...] had not sufficient capital to cultivate it, he {{in the first instance}} [...] loaned them the requisite stock and implements. The laborers were, [...] in fact, formed into a company in which there were eleven shares, [...] and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share. The plan [...] was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been [...] saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced, and [...] the stock and implements became the property of the laborers. Each [...] share greatly increased in value. Mr. Gurdon was so much encouraged, [...] not only by the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> secured to the laborers, but [...] also by the general improvement effected in their condition, that [...] some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar [...] terms. Although no statement of accounts has ever been published, [...] the remarkable <b>pecuniary</b> <b>advantages</b> secured to the laborers is [...] proved by the fact that, after enjoying at least as high wages as [...] were paid in the district, they were able in a few years to become [...] the owners of a valuable property, consisting of the stock and [...] implements on the farms. One of the most significant and hopeful [...] circumstances connected with the experiment is, that it was not [...] carried out by a picked body of men; and if so much could be done by [...] laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country, [...] it maybe fairly concluded, that when the intelligence of our rural [...] population has been better developed, co-operation may be applied in [...] a more complete form to agriculture, and with even more striking [...] results than were obtained at Assington.... In the description which [...] has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship, [...] it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated [...] by the feeling of property. When he cultivates his own plot of [...] ground, he exerts himself to the utmost, because he knows that he [...] will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor. Each year, with the [...] extended use of machinery in agriculture, it is becoming more [...] advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale. When, therefore, [...] co-operative agriculture becomes practicable, land may be cultivated [...] by associations of laborers, and thus many of the advantages [...] associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured, [...] {{while at the same time}} the disadvantages of small farming may be [...] avoided. The progress toward co-operative agriculture will no doubt [...] be slow and gradual.” ...|$|E

As the electoral legislation has become more stringent, attracting voters by giving them attentions and gifts (buckets, packages of food with sugar, oil, etc., or gourmet) was forbidden and election promises have climbed the first rung of the strategy of attracting voters.
