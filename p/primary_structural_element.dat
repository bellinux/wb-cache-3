It was developed by CEN/TC 250 WG 3 and it presents the available background of both the design of glass components related to up-to-date existing national codes as well as the recent scientific knowledge. The report includes a material part, describing the behaviour of glass and the used interlayer materials. Subsequently, the typical properties of glass products and their placement in existing product standards are mentioned. The principles and basic rules for the design of glass components as well as the safety approach are clarified with regard to the particular characteristic of glass – the absent of plasticity. Furthermore there are different types of construction made of glass. They can be separated in secondary and <b>primary</b> <b>structural</b> <b>elements.</b> For secondary <b>structural</b> <b>elements</b> the existing design rules are presented, for <b>primary</b> <b>structural</b> <b>elements</b> the report gives an overview of the actual state of research work.

The high strain rate behavior of bone has remained relatively unexplored, however, and its properties under dynamic loads perpendicular to the diaphysis of the bone are somewhat poorly understood. Bone is an anisotropic material and displays different properties depending on its orientation during testing. It is known that bone is weaker under a compressive load in the transverse direction, but the relationship has not been tested at high strain rates. A bovine femur was obtained and specimens were cut from it to be tested in a Split Hopkinson-Kolsky Pressure Bar.

Our laboratory has developed a process for self-assembly of macroscopic collagen fibers that have structures and mechanical properties similar to rat tail tendon fibers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the effects of subfibrillar orientation and decorin incorporation on the mechanical properties of collagen fibers. Self-assembled collagen fibers were stretched 0 - 50 % before cross-linking and then characterized by microscopy and mechanical testing. Results of these studies indicate that fibrillar orientation, packing, and ultimate tensile strength can be increased by stretching. In addition, it is shown that decorin incorporation increases ultimate tensile strength of uncross-linked fibers. Based on the observed results it is hypothesized that decorin facilitates fibrillar slippage during deformation and thereby improves the tensile properties of collagen fibers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{building}} undergoes {{progressive collapse}} when a <b>primary</b> <b>structural</b> <b>element</b> fails, {{resulting in the}} failure damage is disproportionate to the original cause, so the term disproportionate collapse {{is also used to}} describe this collapse type. Progressive collapse can be triggered by manmade, natural, intentional, or unintentional causes. Explosion, fires, earthquakes creates large amounts of stresses and the failure of supporting structural members can lead to a progressive collapse failure. Progressive collapse is a complicated dynamic process where the collapsing system redistributes the loads in order to prevent the loss of critical structural members. For this reason beams, columns, and frame connections must be designed in a way to handle the potential redistribution of large loads. This research provides insight into the structural configuration to achieve a demand to capacity ratio of appropriate quantity and prevent collapse {{in the event of a}} single column loss. Several relationships developed between various analysis procedure against shear forces. Ultimately, all this information can be used in design codes where there are currently very limited or no specific rules or guidelines...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this guide is to provide an {{advisory}} document for the design, construction and control of concrete structures reinforced with FRP bars.

Nevertheless, the responsibility of the operated choices remains with the designer.

40|$|A {{model of}} the human pilot is offered for pursuit {{tracking}} tasks; the model encompasses an existing model for compensatory tracking. The central hypothesis {{in the development of}} this model states that those <b>primary</b> <b>structural</b> <b>elements</b> in the compensatory model responsible for the pilot's equalization capabilities remain intact in the pursuit model. In this latter case, effective low-frequency inversion of the controlled-element dynamics occurs by feeding-forward derived input rate through the equalization dynamics, with low-frequency phase droop minimized. The sharp reduction in low-frequency phase lag beyond that associated with the disappearance of phase droop is seen to accompany relatively low-gain feedback of vehicle output. The results of some recent motion cue research are discussed and interpreted in terms of the compensatory-pursuit display dichotomy. Tracking with input preview is discussed in a qualitative way. In terms of the model, preview is shown to demand no fundamental changes in structure or equalization and to allow the pilot to eliminate the effective time delays that accrue in the inversion of the controlled-element dynamics.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Structural Engineering Design. CD ROM includedA structure is subjected to progressive collapse when a <b>primary</b> <b>structural</b> <b>element</b> fails, resulting in failure of adjoining structural elements which, in their turn, cause further structural failure leading eventually to partial or total collapse. The failure of a primary vertical support might occur due to extreme loadings such as bomb explosion in a terrorist attack, gas explosion and huge impact of a vehicle in the parking area. Different guidelines such as the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) addressed the structural progressive collapse due to the sudden loss of a main vertical support. In the current study, a progressive collapse assessment according to the GSA guideline is carried out for a typical 10 -story reinforced concrete framed structure designed according to BS 8110 code. Linear elastic analysis for the structure was carried out using “Etabs” Building software. The investigated cases included the removal of a middle column in short and long side periphery of the building, corner column, and internal columns one at a time. 3 dimensional analysis with slabs panels was carried out to avoid more conservative solutions. It was found for the case that was studied, reinforced concrete structures designed according to BS 8110 code {{do not meet the}} GSA limits and that they have a high potential for progressive collapse in flexure mode for all cases and sudden shear mode collapse at the loss of corner column.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} tailored couplings in {{rotor blades}} to reduce vibratory hub loads was studied through design, structural and aeroelastic analysis, fabrication, and {{wind tunnel test}} of Mach scale articulated composite rotors with tailored flap-bending/torsion couplings. The rotor design was nominally based on the UH- 60 BLACK HAWK rotor. The 6 -foot diameter blades have a SC 1095 profile and feature a linear twist of - 12 deg. The analysis of composite rotor was carried out using a mixed cross-section structural model, and UMARC. Five sets of composite rotor were fabricated, including a baseline rotor without coupling, rotors with spanwise uniform positive coupling and negative coupling, and rotors with spanwise dual-segmented coupling (FBT-P/N) and triple-segmented coupling. The blade composite D-spar is the <b>primary</b> <b>structural</b> <b>element</b> supporting the blade loads and providing the desired elastic couplings. Non-rotating tests were performed to examine blade structural properties. The measurements showed good correlation with predictions, and good repeatability for the four blades of each rotor set. All rotors were tested at a rotor speed of 2300 rpm (tip Mach number 0. 65) at different advance ratios and thrust levels, in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at the University of Maryland. The test results showed that flap-bending/torsion couplings {{have a significant effect}} on the rotor vibratory hub loads. All coupled rotors reduced the 4 /rev vertical force for advance ratios up to 0. 3, with reductions ranging from 1 to 34 %. The mixed coupling rotor FBT-P/N reduced overall 4 /rev hub loads at advance ratios of 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3. At a rotor speed of 2300 rpm and an advance ratio of 0. 3, the FBT-P/N rotor achieved 15 % reduction for 4 /rev vertical force, 3 % for 4 /rev in-plane force and 14 % for 4 /rev head moment. The reductions in the 4 /rev hub loads are related to the experimentally observed reductions in 3 /rev and 5 /rev blade flap bending moments. Through the present research, it has been experimentally demonstrated that structural couplings can significantly impact rotor vibration characteristics, and with suitable design optimization (coupling strength and spanwise distribution) they can be used to reduce vibratory hub loads without penalties...|$|E

However, limited research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour and strength of LCBs. Hence a numerical study was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LCBs. Finite element models of simply supported LCBs with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were considered under a mid-span load. They were then validated by comparing their results with test results and used in a detailed parametric study based on the validated finite element models. Numerical studies were conducted to investigate the shear buckling and post-buckling behaviour of LCBs. Experimental and numerical results showed that the current design rules in cold-formed steel structures design codes are very conservative for the shear design of LCBs.
