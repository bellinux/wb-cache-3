A complementation of the wild-type (WT) placenta by using tetraploid rescue technique showed that the embryonic lethality in SOCS 3 -deficient embryo was due to the <b>placental</b> <b>defect.</b> Here we demonstrate that TS cells supplementation rescues <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> in SOCS 3 -deficient embryos. In the rescued placenta, TS cells were integrated into the placental structure, and a substantial structural improvement was observed in the labyrinthine layer that was disrupted in the SOCS 3 -deficient placenta.

40|$|The bHLH-repressor protein I-mfa binds to MyoD family members, {{inhibits}} their activity, {{and blocks}} their nuclear import and binding to DNA. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that mouse I-mfa was highly expressed in extraembryonic lineages, in the sclerotome, and subsequently within mesenchymal precursors of the axial and appendicular skeleton, before chondrogenesis occurs. Targeted deletion of I-mfa in a C 57 Bl/ 6 background resulted in embryonic lethality around E 10. 5, {{associated with a}} <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> and a markedly reduced number of trophoblast giant cells. Overexpression of I-mfa in rat trophoblast (Rcho- 1) stem cells induced differentiation into trophoblast giant cells. I-mfa interacted with the bHLH protein Mash 2, a negative regulator of trophoblast giant cell formation, and inhibited its transcriptional activity in cell culture.

Embryonic aggregation analyses reveal that in contrast to PPARγ-deficient mice, the heart defects are likely a direct result of BAF 180 ablation, rather than an indirect consequence of trophoblast <b>placental</b> <b>defects.</b> We identified potential target genes for BAF 180 in heart development, such as S 100 A 13 as well as retinoic acid (RA) -induced targets RARβ 2 and CRABPII.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} placenta is {{the site}} of exchange of nutrients and waste between mother and embryo. In humans, placental insufficiency can result in intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal death and spontaneous abortion. We show that in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice a null mutation in the gene encoding the transcriptional corepressor, Tgif, causes <b>placental</b> <b>defects.</b> The major defects are decreased vascularization of the placenta, due to a decrease in the fetal blood vessels, and decreased expression of the gap junction protein Gjb 2 (Cx 26). These defects result in severe growth retardation in a proportion of Tgif null embryos in Tgif heterozygous mothers, and an overall growth delay in Tgif null animals. <b>Placental</b> <b>defects</b> are much more severe if the mother also completely lacks Tgif function, and placentas from heterozygous Tgif embryos are defective in a Tgif null mother. Embryo transfer experiments show that even the placenta from a wild type embryo is compromised in the absence of maternal Tgif.

40|$|Suppressor of {{cytokine}} signaling  3 (SOCS 3) binds cytokine receptors {{and thereby}} suppresses cytokine signaling. Deletion of SOCS 3 causes an embryonic lethality that is rescued by a tetraploid rescue approach, demonstrating {{an essential role}} in placental development and a non-essential role in embryo development. Rescued SOCS 3 -deficient mice show a perinatal lethality with cardiac hypertrophy. SOCS 3 -deficient placentas have reduced spongiotrophoblasts and increased trophoblast secondary giant cells. Enforced expression of SOCS 3 in a trophoblast stem cell line (Rcho- 1) suppresses giant cell differentiation. Conversely, SOCS 3 -deficient trophoblast stem cells differentiate more readily to giant cells in culture, demonstrating that SOCS 3 negatively regulates trophoblast giant cell differentiation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes giant cell differentiation in vitro, and LIF receptor (LIFR) deficiency results in loss of giant cell differentiation in vivo. Finally, LIFR deficiency rescues the SOCS 3 -deficient <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> and embryonic lethality.

40|$|The serine {{protease}} CAP 1 /Prss 8 {{is crucial for}} skin barrier function, lung alveolar fluid clearance and has been unveiled as diagnostic marker for specific cancer types. Here, we show that a constitutive knockout of CAP 1 /Prss 8 leads to embryonic lethality. These embryos presented no specific defects, but it is during this period, and in particular at E 13. 5, that wildtype placentas show an increased expression of CAP 1 /Prss 8, thus suggesting a <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> in the knockout situation. The placentas of knockout embryos exhibited significantly reduced vascular development and incomplete cellular maturation. In contrary, epiblast-specific deletion of CAP 1 /Prss 8 allowed development until birth.

40|$|International audienceMelatonin {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{mitochondrial}} protection and its protective effects are equal or even better if compared with several consecrated antioxidants. Furthermore, the activation of specific melatonin receptors triggers several cellular pathways that improve the oxidoreduction and inflammatory cellular state. The discovery of the melatoninergic machinery in placental cells was the first step to understand the effects of this indoleamine during pregnancy. In critical points of pregnancy, melatonin has been pointed as a protagonist and its beneficial effects have been shown as essential for the control of trophoblastic function and development. On the contrary of the plasmatic melatonin (produced in pineal gland), placental melatonin does not vary according to the circadian cycle and acts as an autocrine, paracrine, intracrine, and endocrine hormone. The important effects of melatonin in placenta have been demonstrated in the physiopathology of pre-eclampsia with alterations in the levels of melatonin and in the expression of its receptors and synthetizing enzymes. Some authors suggested melatonin as a biomarker of pre-eclampsia and as a possible treatment for this disease and other obstetric pathologies associated with <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> and increases in oxidative stress.

Mice deficient in Wnt 2, generated by gene targeting, displayed runting and approximately 50 % died perinatally. Histological analysis revealed alterations in the size and structure of placentas from these mice from 14. 5 dpc. The <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> were associated primarily with the labyrinthine zone and included oedema and tissue disruption and accumulation of maternal blood in large pools. There was also an apparent decrease in the number of foetal capillaries and an increase in the amount of fibrinoid material in the Wnt 2 mutant placentas.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} there is an association between hypercoiling of the umbilical cord and <b>placental</b> maturation <b>defect.</b> From a database comprising 1147 cases, containing data on all placentas examined at our institution during the study period, we selected all cases with a gestational age of at least 37 weeks that exhibited hypercoiling of the umbilical cord (coiling density above the 90 th percentile, n = 42); we also examined 2 matched controls for each case, one with hypocoiling and one with normocoiling. The mean number of syncytiocapillary membranes (SCM) per terminal villus was calculated. Presence of a <b>placental</b> maturation <b>defect</b> was defined as the mean number of SCM below the 10 th percentile. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's rho. Relations between dichotomous variables were tested using logistic regression. Mean number of SCM per terminal villus (+/-standard deviation) was 1. 25 +/- 0. 65. Difference in mean between hypo- and hypercoiled cords was 0. 37 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 07 to 0. 67). The correlation coefficient between mean number of SCM and umbilical coiling index (UCI, coils/cm) was - 0. 28 (P = 0. 002). The odds ratio (OR) for <b>placental</b> maturation <b>defect</b> in presence of hypercoiling was 2. 61 (95 % CI, 0. 75 to 9. 12). The OR for fetal death was 132 (95 % CI, 13. 2 to 1315) {{in the presence of a}} <b>placental</b> maturation <b>defect</b> and 5. 49 (95 % CI, 1. 02 to 29. 6) in the presence of hypercoiling.

40|$|Many factors {{negatively}} affect pregnancy establishment and subsequent fetal growth and development, including maternal {{factors such as}} nutritional stress, age, body mass index, and genetic background, and external factors including environmental stress, psychosocial stress, multiple fetuses, medical conditions (e. g., polycystic ovary syndrome), lifestyle choices (e. g., alcohol consumption, smoking), and assisted reproductive technologies. These same factors have similar consequences for placental growth and development, including vascular development. We and others have shown that placental vascular development begins very early in pregnancy and determines, to a large extent, placental function—that is, {{the magnitude of the}} increase in placental blood flow and thus nutrient transport to the fetus. During the peri-implantation period and also later in pregnancy, cloned (somatic cell nuclear transfer) embryos exhibit a variety of <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> including reduced vascularization and altered expression of angiogenic factors. Although <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> are less pronounced in pregnancies resulting from the transfer of in vitro fertilized embryos, we and others have recently demonstrated that vascularization, expression of angiogenic factors, sex steroid receptors, several epigenetic markers, and growth of utero-placental tissues all were altered during early pregnancy after transfer of embryos obtained through natural mating, in vitro fertilization, or other assisted reproductive techniques. These observations are in agreement with the recent reports that in humans even singleton pregnancies established with assisted reproductive techniques are at increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight, and seem especially relevant considering the rapidly expanding use of these techniques in humans and animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{suppressor}} of cytokine-signaling (SOCS) proteins act as negative-feedback inhibitors of cytokine and growth-factor-induced signal transduction. In vivo {{studies have}} implicated SOCS 3 {{as a negative}} regulator of signaling downstream of gp 130, the receptor subunit shared by IL- 6 -like cytokines. Mice lacking SOCS 3 die at midgestation because of placental failure, and SOCS 3 ablation in a cell-type-specific manner results in changes in the functional outcome of gp 130 signaling in response to IL- 6. In this study, we show that genetic reduction of leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) production by embryo-derived tissues is sufficient to prevent the <b>placental</b> <b>defect.</b> This establishes LIF signaling as a major physiological regulator of trophoblast differentiation in vivo. Mice deficient in both SOCS 3 and LIF are born in predicted numbers and appear normal at birth but exhibit failure to thrive and high neonatal mortality. Adult SOCS 3 -null mice on a LIF-null background succumb to a spontaneous fatal inflammatory disease characterized by neutrophilia and inflammatory-cell tissue infiltrates. The disease spectrum mimics that seen in mice with a conditional deletion of SOCS 3 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells, extending the evidence for a major role for SOCS 3 in the homeostatic regulation of the inflammatory response and indicates that LIF is not required for this process...|$|E

Using Sox 2 CRE/PPARγL 2 /L 2 mice we obtained fully viable PPARγ null mice through specific and total epiblastic gene deletion, thereby demonstrating that the <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> is the unique cause of PPARγ–/– embryonic lethality. The vasculature defects observed in PPARγ–/– placentas at E 9. 5 correlated with an unsettled balance of pro- and antiangiogenic factors as demonstrated by increased levels of proliferin (Prl 2 c 2, PLF) and decreased levels of proliferin-related protein (Prl 7 d 1, PRP) respectively. To analyse the role of PPARγ in the later stage of placental development, when its expression peaks, we treated pregnant wild-type mice with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. This treatment resulted in a disorganisation of the placental layers and an altered placental microvasculature, accompanied by the decreased expression of proangiogenic genes such as Prl 2 c 2, vascular endothelial growth factor and Pecam 1.

E 2 F 4 is the major pRB-associated E 2 F in vivo, yet its role in Rb−/− embryos is unknown. Here we establish that E 2 f 4 deficiency reduced the lifespan of Rb−/− embryos by exacerbating the Rb mutant <b>placental</b> <b>defect.</b> We further show that this reflects the accumulation of trophectoderm-like cells in both Rb and Rb;E 2 f 4 mutant placentas. Thus, Rb and E 2 f 4 play cooperative roles in placental development. We used a conditional mouse model to allow Rb−/−;E 2 f 4 −/− embryos to develop {{in the presence of}} Rb wild-type placentas. Under these conditions, Rb−/−;E 2 f 4 −/− mutants survived to birth. These Rb−/−;E 2 f 4 −/− embryos exhibited all of the defects characteristic of the Rb and E 2 f 4 single mutants and had no novel defects.

Finally, we observe that PPARδ is dispensable for polyp formation in the intestine and colon of APCmin mice, inconsistent with its recently proposed role {{in the establishment of}} colorectal tumors.

Crossing male chimeras with wild-type females resulted in heterozygous (DUSP 9 +/−) females. However, when these animals were crossed with wild-type (DUSP 9 +/y) males none of the progeny carried the targeted DUSP 9 allele, indicating that both female heterozygous and male null (DUSP 9 −/y) animals die in utero. The DUSP 9 gene is on the X chromosome, and this pattern of embryonic lethality {{is consistent with the}} selective inactivation of the paternal X chromosome in the extraembryonic tissues of the mouse, suggesting that DUSP 9 /MKP 4 performs an essential function during placental development. Examination of embryos between 8 and 10. 5 days postcoitum confirmed that lethality was due to a failure of labyrinth development, and this correlates exactly with the normal expression pattern of DUSP 9 /MKP- 4 in the trophoblast giant cells and labyrinth of the placenta. Finally, when the <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> was rescued, male null (DUSP 9 −/y) embryos developed to term, appeared normal, and were fertile.

40|$|The primary <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> in preeclampsia is shallow {{trophoblast}} {{invasion of}} the decidua leading to incomplete vascular transformation and inadequate uteroplacental perfusion. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1 (sFlt- 1) seems to interfere with these events by inhibiting local angiogenesis and/or by impeding trophoblast invasion. Preeclampsia is also associated with maternal thrombophilias and decidual hemorrhage, which form thrombin from decidual cell-expressed tissue factor. Although sFlt- 1 is highly expressed by trophoblasts, sFlt- 1 expression has not been studied in decidual cells, which are the predominant cell type encountered by invading trophoblasts. Here, we demonstrate that isolated decidual cells express sFlt- 1 mRNA, suggesting that they can synthesize sFlt- 1. Moreover, in first trimester decidual cells, thrombin enhanced sFlt- 1 mRNA levels, as measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and levels of secreted sFlt- 1 protein, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The thrombin antagonist hirudin blocked this effect, demonstrating that active thrombin is required. Emphasizing the specificity of the thrombin response, neither interleukin- 1 nor tumor necrosis factor- affected sFlt- 1 expression in the decidual cells. In contrast to first trimester decidual cells, thrombin did not affect sFlt- 1 levels in cultured term decidual cells.

Confluent decidual cells were primed for 7 days in either estradiol or estradiol plus medroxyprogesterone acetate to mimic the decidualizing steroidal milieu of the luteal phase and early pregnancy. The medium was exchanged for a serum-free defined medium containing corresponding steroids / tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - or interleukin (IL) - 1. After 24 hours, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements indicated that the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate did not affect MCP- 1 output, whereas 10 ng/ml of TNF- or IL- 1 increased output by 83. 5 -fold 20. 6 and 103. 1 -fold 14. 7, respectively (mean SEM, n 8, P < 0. 05). Concentration-response comparisons revealed that even 0. 01 ng/ml of TNF- or IL- 1 elevated MCP- 1 output by more than 15 -fold. Western blotting confirmed the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay results, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed corresponding effects on MCP- 1 mRNA levels. The current study demonstrates that TNF- and IL- 1 enhance MCP- 1 in first trimester decidua.

Mice surviving to term manifested hyposplenia and abnormal cardiac development. Analysis of global gene expression of Ott 1 -deficient embryonic hearts showed an enrichment of hypoxia-related genes and a significant alteration of several candidate genes critical for cardiac development.

Aromatization of fetal adrenal androgens is essential for the production of estrogens by the human placenta during pregnancy (10).

Under these conditions, Rb[superscript −/−];E 2 f 4 [superscript −/−] mutants survived to birth. These Rb[superscript −/−];E 2 f 4 [superscript −/−] embryos exhibited all of the defects characteristic of the Rb and E 2 f 4 single mutants and had no novel defects. Taken together, our data show that pRB and E 2 F 4 cooperate in placental development, but play largely non-overlapping roles in the development of many embryonic tissues. August 1, 2010 David H.

40|$|Preeclampsia is a {{systemic}} disease {{that results from}} <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> and occurs in about 5 – 8 % of pregnancies worldwide. Preeclampsia is a disease of many theories, wherein investigators put forward their favorite mechanistic ideas, each with a causal appeal for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. In reality, the patho-mechanism of preeclampsia remains largely unknown. Preeclampsia, as diagnosed in patients today, is likely a heterogeneous collection of disease entities that share some common features but also show important differences. Therefore, one single mechanism may never be found to explain all the variants of preeclampsia. Current research must focus on evaluating such diverse mechanisms, {{as well as the}} possible common effector pathways. Here, we provide a discussion of several possible mechanisms and putative theories proposed for preeclampsia, with particular emphasis on the recent discovery of a new genetic mouse model offering new opportunities to explore experimental therapies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Backgroud ERK 5 is {{a member}} of the mitogen {{activated}} protein kinase family activated by certain mitogenic or stressful stimuli in cells, but whose physiological role is largely unclear. Results To help determine the function of ERK 5 we have used gene targeting to inactivate this gene in mice. Here we report that ERK 5 knockout mice die at approximately E 10. 5. In situ hybridisation for ERK 5, and its upstream activator MKK 5, showed strong expression in the head and trunk of the embryo at this stage of development. Between E 9. 5 and E 10. 5, multiple developmental problems are seen in the ERK 5 -/- embryos, including an increase in apoptosis in the cephalic mesenchyme tissue, abnormalities in the hind gut, as well as problems in vascular remodelling, cardiac development and <b>placental</b> <b>defects.</b> Conclusion Erk 5 is essential for early embryonic development, and is required for normal development of the vascular system and cell survival. </p...|$|R
40|$|Deficiency of the {{transcription}} factor Cited 2 in mice results in cardiac malformation, adrenal agenesis, neural tube, <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> and partially penetrant cardiopulmonary laterality defects resulting from an abnormal Nodal->Pitx 2 c pathway. Here {{we show that}} a maternal high-fat diet more than doubles the penetrance of laterality defects and, surprisingly, induces palatal clefting in Cited 2 -deficient embryos. Both maternal diet and Cited 2 deletion reduce embryo weight and kidney and thymus volume. Expression profiling identified 40 embryonic transcripts including Pitx 2 that were significantly affected by embryonic genotype-maternal diet interaction. We show that a high-fat diet reduces Pitx 2 c levels > 2 -fold in Cited 2 -deficient embryos. Taken together, these results define a novel interaction between maternal high-fat diet and embryonic Cited 2 deficiency that affects Pitx 2 c expression and results in abnormal laterality. They suggest that appropriate modifications of maternal diet may prevent such defects in humans...|$|R
40|$|The growth suppressive {{functions}} of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), the first identified tumor suppressor, are considerably mediated through the repression of the E 2 F transcription factors. Functional inactivation of pRB, and subsequent deregulation of E 2 F activity, is a critical event {{in the formation of}} most human cancers. pRB {{is a member of the}} pocket protein family, which includes p 107 and p 130. The pocket proteins have some functional redundancy; however, they have differential binding properties to the E 2 Fs and make very different contributions to the suppression of tumors. The E 2 F proteins that associate with the pocket proteins can be divided into two groups based on structural and functional similarities. The activating E 2 Fs, E 2 F 1, E 2 F 2 and E 2 F 3 a, are exclusively regulated by pRB and are primarily involved in activating the transcription of E 2 F-responsive genes that are required for cell cycle progression. The repressive E 2 Fs, E 2 F 3 b, E 2 F 4 and E 2 F 5, are regulated by the entire pocket protein family and are important for transcriptional repression. Mechanistically, the inappropriate proliferation promoted by the absence of pRB is, in large part, attributed to the activating E 2 Fs. This study investigates the contribution of a repressive E 2 F, E 2 F 4, to the growth inhibitory properties of pRB during normal development and tumorigenesis. The characterization of mutant mice demonstrated that E 2 F 4 loss significantly suppresses tumor formation in the Rb+/- animals. Molecular analyses suggest a novel mechanism in which p 107 and p 130 compensate for the loss of pRB by re-establishing the proper regulation of the activating E 2 Fs. The function of E 2 F 4 in the developmental phenotypes arising from homozygous mutation of Rb was also assessed. (cont.) In contrast to the tumor setting, E 2 F 4 loss aggravated the <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> in the Rb-/- mice, resulting in earlier lethality. Furthermore, there was no cooperation between E 2 F 4 and pRB within the developing embryo. These results indicate that E 2 F 4 acts in a manner differing from the activating E 2 Fs in mediating the effects of pRB deficiency in development. Thus, this study has established that E 2 F 4 is a key downstream effector of pRB and has reshaped our understanding of the roles of the activating and repressive E 2 Fs with respect to the pocket proteins. by Eunice Y.

40|$|D 6 is an {{atypical}} chemokine receptor {{related to}} CCR 1 - 5 that binds to many inflammatory CC chemokines. Experiments using transfected cell lines {{have shown that}} upon binding to a chemokine ligand D 6 does not trigger cellular signalling pathways, but rather acts to scavenge the bound ligand. It achieves this by constitutively travelling {{to and from the}} cell surface via early and recycling endosomes, internalising chemokines bound when it is at the cell surface. Over time, D 6 removes a large amount of ligands from the extracellular compartment. In vivo, this scavenging activity is thought to regulate the level of CC chemokines, and thus controls inflammation locally and systemically. Lack of D 6 has been shown to result in elevated amounts of bioavailable chemokines, and is associated with over exuberant inflammatory responses. In human, D 6 mRNA and protein is highly expressed in trophoblast-derived gestational tissues. The expression of D 6 mRNA in the placenta is by far the highest, compared to other solid tissues being studied. The importance of D 6 in protecting the offspring has been demonstrated in animals. In pigs, a defect in D 6 expression was discovered in placental attachment sites in endometrium from arresting fetuses. In mice, lack of D 6 results in an increase in fetal loss after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or antiphospolipid autoantibodies (aPL), and {{an increase in the number}} of abnormal pups when mouse embryos are transferred into fully allogeneic pseudo-pregnant female recipients. In view of these results suggesting a critical role for D 6 in placental mediated complications, the expression and molecular function of D 6 in primary human trophoblast cells were studied, as to date in vitro human studies have utilised the choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo or immortalised cell lines engineered to over-express exogenous D 6. Secondly the impact of D 6 deficiency on placental structure, chemokine expression and leukocyte abundance in mice was examined. Chapter 3 presents the results of experiments on primary human trophoblasts. Protocols for routine primary trophoblast isolation, purification and culture from fresh term placentas were optimised in our laboratory. D 6 mRNA was detected in these primary cells. Using Western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, D 6 was shown to be present predominantly in the intracellular vesicles of the cells. Competition chemokine uptake assays, analysed by flow cytometry, showed that CCL 2 was internalised by trophoblasts using D 6. Competitive chemokine scavenging assays, analysed by quantitative Western blot, confirmed that D 6 was functioning as a chemokine scavenger on primary human trophoblasts and that it progressively removed substantial quantities of chemokine from medium bathing the cells. This is the first set of experiments that confirms D 6 is present, and functioning as a chemokine scavenger in primary human cells. Chapter 4 contains the results from the mouse experiments. Even in an unchallenged environment it was shown that, on the DBA- 1 genetic background, D 6 deficiency in the mother and pups leads to higher rates of stillbirth and neonatal deaths, resulting in a reduction in the number of pups weaned per litter than their WT counterparts. By gestational age E 14, pup weight was significantly smaller in the D 6 KO mice. Using stereological techniques, the placenta of the D 6 KO mice at this gestation was found to have a smaller labyrinthine zone. The volume of the labyrinthine zone was positively correlated with pup/placenta ratio. These phenotypes could be due to a maternal or fetal effect of D 6 deficiency. To ascertain the answer to this question, the experiment at E 14 was extended by breeding DBA- 1 females heterozygous for the deleted D 6 allele (D 6 HET) with D 6 deficient (D 6 KO) males. In this model the phenotypes of D 6 KO pups and placentas could be compared with their D 6 HET siblings that developed in a mother expressing some D 6 (i. e. D 6 HET). Although there were no differences in pup weight, placental weight and pup/placenta ratio between these two groups, stereology revealed a decrease in labyrinthine zone volume fraction in the D 6 KO placentas in comparison to their D 6 HET siblings. The observed fetal compromise and <b>placental</b> <b>defect</b> at E 14 was not apparent at the later gestational age of E 18. Luminex multiplex protein assay showed an elevated level of circulating chemokine CCL 2 in the serum of D 6 KO pregnant mice in comparison to their WT counterpart, so loss of chemokine regulation could be responsible for the defects observed in D 6 deficient placentas. In summary, D 6 deficiency results in an increase in perinatal death, a fundamental defect in placental formation (reduced labyrinthine zone) and dysregulation of circulating chemokine levels. Chapter 5 discusses the mechanisms of D 6 in regulating placental formation and reproductive outcome and the novel insights that this work provided into placental D 6 function. It also describes the design of future experiments to reveal the precise role of D 6 in chemokine regulation and cell signalling in reproductive immunology, and discusses how D 6 might contribute to pregnancy outcome in humans...|$|E
40|$|Dlx 3 is a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} {{and a member}} of the vertebrate Distal-less family. Targeted deletion of the mouse Dlx 3 gene results in embryonic death between day 9. 5 and day 10 because of <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> that alter the development of the labyrinthine layer. In situ hybridization reveals that the Dlx 3 gene is initially expressed in ectoplacental cone cells and chorionic plate, and later in the labyrinthine trophoblast of the chorioallantoic placenta, where major defects are observed in the Dlx 3 −/− embryos. The expression of structural genes, such as 4311 and PL- 1, which were used as markers to follow the fate of different derivatives of the placenta, was not affected in the Dlx 3 -null embryos. However, by day 10. 5 of development, expression of the paired-like homeodomain gene Esx 1 was strongly down-regulated in affected placenta tissue, suggesting that Dlx 3 is required for the maintenance of Esx 1 expression, normal placental morphogenesis, and embryonic survival...|$|R
40|$|Uterine NK cells (uNK) are innate {{lymphoid cells}} (ILC) that {{populate}} the uterus and expand during pregnancy, regulating placental development and fetal growth in humans and mice. We have recently characterised {{the composition of}} uterine ILCs (uILCs), some of which require the transcription factor NFIL 3, but {{the extent to which}} NFIL 3 -dependent cells support successful reproduction in mice is unknown. By mating Nfil 3 -/- females with wild-type males, here we show the effects of NFIL 3 deficiency in maternal cells on both the changes in uILCs during pregnancy and the downstream consequences on reproduction. Despite the presence of CD 49 a+Eomes- uILC 1 s and the considerable expansion of residual CD 49 a+Eomes+ tissue-resident NK cells and uILC 3 s in pregnant Nfil 3 -/- mice, we found incomplete remodelling of uterine arteries and decidua, <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> and fetal growth restriction in litters of normal size. These results show that maternal NFIL 3 mediates non-redundant functions in mouse reproduction...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{importance}} of maternal folate consumption for normal development is well established, yet the molecular mechanism linking folate metabolism to development remains poorly understood. The enzyme methionine synthase reductase (Mtrr) {{is necessary for}} utilization of methyl groups from the folate cycle. We found that a hypomorphic mutation of the mouse Mtrr gene results in intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay, and congenital malformations, including neural tube, heart, and <b>placental</b> <b>defects.</b> Importantly, these defects were dependent upon the Mtrr genotypes of the maternal grandparents. Furthermore, we observed widespread epigenetic instability associated with altered gene expression in the placentas of wild-type grandprogeny of Mtrr-deficient maternal grandparents. Embryo transfer experiments revealed that Mtrr deficiency in mice lead to two distinct, separable phenotypes: adverse effects on their wild-type daughters’ uterine environment, leading to growth defects in wild-type grandprogeny, {{and the appearance of}} congenital malformations independent of maternal environment that persist for five generations, likely through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

40|$|SummaryThe rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex 2 (mTORC 2) {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to play an important}} role in growth factor-dependent signaling. To explore this possibility further in a mammalian model system, we disrupted the expression of rictor, a specific component of mTORC 2, in mice by using a multiallelic gene targeting strategy. Embryos that lack rictor develop normally until E 9. 5, and then exhibit growth arrest and die by E 11. 5. Although <b>placental</b> <b>defects</b> occur in null embryos, an epiblast-specific knockout of rictor only delayed lethality by a few days, thereby suggesting other important roles for this complex in the embryo proper. Analyses of rictor null embryos and fibroblasts indicate that mTORC 2 is a primary kinase for Ser 473 of Akt/PKB. Rictor null fibroblasts exhibit low proliferation rates, impaired Akt/PKB activity, and diminished metabolic activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that both rictor and mTORC 2 are essential for the development of both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues...|$|R
