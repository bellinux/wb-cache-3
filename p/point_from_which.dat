5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous {{position in the}} Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to this situation, a small, D-shaped stone fortification was built to protect Fowey Harbour in Cornwall, then an important centre for trade. The harbour was reached through the Fowey estuary, which the local town had protected in the previous century with two blockhouses positioned along the river's edge—the Fowey and Polruan blockhouses—and a boom chain strung between them. The new castle replaced these and was located high on the headland overlooking {{the entrance to the}} estuary itself, St Catherine's <b>Point,</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> it took its name.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Auburn {{took over}} on offense at its six-yard line—the <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> Tech {{had missed the}} kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown {{returned}} to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.|$|E

25|$|In Western Sahara, young Sahrawis held {{a series}} of minor demonstrations to protest labour discrimination, lack of jobs, looting of resources, and human rights abuses. Although protests from February 2011 onward were related to {{a series of}} Sahrawi demonstrations outside El Aaiun that {{originated}} in October 2010 and died down the following month, protesters cited inspiration from the events {{in other parts of the}} region. Noam Chomsky viewed the October protests as the starting <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> 'the current wave of protests actually began'.|$|E
25|$|There are two islands on {{the crest}} of the falls that are large enough to divide the curtain of water even at full flood: Boaruka Island (or Cataract Island) near the western bank, and Livingstone Island near the middle—the <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> Livingstone first viewed the falls. At less than full flood, {{additional}} islets divide the curtain of water into separate parallel streams. The main streams are named, in order from Zimbabwe (west) to Zambia (east): Devil's Cataract (called Leaping Water by some), Main Falls, Rainbow Falls (the highest) and the Eastern Cataract.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{germination}} {{has three}} stages; hydration, activation and pollen tube emergence. The pollen grain is severely dehydrated {{so that its}} mass is reduced enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. Germination only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature germination does not {{take place in the}} anther. Hydration allows the plasma membrane of the pollen grain to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become concentrated at the <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> the pollen tube will emerge. Hydration and activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow.|$|E

25|$|Until 1899, when South Station opened, the Boston {{terminal}} was at Park Square, with a crossing {{at grade}} of the Boston and Worcester Railroad {{at the current}} merge at Back Bay station (also opened in 1899, serving only the B). The original Providence terminal was at Fox <b>Point,</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> it ran east along the Seekonk River shore and over the river via the India Point Railroad Bridge into East Providence (then part of Seekonk, Massachusetts) before turning north towards Boston. A ferry across the Providence River connected Fox Point to the South Providence terminal of the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (opened 1837). The former mainline became the freight-only East Junction Branch.|$|E
25|$|Lowerson's {{promotion}} to sergeant was made permanent {{while he was}} still recovering from his wounding at Bullecourt. He rejoined his battalion in November 1917. On 1 September 1918, during the Battle of Mont St Quentin, 21st Battalion supported 23rd and 24th Battalions in an attack towards the village of Mont St Quentin. Lowerson's company was held up in its advance on the flank of the village and, with a party of seven men, attacked and captured a strong <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> heavy machinegun fire was directed towards the advancing Australians. The advance was able to continue. Lowerson, wounded, was sent to the rear but it was a further two days before he was dispatched to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|The provincial {{government}} {{was aware of}} these issues as early as 1972, when a Ministry of Highways report recommended developing a new ferry route between Iona Island south of Vancouver and Gabriola Island south of Nanaimo. Another report recommending the same solution was produced in 1988. This proposed route is 22 kilometres shorter than the current route and would have also eliminated the problems with ferry terminal traffic. Ultimately, the government did build a new ferry terminal for Nanaimo: Duke Point, which opened in 1997 and which serves as terminus for the ferry route from Tsawwassen. Duke Point was intended to divert truck traffic away from the Horsesehoe Bay-Departure Bay route. This situation was the starting <b>point</b> <b>from</b> <b>which</b> the fast ferry project developed.|$|E
