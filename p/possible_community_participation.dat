Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were performed with regard to malaria prevention and community-based environmental hygiene training workshops in three local communities in Lagos, Nigeria. Qualitative evaluation revealed the importance of establishment of close partnerships between local governmental and non-governmental organizations, and <b>possible</b> <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in the program for its success. A total of 36 participants completed pre- and follow-up assessment {{before and after the}} three-day training course.

This mean gain of 29. 3 +/- 17. 4 in the score represented a significant improvement (p < 0. 001). The objective of the training workshop, i. e., to implement the community-based environmental hygiene program, was successfully achieved.

40|$|General {{approaches}} {{that have been}} developed for facilitating <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in coastal/estuarine management initiatives in the UK are considered and their implementation reviewed. It is argued that rural communities are more willing to participate proactively in such initiatives and that their relatively close association with the natural resources in question dictates that such participation is of particular importance. Urban communities, on the other hand, are less closely associated with natural resources and are less likely to take an interest in such initiatives, whilst recreational communities, especially those that are relatively diffuse, are more likely to take a reactive role in objecting to proposed management restrictions.

40|$|Does {{the fishery}} {{management}} {{regime in the}} Indian context require a reinvigoration? This {{is one of the}} queries which often becomes conspicuous, while speaking the present fishery management system prevailing in a developing country like India. Though the answer for the question is ‘yes’, it can also be a debatable issue highlighting both affirmative and negative sides of fishery management in the strict literal sense. Rather than exploring the intricacies of the meaning of ‘re-invigoration’ with a surgical postmortem approach, this paper is a simple and subtle effort on addressing the sociological issues by harnessing the paradigm of co-management ultimately for augmenting the fishery management perspective in the Indian context. It is a truth that, in the scenario of Indian Fisheries Management regime, the ‘questions’ are very tough and timid, but answers are so simple and known to everyone, though the impediment is the practical implementation part. The open access regime prevailing in the harvesting of marine fishery resources in our country warrants stronger emphasis on invoking technological innovations as well as management paradigms that reconcile livelihood issues with concerns on resource conservation. It is a truth that, innovations do not emerge in a socio-political vacuum.

40|$|The {{premise of}} this thesis is the {{relationship}} between <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> and public satisfaction in urban renewal projects. Public satisfaction is different from those evaluation indicators used in most previous studies. Public satisfaction level evaluates performance of renewal projects based on public’s perspectives instead of a set of standards. Performances of renewal projects in satisfying the public personally, in environmental and social aspects were appraised. Both quantity and quality of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> of the renewal projects and other factors believed to have effects on people’s perception were studied. Quantity of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> was measured as <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> level based on the variety of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> activities organized in the renewal projects, while quality of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> was assessed by the satisfaction level on <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> perceived by the public using questionnaire survey. Also, public satisfaction levels of renewal projects in different aspects were collected by questionnaire survey. The relationship between <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> and public satisfaction was examined by linear regression analysis. Data was collected from 181 respondents responding to 5 sample projects regarding their satisfaction level towards the renewal projects in different aspects. Quality of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> and public satisfaction level of urban renewal projects are positively related in different aspects while negative effect of quantity of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> on the public satisfaction level was found. It is anticipated that if the public are satisfied with the <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> activities organized in a renewal project, they will also be satisfied with the project itself. However, results unexpectedly showed that public satisfaction level would increase as less <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> activities were organized in the renewal projects. This thesis gives insights into the optimum practice of community involvement in renewal projects and that of urban renewal to satisfy the public’s needs. The results are suggestive to the ideas that private developments can better formulate the needs of the public and the public concern more about the quality of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> than the variety or number of it. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the notion}} of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism {{originates}} from the general concept of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in development studies, {{the subject of the}} former seems to have evolved and popularized in isolation from the meaning and scope of its origin. This article reveals that such isolation has ushered in a rigid and simple paradigm of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism.

It is suggested that the concept of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> should be re-considered in terms of an adaptive categorical paradigm, which incorporates a range of various forms of <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> These forms of participation are outlined for a variety of abstract situations with the aim of illustrating the legitimacy of different forms of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism...|$|R
40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>participation</b> is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} as one important condition to achieve sustainable tourism development. The twelve aims of sustainable tourism {{determined by the}} United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) emphasises the significance of destination community, for example, local control, local prosperity and community well-being. This is because local people are the effected groups who are most directly impacted by tourism. Based on literature, generally <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in developing countries appears {{to be at a}} low level, particularly in participation in tourism planning and decision making which largely affects <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism operation and management, and receiving benefits. Literature also reveals several obstacles impeding <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> Therefore, this research aims to explore how <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> works in Thailand. Although the tourism industry in Thailand has grown enormously and rapidly within the last five decades, benefits from tourism are mostly restricted to large enterprises while local people participate at low levels and gain very little despite being burdened with negative impacts of tourism in their respective communities. This research explored issues surrounding <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism in two case study communities; Koh Samet, a community at the ‘consolidation stage’ of Butler’s Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC), and Mae Kam Pong, a community at the ‘involvement’ stage of the TALC. Forms of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> are assessed through three issues: participation in tourism planning and decision making; participation in tourism operation and management, and participation in benefits from tourism. Both qualitative methods (interviews, participant observation) and quantitative methods (surveys) were employed to collect data from two case study communities. ‘Social capital’ was a central concept utilised to examine <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism development. This concept has been widely used in many fields at the community level, for example public health and natural resource management, however, there are few studies exploring the relationship of social capital and community tourism development. The literature that does exist suggests that communities with high levels of social capital {{are more likely to have}} extensive <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism development. Findings from the Thai context show that <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism decision making is evidenced from the low to the high rungs of Arnstein’s (1969) ladder of citizen participation. This research explains what makes <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> different based on three themes. The first theme is that <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism development may be influenced by the social capital. The findings reveal that social capital is significantly associated with <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism development; however, social capital alone may not be sufficient to foster effective <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism development in these communities. It is argued that power relations and cultural factors appear to have a strong influence on <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> The second theme is that communities at different stages of tourism development tend to have different levels of forms of participation. It seems promoting a high level of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> may be easier when tourism is at the initial stage of development, but becomes more difficult as communities shift to later stages in the TALC. A process to monitor <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> over time is vitally required to ensure the balance of power within the community which appears to be a significant condition to achieve genuine <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> Lastly, the levels and forms of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> are likely to occur at a higher level at the communities where tourism is developed as community-based, rather than mass tourism. These findings may have important implications for ensuring genuine <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in tourism development in other parts of Thailand, and perhaps the developing world...|$|R

Through a process of synthesising existing evidence for the effectiveness of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in terms of health outcomes we identified several conceptual areas of confusion. This paper builds on earlier work to disentangle the conceptual gaps in this area, and clarify our common understanding of <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> We conducted a research synthesis of 689 empirical studies in the literature linking rural <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> and health outcomes. The 37 final papers were grouped and analysed according to: contextual factors; the conceptual approach to <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> (using a modification of an existing typology); <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> process; level of evidence; and outcomes reported. Although there is some evidence of benefit of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in terms of health outcomes, we found only a few studies demonstrating higher levels of evidence. However, it is clear that absence of evidence of effect is not necessarily the same as absence of an effect. We focus on areas of debate and lack of clarity in the literature.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{informal}} peace committees have rapidly {{made their}} mark either as precautionary or as response mechanisms to particular conflicts. Their main {{purpose is to}} prevent the eruption or escalation of nascent micro-level conflict into violent and more widespread conflicts. This article reports on aspects of a larger research project in which the researcher collaborated with local communities to create a ward-level peace committee in ward 8 of Seke district, Mashonaland East province, Zimbabwe. Objective: To test whether and under what conditions informal peace committees can effectively help to contribute to peacebuilding at local community level. Method: The study applied participatory action research to design, implement and evaluate the peace committee initiative with 15 individual members in ward 8 of Seke district. The study first conducted a 10 -member focus group. Secondly, a follow-up in-depth interview on five focus group members and seven more involved in peacebuilding provided feedback {{on the effectiveness of}} informal peace committees. Results: The study showed that creating informal peace committees is <b>possible,</b> as <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in the design, implementation and day-to-day operations of such initiatives guarantees their sustainability even without external funding. One of the comparative advantages of informal peace committees is that all social groups in the community have equal chances of being represented, thus helping to meet the needs and aspirations of the community at large. The study further revealed that informal peace committees are faced with a number of limitations. The major one is that they do not enjoy official recognition from government, in spite of their critical role in contributing to peace in their host communities. Conclusion: The strengths of informal peace committees are that they are self-initiated; they represent the interests of the host community and can be replicated...|$|R

40|$|Context: Internationally, <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> is {{highlighted}} in health policy reform {{as good for}} rural communities. Implicit in this policy is {{the message that the}} complexities of the rural environment are too difficult for easy solutions and that <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> will somehow build resilient, self-determining communities capable of dealing with complex rural access and equity issues and poorer health outcomes. The underpinning proposition is that by giving decision-making powers to community members, health care will be locally responsive, costs will be contained, and health outcomes will improve. What happens in the practice of enacting <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in health-care decision making is less clear. Objective: Despite the growing body of work that documents different levels and models of <b>community</b> <b>participation,</b> significant gaps that outline the practical challenges inherent in rural <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> remain.

Besides, the issues of health education and <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> regarding breast cancer prevention are not similar to other activities included into primary health care services, such as family planning in Iran. Within this context, increasing the <b>participation</b> of women <b>community</b> regarding breast cancer prevention, through recognized channels such as health workers, community leaders, health educators, health care professionals, teachers and women volunteers should be given high priority at on the community, district, province and national levels. Local <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in health and wellbeing is strongly supported as a fundamental element to development. Thus, the objective of the current study was to identify the levels of women’s <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in community-based program on breast cancer prevention. The study involves a cross sectional survey of women who have participated in mammography in the last two years (n= 86). The actual level of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> was assessed based on Rifkin’s perspective. Using five levels of participation in health programs by Rifkin (1991), the study examined the feasibility of public participation in health and relieves effort on breast cancer prevention based on local <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> The stud...|$|R

The study also reviews the methodological characteristics of community participation's theory and measurement and its association to rural tourism environment. The extant literature is revisited to establish taxonomy of the methodological procedures for measuring <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> from the context of rural tourism. Hence, proposing a comprehensive conceptual framework featuring its multifaceted, intertwined and progressive nature for <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in a rural tourism environment...|$|R
40|$|The extant {{literature}} suggests that <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> is an important ingredient for the successful delivery of post-disaster housing reconstruction projects. Even though policy-makers, international funding bodies and non-governmental organisations broadly appreciate the value of <b>community</b> <b>participation,</b> post-disaster reconstruction practices systematically fail to follow, or align with, existing policy statements. Research into past experiences has led many authors to argue that post-disaster reconstruction is the least successful physically visible arena of international cooperation. Why is the principle of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> not evident in the veracity of reconstructions already carried out on the ground? This paper discusses and develops the concepts of, and challenges to, <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> and the subsequent negative and positive effects on post-disaster reconstruction projects outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Issue addressed: <b>Community</b> <b>participation</b> {{is vital}} if sexual health {{disadvantage}} among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young {{people is to}} be addressed, {{yet there is a}} paucity of literature examining this issue. Methods: The development, nature and impact of a <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> strategy for sexual health, implemented in two North Queensland sites, provided the opportunity for a systematic study, using qualitative and grounded theory analytic methods, of the factors that enable and constrain <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in this context. A total of 30 people participated, in individual interviews and focus groups. Results: The <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> strategy was fundamental to the development of culturally and community congruent sexual health initiatives. There were also signs of a changing discourse in community around sexual health. Factors that enabled effective <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> involved individual attributes, structured group processes, organisational support, empowering external relationships, a culturally sensitive strategy and enhanced health and wellbeing. Conclusion: The model developed here identifies factors that enable <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> and mobilisation, thus providing a valuable tool for health practitioners seeking to plan and evaluate strategies that address entrenched disadvantage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations...|$|R
40|$|The year 2008 {{marked the}} 30 year anniversary of Primary Health Care, the health policy of all member {{nations of the}} WHO. <b>Community</b> <b>participation</b> {{was one of the}} key {{principles}} of this policy. This article reviews the experiences of and lessons learned by policy makers, planners and programme managers in attempting to integrate <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> into their health programmes. The lessons, identified in an earlier article by the author, are still relevant today. They help to identify three reasons why integrating <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> into health programmes is so difficult. These reasons are: (1) the dominance of the bio-medical paradigm as the main planning tool for programmes, leading to the view of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> as an intervention; (2) the lack of in-depth analysis of the perceptions of community members regarding the use of community health workers; and (3) the propensity to use a framework that limits investigation into what works, why and how in <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in health programmes. Despite these challenges, evidence suggests that <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> has contributed to health improvements at the local level, particularly in poor communities, {{and will continue to be}} relevant to programme professionals...|$|R
40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>participation</b> {{is a major}} {{principle}} of people centered health systems, with considerable research highlighting its intrinsic value and strategic importance. Existing reviews largely focus {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> with less attention to how <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> is supported in health systems intervention research. To explore the extent, nature and quality of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in health systems intervention research in low- and middle-income countries. We searched for peer-reviewed, English language literature published between January 2000 and May 2012 through four electronic databases. Search terms combined the concepts of community, capability/participation, health systems research and low- and middle-income countries. The initial search yielded 3, 092 articles, of which 260 articles with more than nominal <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> were identified and included. We further excluded 104 articles due to lower levels of <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> across the research cycle and poor description of the process of <b>community</b> <b>participation.</b> Out of the remaining 160 articles with rich <b>community</b> <b>participation,</b> we further examined 64 articles focused on service delivery and governance within health systems research. Most articles were led by authors in high income countries and many did not consistently list critical aspects of study quality. Articles were most likely to describe <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in health promotion interventions (78 %, 202 / 260), even though they were less participatory than other health systems areas. Community involvement in governance and supply chain management was less common (12 %, 30 / 260 and 9 %, 24 / 260 respectively), but more participatory. Articles cut across all health conditions and varied by scale and duration, with those that were implemented at national scale or over more than five years being mainstreamed by government. Most articles detailed improvements in service availability, accessibility and acceptability, with fewer efforts focused on quality, and few designs able to measure impact on health outcomes. With regards to participation, most articles supported community's in implementing interventions (95 %, n = 247 / 260), in contrast to involving communities in identifying and defining problems (18 %, n = 46 / 260). Many articles did not discuss who in communities participated, with just over a half of the articles disaggregating any information by sex. Articles were largely under theorized, and only five mentioned power or control. Majority of the articles (57 / 64) described <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> processes as being collaborative with fewer describing either community mobilization or community empowerment. Intrinsic individual motivations, community-level trust, strong external linkages, and supportive institutional processes facilitated <b>community</b> <b>participation,</b> while lack of training, interest and information, along with weak financial sustainability were challenges. Supportive contextual factors included decentralization reforms and engagement with social movements. Despite positive examples, <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> in health systems interventions was variable, with few being truly community directed. Future research should more thoroughly engage with <b>community</b> <b>participation</b> theory, recognize the power relations inherent in <b>community</b> <b>participation,</b> and be more realistic as to how much communities can participate and cognizant of who decides that...|$|R
