2500|$|Herbivores {{can avoid}} plant {{defenses}} by eating plants selectively {{in space and}} time. For the winter moth, feeding on oak leaves {{early in the season}} maximized the amount of protein and nutrients available to the moth, while minimizing the amount of tannins produced by the tree. Herbivores can also spatially avoid plant defenses. [...] The piercing mouthparts of species in Hemiptera allow them to feed around areas of high toxin concentration. Several species of caterpillar feed on maple leaves by [...] "window feeding" [...] on <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> and avoiding the tough areas, or those with a high lignin concentration. Similarly, the cotton leaf perforator selectively avoids eating the epidermis and pigment glands of their hosts, which contain defensive terpenoid aldehydes. Some plants only produce toxins in small amounts, and rapidly deploy them to the area under attack. Some beetles counter this adaptation by attacking target plants in groups, thereby allowing each individual beetle to avoid ingesting too much toxin. Some animals ingest large amounts of poisons in their food, but then eat clay or other minerals, which neutralize the poisons. This behavior is known as geophagy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{start with}} a mini-survey on some {{problems}} of pseudoperiodic topology. In {{the main part of}} the paper we consider analogs of irrational winding lines on a torus for arbitrary Riemann surfaces. These analogs are leaves of folia-tions defined by closed differential 1 -forms. We study asymptotic topological dynamics of the winding lines. We take long <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> leaves of the foliation and consider the behavior of cycles obtained by joining the endpoints <b>of</b> each <b>piece</b> by short segments. We prove that generically there is a flag of subspaces V 1 ⊂ V 2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Vg ⊆ V ⊂ H 1 (M 2 g;R) in the first homology group with the following properties. The 1 -dimensional subspace V 1 is spanned by the asymptotic cycle.

50|$|The {{church of}} ST. PETER AND ALL SAINTS {{is a small}} aisleless {{building}} set on the south slope of a hill, its earliest part dating apparently from {{the last quarter of}} the 13th century. There is a two-light window of this date in the south wall of the nave near the west end, and opposite to it in the north wall a single lancet, their late date being shown by the existence of original glass grooves. The nave is 41 ft. by 21 ft., and in its south-west corner a tower has been built in the 15th century, evidently on insufficient foundations, as it has gone over south-westwards, and is much buttressed and patched in consequence. The chancel is probably of early 14th-century date, though nothing but the chancel arch now remains to show detail of that time; its east window is modern, and its two south windows much restored 16th-century two-light openings. Between them is a plain doorway, and there is a square recess with no sign of a drain below the south-east window. On either side of the east window are 15th-century image brackets carried by angels, whose very modern heads do not agree well with their mediaeval bodies, and in the north wall is a square plastered recess. The chancel arch has good moulded capitals and stops to its chamfered arch, but of the moulded base only a small piece remains.The nave had a rood-stair at the south-east, of which only the lower doorway remains, and next to it a wide two-light 15th-century window. In the north wall is a 17th-century window of three lights with a transom, and west of it a two-light 15th-century window, and there is a squint to the chancel in the north jamb of the chancel arch. The north doorway of the nave is plain 14th-century work under a small and late porch, and west of it is the lancet already mentioned. There is no trace of a south door to the nave, but high in the wall about midway on this side is a plain and late two-light window, intended to serve a gallery east of the tower, now removed. The low-pitched nave roof has late 15th-century moulded tie-beams, purlins, &c., and the chancel roof is modern.The tower has simple chamfered arches to the nave on the east and north, and in its west wall is a doorway now blocked by a red brick buttress, but originally opening to a stair turret. The belfry windows are plain two-light openings, and the exterior of the church is very much overgrown with ivy. The font has a rough circular bowl with four <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> carving, apparently of late 12th-century date, and stands in the eastern tower arch. On the north of the chancel arch is a wall monument to Lady Elizabeth Duncombe undated, on the south another to William Duncombe, 1603, set up about 1640, and on the north wall of the nave a third to Sir John Duncombe, 1687.There are three bells, the treble and the tenor blank and the second of 1813.The plate consists of two communion cups of 1676, two standing patens of 1674, and a large paten given in 1696 by Elizabeth daughter of Nathaniel Reynes, vicar of the parish and of Friern Barnet.The earliest register book contains all entries from 1694 to 1807, but the marriages only till 1753; the second book is of marriages 1754 to 1799, and the third has marriages 1799 to 1812 and baptisms and burials 1807 to 1812.|$|E

40|$|Induction {{and growth}} of callus from seeds, stems and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana were {{successful}} on a Gamborg B 5 medium and on a modified B 5 medium (PG 2). Actively growing calluses have been obtained on agar and in liquid cultures. Cell suspension cultures were establiched on the same culture media, with cell densities up to 1. 6 · 106 cells/ml. A culture system is described which enables us to use large cell aggregates as a continuous source of single cells and small cell aggregates (containing up to 10 cells) for mutagenesis, plating and protoplast production. Arabidopsis plants were regenerated from young calluses grown in solid or liquid cultures, by a sequential transfer from a medium (PG 3), where shoot initiation takes place, to a PG 4 medium which induces root formation. The morphogenetic potential appeared {{to depend on the}} age of the callus in culture. A wide range of heteroploidy has been observed in tissue cultures. The influence of factors such as the age of the callus, the type of organ used to induce calluses, the hormone ratio and the composition of the medium was determined.

40|$|Citrus {{variegated}} chlorosis (CVC), {{caused by}} Xylella fastidiosa, {{is an important}} disease of citrus in Brazil. X. fastidiosa is restricted to xylem vessels of plants and knowledge regarding xylem colonization is still limited. Our goal was to verify how this bacterium colonizes and spreads within xylem vessels of sweet orange Citrus sinensis cv. Pêra. Petioles and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> blades from naturally infected plant exhibiting characteristic symptoms were prepared for light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold labeling (IGL). Petioles from healthy plants were used as control. IGL results, using an antibody against wall hemicelluloses, revealed that the pit membrane of vessels was altered. Bacterial cells were observed in the pit between adjacent vessels. Results support the contention that X. fastidiosa produces cellulases to reach adjacent vessels. SEM revealed that colonization of sweet orange started with X. fastidiosa cells attaching to the xylem wall, followed {{by an increase in}} the number of bacterial cells, the production of fibrous material, and finally vessel occlusion by biofilm composed of copious amounts of amorphous material, strands and cells. Phenolic materials, hyperplasia and hypertrophy were noticed in leaves with gummy material. Xylem vessels frequently contained an unknown needle-like, crystallized matter blocking the vessel...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{reports that}} the water {{potential}} of sliced leaf tissue is {{higher than that of}} unsliced control tissue are confirmed. The effect is shown to increase as damage to the tissue due to slicing is increased. However, {{there is some evidence that}} increase in damage beyond a certain point causes water potentials to fall again towards the control value. The electrical resistance of washings from sliced leaf tissue increases with increase in the time interval between slicing and washing. Both the rise in water potential of sliced tissue and the rise in electrical resistance of washings are partially and reversibly inhibited by low temperature. These results suggest that the remaining intact cells actively accumulate solutes released from the cells cut open on slicing. The sap from the sliced cells is thereby diluted and flows passively into the intact cells. Since pressure potential changes more rapidly with cell volume than does osmotic potential, the net result is a rise in the total water potential of sliced tissue. It is concluded that this effect may cause spuriously high water potential values to be measured if excessively small <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> tissue are used. This is demonstrated with stacks of annuli cut from leaves...|$|E
