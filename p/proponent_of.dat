40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{held that the}} ascription of truth to a sentence is intersubstitutable with that very sentence. However, the simplest subclassical logics available to <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> this view, namely K 3 and LP, are hopelessly weak for many purposes. In this paper, I argue that this is {{much more of a}} problem for <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> LP than for <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> K 3. The strategies for recapturing classicality offered by <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> LP are far less promising than those available to <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> K 3. This undermines the ability <b>of</b> <b>proponents</b> LP to engage in public reasoning in classical domains...|$|R

30|$|There is a {{long and}} {{interesting}} discussion between <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> internalism and <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> externalism, but to describe more than the shadowy lines of this discourse would go {{beyond the scope of}} this paper.|$|R
5|$|Andrew Jackson Houston (1854–1941) was a United States Senator. A {{graduate}} of West Point, {{he served in}} Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders during the Spanish–American War. He was a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> prohibition and supportive of suffrage for women. His first wife was Carrie Glenn Purnell; after her death, he remarried to Elizabeth Hart Good.|$|E
5|$|As an activist, Gordon {{was a key}} <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> the Woman Lawyer's Bill, {{which allowed}} women to {{practice}} law in California.

5|$|Cloud seeding {{was first}} {{attempted}} by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir. After witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals, Langmuir became an enthusiastic <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> weather modification.

50|$|<b>Proponents</b> <b>of</b> Nordic Israelism follow John Cox Gawler's {{identification}} of the Tribe of Dan with Denmark. However Gawler also placed Dan in Scotland and Ireland, an identification British Israelites follow, but <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> Nordic Israelism stress more on the identification with Denmark.|$|R
50|$|<b>Proponents</b> <b>of</b> such {{parties and}} {{movements}} advocate {{for them on}} the grounds of restoring law and order, respecting national sovereignty and maintaining individual national cultures. Critics have accused these <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> supporting neo-fascism, and using such tactics as fear-mongering, racism and xenophobia.|$|R
50|$|This {{makes it}} fair for the <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} motion (if only the substitute {{could be considered}} and passed, then the <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> the original motion wouldn't {{get a chance to}} advocate and possibly improve their motion if that was the case).|$|R

The event was considered a strategic coup for West, establishing the State's authority over a remote rural community and cementing {{his reputation as a}} <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> prohibition.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, President Donald Trump {{appointed}} Charmaine Yoest, an anti-abortion {{activist and}} <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> the abortion-breast cancer link, {{to the post}} of assistant secretary for public affairs in the Department of Health And Human Services.|$|E
50|$|Non-interventionism is {{distinct}} from and often confused with isolationism. <b>Proponents</b> <b>of</b> isolationism differ from <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> non-interventionism through their advocacy of economic nationalism (called also protectionism) and immigration reduction. Non-interventionism is a policy in government only and thus does not exclude non-governmental intervention by organizations.|$|R

Comparative studies have repeatedly shown {{that there is little}} or no overall safety advantage to either SAE or ECE beams; the two systems' acceptance and rejection by various countries is based primarily on which system is already in use.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of modern}} Palestinian {{politicians}} who are <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian self-determination include Saeb Erekat. In the one state solution, Palestinian self-determination usually {{takes the form}} of calls for Palestinian reunification, which would include a reversal of the 1948 UN decision for the partition of Palestine. Some Palestinian <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> self-determination such as Edward Said have drawn an analogy between Zionism and colonialism. Other <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian self-determination such as Jamil Effarah have made an analogy between the conditions in the Palestinian territories and the Bantustan land-reserves in apartheid era South Africa.|$|R

5|$|Unlike Confucianism, Taoism favors {{philosophical}} anarchism, {{pluralism and}} laissez-faire-government. Laozi {{has been cited}} as an early example of a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> liberalism. On the other hand, politics never have been a main issue in Taoism.|$|E
