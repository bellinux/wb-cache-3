50|$|This color {{matches the}} color of the Persian rose color sample in A Dictionary of Color—a highly {{saturated}} color close to the outer surface of the color sphere, just below the equator of the color sphere, about halfway between rose and magenta. The color Persian rose may also be described as a color close to the <b>purple</b> <b>boundary</b> of the CIE chromaticity diagram about halfway between rose and magenta.|$|E
50|$|RGB color model, {{although}} theoretically capable to {{get very}} close to the <b>purple</b> <b>boundary</b> due to its additive nature, does not usually do it practically due to light source limitations. The boundary of sRGB (pictured) goes roughly parallel to the line of purples, connecting primaries red and (color wheel) blue and hence the gamut of sRGB lacks all near-boundary purples. Magenta ink, a CMYK's primary, is also rather distant from the line for the reason explained above. Wide-gamut RGB color space approximates boundary purples better, but corresponding devices are expensive.|$|E
50|$|In color theory, {{the line}} of purples or the <b>purple</b> <b>boundary</b> is the locus {{on the edge of}} the {{chromaticity}} diagram between extreme spectral red and violet. Except for the endpoints, colors on {{the line of}} purples are not spectral. Line-of-purples colors and spectral colors are the only ones which are considered fully saturated in the sense that for any given point on the line of purples there exists no color involving a mixture of red and violet that is more saturated than it. There is no monochromatic light source able to generate a purple color. Instead, every color on the line of purples is produced by mixing a unique ratio of fully saturated red and fully saturated violet, at the extreme points of visibility on the spectrum of pure hues.|$|E

This map shows how Gisburn forms {{part of the}} {{territory}} which has been transferred from Yorkshire to Lancashire. Lancashire's old boundaries are in red, and new boundaries are in green.|$|R

5000|$|The line of <b>purples,</b> a {{theoretical}} <b>boundary</b> of chromaticity, {{should not be}} confused with [...] "purples", a more general color term which also refers to less than fully saturated colors (see variations of purple and variations of pink for possible examples) which form an interior of a triangle between white and the line of purples in the CIE chromaticity diagram.|$|R
5000|$|In 3-dimensional color spaces the [...] "line", if present, {{becomes a}} 2-dimensional shape. For example, in CIE XYZ it is a planar sector bounded by black-red and black-violet rays. In systems focused on pigment colors, such as Munsell and Pantone, <b>boundary</b> <b>purples</b> might be absent, because maximally {{possible}} lightness of a pigment vanishes when its chromaticity approaches {{the line of}} purples, such that near-boundary purple pigments become indistinguishable from black.|$|R
