The album was dedicated to characters from Get Smart, F-Troop and <b>Petticoat</b> Junction. They were awarded 'Best Debut Album' of 1984 at the July 1985 Countdown Music Awards. When Stoneage Romeos was released in America it stayed at number 1 in the Alternative/College charts for seven weeks, {{becoming one of the}} most played albums for the year on the college network.|$|E
5|$|Eaton and {{his wife}} lived comfortably in {{retirement}} in Washington, D.C. He resumed his law practice, and he and is wife returned to Franklin during the summers. Eaton chose not to join any church, but figured prominently in Washington social circles. He was President of the Washington Bar Association. Eaton {{and his wife}} were reported to have drank too much, and he was criticized for taking up a legal case against Amos Kendall, a staunch Jacksonian who had defended the Eatons' conduct during the <b>Petticoat</b> affair. Eaton died in Washington on November 17, 1856 at age 66. His funeral was conducted at his residence. Eaton was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake's death, rather than waiting for the usual {{mourning}} period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. <b>Petticoat</b> politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in {{the first months of}} the administration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Petticoats</b> were revived by Christian Dior in his full-skirted [...] "New Look" [...] of 1947 and tiered, ruffled, {{stiffened}} <b>petticoats</b> remained {{extremely popular}} during the 1950s, especially with teenage girls. Most of the <b>petticoats</b> were netlike crinoline, sometimes made of horsehair. Increasingly, nylon chiffon, taffeta, and organdy {{were used in}} <b>petticoats.</b> Many department stores carried an extensive variety of styles and colors of <b>petticoats</b> until the early 1960s (a few clothing and department stores sold them as late as 1970). They were also available through the famous Sears and J. C. Penney catalogues. Typically, at least three single <b>petticoats</b> were worn, until manufacturers began making double and triple layer <b>petticoats.</b> A narrow slip was usually worn under the <b>petticoats,</b> especially the crinoline type, because they tended to be [...] "scratchy".|$|R
50|$|Also, {{people who}} dress in period costumes have begun wearing <b>petticoats</b> {{for a more}} {{authentic}} look. A number of websites offer {{a great variety of}} <b>petticoats</b> for sale, while other websites show historic and modern photographs of <b>petticoats,</b> often worn by models.|$|R

5|$|Calhoun had a {{difficult}} relationship with Jackson primarily due to the Nullification Crisis and the <b>Petticoat</b> affair. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored the North, putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, {{with only a few}} months remaining in his second term, he resigned as vice president and entered the Senate. He sought the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1844, but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk, who went on to become president. Calhoun served as Secretary of State under John Tyler from 1844 to 1845. As Secretary of State, he supported the annexation of Texas as a means to extend the slave power, and helped settle the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain. He then returned to the Senate, where he opposed the Mexican–American War, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Compromise of 1850 before his death in 1850. Calhoun often served as a virtual party-independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and Whigs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close-Up, a celebrity tabloid, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. The Federal Communications Commission made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's {{apartment}} on Manhattan's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff, the head of Filmways, the producer of the Hillbillies, <b>Petticoat</b> Junction, Mister Ed, and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car {{paid for by the}} network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car. The company was also concerned about the money spent to buy Gleason's former home.|$|E
5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted <b>petticoat</b> stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} two decades of the 20th century, {{multiple}} <b>petticoats</b> fell out of fashion; narrow, sometimes tight, skirts became more common. Then, in the late 1920s, chiffon dresses with several sheer <b>petticoats</b> became fashionable. With the Great Depression in the 1930s, narrow skirts returned and <b>petticoats</b> again were unpopular {{until the end of}} the decade when revived for some evening, prom, and wedding gowns. World War II, with its rationing and general shortage of materials, brought an end to <b>petticoats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Edith Head {{designed}} {{a number of}} gowns and dresses, supported by multiple layers of <b>petticoats,</b> for actresses such as Grace Kelly and Doris Day, who appeared in Alfred Hitchcock films in the 1950s. Dinah Shore frequently wore dresses with <b>petticoats</b> on her NBC television shows Actress Connie Stevens, who appeared in television series and movies, said she wore <b>petticoats</b> {{as long as possible}} because she had wide hips. [...] Other entertainers who often wore <b>petticoats</b> were Brenda Lee, Connie Francis, and Patti Page.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of wearing <b>petticoats</b> as undergarments was well established by 1585. <b>Petticoats</b> were worn throughout history by women {{who wanted to}} have the currently fashionable shape created by their clothing. The <b>petticoats,</b> if sufficiently full or stiff, would hold the overskirt out in a pleasingly domed shape and {{give the impression of}} a smaller waist than the wearer actually had. It would also complement the desired large bust.|$|R
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in <b>Petticoat</b> Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E
5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton <b>petticoat</b> of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

50|$|There {{was a major}} {{attempt to}} revive {{separate}} <b>petticoats</b> in 1987. However, by that time, most women who wanted very full skirts for proms, parties, or weddings bought dresses or skirts with attached crinoline <b>petticoats.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Petticoats</b> {{are also}} making a {{comeback}} due to recent trends towards lavish weddings and grandiose bridal attire. <b>Petticoats</b> are commonly worn under bridal gowns with full skirts {{as a means of}} maintaining the gown's intended silhouette.|$|R
25|$|As in {{previous}} periods, the traditional riding habit {{consisted of a}} tailored jacket like a man's coat, worn with a high-necked shirt, a waistcoat, a <b>petticoat,</b> and a hat. Alternatively, the jacket and a false waistcoat-front might be a made as a single garment, {{and later in the}} period a simpler riding jacket and <b>petticoat</b> (without waistcoat) could be worn.|$|E
25|$|The final layer was the <b>petticoat,</b> {{which could}} have a scooped {{neckline}} and was sleeveless, and was fitted {{in the back with}} hooks and eyelets, buttons or tapes. These petticoats were often worn between the underwear and the outer dress and was considered part of the outer clothing not underwear. The lower edge of the <b>petticoat</b> was intended to be seen, since women would often lift their outer dresses to spare the relatively delicate material of the outer dress from mud or damp (so exposing only the coarser and cheaper fabric of the <b>petticoat</b> to risk). Often exposed to view, petticoats were decorated at the hem with rows of tucks or lace, or ruffles.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} decade saw Spanish breeches as {{the most}} popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called <b>petticoat</b> breeches became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving {{the impression of a}} lady's <b>petticoat.</b> They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee {{on the outside of the}} leg. Alongside the <b>petticoat</b> breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called rhinegraves, were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed <b>petticoat</b> breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.|$|E
50|$|Ruffled {{white or}} {{unbleached}} cotton <b>petticoats</b> were a brief fashion under Prairie skirts in the 1970s, and remain {{a component of}} Western wear. Short, full <b>petticoats</b> in the 1950s style are also commonly worn by squaredancers.|$|R
5000|$|Often, {{there are}} {{specific}} themes for said <b>petticoating.</b> Often, <b>petticoating</b> {{revolves around the}} [...] "little girl" [...] aspect in which the submissive/child is forced {{to act like a}} little girl. Other scenarios include Infantilism and Sissy Maid.|$|R
50|$|Elaborately {{decorated}} <b>petticoats</b> {{were worn}} under open-fronted gowns and looped overskirts from the mid-16th century. Eighteen century <b>petticoats</b> of wool or silk were often quilted for additional warmth and were worn with matching short gowns or jackets, {{which could be}} fashioned like a man's jacket with military details and trimmings. These ankle-length <b>petticoats</b> remained a rural fashion, especially in the UK, into the 19th century and {{are a part of}} the traditional Welsh costume.|$|R
25|$|Free-hanging pockets {{were tied}} {{around the waist}} and were {{accessed}} through pocket slits in the gown or <b>petticoat.</b>|$|E
25|$|For walking, jackets were {{accompanied}} by floor-length skirts that could be looped or drawn up by means of tapes over a shorter <b>petticoat.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Victorian era, despite {{contemporary}} {{ideas about}} morality, women's clothing was paradoxically designed to emphasize both the breasts and hips by tightlacing the waist. Victorian women were encumbered with {{many layers of}} clothing, including a chemise with a drawstring neckline, usually drawers, then the corset and corset cover, the under <b>petticoat,</b> the hoop skirt, the over <b>petticoat,</b> and finally the dress. According to the social expectations of the times, even the lowest-cut evening gown should dip no lower than three finger breadths below the clavicles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Petticoating</b> a {{child is}} illegal in many Islamic states. It is {{considered}} highly immoral to punish a child in this fashion, but still exists {{in many of the}} Commonwealth states in a small extent as a legal practice as long as the child is not being sexually abused. The thin line between <b>petticoating</b> and child sexual abuse has been a serious factor in <b>petticoating,</b> and has at least one occasion, led to a child sexual abuse charge.|$|R

25|$|Unfitted gowns (called nightgowns in England) {{with long}} hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice and skirt and {{tied with a}} ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an {{embroidered}} jacket called a waistcoat and a contrasting embroidered <b>petticoat,</b> without a farthingale. Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and <b>petticoat,</b> but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.|$|E
25|$|Riding habits {{consisted}} of a fitted, thigh- or knee-length coat similar to those worn by men, usually with a matching <b>petticoat.</b> Ladies wore masculine-inspired shirts and tricorne hats for riding and hunting.|$|E
5000|$|Stoddard {{may have}} been too liberal for his {{grandson}} Jonathan Edwards, but he was lampooned for prudishness concerning <b>petticoats</b> in an anonymous pamphlet attributed to Benjamin Franklin. Stoddard published a pamphlet in 1722 entitled [...] "Answer to Some Cases of Conscience" [...] in which he argued that the newly fashionable hoop <b>petticoats</b> were [...] "Contrary to the Light of Nature" [...] and that [...] "Hooped <b>Petticoats</b> have something of Nakedness". Franklin's satirical response was entitled [...] "Hoop-Petticoats Arraigned and Condemned, by the Light of Nature, and Law of God".|$|R
