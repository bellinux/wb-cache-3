5|$|Luna {{was one of}} {{the first}} to see action in Manila on 13 August 1898, when the Americans landed troops in Intramuros. Since June 1898, Manila had been {{completely}} surrounded by the revolutionary troops. Colonel Luciano San Miguel occupied Mandaluyong; General Pío del <b>Pilar,</b> Makati; General Mariano Noriel, Parañaque; Colonel Enrique Pacheco, Navotas, Tambobong, and Caloocan. General Gregorio del <b>Pilar</b> marched through Sampaloc, taking Tondo, Divisoria, and Azcárraga; Noriel cleared Singalong and Paco, and held Ermita and Malate. Luna thought the Filipinos should enter Intramuros to have joint occupation of the walled city. But Aguinaldo, heeding the advice of General Wesley Merritt and Commodore (later Admiral) George Dewey, whose fleet had moored in Manila Bay, sent Luna to the trenches where he ordered his troops to fire on the Americans. After the chaos following the American occupation, at a meeting in Ermita, Luna tried to complain to American officers about the disorderly conduct of their soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Count, later (1882) Prince Pavel Vorontsov-Shuvalov (1846–1885), {{the son of}} Sofia Shuvalova and {{grandson}} of Mikhail Vorontsov, inherited the largely empty palace and the Vorontsov title {{on the death of}} his uncle in 1882. He died three years later. His wife, Yelizaveta Stolypina, née Baroness <b>Pilar</b> von Pilchau, outlived him by 54 years. They had no children.

5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm <b>Pilar</b> and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E

5|$|Most {{members of}} the Eskaya {{community}} inhabit a mountainous area that intersects the municipalities of Duero, Guindulman, <b>Pilar,</b> and Sierra Bullones in the once-forested region of Bohol's southeast interior. The original Eskaya settlement in Biabas (Guindulman), was established in 1902. In 1951, the second township of Taytay (municipality of Duero) was founded by Fabian Baja in accordance with Datahan's directions. Significant Eskaya populations are now {{also found in the}} nearby townships of Canta-ub, Lundag, Tambongan, Cadapdapan, and Fatimah.

5|$|Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 {{after three}} priests—Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (collectively known as Gomburza)—were accused of sedition by colonial {{authorities}} and executed. This would inspire a propaganda movement in Spain, organized by Marcelo H. del <b>Pilar,</b> José Rizal, and Mariano Ponce, lobbying for political {{reforms in the}} Philippines. Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion. As attempts at reform met with resistance, Andrés Bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the Katipunan, who sought independence from Spain through armed revolt.|$|E
5|$|Born in Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Jesé {{began his}} footballing career with local team Huracán in 2005, whom he joined from amateur side El <b>Pilar.</b> His form at youth {{level for the}} club saw him attract {{interest}} from La Liga sides Espanyol, Mallorca and Barcelona, but he opted to sign for Real Madrid's youth system in 2007, aged 14. Jesé made his senior debut for the Real Madrid Castilla side on 16 January 2011 in a 5–0 Segunda División B home win over Universidad de Las Palmas. His performance throughout the match, which included an assist for Dani Carvajal, drew early comparisons to fellow Real Madrid teammate and multiple Ballon d'Or winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. Jesé {{spent most of the}} season with Real Madrid's Juvenil A team, however, and enjoyed a successful 2010–11 campaign which earned him a permanent promotion to the Castilla side.|$|E
5|$|While {{traveling}} in Mexico, Scripps met María <b>Pilar</b> Arellanos, of Cancún, and married her in 1980. They travelled together {{for two years}} until 1982, when {{he was sentenced to}} a three-year jail term for theft, burglary and resisting arrest. His imprisonment upset María, and their relationship was further soured when he ran away from jail during home leave in June 1985—just months short of completing his term—and burgled again. He was sentenced to another three years' imprisonment, during which she filed for divorce and married Police Constable Ken Cold, an officer in the Royal Protection Squad. This angered Scripps, who acted in revenge, stealing some of Cold's clothing while released on home leave. He was appeased only when she divorced her new husband and returned to her hometown. After he was released, Scripps legally changed his name to John Martin.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Ford {{initiated}} the Belize River Archaeological Settlement Survey, or BRASS, project {{in order to}} better examine the settlement patterns and cultural ecology of the Maya region. In the course of that survey she and her team discovered the ancient Maya city, El <b>Pilar.</b> In the following years the BRASS team excavated many sites from under the forest canopy. From 1983 to 1989, Ford and her team focused on the residential settlement patterns of the El <b>Pilar</b> area. From 1990 to 1992, Ford and her team focused on the full-scale excavation of representative residential of the El <b>Pilar</b> area. Investigations that began in 1993 at El <b>Pilar</b> resulted in detailed maps and site chronology for the monuments. Now that El <b>Pilar</b> is protected in Belize and Guatemala, and destined to be a peace park, current field research is focused on mapping the residential component of El <b>Pilar,</b> identifying undiscovered sites and monuments. The team has worked with Lidar since 2013, field protocol funded by National Geographic, which led to the discovery of The Citadel, a hilltop temple complex.|$|E
