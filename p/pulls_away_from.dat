5|$|Agaricus deserticola, {{commonly}} known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. Found only in southwestern and western North America, A.deserticola is adapted for growth in dry or semi-arid habitats. The fruit bodies are secotioid, meaning the spores are not forcibly discharged, and the cap does not fully expand. Unlike other Agaricus species, A.deserticola does not develop true gills, but rather a convoluted and networked system of spore-producing tissue called a gleba. When the partial veil breaks or <b>pulls</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.|$|E

500|$|The final {{pull-out}} {{scene of}} the movie, immediately before the end-title card, was described by the directors as the most difficult scene {{in the history of}} Disney animation. They said that the pullout attempt on their prior film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, [...] "struggled" [...] and [...] "lacked depth"; however, after making advances in the process of multiplaning, they tried the technique again in Atlantis. The scene begins with one 16-inch piece of paper showing a close-up of Milo and Kida. As the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them to reveal the newly restored Atlantis, it reaches the equivalent of an 18,000-inch piece of paper composed of many individual pieces of paper (24inches or smaller).
