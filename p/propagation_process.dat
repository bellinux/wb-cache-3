5000|$|The {{algorithm}} {{works by}} iteratively selecting a node from the OPEN list and evaluating it.

In contrast to canonical A*, which follows the path from start to finish, D* begins by searching backwards from the goal node. Each expanded node has a backpointer which refers to the next node leading to the target, and each node knows the exact cost to the target. When the start node is the next node to be expanded, the algorithm is done, and the path to the goal can be found by simply following the backpointers.|$|E

Once grown pollen was obtained where it was cultured on vines from the vineyard. Seeds were then treated with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide for 24 hrs, 1000 ppm GA3 for one day, after that was three months of moist stratification, then treated with 5000 ppm GA3 for one day before being placed in an incubator at 29.3 °C.

5000|$|Optimizers {{often have}} to make {{conservative}} assumptions about variables {{in the presence of}} pointers.

However, the compiler cannot use this information after an assignment to another variable (for example, in C, [...] ) because it could be that [...] is an alias of [...] This could be the case after an assignment like [...] As an effect of this assignment to , the value of x would be changed as well, so propagating the information that [...] is 5 to the statements following [...] would be potentially wrong (if [...] is indeed an alias of [...] ). However, if we have information about pointers, the constant <b>propagation</b> <b>process</b> could make a query like: can [...] be an alias of ? Then, if the answer is no, [...] can be propagated safely.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{a system for}} early detection of gaseous substances and coarse source localization by using heterogeneous sensor measurements and human reports. The system is based on Distributed Perception Networks, a Multi-agent system framework implementing distributed Bayesian reasoning. Causal probabilistic models are exploited in several complementary ways. They support uniform and efficient integration of very heterogeneous information sources, such as different static and mobile sensors as well as human reports. In principle, modular Bayesian networks allow creation of complex probabilistic observation models which adapt to changing constellations of information sources at runtime. On the other hand, Bayesian networks are used also for coarse modeling of transitions in the gas <b>propagation</b> <b>processes.</b> By combining dynamic models of gas <b>propagation</b> <b>processes</b> with the observation models, we obtain adaptive Bayesian systems which correspond to Hidden Markov Models. The resulting systems facilitate seamless combination of prior domain knowledge and heterogeneous observations...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{aiming to}} {{evaluate}} the structural distribution of economic impacts usually treat consumption demand as an exogenous variable. In this case, the Leontief matrix multiplier lacks the multiplier process via the consumption function that one customarily finds in a Keynesian model. To regard the consumption as a fictitious production activity is not the appropriate procedure. Instead, the Keynesian consumption function is introduced at a disaggregated level. For that, a matrix multiplier was formulated in order to combine Leontief's <b>propagation</b> <b>process</b> with the Keynesian <b>propagation</b> <b>process.</b> This matrix includes the effects of endogenous changes in consumption demand. Based on the present production structure in Brazil, the results show how the propagation effect directs the induced income towards capitalists, depriving wage earners.

In addition to analyzing historic epidemic data, computational simulation of epidemic <b>propagation</b> <b>processes</b> and disease control strategies can help us understand in the laboratory the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} modeling the <b>propagation</b> <b>process</b> of topology-aware worms. Topology-aware worms are more intelligent and adaptive to network topologies than other worms, thus {{are more difficult to}} control. Due to the complexity of the problem, no existing work has solved the problem of modeling the propagation of topology-aware worms. Our major contributions in this paper are firstly, we propose an innovative logic matrix formulation of the <b>propagation</b> <b>process</b> of topology-aware worms; and secondly, we find, from the applications of the formulation in our experiments, the impacts of two different topologies, namely the simple random graph topology and the pseudo power law topology, on a P 2 P worm’s mean coverage rate in the P 2 P overlay network. The proposed innovative logic matrix formulation, which is a discrete time deterministic propagation model of topology-aware worms, can translate the <b>propagation</b> <b>process</b> of topology-aware worms into a sequence of logic matrix operations.
