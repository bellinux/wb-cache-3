30|$|Action focus {{specifically}} highlights and extracts video actions {{which are}} most salient {{for the analysis}} in question, to help researchers focus on particular action and look closely to all the elements linked to that action.

Action can also be assigned to non-animate elements, such as “the pen falling” (e.g. it falls off the table rather than being dropped by a hand). Once the action focus is defined, the researcher looks into the elements related to the action as well as key conceptual framework and research questions to guide interpretation of the video.|$|R
