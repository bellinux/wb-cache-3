40|$|In Italy, the {{meningococcal}} C conjugate vaccine (MenC) {{has been}} offered in most regions since 2009 - 2010. The incidence of Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) was 0. 25 confirmed cases per 100, 000 in 2011, but this may be considerably underestimated due to underdetection and underreporting. This study estimates {{the impact of the}} MenC universal vaccination (URV) in the Puglia region by assessing the completeness of three registration sources (notifications, hospitalizations, and laboratory surveillance). Capture-recapture analysis was performed on meningococcal meningitis collected within 2001 - 2013. The impact of URV among ≤ 18 -year-olds was assessed by attributable benefit, <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction,</b> and prevented fraction. Missed opportunities for vaccination were evaluated from surveillance of IMD. The proportion of detected serogroups was applied to the number of IMD in the postvaccination period to compute the cases still preventable. The sensitivity of the three sources was 36. 7 % (95 % CI: 17. 5 %- 57. 9 %) and registrations lost nearly 28 cases/year in the period. Attributable benefit of URV was - 0. 5 cases per 100, 000, <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> 19. 6 %, and prevented fraction 31. 3 %. Three adolescent cases missed the opportunity to be vaccinated. The multicomponent serogroup B meningococcal vaccine has the potential to further prevent at least three other cases/year.

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to review}} the {{literature}} as {{to the effectiveness of}} intervention programmes for the prevention of aggravation of back disorders or prolonged duration of sickness absence. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed using three groups of key words and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Effectiveness was evaluated using two measures: the difference between intervention and referent groups in return to work, and the fraction of sickness absence among referent groups that could be prevented if these referents had undergone the same intervention (<b>preventable</b> <b>fraction).</b> Results: Twelve articles with quantitative information on the effect of ergonomic interventions on return to work were included. In eight studies, introduction of a back-school programme was the preferred intervention, combining exercise and functional conditioning, and training in working methods and lifting techniques. In seven out of eight back-school studies return to work was significantly better in the intervention group. Intervention after 60 -days, in the subacute phase of back pain, showed the most promising results. In these studies the <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> varied between- 11 % and 80 %, largely depending on the stage and phase of back disorders and the time of follow-up. The success of intervention also depended on the profile of the referents when left untampered. In all studies compliance during the intervention was fairly good, but {{there was a lack of}} information on sustainability of the intervention during the follow-up and on recurrence of back complaints and consequent sickness absence. Conclusions: Few studies were performed to assess the outcome return to work after ergonomic intervention. However, there is evidence that intervention in the subacute phase of back pain is preferable. Future intervention studies should address intervention sustainability and recurrence of sickness absence due to back pain over at least a 1 -year follow-up period...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Unintentional injury {{remains the}} leading cause of death among {{individuals}} < 45 -year-old in several developed countries, including the United States, despite the availability of evidence-based preventive policies and practices. This study aims to estimate the <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> of unintentional injury mortality in the United States and critically examine variability components and time trends among four different US regions. METHODS: ICD- 10 coded unintentional injury mortality data were electronically obtained for all available years (1999 - 2004) from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control database; inter-region variability and time trends were calculated to assess age-specific and injury type-specific components. A theoretical model was applied to estimate the <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> of unintentional injuries, assuming that all US regions could achieve the region-specific lowest mortality rate. RESULTS: Children enjoy the lowest injury mortality rates, whereas adults present 4 -fold and elderly 10 -fold higher rates. Of all injury deaths ∼ 25 %, nearly 25, 000 deaths, could have been averted (∼ 2, 300 among children; ∼ 17, 200 among adults [15 - 64 years] and ∼ 5, 500 among elderly) provided that preventive strategies of the best performing region were implemented across the United States. During the studied period, a statistically significant annual increase of 1. 6 % was observed, caused by an alarming rising trend in poisoning (+ 11. 5 %) mainly among adults, and falls (+ 5. 5 %) among elderly. Contrary, a noticeable (- 2. 4 %) and statistically significant decrease of all types of injuries except suffocation was noted among children. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of lives might be saved if established injury preventive programs in low-mortality regions were also implemented in the less-privileged ones. Given the stable trends reported for motor vehicle and occupational injury mortality rates, poisoning and fall injuries occurring at home or during leisure time among the workforce population should be considered as main public health priority areas pending further elucidation of underlying mechanisms, such as the role of alcohol, drugs, and comorbidity in their causation. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To assess {{separate}} and combined effects of work factors and behavioural coping {{in relation to}} withdrawal from the labour force among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  METHODS—A cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} a Dutch nationwide random sample of 720  patients with RA. Information about work factors and behavioural coping was collected by a self-administered postal questionnaire. A broad variety of work factors and coping styles were evaluated separately and in combination using multivariate logistic regression analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and disease related variables. Attributable and <b>preventable</b> <b>fractions</b> were calculated from the combined analyses to assess the relative importance of the contributing factors.  RESULTS—Additional job training, equal career opportunities, letting the disease influence the choice of the current job position, and informing colleagues about having the disease were negatively associated with withdrawal from the labour force. The most relevant factor in terms of decreasing the risk was adjusting job demands which accounted for 63 % of the patients still in the labour force. Decreasing activities and diverting attention in order to cope with pain, and pacing in order to cope with limitations were the coping styles which were positively associated with withdrawal from the labour force. The most relevant factor in terms of increasing the risk of withdrawal was pacing which accounted for 67 % of the withdrawals.  CONCLUSION—Work factors are potentially important modifiable risk factors for withdrawal from the labour force in patients with RA.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} labour market {{position}} {{of patients with}} ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in relation to disease duration and to identify potential factors in relation to withdrawal from the labour force. Methods: A cross sectional mail survey was conducted among 658 patients with AS. Participation in the labour force was defined as having a paid job. The independent effect of duration of disease was examined by an indirect method of standardisation. A broad variety of risk factors were examined separately and in a combined analysis, including sociodemographic factors, disease related variables, coping styles, and work related factors. Attributable and <b>preventable</b> <b>fractions</b> were calculated from the combined analyses to assess {{the relative importance of}} the contributing factors. Results: Probability of participation in the labour force was similarly reduced in patients with AS with different durations of disease. Pacing to cope with limitations was the most relevant factor in increasing the risk of withdrawal from the labour force, accounting for 73 % of withdrawals. Coping with limitations by often seeking creative solutions, high disease activity, increased age, and insufficient support from colleagues or management were also positively associated with withdrawal from the labour force. Technical or ergonomic adjustments of the workplace, working in large companies, and coping with dependency style through frequent acceptance were negatively associated. Of these factors, technical or ergonomic adjustment was the most relevant in terms of reducing the risk.

40|$|Background: Tests of {{genotype}} may enable {{workers at}} unusual risk of future ill-health to be identified. Using them to select for employment, however, entails {{gains and losses}} to employers and employees. Ensuring a fair balance between the rights and obligations of each group requires a value judgement, but {{the advantages and disadvantages}} to interested parties must first be quantified in a meaningful way. Method and Results: The purposes of pre-employment screening are reviewed, and several simple measures relevant to the separate interests of employers and job applicants proposed—number screened to prevent a single adverse outcome; number excluded to prevent a case; expected incidence of the adverse outcome in those excluded; and <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction.</b> The derivation of these measures is illustrated, and the factors that influence them (the prevalence of the prognostic trait, the relative risk that it carries for an adverse outcome, and the overall incidence of disease) are related algebraically and graphically, to aid judgement on the utility of screening under different circumstances. Conclusions: In sensitive areas such as genetic testing the onus should be on the employer to justify plans for pre-placement screening. Several quantitative measures can be used to inform the ethical and economic debate about screening and to evaluate alternative strategies for prevention. ...|$|E

This paper outlines the sources of the major pollutants in Hong Kong, both natural and manmade, and examines the health risks to the Hong Kong population from exposure to such pollutants. The principle man-made sources of these pollutants are mainly diesel vehicle emissions, and high sulphur content fuels burnt in industrial furnaces and power plants. There is concern over levels of these pollutants in ambient air because of their relationship with respiratory health problems, which range from local irritation of the respiratory tract to carcinogenesis. Studies in Hong Kong also demonstrate the importance of environmental tobacco smoke in the home as a cause of children's respiratory health problems, in addition to poor air quality. Epidemiological studies are useful tools for identifying risks and for evaluating the effectiveness of preventive measures, including legislation. In particular we need to identify health risks to young children and the <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> likely to be achieved from different interventions.

40|$|Worldwide, {{the burden}} of cancer is rising, {{stimulating}} efforts to develop strategies to control these diseases. Primary prevention, a key control strategy, aims to reduce cancer incidence through programs directed towards reducing population exposure to known causal factors. Before enacting such strategies, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the likely effect on cancer incidence if exposures to known causal factors were reduced or eliminated. The population attributable fraction (PAF) is the epidemiological measure which quantifies this potential reduction in incidence. We surveyed the literature to document and summarise the proportions of cancers across the globe attributable to modifiable causes, specifically tobacco smoke, alcohol, overweight/obesity, insufficient physical activity, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and dietary factors (insufficient fruit, non-starchy vegetables and fibre; red/processed meat; salt). In total, we identified 55 articles that presented PAF estimates for one or more causes. Information coverage was not uniform, with many articles reporting cancer PAFs due to overweight/obesity, alcohol and tobacco, but fewer reporting PAFs for dietary factors or solar UV radiation. At all cancer sites attributable to tobacco and alcohol, median PAFs were markedly lower for women than men. Smoking contributed to very high median PAFs (> 50 %) for cancers of the lung and larynx. Median PAFs for men, attributable to alcohol, were high (25 – 50 %) for cancers of the oesophagus, oral cavity/pharynx, larynx and liver. For cancers causally associated with overweight/obesity, high median PAFs were reported for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (men 29 %, women 37 %), gallbladder (men 11 %, women 42 %) and endometrium (36 %). The cancer PAF literature is growing rapidly. Repeating this survey in the future should lead to more precise estimates of the potentially <b>preventable</b> <b>fractions</b> of cancer...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to calculate the costs and the effects of this intervention. Methods: We performed a cost-effect analysis from the perspective of the society, followed by an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The distribution of radon levels in Norwegian homes is lognormal with mean= 74. 5 Bq/m 3, and 7. 6 % above 200 Bq/m 3. Results: The <b>preventable</b> attributable <b>fraction</b> of radon on lung cancer was 3. 8 % (95 % uncertainty interval: 0. 6 %, 8. 3 %). In cumulative present values the intervention would cost $ 238 (145, 310) million and save 892 (133, 1981) lives, each life saved costs $ 0. 27 (0. 09, 0. 9) million. The cost-effect ratio was sensitive to the radon risk, the radon exposure distribution, and the latency period of lung cancer. Together these three parameters explained 90 % of the variation in the cost-effect ratio. Conclusions: Reducing the radon concentration in present and future homes to below 200 Bq/m 3 will cost $ 0. 27 (0. 09, 0. 9) million per life saved. The uncertainty in the estimated cost per life is large, mainly due to uncertainty in the risk of lung cancer from radon. Based on estimates from road construction, the Norwegian society has been willing to pay $ 1 million to save a life. We therefore conclude that the intervention against radon in homes is justifiable.

We determined incidence rates and characteristics of ventilator-associated events reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network. Design, Setting, and Patients:We analyzed data reported from U. S. healthcare facilities for ventilator-associated events that occurred in 2014, the first year during which ventilator-associated event surveillance definitions were stable. We used negative binomial regression modeling to identify healthcare facility and inpatient location characteristics associated with ventilator-associated events. We calculated ventilator-associated event incidence rates, rate distributions, and ventilator utilization ratios in critical care and noncritical care locations and described event characteristics. Measurements and Main Results:A total of 1, 824 healthcare facilities reported 32, 772 location months of ventilator-associated event surveillance data to the National Healthcare Safety Network in 2014. Critical care unit pooled mean ventilator-associated event incidence rates ranged from 2. 00 to 11. 79 per 1, 000 ventilator days, whereas noncritical care unit rates ranged from 0 to 14. 86 per 1, 000 ventilator days. The pooled mean proportion of ventilator-associated events defined as infection-related varied from 15. 38 % to 47. 62 % in critical care units. Pooled mean ventilator utilization ratios in critical care units ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 47.

A qualitative reading and evaluation of relevant articles on the can-cer-preventive effect of the consumption of fruits and vegeta-bles was made followed by the calculation of the mean rela-tive risk and range for cohort and case-control studies separately. The possible population-preventable fraction for modifying diet in relation to fruit and vegetable consumption was calculated as well as an overall statement about the de-gree of evidence for the cancer-preventive effect of fruit and vegetable consumption for each cancer site. There is limited evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of the consumption of fruits and vegetables for cancer of the mouth and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon-rectum, larynx, lung, ovary (veg-etables only), bladder (fruit only), and kidney. There is inade-quate evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of the consump-tion of fruits and vegetables for all other sites. Applying this range of risk difference to the range of prevalence of low in-take, the <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> for low fruit and vegetable in-take would fall into the range of 5 – 12 %. It {{is important to recognize that}} this is only a crude range of estimates and that the proportion of cancers that might be preventable by in-creasing fruit and vegetable intake may vary beyond this range for specific cancer sites and across different regions of the world...|$|E
40|$|The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2015. Objectives: There is accumulating {{evidence}} about {{effectiveness of a}} number of suicide prevention interventions, and a multilevel systems approach seems promising in reducing suicide risk. This approach requires that components ranging from individual-level to public health interventions are implemented simultaneously in a localised region. This paper presents estimated reductive effects on suicide attempts and deaths that might be expected in Australia if active components of the systems approach were to be implemented. Method: The study estimated population preventable fractions which indicate the extent to which suicide attempts and deaths might be decreased if the each of the proposed interventions was fully implemented. The population preventable fractions were based on the best available evidence available in the literature for the risk ratio for each intervention. Prevalence estimates were assessed for each component of the proposed systems approach: reducing access to suicide means, media guidelines, public health campaigns, gatekeeper programmes, school programmes, general practitioner training, psychotherapy and co-ordinated/assertive aftercare. Results: There was insufficient evidence available for the impact {{of a number of}} strategies, including frontline staff gatekeeper training, on either suicide attempts or deaths. Taking prevalence of exposure to the intervention into consideration, the strategies likely to bring about the strongest reduction in suicide attempts were psychosocial treatments and co-ordinated/assertive aftercare. The greatest impact on reductions in suicide deaths was found for psychosocial treatment, general practitioner training, gatekeeper training and reducing access to means of suicide. Conclusion: The evidence regarding the overall efficacy of the systems approach is important in identifying what strategies should be prioritised to achieve the biggest impact. The findings of the population <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> calculations indicate that the systems approach could lead to significant reduction in suicide attempts and suicide deaths in Australia. Potential synergistic effects between strategies included in the approach could further increase the impact of implemented strategies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{estimated}} {{the potential impact}} of an investigational 9 -valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPVs 6 / 11 / 16 / 18 / 31 / 33 / 45 / 52 / 58) in HPV-related cervical disease in Brazil, Mexico, India and China, to help to formulate recommendations on cervical cancer prevention and control. MethodsEstimations for invasive cervical cancer (ICC) were based on an international study including 1356 HPV-positive cases for the four countries altogether, and estimations for precancerous cervical lesions were extracted from a published meta-analysis including 6 025 HPV-positive women from the four mentioned countries. Globocan 2012 and 2012 World Population Prospects were used to estimate current and future projections of new ICC cases. ResultsCombined proportions of the 9 HPV types in ICC were 88. 6 % (95 %CI: 85. 2 – 91. 3) in Brazil, 85. 7 % (82. 3 – 88. 8) in Mexico, 92. 2 % (87. 9 – 95. 3) in India and 97. 3 % (93. 9 – 99. 1) in China. The additional HPV 31 / 33 / 45 / 52 / 58 proportions were 18. 8 % (15. 3 – 22. 7) in Brazil, 17. 6 % (14. 2 – 21. 2) in Mexico, 11. 3 % (7. 5 – 16. 1) in India and 11. 9 % (7. 5 – 17. 2) in China. HPV 6 and 11 single types were not identified in any of the samples. Proportion of the individual 7 high risk HPV types included in the vaccine varied by cytological and histological grades of HPV-positive precancerous cervical lesions. HPV 16 was the dominant type in all lesions, with contributions in low grade lesions ranging from 16. 6 %(14. 3 – 19. 2) in Mexico to 39. 8 % (30. 0 – 50. 2) in India, and contributions in high grade lesions ranging from 43. 8 % (36. 3 – 51. 4) in Mexico to 64. 1 % (60. 6 – 67. 5) in Brazil. After HPV 16, variations in other majors HPV types were observed by country, with an under representation of HPV 18 and 45 compared to ICC. ConclusionThe addition of HPVs 31 / 33 / 45 / 52 / 58 to HPV types included in current vaccines could increase the ICC <b>preventable</b> <b>fraction</b> in a range of 12 to 19 % across the four countries, accounting the 9 -types altogether 90 % of ICC cases. Assuming the same degree of efficacy of current vaccines, the implementation of the 9 -valent HPV vaccine in Brazil, Mexico, India and China would substantially impact on the reduction of the world cervical cancer burden...|$|E
