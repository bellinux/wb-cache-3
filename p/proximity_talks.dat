40|$|Benefitting from Web 2. 0 features, Social Media allows organisations to {{be where}} the users are, {{creating}} <b>proximity,</b> <b>talking</b> to them, and knowing what they want. Going viral and word-of-mouth become easier, as these platforms allow us to share, to like, and to use multimedia and convergence – as they can interact with each other, communicating on a large scale. Given that online portals provide for a highly competitive environment, players strive to get more visits, better search rankings, and even aspire to be the homepage for the Web universe. We discuss the integration of Social Media tools in a Web Portal, and explore how using these together may improve the competitiveness of a Web Portal. A large Web Portal was selected to develop this case study. We found that, although for this particular Web Portal conditions were created to accommodate and integrate the chosen Social Media platforms, this was done in an organic and fluid way, with great focus on community construction and less focus on absorptive capacity. Based {{on the findings of}} this case study, we propose a dynamic cycle of benefits for integrating Social Media tools in a Web Portal...|$|R

The mission of both the unit and the AAF Technical Base expanded by early 1946, gaining full support responsibility for Patterson Field. The 2750th became host wing for Wright-Patterson AFB in October 1949, exercising command jurisdiction over the base and providing services necessary to support Headquarters of Air Force Logistics Command and numerous tenant units. It frequently supported regional humanitarian missions, such as the Xenia tornado relief in April 1974. It Provided logistical support {{and served as a}} port of embarkation during contingency situations, most notably from, 1965-1973 and 1990-1991. The unit deployed support personnel to Southwest Asia, August 1990-May 1991. After 1 July 1992 it provided logistic and administrative support for Headquarters, Air Force Materiel Command and Aeronautical Systems Center, now known as the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, as well as on-base and off-base tenant units in a five-state area and managed base facilities and resources.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on specifying and {{describing}} the terms used in Estonian child language and child-directed speech. The terms used now do not offer enough necessary and precise tools for researchers of child language. Since children of different ages and <b>proximities</b> are <b>talked</b> to differently, a need has arisen to define {{the different types of}} child-directed speech, due to the multiple interpretations of terms and their concepts. Although most of the terms describing speech directed from an adult to a child have been considered synonyms in the English linguistics literature, this might not be the case in Estonian scientific language. The confusion of terms in English science is due to the massive amount of researchers and publishers which obviously makes it difficult to achieve uniformity. Taking into consideration this multitude of terms and confusion of concepts, the authors of this article offer recommended terms {{to be used in the}} future research of child and child-directed speech, in order to simplify the research and facilitate understanding of the terminology. The circle of researchers of child and child-directed speech in Estonia is quite narrow, which not only makes the implementation of clear, specified terms easy to agree on but would also greatly benefit the field of research itself. The authors are aware that in English scientific literature the terms used (e. g. motherese, fatherese, parentese) are not strictly distinctive, often due to the fact that it is not necessary, if the aim is to research child-directed speech in general. Since Estonian child language research is diversified, the necessary tools in the form of Estonian-language terms should be provided to be used according to the aim of the researcher...|$|R
40|$|This practice-based project {{examines}} mediated performative relationality in videoperformance {{by means}} of five artworks and a dissertation. I argue that videoperformance {{has the potential to}} contribute to wider debates on relationality, to examine the addressee and the dynamics of relationality through the mediated encounter between performer and viewer, and to produce an account of relationality that manifests the specific ethical and political valence of this practice. I focus on videoperformances in which artists address viewers via video camera and screen, with the result of activating mediated relationality. The term relationality conveys the emergence of intersubjective relationships. Mediation refers to the relay of performativity from performer to camera, screen and viewer, and acknowledges the transformations introduced by technology. My videoperformances experiment with aspects of mediated relationality: Before You Now (2013) explores the desire for authenticity and unmediated relationality. Regardless (2007) experiments with visual strategies to suggest that the screen is permeable. The Other Person (2010) explores intimacy, trust and zones of <b>proximity.</b> Are You <b>Talking</b> to Me? (2010) denies relationality by focusing on a dialogue internal to the performer. Wish You Were Here (2011) suggests and mocks idealised conviviality, and plays with ideas of liveness. The dissertation is divided into two parts: part one contextualises the project in the framework of theoretical approaches and practices. It maps Lacanian concepts of subjectivity and the gaze; Butler’s concept of performativity; film, performance and new media studies; relational and distributed aesthetics. It also reviews the history of videoperformance from a contemporary relational perspective. Part two examines the interplay of relationality and subjectivity in three videoperformances by way of performative writing and critical analysis. This combination of different research methodologies achieves a thorough analysis of performative mediated relationality in videoperformance and contributes to a wider discourse on relationality...|$|R

5000|$|On 24 May 1993, the Secretary-General {{formally}} {{presented the}} two sides with his CBMs. Denktaş, while accepting some of the proposals, {{was not prepared to}} agree to the package as a whole. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the European Commission returned its opinion on the Cypriot application for membership. While the decision provided a ringing endorsement of the case for Cypriot membership, it refrained from opening the way for immediate negotiations. The Commission stated that it felt that the issue should be reconsidered in January 1995, taking into account [...] "the positions adopted by each party in the talks". A few months later, in December 1993, Glafcos Clerides proposed the demilitarisation of Cyprus. Denktaş dismissed the idea, but the next month he announced that {{he would be willing to}} accept the CBMs in principle. <b>Proximity</b> <b>talks</b> started soon afterwards. In March 1994, the UN presented {{the two sides}} with a draft document outlining the proposed measures in greater detail. Clerides said that he would be willing to accept the document if Denktaş did, but the Turkish Cypriot leader refused on the grounds that it would upset the balance of forces on the island. Once again, Ghali had little choice but to pin the blame for another breakdown of talks on the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas would be willing to accept mutually agreed changes, but Clerides refused to negotiate any further changes to the March proposals. Further proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in an attempt to break the deadlock were rejected by both sides.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} impact of various forms of time pressure on the outcomes of negotiation processes in territorial conflicts in the post-Cold War period. Deadlines are used increasingly often by mediators to spur deadlocked negotiation processes, {{under the assumption that}} fixed time limits tend to favour pragmatism. Yet, little attention is typically paid to the durability of agreements concluded in these conditions; moreover, research in experimental psychology suggests that time pressure may impact negatively on individual and collective decision-making by reducing each side's ability to deal with complex issues, complex inter-group dynamics and inter-cultural relations. The comparative section of the research assesses {{the impact of}} natural and artificial deadlines on negotiation outcomes through a fuzzy-set comparison of 68 episodes of negotiation in territorial conflicts between 1990 and 2005. The results reveal that high levels of time pressure can be associated with both 'broad' and 'limited' agreements, but that low levels of time pressure or its absence are consistently associated with more durable ones. Other exploratory models also confirm the findings of experimental psychology and show that 'complex' negotiations are more likely to result in durable agreements when they take place under no or low time pressure. These results are explored and discussed in detail in two pairs of case studies: the Bougainville and Casamance peace processes, and the Dayton and Camp David <b>proximity</b> <b>talks.</b> These cases confirm the intuitions of the comparative section; they provide evidence of the negative impact of time pressure on the cognitive processes of the actors involved and highlight, in particular, how in certain conditions the absence or low levels of time pressure can impact on the durability of agreements by making possible effective intra-rebel agreements before official negotiations, and that time pressure works in <b>proximity</b> <b>talks</b> only when applied to solving circumscribed deadlocks...|$|E

40|$|Since the reformation of the Chinese economy, two notable trends have developed. First, {{the growing}} {{prominence}} of multilateral economic regimes (MERs) {{on the political}} agenda of Beijing has propelled deepened engagements between Chinese policy actors and institutions, and the agencies of MERs. This development {{is accompanied by a}} second trend, which is a growing dynamism in China’s economic diplomacy within the multilateral arenas. This dynamism is reflected in the evolving national preferences and approaches for multilateral economic negotiations, from outright resistance to gradual flexibility, and in some cases, acceptance. The simultaneous and parallel developments of these two trends stem a curiosity on whether a causal relationship exist between the deepened China-MER engagements and the dynamism of China’s economic diplomacy. Has Beijing’s open-door policy to global economic integration opened new windows of opportunity for the MER agencies to influence China’s economic diplomacy and its preference formation? In what way(s) and/or in which capacities can the agencies of MERs assert influence on China’s economic diplomacy preference formation? Under what conditions is this form of external influence successful? What are the long-run implications of the deepened China-MER engagements on Beijing’s economic diplomacy preference formation structure? What does the China-MER relationship tell us about China’s economic diplomacy preference formation in the 21 st century? Although China’s partake in the international political economy has received much scholarly attention, few studies have attempted to decode China’s economic diplomacy preference formation, and even fewer have investigated the important nexus between the China-MER relationship and the behaviours of Chinese economic diplomacy. This thesis is a response to the knowledge deficit in these regards. By examining China’s participation in the multilateral climate change, and trade 4 negotiations, the thesis addresses the primary research question, how do multilateral economic regimes and their agencies influence China’s economic diplomacy preference formation? The study finds that the MER agencies do affect Chinese economic diplomacy preference formation. However, their influence peaks at an absorption level whereby Chinese preferences adapt to external preferences but not to the extent of reforming traditional principles and beliefs. The comparatively more effective ways of asserting influence for the MER agencies is through a costs-and-benefits calculus, information dissemination, shuttle diplomacy <b>proximity</b> <b>talks,</b> and informal negotiation practices. In general, Chinese policy actors do not refute the influence of the MER agencies; rather they absorb and adapt to it. In addition, the MER agencies assert influence at different stages of the preference formation, and over time, implicitly establish themselves as integrated policy actors in Beijing. On the whole, this thesis contributes to a deeper understanding about how, why, and when international linkages matter in China’s economic diplomacy, and to the extent of driving preference transformation. The study provides useful analytic lenses that flesh out the variety of functions the MER agencies have in shaping and informing China’s national preferences and negotiation approaches. At the same time, it offers a fuller description of how the Chinese policy actors and institutions respond to (implicit) external interventions in its policy processes. Consequently, this thesis is a significant contribution that adds value to the scholarly debates and knowledge-building about {{one of the most important}} political and economic phenomenon of our time...|$|E
