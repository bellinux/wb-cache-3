50|$|The Number One Crossbar Switching System (1XB switch), was {{the primary}} {{technology}} for designing urban telephone exchanges in the Bell System in the mid-20th century. Its switch fabric used the new electromechanical crossbar switch to implement the topology of the <b>panel</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> of the 1920s. The first 1XB system was installed in the PResident-2 office at Troy Avenue in Brooklyn, New York which became operational in February 1938.|$|E
5000|$|In 1915, newly {{developed}} <b>panel</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> {{were tested in}} the Mulberry and Waverly exchanges in Newark, New Jersey. When the technology {{first appeared in the}} Mulberry exchange, subscribers had no dials on their telephones and the new system was transparent to them [...] - [...] they asked an operator to ring their called party as usual. However, the operator keyed the number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually. The <b>panel</b> <b>switch</b> was later, from the early 1920s through the 1930s, installed in large metropolitan areas in the Bell System. By the 1950s twenty cities were served by this type of office.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Panel</b> Machine <b>Switching</b> <b>System</b> is {{an early}} type of {{automatic}} telephone exchange for urban service, introduced in the Bell System in the 1920s. It was developed by Western Electric Labs, the forerunner of Bell Labs, in the U.S., in parallel with the Rotary system at International Western Electric in Belgium before World War I, which was used in Europe. Both systems had many features in common.|$|R

50|$|When {{the office}} {{classification}} system for DDD was established, the principal designs in use for Class-5 in the US were Strowger-type step-by-step <b>systems,</b> <b>Panel</b> <b>switches,</b> and crossbar <b>systems.</b> 5XB crossbar <b>switches</b> were installed {{in large numbers}} in the 1950s and 60s, and 1ESS switches and variants starting in the 1960s. Most of these systems were removed in the late 20th century, primarily replaced in North America by DMS-10, DMS-100 and 5ESS switches in the Bell operating territories and the GTD-5 EAX in the GTE operating areas. Principal European products include Ericsson AXE telephone exchange, Siemens EWSD and Alcatel-Lucent S12 and E10.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{most large}} cities were {{served by the}} Bell System and used the <b>Panel</b> <b>switch,</b> or later the Number One Crossbar <b>Switching</b> <b>System</b> (1XB), or the Number 5 Crossbar <b>Switching</b> <b>Systems</b> rather than {{step-by-step}} equipment. Los Angeles being a small town early in the 20th century and partly being served by an independent telephone company, grew {{to be a major}} exception. Before the advent of electronic <b>switching</b> <b>systems,</b> directors were commonly used in areas of the city served by GTE.|$|R
50|$|The Rotary Machine <b>Switching</b> <b>System,</b> or most {{commonly}} known as the Rotary System, was a type of automatic telephone exchange manufactured and used primarily in Europe from the 1910s. Formally named the No. 7-A Machine <b>Switching</b> <b>System,</b> it was developed in Belgium by International Western Electric, a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), at the same time when AT&T's American engineering division, Western Electric, was developing the <b>Panel</b> <b>switch</b> in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The No. 4 Crossbar <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the 1940s to switch four-wire circuits and replace the incoming operator. With semiautomatic operation analogous to {{the early days of}} the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the operator in the originating city used a multifrequency keypad to dial an access code to connect to the correct city and to send the seven digit number to incoming equipment at the terminating city. This design was further refined to serve DDD.|$|R
50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder of the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> autonomously connecting {{the line to}} a junctor, which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the sender then found the chosen junctor and supplied dial tone. Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient trunking. Unlike the <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|R

5000|$|Early switchboards {{in large}} cities usually were mounted floor to ceiling {{in order to allow}} the {{operators}} to reach all the lines in the exchange. The operators were boys who would use a ladder to connect to the higher jacks. Late in the 1890s this measure failed {{to keep up with the}} increasing number of lines, and Milo G. Kellogg devised the Divided Multiple Switchboard for operators to work together, with a team on the [...] "A board" [...] and another on the [...] "B." [...] These operators were almost always women until the early 1970s, when men were once again hired. Cord switchboards were often referred to as [...] "cordboards" [...] by telephone company personnel. Conversion to <b>Panel</b> <b>switch</b> and other automated <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> first eliminated the [...] "B" [...] operator and then, usually years later, the [...] "A". Rural and suburban switchboards for the most part remained small and simple. In many cases, customers came to know their operator by name.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We discuss {{stability}} of a loop {{consisting of two}} asynchronous <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> in which the first <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> influences the input and the switching signal of the second <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> and the second <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> affects the first <b>switched</b> <b>system’s</b> jump map. We show that when the first <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has a small dwell-time and is switching slowly {{in the spirit of}} average dwell-time switching, all the states of the closed loop are bounded. We show how this result relates to supervisory adaptive control of time-varying plants. When the uncertain plant {{takes the form of a}} <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> with an unknown switching signal, we show that all the states of the closed-loop control system are guaranteed to be bounded provided that the plant’s switching signal varies slowly enough.
