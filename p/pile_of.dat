5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape.

5|$|The {{site of the}} burned-out capitol {{building}} remained a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> stones for several years after the fire.

The legislature met on {{the second and third}} floors of that building, which also housed the other state offices.|$|E
50|$|Limonada is a Lemon variant {{that uses}} similar game play, yet with Uno cards.The setup for Limonada differs because an Uno deck {{contains}} 108 cards. <b>Piles</b> <b>of</b> four cards are distributed to each player such that each has {{an equal number}} <b>of</b> <b>piles.</b> The remaining cards are placed face up in the middle. For example, three players will each have 8 <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> four with 12 cards in the middle. Five players would have 5 <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> 4 cards with 8 cards in the middle.|$|R

5|$|The video commences with {{shots of}} a {{construction}} site, where Ciara arrives {{in a large}} construction vehicle. Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses. She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> tires. She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up.|$|E

A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran into a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of the way into the tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E

For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was {{at the bottom of a}} <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> fans.|$|E

5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E
5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law. Witnesses {{said that}} the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head, stabbed, then gathered into one room and set on fire. A <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> ashes {{was found on the}} floor of one victims' house; at least one child's body was found partially charred. A reporter for The New York Times inspected the children's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing burns on some of the legs and heads.|$|E
5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundations}} for the BWSL's cable-stayed bridges consist of 120 reinforced concrete <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> 2000 mm diameter. Those for the viaducts consist <b>of</b> 484 <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> 1500 mm. These 604 piles were driven between 6m and 34m into the substrate in geotechnical conditions that varied from highly weathered volcanic material to massive high strength rocks.|$|R
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are slender {{structural elements}} used to transfer loads from super structure into deep hard strata below the ground level. However, single piles are rarely found in practice. It is quite complicated to analyze pile groups since pile soil interaction is complex. In this study, {{two dimensional analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group under vertical load is carried out using finite element software ANSYS. Pile group has 16 numbers <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and it is located in c-ø soil, parameters like diameter (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 m), length (3, 4, 5, 6 m) and spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> (2 D, 2. 5 D, 3 D, 3. 5 D, 4 D) and thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 m) are varied to study the behavior <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group. Results <b>of</b> influence of diameter, length and spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap are discussed. It can be observed that, as the diameter and spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap increase, the load carrying capacity <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group increases. The length <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> has no significant effect when compared to influence <b>of</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> on load carrying capacity <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group...|$|R

There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rocks for children to climb over to find stones.

Rhino was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a part of the match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik into a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches as a result of this match.|$|E

Dipteran {{flies in the}} families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.|$|E
