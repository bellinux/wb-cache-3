500|$|Valueâ€”Beyond Price is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on a family beset by tragedy when the father is presumed dead after his ship is lost at sea. The mother struggles to support her child and sells her possessions to a pawnbroker. When she has nothing left, save her wedding ring, the pawnbroker asks {{to take care of}} the child and the mother consents. The pawn broker gives her a <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> for the girl stating [...] "a precious jewel, a value beyond price" [...] and tells her she can redeem it at any time. Before her death, she entrusts the ticket to a friend. Ten years pass, the shipwrecked father has discovered a great fortune on the island and is rescued by a passing steamship. The father soon realizes his wife is dead and his child is missing, but he receives the <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> and decides to claim this jewel his wife had left for him. He redeems it at the pawn shop and finds it is his lost daughter. The film was released on November 29, 1910 and it was met with positive reviews. The film survives in the Library of Congress archives.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can go out and get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E
500|$|... "And he is not. He {{has been}} cast up on a fertile {{island in the}} South Seas, where he lives a Crusoe-like {{existence}} for 10 years, and incidentally finds buried treasure which makes him rich. He was finally rescued by a passing steamer and brought {{back to his own}} country, only to find that in his absence his wife has died, no one knows the fate of his child. He only finds, in an envelope addressed to him in the hand of his dying wife, a <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> for a 'precious jewel' which she has pledged. Thinking the jewel to be some gift of his to his wife, which she desired him to have as a remembrance, he goes to the pawnshop and is there waited upon by a sweet-faced girl of 15 to whom he is at once attracted. The girl is unable to find any article in the shop with a ticket corresponding to the number on the ticket which the captain carries, and appeals to her foster father, Levy, to help her find the gentleman's goods. Levy at once recognizes the ticket as the one he gave for his little adopted daughter. Although he dislikes to surrender the one joy of his life, he finally decides to reunite father and daughter. The latter have the old pawnbroker make his home with them, so the reunion brings happiness to all." ...|$|E

But at last Susan came, too humbly invisible for Sir Isaac's attention, and directly she found Lady Harman {{alone in the room}} with her, she produced a <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> and twenty pounds.

50|$|The Shadwell Police Office {{examined}} Williams as well {{as several}} other suspects. He had two <b>pawn</b> <b>tickets</b> on his person, some silver coins and a pound note. His last voyage had been on the Roxburgh Castle, an East India Company trading ship, and he had narrowly escaped being part of a failed mutiny attempt. He was educated and had a reputation for being honest, as he always paid for his rooms, and was popular with women. Williams had been seen drinking with at least one other man at The King's Arms shortly before the murders, so he was subjected to an intense interrogation. Williams was of medium height and slight build, so his description in no way matched Turner's description of a large man in a dark flushing coat. Williams said that he had never denied being at The Kings Arms that evening, but the Williamsons considered him a family friend. Mrs Williamson had even touched his face that night in a motherly gesture. What aroused suspicion was his earlier mention that he had no money, although he was seen to have some after the murders. Williams claimed that he had pawned articles of clothing afterwards and that the <b>pawn</b> <b>tickets</b> were proof of this. He claimed that after he had left the tavern that evening he had consulted a surgeon about an old wound, {{as well as}} a woman with some knowledge of medicine. No one investigated this alibi or checked the dates on the <b>pawn</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R

The sheik steals and pawns the girl's father's pocket watch for $4. With the money, he buys a $3 box of chocolates for the girl. When the father notices his watch is missing, the sheik slips the <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> into the projectionist's pocket unnoticed.

His identification was confirmed by Catherine Eddowes' sister, Eliza Gold. No money was found on her. Though the murder occurred within the City of London, {{it was close to}} the boundary of Whitechapel where the previous Whitechapel murders had occurred. The mutilation of Eddowes' body and the abstraction of her left kidney and part of her womb by her murderer bore the signature of Jack the Ripper and was very similar in nature to that of earlier victim Annie Chapman.|$|R

50|$|One day, Mrs. Bixby {{arrives in}} Baltimore and {{receives}} a package from the Colonel containing {{a letter and}} an expensive gift: a dark mink coat. The Colonel's letter informs Mrs. Bixby that {{they can no longer}} see each other, and suggests she tell her husband the mink coat is a Christmas present from her aunt. Mrs. Bixby is in despair as she reads the letter: her aunt is far too poor to be given credit for the gift. However, Mrs. Bixby is intent on keeping the coat and devises a plan. On her return to New York she visits a pawnbroker and pawns the coat for $50. The pawnbroker gives her a <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket,</b> which she declines to mark with any kind of name or description. The ticket guarantees her right to claim the coat at any time.

LaSalle and the DubMD confront Carr in his office, as do Bulkin and his men. Insulted by Bulkin's racist remarks, LaSalle kills him.|$|E
40|$|During {{the long}} eighteenth century an {{apparently}} minor and ephemeral object proliferated in Britain: the ticket. A significant and increasing {{proportion of the}} population was exposed to tickets of admission, lottery tickets and pay tickets. Novel forms emerged, including <b>pawn</b> <b>tickets</b> and Tyburn tickets; philanthropists discovered their potential for investigating and relieving poverty. Historians have not brought different instances together, but new applications of the term ???ticket,??? and more importantly, processes of elaboration and consolidation, suggest a variety of uses that bridged different registers and social settings. This extended early-modern capacities to express contractual obligation, affection or allegiance through material objects and gave new form to techniques of identification. Crucial was the ticket???s potential to flow, to encapsulate and then release information, access, possession or chance. Fashioned from paper, metal or bone, tickets gave shape to events and actions; they stood in for people and things; they materialized knowledge and experience; they patterned behavior and convention. Losing, counterfeiting or overlooking them had physical and spatial consequences. The article offers case studies of charitable events and fund-raising, plebeian experiences and Methodist practices. It also explores the material forms of tickets, how people learnt to recognize, read and use them, and questions of authenticity and forgery. Tickets mobilized and anchored entitlement, access and identity. Within this micro-politics of ticket use, lower-class women and men emerge as proficient agents. The article concludes that tickets intensified and shaped social interactions. Their presence casts fresh light on eighteenth-century modes of social existence and the broader historical narratives constructed around them...|$|R

5000|$|Bock {{was born}} and raised in Las Vegas, which served as the setting for Beautiful Children. He comes from a family of pawnbrokers who've {{operated}} pawn shops in Downtown Las Vegas for more than thirty years. On his website, he reflects upon his upbringing as a source of inspiration for the novel: [...] "Sometimes, when my siblings and I were little, my parents, for various reasons, used to have us stay in the back of the shop. This would be after school or during summer vacation, when there wasnâ€™t summer camp, or they didnâ€™t have anybody to watch over us and we were too small to be alone. Weâ€™d occupy our time with sodas from a nearby casinoâ€™s gift shop, comic books, and a television that got wavy reception, and weâ€™d do small chores, rolling coins or filing the previous dayâ€™s <b>pawn</b> <b>tickets.</b> The store often had a line of people waiting to pawn their goods, local customers who worked in casinos and also spent all their spare time playing blackjack and slot machines, and also tourists who had blown all their cash, and maybe their plane tickets home, and now were desperate, and hung over, and needed loans on their wedding rings, so they could go back into the casinos and win back their money. Iâ€™d sometimes stare out of the back of the store and watch the people in line and take in their faces. Lots of times my parents would be put in the position of having to tell these people that their wedding ring was only worth a fraction of what theyâ€™d paid for it, or that, say, the diamonds in that ring were brown and flawed. From the back of the store, Iâ€™d watch as the customers exploded and called my parents dirty Jews and cursed at them and threatened them at the top of their lungs. Itâ€™s impossible in situations like that not to feel for everybody involved â€” to be horrified, sure, but more than that, to be saddened by the spectacle, to want so much more than that out of life for everyone." ...|$|R

Carly is put on trial but is exonerated due to the eyewitness testimony of her crippled neighbor's private nurse saying that Miles was attacking Carly. Ultimately Carly admits that she is being blackmailed by the neighbor so that Carly will give her the <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> to a candelabra which Carly recently pawned. The <b>pawn</b> <b>ticket</b> was actually the cause of the argument between Carly and Miles, as the candelabra was stuffed with stolen jewels. When Gridley and Carly go to retrieve the candelabra, the pawnbroker is found murdered and Gridley and Carly find the neighbor in the act of pushing her elderly patient off a cliff to silence her story. It was, in fact, the elderly patient who witnessed Miles and Carly fighting, and the nurse merely said {{she was the one who}} saw the struggle. A chase sequence ensues whereby the patient is saved (with music from The Pirates of Penzance), and the ambassador and the Scotland Yard detective arrive to find the nurse detained.|$|E
