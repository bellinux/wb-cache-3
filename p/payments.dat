5|$|Because {{the balance}} of <b>payments</b> sums to zero, a current account surplus {{indicates}} a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future <b>payments</b> for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} <b>payments</b> links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of <b>payments</b> position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of <b>payments,</b> demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies <b>payments</b> imbalances.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} sources of income in the {{territory}} during the 1850s was U.S. government annuity <b>payments</b> to the Ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties. These <b>payments</b> amounted to more than $380,000 per year on average ($ in present-day terms) compared to approximately $120,000 per year ($ in present-day terms) given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and mishandling of the <b>payments</b> to the tribes, {{a great deal of}} the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these <b>payments</b> were the territory's most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible.|$|E

5|$|The {{balance of}} <b>payments</b> {{accounts}} summarize <b>payments</b> made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while <b>payments</b> are considered debit transactions. The balance of <b>payments</b> {{is a function}} of three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

5|$|The {{main source}} of income {{recorded}} on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded.

40|$|Abstract: The {{way people}} pay for goods and {{services}} is changing dramatically, but little data and research on consumer behavior and <b>payment</b> choice are publicly available. This paper describes the results of a survey of <b>payment</b> behavior and attitudes taken by Federal Reserve employees in 2004. Major contributions of the survey are that it asks: 1) why <b>payment</b> choices are made; 2) why individual <b>payment</b> behavior has changed; and 3) why individual‐specific <b>payment</b> characteristics matter for <b>payment</b> choice. Although the survey is not statistically representative of U. S. consumers, and thus may not provide accurate estimates of aggregate U. S. <b>payment</b> trends, many results are consistent with data from more representative <b>payment</b> surveys. For example, the data show a trend away from check‐ writing and toward electronic and emerging <b>payment</b> methods, but the choice of <b>payment</b> method depends on the type of <b>payment,</b> amount of <b>payment,</b> and other complex factors. Also, cost, convenience, and control over timing are the most important characteristics determining respondents’ adoption and use of <b>payment</b> methods. We find that <b>payment</b> characteristics vary widely across respondents, partly because of inherent heterogeneity but perhaps also because of measurement error, misperception, or inadequate information (lack of consumer education). Cross‐sectional evidence shows that respondents tend to use <b>payment</b> methods in a manner broadly consistent with their reported assessments of the <b>payment</b> characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Initially, the estates' {{contributions}} {{were limited}} to six years, yet the Frederick William obliged the estates to continue the <b>payments</b> thereafter and created a dedicated office to collect the contributions. The contributions were confirmed by the estates in 1662, but transformed in 1666 by decree from a real estate tax to an excise tax. Since 1657, the towns had to contribute not soldiers, but monetary <b>payments</b> to the army, and since 1665, the estates were able to free themselves from contributing soldiers by additional <b>payments.</b> The initial army size of 8,000 men had risen to 25,000 to 30,000 men by 1688. By then, Frederick William had also accomplished his second goal, to finance the army independently of the estates. By 1688, these military costs amounted to considerable 1,500,000 talers or half of the state budget. Ensuring a solid financial basis for the army, undisturbed by the estates, was the foremost objective of Frederick William's administrative reforms.
