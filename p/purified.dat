5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins {{in large quantities}} made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be <b>purified</b> in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. <b>purified</b> 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E

The component of alpha cellulose {{could be used as a}} raw material for nitrocellulose if it is has more than 92 % of purity.

In this time, chemical still be choices to be material for <b>purify</b> alpha cellulose, while as we know that chemical has a bad impact for our envirotment. So it is important to search another <b>purifying</b> agent and it is xylanase. Xylanase is one of enzyme that has an ability to break up the link between xylose in xylan. So the purpose of this research are to use xylanase as another <b>purifying</b> agent, to know what is the best pH for this <b>purifying</b> process and to compare the result between two xylanases that produced from different fungi. Before start the <b>purifying</b> step, midrib have to through extraction step to remove all extractive and continue with hydrolisis step by using extraction liquid of palm empty bunch ash.

The highest purity of alpha cellulose was reached at pH 6 by using xylanase from Aspergillus Niger about 97, 55 %. So the conclucion of this research are, the best pH for <b>purifying</b> process by using xylanase is 6 and the best xylanase is the one which produce from Aspergillus Niger.
