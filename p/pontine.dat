5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the <b>pontine</b> nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the <b>pontine</b> nuclei via transverse <b>pontine</b> fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that the cerebellum is involved in pain processing. The cerebellum receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the <b>pontine</b> nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} <b>pontine</b> nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and <b>pontine</b> tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pontine</b> Paus (born 1973), a {{granddaughter of}} Countess Hedevig of Wedel-Jarlsberg, is a world-leading {{designer}} of handbags.|$|E
25|$|The tract {{is divided}} into two parts, the medial (or <b>pontine)</b> and lateral (or medullary) reticulospinal tracts (MRST and LRST).|$|E
25|$|Bladder afferent signals ascend {{the spinal}} cord to the periaqueductal gray, where they project both to the <b>pontine</b> {{micturition}} center and to the cerebrum. At {{a certain level of}} afferent activity, the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in <b>pontine</b> micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs. The <b>pontine</b> micturition center also causes inhibition of Onuf's nucleus, resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter. When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra. The micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder.|$|E
25|$|The pontomesencephalotegmental complex acts {{mainly on}} M1 receptors in the brainstem, deep {{cerebellar}} nuclei, <b>pontine</b> nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive. It also projects to the thalamus, tectum, basal ganglia and basal forebrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiology}} of micturition and the physiologic {{basis of its}} disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion, especially at the supraspinal level. Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the <b>pontine</b> micturition center and, like defecation, subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition.|$|E
25|$|Between Capua and Rome lay the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes (Pomptinae paludes), a swamp {{infested with}} malaria. A tortuous coastal road wound between Ostia {{at the mouth}} of the Tiber and Neapolis. The via Latina {{followed}} its ancient and scarcely more accessible path along the foothills of Monti Laziali and Monti Lepini, which are visible towering over the former marsh.|$|E
25|$|Hypoacusis {{is defined}} as {{impairment}} in hearing or deafness. Hypoacusis {{is one of five}} etiologies of musical hallucinations, and is the most common in the case studies reviewed by Evers and Ellgers. According to Sanchez et al. 2011, there have been suggestions that <b>pontine</b> lesions could alter the central auditory system's function causing hypoacusis and musical hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|PBA {{has also}} been {{observed}} in association {{with a variety of}} other brain disorders, including brain tumors, Wilson's disease, syphilitic pseudobulbar palsy, and various encephalitides. Rarer conditions associated with PBA include gelastic epilepsy, dacrystic epilepsy, central <b>pontine</b> myelinolysis, olivopontinocerebellar atrophy, lipid storage diseases, chemical exposure (e.g., nitrous oxide and insecticides), fou rire prodromique, and Angelman syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the <b>pontine</b> micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.|$|E
25|$|Urine, {{excreted}} by the kidneys, collects in {{the bladder}} before disposal by urination (micturition). The urinary bladder usually holds 300-350 ml of urine. As urine accumulates, the rugae flatten {{and the wall}} of the bladder thins as it stretches, allowing the bladder to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure. Urination is controlled by the <b>pontine</b> micturition center in the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, Syrah {{is grown}} in Tuscany (i.e. Cortona DOC), Lazio (<b>Pontine</b> Agro), and Apulia (Syrah Tarantino IGT). Also a DOC Sirah Piedmont exists. The region though {{which has made}} {{one of the best}} uses of Syrah, by {{blending}} it with Nero d'Avola grapes, is Sicily. The wines thus obtained are mellow with spicy accents and are in great demand on the international market.|$|E
25|$|In some animals, in {{addition}} to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centers that regulate urination include the <b>pontine</b> micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals, urine is drained through the urinary meatus, a urethral opening in the male penis or female vulval vestibule.|$|E
25|$|Paulo <b>Pontine</b> – The day house {{occupies}} a single storey ground floor area beneath the Art Department towards {{the south of}} the school estate. The boarding house, Redburn, is situated within a ten-minute walk of the school. The house colours are yellow, brown and light blue. The house takes its name from the area around St Paul's Church ('Paulo') and the area south of the river, over the Town Bridge ('Pontine').|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus {{is located}} where the {{cochlear}} nuclei and the <b>pontine</b> reticular formation (PRF) crossover. The PRF descends the reticulospinal tract where it innervates motor neurons and spinal interneurons. It {{is the main}} auditory tract in the brainstem that connects the superior olivary complex (SOC) with the inferior colliculus (IC). The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) has input from the LL and output to the contralateral LL via the ipsilateral and contralateral Dorsal Acoustic Stria.|$|E
25|$|Decius {{returned}} to favor {{under the rule}} of Theodoric the Great, by reclaiming a portion of the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes at his own expense. He was praised for this in a letter signed by Theodoric, and Decius set up an inscription at Terracina stating this was done by the command of king Theodoric. Around 510, Decius was one of five senators appointed to investigate charges that the vir inlustris Basilius and Praetextatus had practiced black magic.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Caligula {{named his}} only known daughter, Julia Drusilla, after his dead sister. Meanwhile, the widowed husband of Drusilla, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, {{reportedly}} became a lover to her sisters, Julia Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, {{in an apparent}} attempt to gain their support that he would succeed Caligula. This political conspiracy was discovered during that autumn by Caligula while in Germania Superior. Lepidus was executed swiftly and Livilla and Agrippina were exiled to the <b>Pontine</b> Islands.|$|E
25|$|The Anzio beachhead is at {{the northwestern}} end of a tract of {{reclaimed}} marshland, formerly the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes, now the <b>Pontine</b> Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying malaria, in Roman times armies marched {{as quickly as possible}} across it on the military road, the Via Appia. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and on others by mountains: the Monti Albani, the Monti Lepini, the Monti Ausoni and further south the Monti Aurunci (where the allies had been brought to a halt before Monte Cassino). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of Lazio, the ancient Latium. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the Via Latina, running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, risking entrapment. The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under Benito Mussolini. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from north Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.|$|E
25|$|Neurosurgical {{experiments}} by Michel Jouvet {{and others}} in the following two decades added an understanding of atonia and suggested the importance of the <b>pontine</b> tegmentum (dorsolateral pons) in enabling and regulating paradoxical sleep. Jouvet and others found that damaging the reticular formation of the brainstem inhibited this type of sleep. Jouvet coined the name “paradoxical sleep” in 1959 and in 1962 published results indicating that it could occur in a cat with its entire forebrain removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} pathway {{through which}} the threat-activated vigilance system acts is not well understood. One possibility is that the thalamus receives sensory information and sends it on the amygdala, which regulates emotional experience. Another is that the amygdaloid complex, anterior cingulate, and the structures in the <b>pontine</b> tegmentum interact to create the vision. It is also highly possible that SP hallucinations could result {{from a combination of}} these. The anterior cingulate has an extensive array of cortical connections to other cortical areas, which enables it to integrate the various sensations and emotions into the unified sensorium we experience.|$|E
25|$|Body {{temperature}} {{is not well}} regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver and breathe faster to regulate temperature during NREMS but not during REMS. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through body movement. (However, even cats with <b>pontine</b> lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.) Neurons which typically activate in response to cold temperatures—triggers for neural thermoregulation—simply do not fire during REM sleep, {{as they do in}} NREM sleep and waking.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} paruresis {{involves}} a tightening of the sphincter and/or bladder neck {{due to a}} sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, {{or some combination of}} the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The <b>pontine</b> micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|Without {{waiting to}} be {{told what to do}} by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|E
25|$|Some {{light was}} thrown on the {{mechanisms}} on sleep onset {{by the discovery}} that lesions in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus lead to insomnia while those in the posterior hypothalamus lead to sleepiness. Apart from this, {{it was found that}} lesions in oral <b>pontine</b> and midbrain reticular formation lead to loss of cortical activation. This was further narrowed down to show that the central midbrain tegmentum is the region that plays a role in cortical activation. Thus, sleep onset seems to arise from activation of the anterior hypothalamus along with inhibition of the posterior regions and the central midbrain tegmentum. Further research has shown that the hypothalamic region called ventrolateral preoptic nucleus produces the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA that inhibits the arousal system during sleep onset.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini {{launched}} several public construction {{programs and}} government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels. His earliest (and {{one of the}} best known) was the Battle for Wheat, by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them Littoria and Sabaudia) on land reclaimed by draining the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes. In Sardinia, a model agricultural town was founded and named Mussolinia, but has long since been renamed Arborea. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high tariffs were imposed. The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.|$|E
25|$|In 39, Livilla was {{involved}} in an unsuccessful conspiracy (led perhaps by Agrippina) to overthrow Caligula and to replace him by his brother-in-law Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Drusilla's widower, but also lover of Agrippina and Livilla). Livilla and her sister Agrippina the Younger were banished to the <b>Pontine</b> Islands (they were most likely separated in their exile and each one sent to a different island). After the deaths of Caligula, his fourth wife Milonia Caesonia, and their daughter Julia Drusilla, she returned from exile on the orders of the new emperor, Livilla's paternal uncle Claudius. Later in 41, she fell out of favour with Messalina (Claudius's third wife) and was charged by her paternal uncle Claudius for having adultery with Seneca the Younger. Both were exiled. She was most likely sent to Ventotene. Political considerations {{may have played a}} role in Julia Livilla's fate, more than just moral or domestic preoccupations as inferred in the ancient sources. In late 41 or early 42, her uncle ordered her execution, apparently by starvation, without a defense and on unsupported charges. She was executed around the same time as her cousin Julia Livia, the daughter of her aunt Livilla. Her remains were later brought back to Rome, probably when Agrippina became Empress; they were laid to rest in the Mausoleum of Augustus.|$|E
25|$|Other coins {{that were}} used at various times in the Pontifical States were the baiocchella = 1 baiocco, a copper piece with a silver surface, and {{therefore}} smaller than the copper baiocco; there were coins made of the two metals of the values, respectively of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 baiocchi; the copper madonnina (Bologna) = 5 baiocchi; the sampietrino (Pius VI) = 2½ baiocchi; the paludella was a soldo, made of an alloy of copper and silver, established by Pius VI as a more easily portable specie with which to pay the workmen of the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes; the sesino = 0·4 of a baiocco = 2 quattrini; the leonina (Leo XII) = 4·4 Gregorian scudi; the doblone = 2 old scudi = 3·3 scudi of the nineteenth century; there were dobloni of the relative values of 4, 8, and 16 scudi; the doppio was worth {{a little less than}} the doblone, that is, 3·21 scudi of the nineteenth Century; at Bologna there were also coined scudi of 80 baiocchi, and half-scudi of 40 baiocchi; the gabella was a Bolognese coin, equivalent to a carlino or giulio; the gabellone was equivalent to 26 bolognini (baiocchi); the franco, in the fifteenth century, was worth 12 baiocchi at Bologna, but only 10 baiocchi at Rome; the alberetti was a two-baiocco piece that was coined by the Roman Republic (1798–99).|$|E
500|$|The lateral zone, {{which in}} humans {{is by far}} the largest part, {{constitutes}} the cerebrocerebellum, also known as neocerebellum. It receives input exclusively from the cerebral cortex (especially the parietal lobe) via the <b>pontine</b> nuclei (forming cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways), and sends output mainly to the ventrolateral thalamus (in turn connected to motor areas of the premotor cortex and primary motor area of the cerebral cortex) and to the red nucleus. There is disagreement about the best way to describe the functions of the lateral cerebellum: It is thought to be involved in planning movement that is about to occur, in evaluating sensory information for action, and in a number of purely cognitive functions, such as determining the verb which best fits with a certain noun (as in [...] "sit" [...] for [...] "chair").|$|E
500|$|References to {{the unique}} {{periodic}} fevers of malaria are found throughout recorded history. Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian. The Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps. Malaria {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the Roman Empire, and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the [...] "Roman fever". Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber River. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, runoff from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.|$|E
500|$|After four busy {{weeks the}} Mozarts {{departed}} for Naples. Travellers {{on the route}} through the <b>Pontine</b> Marshes were frequently harassed by brigands, so Leopold arranged a convoy of four coaches. They arrived on 14 May. Armed with their letters of recommendation, the Mozarts were soon calling on the prime minister, marchese Bernardo Tanucci, and William Hamilton, the British ambassador, whom they knew from London. They gave a concert on 28May, which brought in about 750 florins (Leopold would not reveal the exact amount), and attended the first performance of Niccolò Jommelli's opera Armida abbandonata at the Teatro di San Carlo. Wolfgang was impressed by both {{the music and the}} performance, though he felt it [...] "too old-fashioned and serious for the theatre". Invited to write an opera for the next San Carlo season, he declined because of his prior commitment to Milan. When no summons to play at the royal court was forthcoming, Leopold eventually decided to leave Naples, after visits to Vesuvius, Herculaneum, Pompeii, and the Roman baths at Baiae. They departed by post-coach for Rome on 25June.|$|E
500|$|Delayed until 10 June by a {{calm and}} still unaware of French intentions, Nelson {{initially}} sailed along the Corsican coast, before anchoring at Elba on 12 June and sending Mutine into Civitavecchia for information. Hardy {{was unable to}} discover the French destination and, after a detour to Elba with his whole fleet, Nelson continued south. Two days later, the admiral spoke with a Tunisian ship at Giannutri, which passed on the inaccurate information that the French had been seen off Trapani, and might be anchored at Syracuse. On 17 June Nelson anchored at the <b>Pontine</b> Islands off Naples and sent Troubridge ashore {{to appeal to the}} British ambassador Sir William Hamilton for information and for the assistance of the Neapolitan Navy in scouting for the French. Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister Sir John Acton had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt, Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson, possibly suspicious of disinformation. Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta. Despite private animosity towards France, the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates, although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson's fleet. With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily, Nelson sailed in pursuit, but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the Straits of Messina until 20 June. There he received a report from the ambassador at Messina that the French were at Malta. Then on 22 June near Cape Passaro, Hardy stopped a Genoese ship from Ragusa that reported seeing the French fleet sailing southwards away from Malta, and that they had left Valletta on 16 June. This information was wrong (or mistranslated) in one important respect: although preparations had begun on 16 June the French had actually not departed until 19 June, and Nelson's fleet was just [...] away from Brueys. Nelson decided that the French target must be Egypt or Constantinople and called his senior captains: Saumarez, Ball, Troubridge and Henry Darby on board Vanguard for a conference. Together these officers determined Egypt as the most likely option, deducing that it was the best location in the Mediterranean from which Bonaparte could threaten India. Consequently, Nelson turned southeast towards Alexandria, exercising his men's gunnery daily to ensure they were ready for the battle he planned. His plan should his force encounter the French was clear: dividing into three squadrons, his fleet would strike the French at three points. Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports, sinking or capturing as many as possible. Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them. He later said of this time that [...] "I had the happiness to command a Band of Brothers." ...|$|E
