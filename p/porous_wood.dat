As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, <b>porous</b> <b>wood</b> composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.|$|E

The Medford Lakes Development Company was formed in 1927, and in 1928 the Colony Club Pavilion was constructed on ground donated by the Development Company.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Many {{species of}} the Fagaceae have been {{variously}} interpreted on the basis, primarily of external morphological characteristics. The objectives {{of this study are}} to elucidate generic and specific characteristics of the wood of Fagaceae and to attempt to obtain evidence regarding taxonomic relationships among some of the species occurring in Taiwan that have been variously interpreted. There are 45 species (Lin and Liu, 1965) of Fagaceae, subdivided to seven genera, in Taiwan and 35 of these were obtained for study. Detailed descriptions are provided for all species and differences among species and genera are emphasized. On the basis of comparative wood anatomy of the species studied, several suggestions are made regarding relationships of certain species. The wood anatomy of Pasania uraiana (Hay.) Schottky is very similar to that of Castanopsis and quite different from the anatomy of other species of Pasania or of Lithocarpus. The cupula is cuplike, however, so that it differs in this important generic character from Castanopsis. It probably should be treated under a distinct genus, Limlia, as Masamune and Tomiya (1947) suggested. The comparison of wood anatomy between Pasania dodoniaefolia and Pasania formosana shows consistent differences. Pasania dodoniaefolia shows distinct growth rings, homogeneous rays and absence of crystals in the parenchyma cells. Pasania formosana shows indistinct growth rings, heterogeneous rays and presence of crystals in parenchyma cells. Since the morphological characters are also somewhat different (Lin and Liu, 1965), they probably should be treated as two distinct species. Morphologically, Castanopsis carlesii var. sessilis is very similar to Castanopsis carlesii, but is quite different with regard to wood anatomy. Since Castanopsis carlesii var. sessilis has ring <b>porous</b> <b>wood,</b> conspicuous growth rings and pore size transition abrupt, while Castanopsis carlesii has diffuse <b>porous</b> <b>wood,</b> inconspicuous growth rings, pore size transition gradual, these should be considered as separate species and the original name, Castanopsis stipitata should be recognized as the valid name. The genera Lithocarpus and Pasania could not be separated anatomically.

The first question about this model is which of the two factors, the alignment of the pores and the dielectric anisotropy of wood substance, causes the dielectric anisotropy of wood [17 – 20, 23, 25, 29]. Norimoto and Yamada [23] concluded that the dielectric anisotropy of oven-dried wood is caused by both of them in the low frequency range and only by the pore alignment in the high frequency range. According to their conclusion, it is expected that the dielectric anisotropy of oven-dried wood at a frequency of 100  GHz is caused only by the pore alignment and that wood substance is a dielectric isotropic material. For air-dried wood (MC =  11  %), wood substance with bound water is assumed to be also isotropic.|$|E

Experiments on veneer from 11 different species of <b>wood,</b> covering ring <b>porous,</b> semi-diffuse/-ring porous and diffuse <b>porous</b> <b>woods,</b> were carried out and examined. The optimal cutting metrics with respect to speed, power and frequency for the types of wood were determined.  The most important ethical question for a conservator {{is to be able to}} preserve as much as original material as possible. The results of this project show that the use of a laser cutting machine is indeed a suitable solution to produce replacement veneer for marquetry works in furniture conservation with respect to quality and time. Especially when it comes to the precision in the shape of the replacement piece, laser cutting is superior to hand sawing. This makes laser cutting an interesting option and reduces the need for expert skills in hand sawing in order to perform very detailed completion work. It also reduces the need of invasive work on the original marquetry to accommodate the replacement piece. The findings are general for all of the examined types of wood. On the negative side, the laser cutting machine requires a relatively big initial investment, making it difficult to say if it is really a cost-effective method of cutting replacement veneer pieces.

We used standard palaeobotanical methods and a new approach: propagation phase contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRμCT) for fossil plant infilled with metallic sulphides and oxides, which enabled a three-dimensional analysis of the fossil wood in virtual histology. We show that the xylem was composed of P-type tracheids (an extinct wall structure of scalariform type), contained rays, and showed evidence of both periclinal and anticlinal cell divisions. A transverse section of xylem cell lumens extracted from the PPC-SRμCT volume was used to map cell dimensions. The specific hydraulic conductivity Ks was calculated as 17. 4 kg m- 1 s- 1 MPa- 1, and the mean cell thickness-to-span ratio (t/b) 2 was 0, 0372.

The <b>porous</b> <b>wood</b> particle is considered as a two-phase system: the solid phase consisting of wood and char and the gas phase consisting of volatiles and tar. Conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy are developed for each phase. Chemical processes are described through an existing one-stage three-reactions scheme, leading separately to char, tar and volatiles evolution dynamics. The variation of transport and physical properties with temperature and with composition is presented by algebraic equations. The model {{presented in this paper}} is more advanced than the current models found in literature, since it contains physical effects not included in past models, such as cross diffusion, differing solid and gas phase temperatures and a transient gas phase momentum equation incorporating the wall friction experienced by a fluid flowing through a porous medium. Furthermore, an adequate reference system for enthalpy, based on temperature dependent reaction heats, is used. The mathematical equations with initial and boundary conditions are solved numerically by means of a commercial CFD code (PHOENICS). The validity of the pyrolysis kinetics scheme is examined through comparison with experimental data.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the orientation of}} wood fibers in porous networks like paper, paperboard or fiberboard by computing digital thermal conductivity experiments on micro-computed tomography (μCT) images with artificial isotropic thermal conductivity parameters. The accuracy of mechanical and thermal constitutive models for <b>porous</b> <b>wood</b> fiber based materials crucially depends on knowing the wood fiber orientation. Unfortunately, due to the high porosity, the micro-heterogeneity of wood fibers, the high carbon content of organic materials and the unknown additives present in industrial paper, μCT-scans often exhibit low contrast and strong artifacts. Conventional image processing approaches encounter difficulties, as they rely upon convex fiber cross sections. We propose a solution by circumventing the segmentation of single wood fibers in μCT images, by performing thermal conductivity simulations on binarized wood fiber structures, where an artificial isotropic thermal conductivity is associated to the fibers and the pore space is considered as isolating. The local and global temperature fluxes are assembled into a fiber orientation tensor. This method overcomes {{the limitations of the}} mentioned local image processing approaches, as individual fibers need not be resolved and convergence for increasing resolution is a consequence of abstract mathematical theory. We use our novel method to analyze large three-dimensional μCT-scans and a synchrotron scan of a paperboard sample, serving as the starting point of an accurate micromechanical modeling of the effective anisotropic mechanical behavior of paper and paperboard.
