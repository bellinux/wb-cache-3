5|$|Annie Leibovitz's <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> naked Lennon {{embracing}} his wife, {{taken on}} the day of the murder, was the cover of Rolling Stones 22 January 1981 issue, most of which was dedicated to articles, letters and photographs commemorating Lennon's life and death. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors ranked it as the top magazine cover of the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|A <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dazed Tittle in the {{end zone}} taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is {{regarded}} among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{intends to}} track Druce's truck, {{which is on}} its way to Colorado. However, before he leaves, Deep Throat {{approaches}} Mulder at his apartment, offering the <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> purported UFO at Fort Benning, Georgia. Mulder initially believes that Druce's truck is a decoy meant to distract him from the UFO, but discovers that Deep Throat's photo is a fake. When Mulder confronts Deep Throat, he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine. He also divulges that the truck is being used to transport an extraterrestrial biological entity, or E.B.E., that was recovered from the Iraqi crash site. Mulder and Scully escape their pursuers and head towards Las Vegas, the last known location of the truck.|$|E

5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spoon on a table in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|Visual scene {{displays}} are {{a different}} method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary {{that is associated with}} specific activities or routines. For example, a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication. Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E

5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} Shockwave {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack Shockwave, {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. Bludgeon is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that Bludgeon intends to use the Ultra-Energon on Earth to re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his cassette player mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire a Transformer, an agent working for the Machination takes a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he is targeted and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rubbing {{of one of the}} bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E
5|$|Veronica shows one of {{the rape}} victims (Krista Kalmus) the <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suspect, but she doesn’t {{recognize}} him. In criminology class, Veronica does {{a case study of}} Weevil (Francis Capra), and the class enjoys it. After the study, Veronica tells Weevil that she’s dating Logan (Jason Dohring), and he reacts negatively. Veronica then walks into Mars Investigations and finds Cyrus O’Dell and his wife (Jaime Ray Newman) talking with Keith, while Veronica herself does some detective work. Keith informs Veronica that Dean O’Dell’s stepson is dying and that he wants Keith to find the boy’s biological father. At Mercer's (Ryan Devlin) party, two masked men enter and steal everyone’s valuables, including the necklace that Lilly gave Veronica. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is failing his mechanical engineering class, a subject in which he wanted to major. Meanwhile, Keith tracks down the husband, and Veronica accuses Weevil of robbing the party.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{sightings}} in the Japan Sea {{are very}} seldom made.
