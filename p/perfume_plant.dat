30|$|From {{the late}} 1970 s to the 1990 s, Han-Dong Sun wrote {{a number of}} reviews about the {{international}} progress of natural perfumes studies and the research progress and strategic discussion of perfume plants in both Yunnan Province and China. For example, “Progress in Analytical Research of Natural Aromatic Compounds” [3], “Perfume Plant Resources in Yunnan Province”, “Suggestions on Exploitation of Perfume Resources in Yunnan Province”, “Taking Full Advantages of Yunnan Natural Resources and Vigorously Developing Natural Perfume Production”, “Advances in Lichens Perfume” [4], “Natural <b>Perfume</b> <b>Plant</b> Resources” and “Chinese <b>Perfume</b> <b>Plant</b> Resources” [5, 6] have been published and well-received in both domestic and foreign publications. These publications boosted {{the research and development}} of natural perfumes in China and contributed greatly {{to the development of the}} natural perfume industry in China. It is noteworthy that “Study on Resource Exploration and Strategic Development in Southwest China” (containing the subproject “Natural <b>Perfume</b> <b>Plant</b> Resources” that was completed by Han-Dong Sun), sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Natural Resources Comprehensive Investigation Commission of the State Planning Commission, won the Science and Technology Progress Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993 and the Second Prize of the National Scientific and Technological Progress Award in 1995.|$|E

Additionally, over the past decade, they reported the development and application of approximately 400 types of Chinese perfume plants, especially those found in tropical and subtropical climates, such as Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna. The research provided a solid scientific basis for the comprehensive and in-depth understanding of <b>perfume</b> <b>plant</b> resources {{as well as their}} exploitation and utilization in Yunnan Province and throughout China. The results of the study were published in two monographs, which were “The Resources and Aromatic Components of Plants of Genus Cinnamomum in China” and “Perfume Plants and Their Utilization in Yunnan Province”, in 1997 and 2001 by Yunnan Science and Technology Press, respectively. These two monographs obtained high praise from perfume industry peers at home and abroad.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ledum palustre is an {{important}} <b>perfume</b> <b>plant</b> in northeast China, and widely distributed at Changbai mountain of Jilin province. The components and contents of essential oils in Ledum palustre were highly correlated with their growth environment. By using GC-MS, about 32 compounds were identified from Ledum palustre essential oils of Changbai mountain. The chemical components were L-bornyl acetate (20. 2 %), 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetramethyl-benzene (16. 5 %), (−) -myrtenal (4. 4 %), terpinen- 4 -ol (4. 3 %), 2, 6 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadiene (3. 8 %), trans-pinocarveol (3. 7 %), L(-) -borneol (3. 0 %), geranyl acetate (2. 8 %), (+) -aromandendrene (2. 3 %), ledol (1. 7 %), sabenene (1. 6 %), β-pinene (1. 4 %), camphene (1. 1 %), caryophyllene oxide (1. 1 %), and citronellyl formate (0. 5 %), which indicate the application of Ledum palustre essential oils from Changbai mountain should be different from other areas.

40|$|International audienceProducing {{coffee in}} a European {{country is a}} {{challenge}} according {{to the cost of}} labour. Faced to the need to substitute non profitable crops like <b>perfume</b> <b>plants</b> (Geranium rosa), farmers of the Reunion Island, the French island in the Indian Ocean (Figure 1), decided to grow coffee helped by a development project ("Café Bourbon pointu de la Réunion"). This project has been set up to study the feasibility of producing a high value coffee, a "gourmet coffee". The coffee Bourbon pointu, caffeine low, is well known for its fruity taste since the 19 th century. It received 39 gold medals at the 1869 Colonial Fair and the gold medal at the 1897 Anvers World Fair. The coffee Bourbon pointu cultivation is abandoned in 1940 because of the production costs that makes this cultivation non profitable. It is now boosted for a high value niche market. Four years of agronomic trials (screening of the lines, development of good cultural methods) and experiments on the post-harvest process give a lot of results. Crossing these results with sensorial evaluations led to produce a high value coffee. Studies about the behaviour of the coffee trees in various environmental conditions permitted to define the favourable "terroir" to produce a high value coffee. This paper focuses on the post-harvest processes and the method used to define the process giving the best sensorial results. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

6000|$|Newman {{hated to}} see {{a husband and wife}} on these terms, and he was sure one or other of them must be very unhappy. He knew it was not Tristram. Mrs. Tristram had a balcony before her windows, upon which, during the June evenings, she was fond of sitting, and Newman used frankly to say that he {{preferred}} the balcony to the club. It had a fringe of <b>perfumed</b> <b>plants</b> in tubs, and enabled you to look up the broad street and see the Arch of Triumph vaguely massing its heroic sculptures in the summer starlight. Sometimes Newman kept his promise of following Mr. Tristram, in half an hour, to the Occidental, and sometimes he forgot it. His hostess asked him a great many questions about himself, but on this subject he was an indifferent talker. He was not what is called subjective, though when he felt that her interest was sincere, he made an almost heroic attempt to be. He told her a great many things he had done, and regaled her with anecdotes of Western life; she was from Philadelphia, and with her eight years in Paris, talked of herself as a languid Oriental. But some other person was always the hero of the tale, by no means always to his advantage; and Newman's own emotions were but scantily chronicled. She had an especial wish to know whether he had ever been in love--seriously, passionately--and, failing to gather any satisfaction from his allusions, she at last directly inquired. He hesitated a while, and at last he said, [...] "No!" [...] She declared that she was delighted to hear it, as it confirmed her private conviction that {{he was a man of}} no feeling.|$|R

These adventurous companions soon lost sight of their devoted champion, and entered a winding ravine, which gradually brought them to the summit of the first chain of the Epirot mountains. From it they looked down upon a vast and rocky valley, through which several mule tracks led in various directions, and entered the highest barrier of the mountains, which rose before them covered with forests of chestnut and ilex. Nicæus chose the track which he considered least tempting to pursuit, and towards sunset they had again entered a ravine washed by a mountain stream. The course of the waters had made the earth fertile and beautiful. Wild shrubs of gay and pleasant colours refreshed their wearied eye-sight, and the <b>perfume</b> of aromatic <b>plants</b> invigorated their jaded senses. Upon the bank of the river, too, a large cross of roughly-carved wood brought comfort to their Christian hearts, and while the holy emblem filled them with hope and consolation, and seemed an omen of refuge from their Moslemin oppressors, a venerable Eremite, with a long white beard descending over his dark robes, and leaning on a staff of thorn, came forth from an adjoining cavern to breathe the evening air and pour forth his evening orisons.|$|R
