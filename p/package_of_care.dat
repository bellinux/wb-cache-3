40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} different treatments for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Data sources were searched up to July 2016 and included MEDLINE and Embase. Randomised trials comparing treatments for GDM (<b>packages</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> (dietary and lifestyle interventions with pharmacological treatments as required), insulin, metformin, glibenclamide (glyburide)) were selected by two authors and double checked for accuracy. Outcomes included large for gestational age, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, caesarean section and pre-eclampsia. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses and used Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare pharmacological treatments (ie, including treatments not directly compared within a trial). RESULTS: Forty-two trials were included, the reporting of which was generally poor with unclear or high risk <b>of</b> bias. <b>Packages</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> varied in their composition and reduced the risk of most adverse perinatal outcomes compared with routine care (eg, large for gestational age: relative risk 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 49 to 0. 68; I(2) = 0 %; trials 8; participants 3462). Network meta-analyses suggest that metformin had the highest probability of being the most effective treatment in {{reducing the risk of}} most outcomes compared with insulin or glibenclamide. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence shows that <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> are effective in reducing the risk of most adverse perinatal outcomes. However, trials often include few women, are poorly reported with unclear or high risk of bias and report few outcomes.

50|$|Carers {{are viewed}} by the {{government}} as an important resource {{and in recent years}} have been given increasing recognition in health and social care policy. Since devolution in 1999 legislation and policy for caregivers has been developed by the former Scottish Executive (now Scottish Government).Carers in Scotland are regarded as ‘partners’ in the provision of care. As a result, support services provided to carers are regarded as part of the overall <b>package</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> to the person being looked after. This means that carers are not seen as service users and are therefore not responsible for the cost of any service provided. The exception to this is when a carer is looking after their partner; in that situation their income may be taken into account during a financial assessment.This situation is different from that which exists in England where carers are viewed as services users in their own right and as such are liable for the cost of services provided. Yet, in many cases, it is not the carer who actually needs the service; it is the person being cared for who needs it because of their illness or disability.|$|E
50|$|This period {{also saw}} {{sporadic}} investigation of more mild forms of hypothermia, with mild hypothermia being {{defined as a}} body temperature of 32 - 34 C. In the 1950s, Doctor Rosomoff demonstrated in dogs {{the positive effects of}} mild hypothermia after brain ischemia and traumatic brain injury. In the 1980s further animal studies indicated the ability of mild hypothermia to act as a general neuroprotectant following a blockage of blood flow to the brain. This animal data was supported by two landmark human studies that were published simultaneously in 2002 by the New England Journal of Medicine. Both studies, one occurring in Europe and the other in Australia, demonstrated the positive effects of mild hypothermia applied following cardiac arrest. Responding to this research, in 2003 the American Heart Association (AHA) and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) endorsed the use of targeted temperature management following cardiac arrest. Currently, a growing percentage of hospitals around the world incorporate the AHA/ILCOR guidelines and include hypothermic therapies in their standard <b>package</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for patients suffering from cardiac arrest. Some researchers {{go so far as to}} contend that hypothermia represents a better neuroprotectant following a blockage of blood to the brain than any known drug. Over this same period a particularly successful research effort showed that hypothermia is a highly effective treatment when applied to newborn infants following birth asphyxia. Meta-analysis of a number of large randomised controlled trials showed that hypothermia for 72 hours started within 6 hours of birth significantly increased the chance of survival without brain damage.|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{attention}} is shifting towards delivering essential <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> {{often based on}} clinical practice guidelines, {{as a means to}} improve maternal, child and newborn survival in low-income settings. Cost effectiveness analysis (CEA), allied to the evaluation of less complex intervention, has become an increasingly important tool for priority setting.

In the discussion, we illustrate some of the challenges facing the extension of CEA to this area. We suggest that there are both practical and methodological challenges to overcome when conducting economic evaluation for <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> interventions that incorporate clinical guidelines. Some might be overcome by developing specific guidance on approaches, for example clarity in identifying relevant costs. Some require consensus on methods. The greatest challenge, however, lies in how to incorporate, as measures of effectiveness, process measures of service quality. Questions on which measures to use, how multiple measures might be combined, how improvements in one area might be compared with those in another and what value is associated with improvement in health worker practices are yet to be answered...|$|R

The planned introduction of water fluoridation for South Africa will impact on the oral health workforce required to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> in the public oral health services. Objectives: To investigate the impact of water fluoridation on oral health workforce requirements to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> to 4 - to 15 -year-old children. Methods: The WHO/FDI (1989) and a "Service Targets Method" model were used to calculate the workforce requirements to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care.</b> Results: Without water fluoridation, oral hygienists represent more than 50 %, dental therapists between 30 to 40 % and dentists less than 10 % of the oral health workforce required to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care.</b> At an anticipated caries reduction of 30 % due to the introduction of water fluoridation, the number of dentists required decreases by 29 %, dental therapists between 27. 5 and 29. 8 % and oral hygienists between 2. 1 and 10. 5 %. This converts to a saving in salary of R 14, 8 million per year. Conclusions: This study supports an increase in the training of oral hygienists for employment in mainly the public sector. The number of dental therapists and dentists currently being trained should not be increased. On the short to medium term a year of compulsory community service after graduation, which was introduced in 2000 for dentists, should be expanded to include both oral hygienists and dental therapists to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care.</b> On the long term a number of posts should be created, linked to incentives, to attract both oral hygienists and dental therapists for employment in the public oral health services.

40|$|The {{world is}} {{undergoing}} a rapid health transition, with an ageing population and disease burden increasingly defined by disability. In Sub-Saharan Africa the next 40 years are predicted to see reduced mortality, signalling a surge in the impact of chronic diseases. We modelled these epidemiological changes and associated mental health workforce requirements. Years lived with a disability (YLD) predictions for mental and substance use disorders for each decade from 2010 to 2050 for four Sub-Saharan African regions were calculated using Global Burden of Disease 2010 study (GBD 2010) data and UN population forecasts. Predicted mental health workforce requirements for 2010 and 2050, by region and for selected countries, were modelled using GBD 2010 prevalence estimates and recommended <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and staffing ratios for low- and middle-income countries, and compared to current staffing from the WHO Mental Health Atlas. Significant population growth and ageing will result in an estimated 130 % increase in the burden of mental and substance use disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, to 45 million YLDs. As a result, the required mental health workforce will increase by 216, 600 full time equivalent staff from 2010 to 2050, and far more compared to the existing workforce.

Policy implementation was assessed using four research tools: key informant interviews, exit interviews, a facility survey, and analysis of facility finances and the cost of the <b>package</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> The findings point to important weaknesses in implementation, such as unclear specification of the exact target group and <b>package</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and inadequate funding.

40|$|Water {{fluoridation}} {{has been}} confirmed by three recent reviews {{as one of the}} most cost-effective and safe primary preventive measure against dental caries. Despite this evidence no artificially fluoridated water scheme exists in South Africa. The economic impact of water fluoridation in times of a reduction in dental caries should be weighed against its benefits. A minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> has been proposed for implementation in the public oral health services. Irrespective of the implementation of water fluoridation and/or a minimum package or oral care, it will impact on the required oral health human resources. The aim of this study was to investigate the economic viability of the implementation of water fluoridation and the delivery <b>of</b> the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> and the impact this will have on human resources planning for oral health in South Africa. Computerised simulation models were developed for this study. Per capita cost, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the implementation of water fluoridation was calculated for seventeen major metropolitan cities, towns and water boards in South Africa. Treatment need data was converted to a per capita cost to express the delivery <b>of</b> the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> as a monetary value. The World Health Organization/Fédération Dentaire Internationale and a “Service Targets Method” model were used to calculate the oral health human resources required to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care.</b> The average per capita cost of water fluoridation for the total population is R 2. 08. At an anticipated 30 % caries reduction achieved with water fluoridation, average cost-effectiveness is R 33. 16 and cost-benefit was calculated as 0. 18. Cost-benefit equals or exceeds 0. 8 for only three municipalities or water boards at an anticipated 10 % caries reduction as a result of the implementation of water fluoridation. The average per capita cost to provide the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> is R 245. 95 without the impact of water fluoridation and R 186. 03 at an anticipated 30 % caries reduction due to water fluoridation. Oral hygienists represent more than 50 %, dental therapists between 30 to 40 % and dentists less than 10 % of the total oral health human resources required to deliver the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care.</b> At an anticipated caries reduction of 30 % due to the introduction of water fluoridation, the number of dentists required decrease by 29 %, dental therapists between 27. 5 and 29. 8 % and oral hygienists between 2. 1 and 10. 5 %. This converts to a saving in salaries of R 14, 8 million per year. </p It is recommended that water fluoridation remains a viable option for South Africa, even if only a 10 % caries reduction as a result of its introduction is achieved. All provinces should actively pursue the introduction <b>of</b> the minimum <b>package</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> with appropriate modes of delivery by creating a number of posts as well as incentives to attract especially oral hygienists and dental therapists to the public service. The impact of the introduction of water fluoridation on human resources should always be considered in planning the number of oral health professionals to be trained.
