40|$|The paper {{highlights}} {{the challenges of}} establishment and characteristics of educational institutions functioning in the highlands. It is analyzed the work of <b>preparatory</b> <b>groups</b> that are meant to replace kindergartens in the remote mountainous areas in terms of preparing children for school. In the context of logical and mathematical development of senior preschool children we analyze the Program "Sure Start" {{and the issue of}} elementary mathematics education. It is concluded that the acquisition of this knowledge in preschool institutions and <b>preparatory</b> <b>groups</b> affects the quality of further mathematics education. In this regard effective solution to the implementation of the tasks of the Program "Sure Start" in mountainous regions is seen in cooperation on the part of kindergartens, schools and parents...|$|R

50|$|At {{the height}} of the {{construction}} effort, more than 100 East German foreign experts worked on the project. The resources of as many as 22 of their factories supplied the construction; at the same time, supply delays were caused by the Soviet Red Army's tremendous drain on East Germany's industrial production. The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the Trans-Siberian railway, and a 15 km track of railroad between Beijing Railway Station and Dongjiao Station was built especially to service the factory. Caltech-educated scientist Dr. Luo Peilin (罗沛霖), formerly head of the <b>preparatory</b> <b>group</b> in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase. Dr. Luo, now retired in Beijing, is remembered by his former colleagues as a dedicated perfectionist whose commitment to the obstacle-strewn project was a major factor of its eventual success.|$|E

By 1951, 156 [...] "joint factory" [...] projects had been realized under that agreement, part of the Chinese government's first Five-Year Plan. However the People's Liberation Army still had a dire need of modern electronic components, which were produced in only two of the joint factories. The Russians were unwilling to undertake an additional project at the time, and suggested that the Chinese turn to East Germany from which much of the Soviet Union's electronics equipment was imported. So at the request of then-Premier Zhou Enlai, scientists and engineers joined the first Chinese trade delegation to East Germany in 1951, visiting a dozen factories. The project was green-lighted in early 1952 and a Chinese <b>preparatory</b> <b>group</b> was sent to East Berlin to prepare design plans.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the conflict competence of children of preschool age and identification of its relationship with the child's sociometric status in the peer group. The hypothesis of the study was that there is a relationship between the sociometric status of preschoolers in the peer group and the strategy of their behavior in a conflict situation, a conflict of competence. The study involved children (41 children: 22 boys and 19 girls) aged 5 - 7 years, attending <b>preparatory</b> <b>groups</b> in kindergartens in Moscow (in 2011 - 2013).
