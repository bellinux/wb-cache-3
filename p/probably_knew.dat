5|$|Stigand did {{not travel}} to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium, the band worn around the neck that is the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from the pope. Travelling to Rome for the pallium had become a custom, practised {{by a number of}} his predecessors. Instead, some medieval chroniclers state that he used Robert of Jumièges' pallium. It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment. Owing to the reform movement, Stigand <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> the request would be unsuccessful. In 1058 Antipope Benedict X, who opposed much of the reform movement, gave Stigand a pallium. However, Benedict was deposed the {{following}} year; the reforming party declared Benedict an antipope, and nullified all his acts, including Stigand's pallium grant. The exact circumstances that led to Benedict granting a pallium are unknown, whether it was at Stigand's request or was given without prompting.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American wars of {{independence}} had repercussions in Puerto Rico; due to widespread privateering and other naval warfare, maritime commerce suffered heavily. Cabo Rojo {{was among the}} municipalities affected most, with its ports at a virtual standstill. African slaves took to the sea in an attempt at freedom; merchants were assessed higher taxes and harassed by foreigners. Under these conditions, Cofresí was born to Francisco and María Germana. The youngest of four children, he had one sister (Juana) and two brothers (Juan Francisco and Ignacio). Cofresí was baptized into the Catholic Church by José de Roxas, the first priest in Cabo Rojo, when he was fifteen days old. María died when Cofresí was four years old, and an aunt assumed his upbringing. Francisco then began a relationship with María Sanabria, {{the mother of his}} last child Julián. A don by birth, Cofresí's education was above average; since {{there is no evidence of}} a school in Cabo Rojo at that time, Francisco may have educated his children or hired a tutor. The Cofresís, raised in a multicultural environment, <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> Dutch and Italian. In November 1814 Francisco died, leaving a modest estate; Roberto was probably homeless, with no income.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William is {{surprisingly}} favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.|$|E

25|$|Early in the investigation, {{the police}} felt {{confident}} that the assailant or assailants {{were familiar with the}} victims and that the victims <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> their killer. The investigators theorized that the time of the killings had not been coincidental. Based on the fact that {{only a handful of people}} knew that Anne would be visiting on that precise time, the investigators concluded that the killer had the house under careful surveillance, and acting when seeing her car parked outside. The main theory is that Anne Orderud Paust was the main target of the killer or killers.|$|E
25|$|William Henry {{also became}} a {{collector}} of books. In many later recollections Ireland described his fascination with the works and the glorious death of the forger Thomas Chatterton, and <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> the Ossian poems of James Macpherson. He was strongly influenced by the 1780 novel Love and Madness by Herbert Croft, which was often read aloud in the Ireland house, and which contained large sections on Chatterton and Macpherson. When he was apprenticed to a mortgage lawyer, Ireland began to experiment with blank, genuinely old papers and forged signatures on them. Eventually he forged several documents until {{he was ready to}} present them to his father.|$|E

25|$|If the {{hypothesis}} is true, then the Chinese <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> about differentials centuries before Europeans. There has been {{speculation that the}} ancient Greeks knew about them in about 100 BCE, but this is now considered unlikely. The first true differential gear definitely {{known to have been}} used in the Western world was by Joseph Williamson in 1720. He used a differential for correcting the equation of time for a clock that displayed both mean and solar time. Even then, the differential was not fully appreciated in Europe until James White emphasized its importance and provided details for it in his Century of Inventions (1822).|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} King Æthelred the Unready {{witnessed}} {{the resumption of}} Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained. Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s, but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009–12, when {{a large part of}} the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall. It remained for Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013–14, and (after Æthelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015–16. The tale of these years incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle must be read in its own right, and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during Æthelred's reign. It is this evidence which is the basis for Simon Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat. The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler <b>probably</b> <b>knew.</b> It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop Æthelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered.|$|E

[...] Michelangelo <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> {{of the work and}} its ideas, and he wanted to incorporate those ideas into his own work. Signorelli’s Madonna similarly uses a tondo form, depicts nude male figures in the background, and displays the Virgin sitting directly on the earth.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of Bach's Magnificat {{has been compared}} with that of Kuhnau's, which he <b>probably</b> <b>knew,</b> and with that of Johann Philipp Krieger's , which Kuhnau <b>probably</b> <b>knew.</b> Kuhnau's Magnificat, his largest extant vocal work, has a similar orchestration as the first version of Bach's Magnificat (differences: Kuhnau's has a second viola, Bach's has two recorders in one movement), and it has the same [...] "expandability" [...] with settings of the same laudes for a Christmas performance. Kuhnau's Magnificat has standard SATB soloists, but like Bach's, a SSATB choir. All three Magnificats set verses 1, 6, 10 and 12 of the Magnificat text for chorus. Kuhnau's has five choral movements, like Bach's, but his second is verse 4 (instead of 3b for Bach), and his last is only verse 12, where for Bach that final chorus sets both verse 11 and 12. In all three Magnificats the other verses are set for soloists, as a single voice or combined into duets and trios.|$|E
500|$|Besides the {{reference}} to Rabelais, an analysis by Dave Evans shows similarities to The Beloved of Hathor and Shrine of the Golden Hawk, a play by Florence Farr. Evans says this may result {{from the fact that}} [...] "both Farr and Crowley were thoroughly steeped in Golden Dawn imagery and teachings", and that Crowley <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> the ancient materials that inspired some of Farr's motifs. Sutin also finds similarities between Thelema and the work of W. B. Yeats, attributing this to [...] "shared insight" [...] and perhaps to the older man's knowledge of Crowley.|$|E

Malacologist (mollusk expert) Ronald Chase of McGill University said about the garden snail Cornu aspersum, [...] "I believe the myth of Cupid and his arrows has its basis in this snail species, which is native to Greece". He added, [...] "The Greeks <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> about this behavior because they were pretty good naturalists and observers." ...|$|E
500|$|Adler grew up {{with one}} foot in a {{traditional}} Jewish world and one in a more modern, European one.

[...] His education was irregular: as the family fortunes rose and fell, he {{would be sent to}} cheder (Jewish religious school) or to a Russian language county school, pulled out of school entirely, or have a private tutor for a few months. He wrote that [...] "the sum of my learning was a little arithmetic, some Russian grammar, and a few French phrases." ...|$|E
500|$|In many {{of these}} {{settings}} a single verse of the Magnificat can be sung {{by one or more}} soloists alternating with choral singing, as Bach does in his treatment of the third Magnificat verse: the soprano sings the first words of the verse, while the chorus concludes it. This particular split of the third verse, leaving only the last two words (omnes generationes) to the chorus, had been practised before by Ruggiero Fedeli, and in a Magnificat in G minor from 1720 which Bach <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> (that Magnificat in G minor used to be attributed to Tomaso Albinoni). Also Graupner's 1722 Magnificat [...] had this split.|$|E

500|$|Cunningham {{described}} {{the command of}} the Mediterranean Fleet as [...] "The finest command the Royal Navy has to offer" [...] and he remarked in his memoirs that [...] "I <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> the Mediterranean {{as well as any}} Naval Officer of my generation". Cunningham was made Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, hoisting his flag in HMS Warspite on 6 June 1939, one day after arriving in Alexandria on 5 June 1939. As Commander-in-Chief, Cunningham's main concern was for the safety of convoys heading for Egypt and Malta. These convoys were highly significant in that they were desperately needed to keep Malta, a small British colony and naval base, in the war. Malta was a strategic strongpoint and Cunningham fully appreciated this. Cunningham believed that the main threat to British Sea Power in the Mediterranean would come from the Italian Fleet. As such Cunningham had his fleet at a heightened state of readiness, so that when Italy did choose to enter into hostilities, then the British Fleet would be ready.|$|E
500|$|Henry was the {{youngest}} of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, [...] "short, stocky and barrel-chested," [...] with black hair. As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> his sister, Adela, well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to {{become a member of the}} clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Paraná had seen both his main foes–Aureliano Coutinho and Feijó–and their {{political}} factions fall into oblivion, while {{he rose to}} power. Eusébio de Queirós, his main rival within the Conservative Party, had attempted to rally the saquaremas against his project, and failed. Eusébio de Queirós and Paraná carried on their power struggle during debates in the Senate, and in the end, Paraná emerged victorious. His success came {{at the expense of}} his weakened and deeply divided party. Just as serious were the consequences of the Law of the Circles. In theory, Paraná's initiatives for judicial and electoral reform would have ensured fairer elections, since they attempted to curtail the corrupting influence of political parties on elections. In practice, however, the opposite happened; tampering by parties was merely replaced by greater interference by the cabinet. Paraná <b>probably</b> <b>knew</b> that the reform, as enacted, had the potential to do more harm than good, as it gave him unprecedented control over national politics. According to Needell, [...] "Paraná might well have seen the cabinet and its victory as his personal vindication before the party rivals and his monarch, his political triumph after the dismissal of 1844 and the second-rank status and saquarema disrespect of 1850." ...|$|E
