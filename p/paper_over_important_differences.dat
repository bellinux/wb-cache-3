40|$|Based on the {{exceptional}} ageing of the Italian population, this paper aims {{to contribute to}} the current debate on population ageing and financial markets. To this end, we use data taken by the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) over the over the period 1995 – 2006 and we analyse the average household portfolios in relation to age and net wealth. Our analysis rests on a clustering of assets according to risk which is different from the one used in Guiso and Jappelli (2002). We find that age has affected financial choices of Italian households over the whole decade, but the portfolio age profile has significantly evolved <b>over</b> time with <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> across wealth quartiles. Overall our analysis highlights a tendency toward a hump-shaped age profile of the allocation in risky assets for most net wealth levels...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a critical response to Ernest Caldwell 2 ̆ 7 s article, Horizontal Rights and Chinese Constitutionalism: Judicialization through Labor Disputes. According to Caldwell, those {{looking for an}} emerging constitutional culture in China should be looking not in the higher courts (as the American paradigm of constitutional law suggests), but in the lower courts that settle day-to-day disputes. Moreover, the constitutional discourse in those lower courts is not about limiting state power, but {{about the need for}} 2 ̆ 2 horizontal 2 ̆ 2 protections of citizens [...] specifically laborers [...] from their powerful employers in furtherance of constitutional values. This article offers three responses to Caldwell 2 ̆ 7 s thesis. First, while acknowledging and drawing on other constitutional traditions in western liberal democracies to illustrate the significance of 2 ̆ 2 horizontal rights 2 ̆ 2 in constitutional thought, Caldwell nevertheless concludes that China 2 ̆ 7 s approach to rights is distinct from the Western tradition, glossing <b>over</b> <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> within Western constitutional thought. Second, while criticizing a single-minded focus on the decisions of the higher courts, Caldwell 2 ̆ 7 s approach remains largely court-centric;there are, however, other understandings of constitutionalism in U. S. constitutional scholarship and in the varying practices of constitutionalism in East and Southeast Asia that are less focused on courts. Finally, the observation that consti- tutional principles might {{play an important role in}} moderating private power in an age of multinational enterprises could be extended beyond the jurisdictional boundaries of the state. If private and hybrid (public-private) forms of power are increasingly operating beyond states, we need to find innovative ways of moderating that power that stretch our understanding of constitutional law.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} minimally <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> for {{dimensions of}} the PDQ- 39, a 39 -item Parkinson's disease questionnaire. A minimally <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> {{is defined as the}} smallest change between two scores that is subjectively meaningful to patients. Data on minimally <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> are essential for the calculation of sample sizes in trials and surveys. METHODS: We conducted a postal survey of randomly selected members of 13 local branches of the Parkinson's Disease Society, asking them to complete the PDQ- 39 on two occasions, 6 months apart. On the first occasion respondents received the PDQ- 39, demographic questions and a request to provide their name and address if they were willing {{to take part in the}} follow-up survey. After 6 months, we sent those who had agreed another copy of the questionnaire and also asked them to indicate how much change they had experienced since baseline in overall health and in each of the eight domains of the questionnaire. RESULTS: We calculated minimally <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> for each dimension and the index score for those reporting minor change since baseline. The minimally <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> varied across dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the minimum magnitude of change that should be sought when designing studies to evaluate change over time in Parkinson's disease. Since minimally <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> differ across dimensions, those designing studies in which sample size calculations are based on the PDQ- 39 as an outcome measure should select the dimension which is the primary variable of interest...|$|R
40|$|Background: The minimal {{clinically}} <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> is {{the smallest}} difference in an outcome score that a patient perceives as beneficial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the minimal clinically <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and in the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) score for patients treated nonoperatively for rotator cuff disease. Methods: Eighty-one patients with tendinitis or a tear of the rotator cuff were treated with nonoperative modalities. Evaluation with the ASES score and the SST was performed at baseline and at a minimum of six weeks after treatment. At the follow-up evaluation, the minimal clinically <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> was estimated for the two scores with use of an anchor-based approach involving fifteen-item (pain and function) and four-item improvement questions. Results: The fifteen-item function and four-item assessments indicated, respectively, that a 2. 05 -point (p = 0. 02) and 2. 33 -point (p = 0. 0009) change in the SST score from baseline represented a minimal clinically <b>important</b> <b>difference.</b> The fifteen-item function, fifteen-item pain, and four-item assessments indicated that a 12. 01 -point (p = 0. 03), 16. 92 -point (p = 0. 004), and 16. 72 -point (p 0. 05). A longer duration of follow-up after treatment was associated with a greater minimal clinically <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> in the ASES score (p < 0. 05), although the duration of follow-up had no effect on the minimal clinically <b>important</b> <b>difference</b> in the SST score. Conclusions: Patients with rotator cuff disease who are treated without surgery and have a 2 -point change in the SST score or a 12 to 17 -point change in the ASES score experience a clinically important change in self-assessed outcome. These minimal clinically <b>important</b> <b>differences</b> can provide the basis for determining if significant differences in outcomes after treatment are clinically relevant...|$|R
