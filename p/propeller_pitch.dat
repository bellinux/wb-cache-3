5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E

This engine introduced a pioneering {{example of an}} engine management system called the Kommandogerät (command-device) designed by BMW, who also designed the 801's forward cowling with its integral oil cooling system: the Kommandogerät functioned in effect as an electro-mechanical computer which set mixture, <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> (for the constant-speed propeller), boost, and magneto timing.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Bader crashed a Spitfire on take-off. He had {{forgotten}} to switch the <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> from coarse to fine, and the aircraft careered down the runway at 80mph, ultimately crashing. Despite a head wound, Bader got into another Spitfire for a second attempt. Leigh-Mallory made Bader a flight commander of No. 222 Squadron RAF {{a few weeks later}} which also meant an advance from flying officer to flight lieutenant.|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} are {{described}} four {{different types of}} propellers which appeared at widely separated dates, but which were exhibited together at the last Salon de l'Aeronautique. The four propellers are the Chaviere variable <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller,</b> the variable <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> used on the Clement Bayard dirigible, the variable <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> used on Italian dirigibles, and the Levasseur variable <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller...</b>|$|R
50|$|Mechanical azimuth {{thrusters}} can {{be fixed}} installed, retractable or underwater-mountable. They may have fixed <b>pitch</b> <b>propellers</b> or controllable <b>pitch</b> <b>propellers.</b> Fixed installed thrusters are used for tugboats, ferries and supply-boats. Retractable thrusters are used as auxiliary propulsion for dynamically positioned vessels and take-home propulsion for military vessels. Underwater-mountable thrusters are used as dynamic positioning propulsion for very large vessels such as semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{probable}} causes of stalling due to low speed {{was attributed to}} turboprop engines features which change the <b>propellers</b> <b>pitch</b> during acceleration. Hence sudden throttle increase is not recommended. Such a maneuver was probably executed by the Captain who was accustomed to flying piston engine aircraft in which such maneuvers are allowed. The Vickers Viscount 804 was recently bought from British United Airways and on LOT's roster for only 84 flight hours.|$|R
25|$|Many {{features}} of the EMB-312 became standard in later basic-training aircraft designs. It was the first turboprop trainer developed from the beginning with military jet capability. A Martin-Baker Mk8L was fitted. It was Embraer's first aircraft with tandem seats designed with a raised rear seat optimized for an uninterrupted view from the rear cockpit and a frameless bubble canopy for unobstructed visibility. Major aircraft features include an automatic torque control system and the jet-like, single-lever throttle which combined both engine power and <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch,</b> assuring smooth and rapid acceleration and deceleration.|$|E
25|$|In putting {{together}} the curriculum for training pilots and copilots on the B-29 Superfortress, Training Command could make use of its experience in transition training for heavy bombers. No such experience was available {{in the case of}} flight engineers, because the B-29 was the first AAF aircraft that required a flight engineer. This individual operated the engine control panel of the aircraft. Located behind the pilot, the panel contained all operating instruments but those the pilot used to control the altitude and direction of the B-29. At the direction of the pilot, the flight engineer used these instruments to adjust the throttles, fuel mixture, supercharger, and <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch.</b> He also computed the aircraft's cruising range, fuel consumption, engine performance, weight and balance, and airworthiness. Flight engineers underwent comprehensive training at Amarillo and Lowry Fields before assignment to B-29 transition training.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, 1979, Hinton {{was racing}} the RB-51 in the Reno Air Races when a {{capacitor}} in the magneto failed, causing {{the engine to}} run on half its spark plugs. Not knowing what was wrong, Hinton pushed the plane to full throttle. This resulted in the supercharger carrying the extra pressure. Eventually, a bearing in the supercharger failed. Hinton finished the race in second place and moved to make an emergency landing. The supercharger failure resulted in a shaft failure, however; that shaft drove the oil pump, which in turn controlled the <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch.</b> The propellers went flat, acting as a huge air brake. The RB-51 crashed short of the runway. The wings were sheared off as the plane came down between two piles of rock and the fuel erupted in a fireball. The cockpit was thrown end-over-end away from the fire, yet Hinton survived with a broken back, leg, and ankle. His survival is attributed {{by one of the}} lead engineers, Pete Law, to additional braces and a roll bar installed on the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|Zorner {{claimed his}} 7th victory on 28/29 June {{southeast}} of Antwerp, Belgium at 02:20. It was recorded as a Halifax bomber. Another Wellington was claimed southwest of Sint-Truiden at 01:09. Zorner achieved his 10th victory west of Malmedy at 01:53. Zorner's 11th victory {{was shot down}} northeast of Groningen at 03:54 on 24/24 July. His victim was Halifax R5573 flown by Flight Sergeant Kenneth Hector Wally McLean from No. 106 Squadron RAF. Zorner saw the Halifax crash and explode {{which resulted in a}} fire-work display of green, red and white flashes. They assumed the aircraft to be a pathfinder, and the flashes exploding flares. Soon afterwards Zorner and his crewman had to abandon the Bf110G-4 because an engine caught fire. Zorner extinguished the fire but he could no longer calibrate the <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> to a glide setting. The other power plant could not cope with the added workload and the Bf110 began to lose height. Zorner ordered his crew to leave. Zorner struggled to exit as his parachute snagged. He managed to clamber back into the cockpit and lower the flaps which slowed the aircraft and afforded him time to unhook the parachute from the strengthening beam in the cockpit and parachute to safety.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the first}} ships {{suffered}} from prototype problems with e.g. the <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> control mechanism {{and returned to}} the shipyard for repairs under warranty, the feedback from the operators was generally positive from the beginning especially regarding the performance of the ships in difficult ice conditions which was deemed superior to earlier ULA class freighters.

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of evidence, Irish and Dutch {{investigators}} could not pinpoint a probable cause for the accident. They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is believed to be a malfunctioning overspeeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing oil feed line regulator valves. [...] The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (gear ratio shifted).

2500|$|The 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe was {{scheduled}} to start on 28 May and each aircraft {{had to make a}} flight at more than [...] over a [...] course in the period 8–14 May to participate. The 28VD arrived at Etampes on 3 May to be flown by Vernhol; it is not known how much flying it had done before that, though it was only completed a fortnight before the competition. The early days of the test period were occupied with the refinement of the 28VD but on the 12–13 May it was reported to have engine problems. During the early tests it was decided to set a finer <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> as the initial setting was producing to much drag on the engine. When the aircraft attempted its qualifying flight on the last allowed day, this change of setting allowed the engine to overspeed. As a result, a rubber joint in the cooling system failed, releasing a cloud of vapour which temporarily blinded the pilot and forced an emergency landing in which the undercarriage collapsed and the aircraft overturned. Vernhol was thrown clear and was not seriously hurt but the 28VD was too damaged {{to take part in the}} contest for which it was built.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Bf 109 E, the Bf 109 F was much {{improved}} aerodynamically. The engine cowling was redesigned to be smoother and more rounded. The enlarged propeller spinner, adapted {{from that of the}} new Messerschmitt Me 210, now blended smoothly into the new engine cowling. Underneath the cowling was a revised, more streamlined oil cooler radiator and fairing. A new ejector exhaust arrangement was incorporated, and on later aircraft a metal shield was fitted over the left hand banks to deflect exhaust fumes away from the supercharger air-intake. The supercharger air-intake was, from the F-1 -series onwards, a rounded, [...] "elbow"-shaped design that protruded further out into the airstream. A new three-blade, light-alloy VDM propeller unit with a reduced diameter of 3m (9ft 8.5in) was used. <b>Propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> was changed electrically, and was regulated by a constant-speed unit, though a manual override was still provided. Thanks to the improved aerodynamics, more fuel-efficient engines and the introduction of light-alloy versions of the standard Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank, the Bf 109 F offered a much increased maximum range of 1,700km (1,060mi) compared to the Bf 109 E's maximum range figure of only 660km (410 miles) on internal fuel, and with the E-7's provision for the 300 litre drop tank, a Bf 109E so equipped possessed double the range, to 1,325km (820mi).|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas placed high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of [...] at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the <b>propeller</b> <b>pitch</b> control mechanism the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings. The hydrodynamic couplings that allowed over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship was operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters was at that time one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the Arktika class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable-pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.|$|E
