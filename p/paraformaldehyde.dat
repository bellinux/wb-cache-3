25|$|Glutaraldehyde and {{formaldehyde}} solutions (also used as fixatives) {{are accepted}} liquid sterilizing agents, {{provided that the}} immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid {{can take up to}} 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to <b>paraformaldehyde,</b> but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid <b>paraformaldehyde.</b> Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{method of}} production to the Woolwich process was found and used in Canada, possibly at the McGill University Department of Chemistry. This was based on reacting <b>paraformaldehyde</b> and ammonium nitrate in acetic anhydride. A UK patent application was made by Robert Walter Schiessler (Pennsylvania State College) and James Hamilton Ross (McGill, Canada) in May 1942; the UK patent was issued in December 1947. Gilman states that the same {{method of production}} had been independently discovered by Ebele in Germany prior to Schiessler and Ross, but {{that this was not}} known by the Allies. Urbański provides details of five methods of production, and he refers to this method as the (German) E-method.|$|E
2500|$|Formaldehyde, {{unlike most}} aldehydes, oligomerizes spontaneously. [...] The trimer is trioxane and the polymer is called <b>paraformaldehyde.</b> [...] Many cyclic {{oligomers}} have been isolated. [...] Similarly, formaldehyde hydrates {{to give the}} geminal diol, which condenses further to form oligomers HO(CH2O)nH. [...] Monomeric CH2O is rarely encountered.|$|E
2500|$|Grignard {{reagents}} {{serve as}} a base for protic substrates (this scheme does not show workup conditions, which typically includes water). [...] Grignard reagents are basic and react with alcohols, phenols, etc. to give alkoxides (ROMgBr). The phenoxide derivative is susceptible to formylation <b>paraformaldehyde</b> to give salicylaldehyde.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} way to {{generate}} the iminium ion from the installed amine is by adding formaldehyde or <b>paraformaldehyde,</b> which undergoes acid-catalyzed condensation to form the iminium. Overman's strychnine synthesis typifies this method. [...] Occasionally, intramolecular carbonyls are used. [...] Other methods for iminium ion formation include using cyanomethyl groups or using oxazolidines as carbonyl precursors.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{involves}} the use of dimethyl phosphite in a one-pot synthesis. [...] Glycine and <b>paraformaldehyde</b> are reacted in a suitable organic solvent (typically triethylamine and methanol) to produce bishydroxymethylglycine, (HOCH2)2NCH2COOH. [...] Dimethyl phosphite is then introduced and work-up with hydrochloric acid cleaves the hydroxymethyl group from the nitrogen atom whilst heating speeds the hydrolysis of both phosphate ester linkages.|$|E
2500|$|Formaldehyde is more {{complicated}} than many simple carbon compounds in that it adopts several different forms. As a gas, formaldehyde is colorless and has a characteristic pungent, irritating odor. [...] Upon condensation, the gas converts to various other forms of formaldehyde (with different chemical formulas) that are of more practical value. One important derivative is the cyclic trimer metaformaldehyde or 1,3,5-trioxane with the formula (CH2O)3. There is also a linear polymer called <b>paraformaldehyde.</b> These compounds have similar chemical properties and are often used interchangeably.|$|E
2500|$|Overman and {{coworkers}} developed methods to synthesize complicated bridged tricyclic structures using the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction. [...] These aza-tricyclic structures {{are found in}} the complex Stemona alkaloid family, as well as in potential drugs such as some immunosuppressants. [...] The example shown is a facile reaction combining a 1-aza-bicycloheptane salt starting material with <b>paraformaldehyde</b> at 80°C to form the pivotal aza-tricyclic structure of the Stemona alkaloid molecules. [...] Saliently, despite unfavorable orbital overlap due to the sterics of this ring system, the reaction proceeds with 94% yield, highlighting the power of this reaction even under unfavorable conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paraformaldehyde</b> (PFA) is the {{smallest}} polyoxymethylene, the polymerization product of formaldehyde with a typical degree of polymerization of 8-100 units. <b>Paraformaldehyde</b> commonly has a slight odor of formaldehyde due to decomposition. <b>Paraformaldehyde</b> is a poly-acetal.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{filling material}} {{was invented in}} the early 1950s by Angelo Sargenti. Filling material has undergone several formulations over the years (N2, N2 Universal, RC-2B, RC-2B White), but all contain <b>paraformaldehyde.</b> The <b>paraformaldehyde,</b> when placed into the root canal, forms formaldehyde, which penetrates and sterilizes the passage. The formaldehyde is then theoretically transformed into harmless water and carbon dioxide. According to some research, {{the outcome of this}} method is better than a root canal performed with gutta-percha. There is, however, a lack of indisputable scientific studies according to the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment.|$|E

50|$|Preparation of {{the sample}} is {{critical}} to maintain cell morphology, tissue architecture and the antigenicity of target epitopes.
