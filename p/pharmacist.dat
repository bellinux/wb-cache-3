40|$|Background Integrating <b>pharmacists</b> into general {{practice}} {{is not a}} novel concept. However, it is new to Australia and evidence supporting this role is limited. Aim To seek the views of <b>pharmacists,</b> general practitioners and consumers on integrating <b>pharmacists</b> into {{general practice}}. Method Questionnaires were used to elicit the opinions of <b>pharmacists,</b> general practitioners and consumers on integrating <b>pharmacists</b> into general practice. Results 1038 participants (829 <b>pharmacists,</b> 167 consumers, 42 general practitioners) completed the survey. Commonly agreed roles for <b>pharmacists</b> in general practice included drug information and medication review. Perceived barriers to service provision included the <b>pharmacist's</b> clinical ability and turf protection. Remuneration {{was viewed as a}} facilitator and a barrier.

40|$|Background: Some Australian <b>pharmacists</b> use {{continuing}} education to maintain knowledge and acquire new information. There {{has been a}} progression from {{continuing education}} to continuing professional development (CPD) - a mandatory requirement for <b>pharmacists</b> in all jurisdictions of Australia. Aim: To identify post-registration learning trends of community <b>pharmacists</b> in Western Australia. Method: A questionnaire was developed and administered by face-to-face interviews with community <b>pharmacists</b> in metropolitan Perth. <b>Pharmacists</b> registered for less than 12 months and <b>pharmacists</b> working in hospitals were excluded. Results: 103 <b>pharmacists</b> were approached with {{a response rate of}} 95 %. Journals (41 %), reference books (23 %) and the Internet (18 %) were the most commonly used educational resources cited by <b>pharmacists.</b> Keeping scientific information up-to-date (39 %) and gathering practical knowledge (22 %) were the leading motivators for <b>pharmacists</b> to participate in continuing education. Factors that hindered participation in continuing education included lack of time (34 %), family commitments (21 %) and business commitments (21 %). 79 % of <b>pharmacists</b> agreed with the concept of mandatory CPD. 47 % of <b>pharmacists</b> suggested that the primary sanction for not complying with mandatory CPD should be counselling to determine reasons for non-compliance. Conclusion: Community <b>pharmacists</b> preferred educational resources that were easily accessible at convenient times. Most <b>pharmacists</b> were able to fulfil the requirements of CPD, however, further educational support and promotion would ensure the successful uptake of CPD by community <b>pharmacists</b> in Western Australia...|$|R

Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors.

Study Design: A cross-sectional survey of community <b>pharmacists</b> in the Western Cape region of South Africa. A face-to-face interview that ascertained experience with requests from patients for STI treatment, current STI treatment practices, and willingness to provide syndromic STI treatment was administered to head <b>pharmacists.</b> Results: Ninety pharmacies were selected and 85 (94 %) of the head <b>pharmacists</b> participated; 55 from an urban area and 30 from a rural area. <b>Pharmacists</b> reported a median of 40 urban clients and 25 rural clients who sought STI treatment from community <b>pharmacists.</b> When provided with a hypothetical clinical situation, 13 % of urban and 17 % of rural <b>pharmacists</b> identified the correct medication for male urethral discharge, 8 % of urban <b>pharmacists</b> and none of the rural <b>pharmacists</b> identified correct treatment for genital ulcers, and none of the <b>pharmacists</b> identified the correct medication for vaginal discharge. Fifty-three percent of <b>pharmacists</b> in urban regions and 47 % of <b>pharmacists</b> in rural regions expressed willingness to provide syndromic STI treatment. Independent predictors of willingness to provide syndromic treatment were knowledge of the link between HIV transmission and STIs (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 13. 78; 95 % CI: 2. 69, 70. 66), past experience prescribing syndromic STI treatment (OR: 11. 1; 95 % CI: 1. 14, 108. 6), and male gender (OR: 4. 38; 95 % CI: 1. 15, 16. 7). Conclusions: <b>Pharmacists</b> are frequently called upon to provide STI treatment but have limited knowledge of correct treatment recommendations.

Objectives To explore the role and challenges facing the clinical <b>pharmacists</b> of Sudan. Settings Two of the main government hospitals in Sudan and an online survey. Method This study applied a two phase mixed method, a focus group discussion and a survey. A FGD was conducted with the clinical <b>pharmacists</b> in two of the main government hospitals in Sudan. This was followed by an on-line survey among the clinical <b>pharmacists</b> of Sudan. Main outcome measure The role of the clinical <b>pharmacists</b> of Sudan and the challenges facing clinical pharmacy practice. Results Four <b>pharmacists</b> participated in the focus group and 51 out of 140 <b>pharmacists</b> (34 %) completed the on-line survey. The roles that were perceived by the majority of <b>pharmacists</b> as part of their duties in hospitals in Sudan were identifying drug-related problems (100 %, n = 51), providing drug-related information to healthcare professionals by (96 %, n = 47), and educating patients about their medicines (96 %, n = 48). The <b>pharmacists</b> identified a number of obstacles that hindered their progress in practice. These obstacles were related to the <b>pharmacists</b> themselves, the lack of senior clinical <b>pharmacists</b> for leadership, the environment they were working in and the training they had received in clinical pharmacy. Conclusion The new clinical <b>pharmacists</b> in Sudan faced several challenges that need to be overcome in order to move forward in their clinical practice.

Setting Random sample of RPSGB registered Scottish <b>pharmacists.</b> A postal questionnaire of pharmacists' CPD activity, views and attitudes was developed, piloted {{and sent to}} 2420 <b>pharmacists.</b> Questions were collated to produce total scores and to rate pharmacists' motivation and attitudes to CPD separately. The number of CPD hours reported by sector and gender were compared ('t' test) and differences identified between hospital, community and primary care in relation to mean motivational attitudinal scores (Mann-Whitney test). Five hundred and forty three <b>pharmacists</b> completed the questionnaire (22. 4 % response rate). In this study 9. 8 % of the <b>pharmacists</b> reported spending no time on CPD. Comparisons of hours showed primary care <b>pharmacists</b> and hospital <b>pharmacists</b> reported similar times spent on CPD and significantly more time than community <b>pharmacists</b> (68 h and 66 h vs 45 h; P < 0. 05). No {{statistically significant differences between}} genders were revealed. Internal reliability on motivation and attitude scores ranged from 0. 74 - 0. 83 (Cronbach's alpha). Although scores were similar across sectors of practice in terms of motivation and attitudinal questions, statistical differences were consistent; showing higher scores for separate motivation and attitude among <b>pharmacists</b> in primary care than in hospital or community practice sectors (Mann Whitney test; P < 0. 001).
