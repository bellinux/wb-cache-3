40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} {{to support the}} monitoring of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>conditions</b> using biologi-cal signals such as electrocardiograms, arterial pressure values and pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveforms. In this ap-proach, a second-order log-linearized model (referred to here as a log-linearized peripheral arterial viscoelastic model) is {{used to describe the}} non-linear viscoelastic relationship between blood pressure waveforms and photo-plethysmographic waveforms. The proposed index enables estimation of peripheral arterial wall stiffness changes induced by sympathetic nerve activity. The validity of the method is discussed here {{based on the results of}} peripheral vascular condition monitoring conducted during endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS). The results of ETS monitoring showed significant changes in stiffness variations between the periods before and during the procedures observed (p < 0. 01) as well as during and after them (p < 0. 01), so that it was confirmed that sympathetic nerve activity is drastically decreased in the area around the monitoring site after the thoracic sympathetic nerve trunk on the monitoring side is successfully blocked. In addition, no change was observed in the values of the proposed index during the ETS procedure on the side opposite that of the monitoring site. The experimental results obtained clearly show the proposed method can be used to assess changes in sympathetic nerve activity during ETS. I...|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{discrepancy}} between invasive (IBP) and noninvasive (NIBP) blood pressure, we studied the appropriateness of various methods and compared them. All data were collected in simulation studies and from routine clinical work. For IBP monitoring, pressure transducers (DTX or P 50, Spectramed, USA) were used. NIBP was monitored in three ways; BP- 308 (Colin, Japan) and Dynamap 8100 (Criticon, USA) for the oscillometric method, CBM- 2000 (Colin, Japan) for the tonometric method and Finapres (Ohmeda, USA) for the zero transmural pressure method. IBP: In our estimation, small invisible air bubbles in the catheter make for a sharp, not dull pressure wave. This phenomenon is explained using frequency response curves. There {{was more than a}} 10 mmHg difference in systolic pressures (aortic valve to bifurcation) and much greater difference in distal pressures. With a vasodilating condition, the situation is more complex and it is not so easy to get a true IBP. NIBP: Oscillometric pressure is little affected by <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>conditions</b> and reflects the central pressure well, however, it is not a continuous pressure monitor. Continuous tonometry pressure was useful only when calibrated with oscillometric pressure. Zero transmural pressure is also an easy continuous method and reveals distal arterial conditions well, but is affected by finger cuff fitness. In conclusion, there is no reliable method, neither IBP nor NIBP for continuous blood pressure monitoring. However, we recommend the use of one of the continuous methods together with intermittent oscillometric pressure...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of serious angiographic {{coronary artery disease}} ranges from 37 % to 78 % in patients undergoing operation for <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> disease. Clinical {{studies have demonstrated that}} cardiac outcome after <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> surgery is not adequately predicted by the standard criteria of history, physical findings and rest electrocardiogram. An adequate exercise work load, left ventricular function and thallium redistribution have proved important in perioperative risk stratification. The choice of a perioperative functional cardiac test depends on patientrelated factors {{and the nature of the}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> operation. Although procedures involving aortic cross-clamping exert a greater hemodynamic stress than do carotid endarterectomy and femoral popliteal surgery, late cardiac morbidity and mortality are significant in all patients with atherosclerotic disease. The decision to proceed with preoperative coronary angiography and myocardial revascularization should be based primarily on indications independent of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> procedure. However, <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> surgery may influence the timing of myocardial revascularization. Patients with high risk or unstable coronary artery disease may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization, although this hypothesis remains unproved. In all patients, careful monitoring during and after operation is essential.

40|$|Objectives. In-hospital <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> {{complications}} of balloon angioplasty {{were compared with}} those of directional atherectomy in the Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial (CAVEAT-I) to identify patients at risk and evaluate costs and outcomes. Background. The incidence, costs and outcomes of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications after coronary intervention have not been fully characterized as a function of randomly assigned therapy. Methods. At 35 sites in the United States and Europe, 1, 012 patients were randomized. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications were defined as the composite of pulse loss, pseudoaneurysm, hematoma > 4 cm in diameter or groin hemorrhage necessitating blood transfusion. Logistic models were derived to 1) predict these complications from baseline and procedural characteristics, 2) test the relevance of randomization assignment, and 3) assess their impact on hospital costs and long-term outcomes. Results. Sixty-seven patients (6. 6 %) developed <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications, of whom 15 (22. 4 %) required a blood transfusion, 14 (20. 9 %) underwent vascular surgery, and 2 (3. 0 %) died. Both in-hospital deaths occurred in patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications. There was no difference in composite <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complication rates among patients randomized to angioplasty or atherectomy. Greater age, female gender, postprocedural heparin and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation were predictive of increased risk. In a representative 60 % subset, mean hospital costs increased from $ 9, 583 in patients without to $ 18, 350 in those with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications (p = 0. 0001). The unadjusted mortality rate at 1 year was 7. 5 % for patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complications compared with 1. 1 % for all others (p = 0. 0001). These complications identified patients at greater risk of death, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization at 30 days and 1 year. The atherectomy group had a trend toward more frequent deaths and myocardial infarction. Conclusions. Directional atherectomy and balloon angioplasty had similar in-hospital <b>peripheral</b> <b>vascular</b> complication rates. Female gender, greater age, postprocedural heparin and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation were predictive of higher risk. The twofold increase in cost and sevenfold increase in long-term deaths highlight the need to prevent these periprocedural events and monitor patients closely...|$|R
