40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{being tested}} {{has been that}} Rene Girard's theory of mimetic desire and scapegoating is a highly appropriate schema for understanding the dynamics of violence in deep-rooted conflict between identity groups. Chapter one explores a number of approaches to deep-rooted conflict. A variety of approaches to human identity needs are presented in order to flesh out the basic notion of identity-based conflict {{as a function of}} a threat to needs satisfiers. Other theoretical approaches are synthesized. Despite the heuristic potential of these different approaches, they do not adequately describe the dynamics by which these conflict are generated and violence is introduced. Chapter two presents Rene Girard's definitions of mimetic phenomena and many examples of mimetic desire, mimetic rivalry and mimetic doubling as Girard develops them within the domains of literature, anthropology and psychology. These examples draw out the inner dynamics of each type of violence. Chapter three is about the phenomenon of scapegoating, examining the classical structure of scapegoating with the stereotypic patterns Girard has synthesized. Examples are used to develop the characteristics of scapegoats and those who scapegoat. An interpretative narrative of the Oka/Kanehsata: ke crisis is presented chapter four as a test case for the usefulness of the new hermeneutic. This <b>presentation</b> <b>recognizes</b> the existence of a pre-contact aboriginal settlement of Kaneshsata: ke and traces the development of Oka and historical relationships between Mohawks and Eurocanadians from the arrival of the Sulpicians in the 1720 s until the crisis. Beginning with the decision in 1989 to expand an existing golf course, events leading up to and during the crisis are described in detail. Of critical importance is the raid on the Pines on July 11, 1990, the event that sparked the crisis itself. Chapter five presents an interpretation of the crisis in terms of mimetic structures of violence. A large number of mimetic rivalries are presented along with examples of scapegoating. The power of mimetic structures of violence becomes particularly apparent as one enters into a very real deep-rooted conflict, raising two theological problems as the basis for a theological reflection in chapter six. First, how are these structures to be stood theologically [...] -is it possible to develop an interface between this discourse and the discourse of theology? The second has to do with deliverance from these structures to something else. Regarding the first, insights of a number of theologians help to make the connections between mimetic structures of violence and discourse around victimization, sin, and Satan. The second issue introduces the concept of reconciliation. The reconciliation of deep-rooted conflicts is presented as the process of moving from mimetic structures of violence to mimetic structures of blessing. The conceptualisation of what might be entailed in reconciliation, from a theological perspective, is rooted in Christology. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

Oral presentations have far more advantages than simply promoting English proficiency.

Because there are extensive collateral networks and potential complications that develop, {{a thorough investigation}} of the intracranial and extracranial circulation is necessary to exclude a treatable cause when these patients present with SAH.

Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular condition charac-terized by narrowing or occlusion of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and proximal middle and anterior ce-rebral arteries. Subsequent development of extensive collat-eral vessels defines the disease.

Here we show how to extend the results to more general groups that we call Garside groups. Define a Gaussian monoid to be a finitely generated cancellative monoid where the expressions of a given element have bounded lengths, and where left and right lower common multiples exist. A Garside monoid is a Gaussian monoid in which the left and right l. c. m. ’s satisfy an additional symmetry condition. A Gaussian group and a Garside group are respectively the group of fractions of a Gaussian monoid and of a Garside monoid. Braid groups and, more generally, finite Coxeter type Artin groups are Garside groups. We determine algorith-mic criterions in terms of <b>presentations</b> for <b>recognizing</b> Gaussian and Garside monoids and groups, and exhibit infinite families of such groups. We describe simple algorithms that solve the word problem in a Gaussian group, show that theses algorithms have a quadratic complexity if the group is a Garside group, and prove that Garside groups have quadratic isoperimetric inequalities. We construct normal forms for Gaussian groups, and prove that, {{in the case of a}} Garside group, the language of normal forms is regular, symmetric, and geodesic, has the 5 -fellow traveller property, and has the uniqueness property. This shows in particular that Garside groups are geodesically fully biautomatic.

Polyanhydride nanoparticles are promising vaccine platforms that have the potential to be used as controlled drug delivery devices as well as potent and effective immune adjuvants for the design of single dose vaccines. CLRs offer unique advantages for tailoring immune responses. Engagement of CLRs regulates antigen presenting cell activation and promotes delivery of antigens to specific intracellular compartments inside antigen presenting cells for efficient processing and <b>presentation.</b> CLRs <b>recognize</b> conserved carbohydrate structures on the surface of diverse microorganisms, by attaching this carbohydrates to the surface of polyanhydride nanoparticles, the recognition of these nanoparticles and danger signals triggered on antigen presenting cells is similar to the one induced by microorganisms. This strategy could be useful for the rational design of vaccines. In fact, the design of intranasal vaccines is the particular interest of this dissertation, accordingly, the target and engagement of CLRs were studied on alveolar macrophages harvested from mice. The results presented on this work include the development of an efficient high throughput method of synthesis and functionalization of polyanydride nanoparticles; maintaining the morphology of the nanoparticles and a constant concentration of carbohydrates on the surface. In addition, in vitro studies indicate that the co-culture of functionalized nanoparticles with alveolar macrophages significantly increased cell surface expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, enhancing alveolar macrophage activation. This phenotype was found to be dependent upon nanoparticle internalization. In conclusion, this study indicate that the strategy of targeting and engaging CLRs is a viable strategy for enhancing the intrinsic adjuvant properties of nanovaccine adjuvants and promoting robust pulmonary immunity...|$|R
