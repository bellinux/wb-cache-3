This makes it costly to transport from production sites to areas where it could be effectively utilized for value-added applications such as in soil fertilization. Densification is one possible way to enhance the storage and transportation of the compost. This study therefore investigates the effect of pressure (20 - 110 MPa) and <b>pressure</b> <b>application</b> <b>time</b> (5 - 120 s) on the compaction characteristics of compost derived from swine solid fraction. Two different types of material have been used: composted swine solid fraction derived from mechanical separation and compost obtained by mixing the first material with wood chips. Results obtained showed that both the pressure applied and the <b>pressure</b> <b>application</b> <b>time</b> significantly affect {{the density of the}} compacted samples; while the specific compression energy is significantly affected only by the pressure. Best predictor equations were developed to predict compact density and the specific compression energy required by the densification process.

40|$|The {{excessive}} {{amount of}} pig slurry spread on soil {{has contributed to}} nitrate water pollution both in surface and in ground waters, especially in areas classified as vulnerable zones to nitrate in accordance with European Regulation (91 / 676 /CEE). Several techniques {{have been developed to}} manage livestock slurries as cheaply and conveniently as possible and to reduce potential risks of environmental pollution. Among these techniques, solid-liquid separation of slurry is a common practice in Italy. The liquid fraction can be used for irrigation and the solid fraction, after aerobic stabilization, produces an organic compost rich in humic substances. However, compost derived from swine solid fraction is a low density material (bulk density less than 500 kgm– 3). This makes it costly to transport composted swine solid fraction from production sites to areas where it could be effectively utilized for value-added applications such as in soil fertilization. Densification is one possible way to enhance the storage and transportation of the compost.

40|$|Objective: The authors {{aimed to}} develop a {{mechanical}} model for delivering controlled impact injuries to an articular cartilage surface, {{with the ability to}} control peak contact pressure while maintaining a constant rate of loading across all impact levels. Methods: A pendulum-style impactor with a direct contact interface was fabricated, based on previously published successful models. This impactor was tested in 2 separate experiments: first with a single analog specimen and next with 15 cadaveric rabbit knee specimens. In both experiments, impacts were performed at 3 pressure levels with multiple repetitions. Peak pressure, rate of <b>pressure</b> <b>application,</b> impulse, and <b>time</b> to peak were evaluated. Results: There was a significant difference between each of the pressure level groups for both the analog and cadaveric experiments. There {{was no significant difference between}} the rates of <b>pressure</b> <b>application</b> for the analog specimen and a statistically significant difference only between the highest and lowest pressure level groups for the cadaveric specimen. Conclusions: Previous studies have shown that peak pres-sure and rate of <b>pressure</b> <b>application</b> are both significant contributors to cartilage injury. Previous models have controlled only peak contact pressure, allowing rate of loading to change as a function of peak contact pressure. This model is the first to control both variables, with a rate of <b>pressure</b> <b>application</b> that is typical of an athletic or traumatic injury in humans. Use of this model will enable researchers to investigate the isolated effects of peak pressure on progressive cartilage injuries. Keyword...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A better {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties of prepreg in the uncured state is required to establish process models for automated layup of thermoset prepregs. Such models would enable control of the bulk factor and defects, such as fibre waviness and voidage, during layup. <b>Pressure</b> <b>application</b> <b>time</b> and temperature during automated layup are typically low while the through-thickness strains can be high due to a reduction of gaps between the plies. A visco-elastic analysis for the through-thickness compression response of a toughened carbon/epoxy prepreg is compared against an elastic–plastic material behaviour with respect to automated layup for three representative temperatures. It is shown that a simple plastic material law with strain hardening can be used to accurately model the material response during automated layup of toughened epoxy prepreg.

This is the so-called hemihidrotic phenomenon which was first described by Kuno. The purpose of the study was to reconfirm the hemihidrotic phenomenon by the <b>application</b> of skin <b>pressure</b> with a special newly designed apparatus. Local heat load or general heat load was applied to induce thermal sweating, detected by capacitance hygrometer-sweat capture capsule method on both sides of the forehead and chest in an environmental control chamber.
