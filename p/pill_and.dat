5|$|Čabrinović {{swallowed}} his cyanide <b>pill</b> <b>and</b> {{jumped into}} the Miljacka river. Čabrinović's suicide attempt failed, as the cyanide only induced vomiting, and the Miljacka was only 13cm deep due to the hot, dry summer. Police dragged Čabrinović out of the river, and he was severely beaten by the crowd before being taken into custody.|$|E
5|$|It is {{expected}} that reopening the station will result in reduced car usage to and from <b>Pill</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding villages. Most station users will walk to the station, with the next largest share being car drivers and car passengers being dropped off, followed by cyclists and bus users. Some parking restrictions are proposed to prevent rail users parking on the local streets, which are narrow and not suitable for widening.|$|E
5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive <b>pill</b> <b>and</b> in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E

The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} parthenogenesis occurring, which would have killed those who had taken the <b>pill,</b> <b>and</b> {{the remainder of the}} young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts.

5|$|The Portishead line again saw {{a rise in}} {{use during}} the Second World War, as Bristolians {{evacuated}} to the more rural areas of <b>Pill</b> <b>and</b> Portishead commuted in to work, many alighting at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains {{by members of the}} Women's Land Army.

5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide <b>pill</b> <b>and</b> collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive <b>pill</b> <b>and</b> the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E

25|$|The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is a {{conceptual}} framework first formulated in 1986 by Ron Lesthaeghe and Dirk van de Kaa in a short article that {{was published in the}} Dutch sociology journal Mens en Maatschappij. SDT addressed the changes in the patterns of sexual and reproductive behavior which occurred in North America and Western Europe in the period from about 1963, when the birth control <b>pill</b> <b>and</b> other cheap effective contraceptive methods such as the IUD were adopted by the general population, to the present. Combined with the sexual revolution and the increased role of women in society and the workforce the resulting changes have profoundly affected the demographics of industrialized countries resulting in a sub-replacement fertility level.|$|E
