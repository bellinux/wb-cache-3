However unlike the one spin case, the magnitude of the <b>precession</b> <b>velocity</b> of Ω_ 0 varies significantly due to the variation of the sum the spin angular momenta of the two stars, S, which can lead to significant secular variabilities in binary pulsars.

40|$|General {{relativistic}} spin-orbit interaction {{leads to}} the quasiresonant oscillation of the gyroscope mass center along the orbital normal. The beating amplitude {{does not include the}} speed of light and equals the ratio of the intrinsic momentum of the gyroscope to its orbital momentum. The modulation frequency equals the angular velocity of the geodetic precession that prevents the oscillation from resonance. The oscillation represents the precession of the gyroscope orbital momentum. Within an acceptable time the oscillation amplitude reaches the values that are amenable to being analyzed experimentally. Taking into account the source oblateness decreases the beating amplitude and increases the modulation frequency by the factor that is equal to the ratio of the quadrupole <b>precession</b> <b>velocity</b> to the geodetic <b>precession</b> <b>velocity.</b> The period of the quadrupole precession {{turns out to be a}} quite sufficient time to form a measurable amplitude of the oscillation.

40|$|We have {{considered}} precession in accretion disks {{in which a}} second moment of inertia relative to an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation may be very important. This formalism, {{that takes into account}} the precession contribution to the angular momentum, is based on the existence of a parameter p which determines three characteristic densities resulting from the averaging process and imposes constraints on the actual disk density. It is shown that the <b>precession</b> <b>velocity</b> will lie in a three branch solution, and depends on how large is the disk actual density as compared to the characteristic densities. Besides the large spread on the solution for the <b>precession</b> <b>velocity,</b> depending on the density strength, it may be prograde and retrograde. It is shown that the keplerian thin disk, with very large density values compared to characteristic ones, only precesses very far away from the primary object, which implies very large precession periods. For other models, the disk will thicken, with large deviations from the keplerian approximation. Constraints on the density only will be effective for very large values of the ratio ˙ M, respectively, accretion rate and mass of the primary. Un-Mp der this condition, the structure of the precessing region is found. Lower bounds on the precession period are found for not so large values of this ratio. Deviations from the mean precessional motion are considered. It is shown that these deviations result in periodic motions as long as the time scales associated to them are comparable to the remaining time scales. Otherwise, they result in misalignment motions, forcing the plane of the disk to become normal to the orbital plane of the secondary. 1...|$|E

40|$|Regarding the large-size {{space debris}} objects with a {{cross-section}} more than 5 m 2 situated at LEO, {{it is possible}} to mark out 5 non-structured groups of such objects according to their spatial distribution. The orbits of objects in a group have approximately the same inclinations whereas the deviations in the Right Ascension of the Ascending node (RAAN) may be arbitrary. The features of changing orbital planes’ mutual orientation in a group are seen from the RAAN deviations’ evolution portrait. The flights between the objects are being executed by a single active space vehicle (SV) which captures a LSSD object and takes it away to the especially calculated circular or elliptical low disposal orbit (DO), and then returns back for the next object. The calculation of flyby maneuvers, in fact, breaks up into two independent tasks. At first, one can determine the parameters of the DO for each LSSD object using special software, so the coplanar maneuvers can be calculated ensuring the object’s transition to this orbit. Secondly, the flight to attain a new object is carried out from the DO of the previous object at the moment when their orbital planes will become equal. So {{it is possible to}} calculate the maneuvers, which help to return back for the next object, using numerical-analytical algorithm developed for noncoplanar rendez-vous of middle duration. The time interval for an active SV to stay at the DO is defined by difference of <b>precession</b> <b>velocities</b> of orbital planes of the de-orbited object and of the next object. The usage of a circular DO allows an LSSD object to leave promptly from the region (over 700 km) where active SVs and other debris exist for a long time, whereas the apogee of the elliptical DO remains in the mentioned belt for 10 years. While forming elliptical DO one will need approximately 30 % less of required summary characteristic velocity as compared with circular DO. The collision risk for an object staying at the elliptical DO during these ten years would constitute a half of the collision risk, which takes place if no removal operations were carried out. The paper is enriched by the examples of flyby maneuvers calculation for the first three LSSD groups using the described removal scheme. </p...|$|R

However, within the scope of Lorentz violating theories it can have a role since it is breaking Lorentz symmetry in a very mild way.

In order to generate such terms systematically we start with a formulation for a spinning particle in VSR. It is then coupled minimally to the electromagnetic field and a gyromagnetic factor is added to give rise to a magnetic moment.

This includes FRW universes which are arbitrarily close to the Milne Universe, which is empty, and to the de Sitter universe. Hence the postulate formulated by E. Mach about the physical cause for the time-evolution of the axis directions of inertial frames is shown to hold in cosmological General Relativity for linear perturbations. The time-evolution of axis directions of local inertial frames (relative to given local fiducial axes) is given experimentally by the <b>precession</b> angular <b>velocity</b> of gyroscopes, {{which in turn is}} given by the operational definition of the gravitomagnetic field. The gravitomagnetic field is caused by cosmological energy currents via the momentum constraint. This equation for cosmological gravitomagnetism is analogous to Ampere's law, but it holds also for time-dependent situtations. In the solution for an open universe the 1 /r^ 2 -force of Ampere is replaced by a Yukawa force which is of identical form for FRW backgrounds with $K = (- 1, 0). $ The scale of the exponential cutoff is the H-dot radius, where H is the Hubble rate, and dot is the derivative with respect to cosmic time.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{properties}} of a precessing rotor or a coupled system of precessing rotors (gyroscopes), where a special chaotic behavior in the precession angle can be found if the change of rotor angular velocity is linearly coupled by (an) holonomy to the <b>precession</b> angular <b>velocity</b> and angle. The linear coupling provides for rolling cone paths and allows spinning up and controlling the rotor simply by forcing precession at special quantum magic precession angles. The geometric phase induced by the curved path of the rotor or external curvature {{and part of the}} coupling increases with precession angle. This leads to bifurcations in coupling strength resulting in chaotic precession. As an alternative to the SO(3) matrix or quaternion representation the treatment of the three coupled rotations is here based on Euler’s dynamical equations. First, the classical Magic Angle Precession (MAP) dynamics is realized by a geometric or mechanical condition (type I, transcendental solutions), where it can be experimentally demonstrated how MAP can “slave” angular degrees of freedom allowing the external control of high-frequent spin by slow oscillations. MAP is found in a commercial fitness device and is conceptually approached via Chua’s electric circuit. Second, the quantum-gravitational MAP (type II, rational solutions) with discrete precession angles is analyzed on a deeper level requiring intrinsic curvature/relativistic effects adjusting holonomy to quantum numbers. Third, a macroscopic network of MAP elements is presented as a discretetime recurrent neural network synchronizing to one common MAP I/II dynamics under special pairing and symmetry conditions (type III). In all three cases MAP can be treated as a time-discrete chaotic system with singularities given by the cosine map with several possible links to interesting applications on all scales...|$|R

The energy distribution of the electrons is indirectly measured by a hard X-ray detector (CdTe) with the pulse height analysis (PHA). When the counts of the energetic electrons with 35 - 70 keV increase to a higher level, the mode can be observed obviously.

The particles experience simultaneously a magnetic torque that drives their individual spinning motion, a magnetic attraction {{toward the center of}} the domain and flow-induced interactions.

After a short transient, an aggregate of particles is formed that then rotates with a <b>precession</b> <b>velocity</b> related to the inter-particle distance. This dynamic self-assembly is stable (but not stationary) and the morphology depends on the number of particles. The numerical simulation is based on the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Lagrangian tracking of each individual particle. Multi-body interactions (at low but finite Reynolds number) are achieved by a local forcing of the momentum equations of the fluid flow.

40|$|The general {{relativistic}} precession rate of periastra in close-in exoplanets can be {{orders of}} magnitude larger than {{the magnitude of the}} same effect for Mercury. The realization that some of the close-in exoplanets have significant eccentricities raises the possibility that this precession might be detectable. We explore in this work the observability of the periastra <b>precession</b> using radial <b>velocity</b> and transit light curve observations. Our analysis is independent of the source of precession, which can also have significant contributions due to additional planets and tidal deformations. We find that precession of the periastra of the magnitude expected from general relativity can be detectable in timescales of � 10 years with current observational capabilities by measuring the change in the primary transit duration or in the time difference between primary and secondary transits. Radial velocity curves alone would be able to detect this precession for super-massive, close-in exoplanets orbiting inactive stars if they have ∼ 100 datapoints at each of two epochs separated by ∼ 20 years. We show that the contribution to the precession by tidal deformations may dominate the total precession in cases where the relativistic precession is detectable. Studies of transit durations with Kepler might need to take into account effects arising from the general relativistic and tidal induced precession of periastra for systems containing close-in, eccentric exoplanets. Such studies may be able to detect additional planets with masses comparable to that of Earth by detecting secular variations in the transit duration induced by the changing longitude of periastron.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of individual kilometer-size planetesimals in circumstellar orbits of a tight binary system. We include both the gravitational perturbations of the secondary star and a non-linear gas drag stemming from an eccentric gas disk with a finite precession rate. We consider several precession rates and eccentricities for the gas, and compare the results with a static disk in circular orbit. The disk precession introduces three main differences {{with respect to the}} classical static case: (i) The equilibrium secular solutions generated by the gas drag are no longer fixed points in the averaged system, but limit cycles with frequency equal to the precession rate of the gas. The amplitude of the cycle is inversely dependent on the body size, reaching negligible values for ∼ 50 km size planetesimals. (ii) The maximum final eccentricity attainable by small bodies is restricted to the interval between the gas eccentricity and the forced eccentricity, and apsidal alignment is no longer guaranteed for planetesimals strongly coupled with the gas. (iii) The characteristic timescales of orbital decay and secular evolution decrease significantly with increasing precession rates, with values up to two orders of magnitude smaller than for static disks. Finally, we apply this analysis to the γ-Cephei system and estimate impact velocities for different size bodies and values of the gas eccentricity. For high disk eccentricities, we find that the disk <b>precession</b> decreases the <b>velocity</b> dispersion between different size planetesimals, thus contributing to accretional collisions in the outer parts of the disk. The opposite occurs for almost circular gas disks, where precession generates an increase in the relative velocities. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures. Accepted in MNRA...|$|R
