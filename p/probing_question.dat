50|$|The long {{reign of}} Queen Victoria ended at the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century but the morality of her times lingered well beyond the 1930s and dictated that acting out homosexual passions would have destructive consequences. The fate of Oscar Wilde provided a rebarbative lesson to those brave enough to test the boundaries of socially acceptable sexual behaviour and even a poet with the most adamantine reputation, such as W. H. Auden, would not risk coming out of the closet in fear of reprisals. By creating a poetic persona as his public face Stewart could avoid suspicion, though not the fear of knowing that just one <b>probing</b> <b>question</b> could surgically pierce the protective epidermis created by duplicity and expose the rawness of his double life. For many of his friends he was a struggling poet, much like the persona he would invent for Ern Malley in the following decade, but for others he assumed a more furtive role. The avuncular poetic persona he invented for his university friends was not his first mask, nor would it be his last, but just another in a long charade of false identities.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>probe</b> <b>questions</b> for {{measuring}} situation awareness is often regarded as being intrusive on operator performance and workload (Pierce, 2012). Moreover, the <b>probe</b> <b>questions</b> themselves {{may change the}} operator's situation awareness. However, the intrusive effects of <b>probe</b> <b>questions</b> can be diminished through optimized presentation and collection of responses (Bacon & Strybel, 2013). The present study analyzed data from a large sample of 54 student controllers to determine whether an optimized presentation method for administering Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM) <b>probe</b> <b>questions</b> negatively impacted the students’ workload or performance.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the value that respondents place on physical activity rather than consume a hypothetical medical tablet by employing Contingent Valuation (CV) and Contingent Behaviour (CB) methods. Results from this study provide constructive insight into the use value and motivations for participating in physical activity rather than avail of a substitute. Methods The data for the study was generated by means of a self administered questionnaire completed by (n= 415) respondents in Northern Ireland (NI) from January 2010 to February 2011. We combine actual minutes of physical activity with estimated minutes of physical activity and portray a hypothetical scenario should a medical tablet be available would respondents consume the tablet or do the physical activity. This medical tablet offers the same health benefits of meeting the recommended guidelines of 30 min of physical activity 5 times per week with no side effects. The authors' hypothesise that the time starved population would favour consumption of a medical tablet rather than the allocation of valuable time to engage in physical activity. Physical activity levels are self reported and to ensure certainty of responses a <b>probing</b> <b>question</b> is included to mitigate against biases. Results Preliminary results reveal respondents' prefer to engage in physical activity opposed to the consumption of a medical tablet. The addition of the <b>probing</b> <b>question</b> indicated that respondents prefer to do physical activity for their physical and mental health {{in addition to}} a leisure activity aiding relaxation.

It concerns their theology, their well being and a number of other areas. In many cases the church has abdicated its responsibility to instruct and give guidance to church members and not provided adequate leading in the sphere of personal financial management. Diverse views on money are propagated through various media by both the secular world and the church alike. This Practical Theological study concerns the ethos of church members with regards to their personal financial management.

" That is, Trausti returns to Iceland from training in Norway as a priest to {{assume the role of}} head of his family, which is embroiled in a conflict with another clan over a dead whale; his adversary in the dispute is Isold, daughter of Erikur and unmarried mother pledged to the son of the bishop of Iceland. The priority of conflicting claims – the pagan heroic code of vengeance, familial obligation, and fate versus Christian mercy, obligation to God, and individual will – is traced against a backdrop of claims of national identity versus the monolithic blurring of boundaries demanded by the dominance of the Church. All of the issues, conventionally debated in the Middle Ages within the genre of the saga {{on the one hand and}} the romance on the other, are complicated in the film by the romance's courtly-love context of attraction of mortal enemies Isold and Trausti.

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Small Island States {{to climate change}} and environmental degradation such as “depletion of fresh water supplies, flooding, disease and loss of traditional food sources, livelihood and housing” has drawn not only international attention but also forced migration or illegal/irregular migration, displacement and settlement (relocation). The <b>probing</b> <b>question</b> for the Pacific Region then is, can such circumstances and dilemmas neatly fit with the internationally agreed definition of a ‘refugee’ under international refugee instruments? An immediate response on humanitarian grounds would probably reveal ‘yes' and thus introduce category's as 'climate refugees’ or 'economic refugees’ but in-depth content/text analysis has rejected this As a mandatory requirement, the constituent elements : •	 outside the country of nationality or habitual residence; •	 well founded fear; •	 persecution; •	 Convention grounds (race, religion, nationality [...] .); and •	 availability of State protection; as stipulated in Article 1 A(2) of the 1951 Refugee Convention need to be satisfied. All signatory States “have an international obligation not to force refugees to return or not to 'refoule' to their home countries where they would face persecution {{on one of the}} five Convention grounds (the non-refoulement principle) ” For small island states in particular, climate change and environmental degradation triggers forced migration. The primary question is whether forced migration sits comfortably with seeking refugee status? Do state's immigration control, foreign policy and decision making process by immigration officials ‘realize’ the non-refoulement principle? What issues, challenges and complications will small island state’s face when “attempting to comply with their international obligations (refugee and human rights) and balancing their own national interests in allowing entry to their territory”.

40|$|AbstractSituation Awareness (SA) {{refers to}} an individual's {{understanding}} {{of what is happening}} in their environment, and what is likely to happen in the near future [1]. SA is an important construct to study in aviation because lower levels of SA are associated with increased aviation accidents and mishaps [2]. One technique to measure operator SA is through the use of online <b>probe</b> <b>questions,</b> where operators are queried about their task environment at various intervals while performing the task. The current study used the Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM) [3] for administering online probes. With SPAM, a ready prompt appears on a panel and participants are instructed to accept the prompt when workload permits to be presented with a SA <b>probe</b> <b>question.</b> Latencies in accepting the ready prompt are indicative of the operator's workload level at that time. When ready prompts go unanswered, (ready time-outs; RTO), it is assumed workload is too high. When a prompt is accepted, <b>probe</b> <b>questions</b> are presented for a limited time (60 seconds in this study). Thus it is possible they too will go unanswered by timing out (question time-out; QTO). QTOs can occur for the following reasons: 1) operator did not know the answer, 2) due to the dynamic changes in the task, the operator workload became too high to devote resources to answering the question, 3) question was unanswerable due to the current context, or 4) question required more time to answer than allowed. In the present study, we analyzed a subset of the data from a larger study (see Brandt et al. [4]) to examine reasons for why <b>probe</b> <b>questions</b> go unanswered. For QTOs, the majority of questions went unanswered because the operator {{did not know how to}} answer the question, or because the operator was dealing with high workload. RTOs, which occurred more frequently, were normally due to task/workload...|$|R
