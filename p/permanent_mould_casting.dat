40|$|The microstructures {{and crystal}} growth {{directions}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>casting</b> and directionally solidified Al-Mg alloys with different Mg contents have been investigated. The {{results indicate that}} the effect of Mg content on microstructure is basically same for the alloys prepared by these two methods. The primary grains change from cellular crystals to developed columnar dendrites, and then to equiaxed dendrites as the Mg content is increased. Simultaneously, both the cellular or columnar grain region and the primary trunk spacing decrease. All of these changes are mainly attributed to the constitutional supercooling resulting from Mg element. Comparatively, the cellular or columnar crystals of the directionally solidified alloys are straighter and more parallel than those of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>casting</b> alloys. These have straight or wavy grain boundaries, {{one of the most important}} microstructure characteristics of feathery grains.

This paper reports the results of a study of the effect of zinc on eutectic morphology in <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>cast</b> hypoeutectic magnesium-aluminium alloys, including the commercial alloy AZ 91. The results show that the strength of this effect varies with aluminium content and cooling rate. The addition of 1. 6 wt% Zn to a Mg- 9 Al alloy cooled at approximately 80 Ws was sufficient to cause a fully divorced eutectic to form when a partially divorced eutectic formed in the binary alloy solidified at the same rate. An addition of 1. 6 wt% Zn to a Mg- 15 Al alloy cooled at approximately 20 K/s was sufficient to cause a partially divorced eutectic to form when a granular eutectic was observed in the binary alloy solidified at the same cooling rate. Directionally solidified samples of AZ 91 were used to investigate the segregating behaviour of zinc during solidification.

An alloy of eutectic composition, Mg- 33 wt% Al, exhibits a lamellar morphology at low growth rates and a fibrous morphology at higher growth rates. However, in low aluminium content magnesium;aluminium alloys such as the most common commercial magnesium alloys AZ 91 and AM 60, the eutectic has a different morphology, described as either completely or partially divorced. This paper reports the results of an investigation into the effect of aluminium content and cooling rate on the morphology of the eutectic in <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium-aluminium alloys.

As the aluminium content of the alloys increased, the dominant eutectic morphology changed progressively from fully divorced to partially divorced, to granular, to fibrous and, finally, to lamellar. Increasing the cooling rate produced a small change in the opposite direction with these transitions occurring at higher aluminium contents.

Measurement of microstructural parameters such as Al-alpha particle size, shape factor, contiguity and entrapped liquid showed a relative equivalency among the various conditioning techniques. It was found that the strongest influence on semi-solid slurry fluidity is exerted by the mould temperature. Tensile properties and porosity levels were measured on a demonstration part produced with different slurry ingate velocities. Results showed similar strength levels among all thixocast samples, a strong correlation between elongation and pore volume fraction and porosity levels much lower than the typical figure for <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> or die <b>cast</b> Al-Si alloys. Finally, thermomechanical fatigue tests results were much more favorable to the semi-solid material when compared with the conventionally cast alloy, a result attributed to lower porosity, spheroidal shape of the Al-alpha phase, and refined Si eutectic particles. alpha 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Defects and {{imperfections}} are intrinsically {{generated by}} casting processes, due to several reasons. The final properties and in-service behaviour of castings are always related to microstructural features and to defects and imperfections: both microstructure and defects/imperfections {{are the results}} of process stages, alloys properties and dies & tools design. As an example, it should be considered that in HPDC filling stage extreme conditions are established: complexity of components leads to complex dies, and the high production rates required (up to 120 shots/h) lead to very high filling velocities for the molten alloy (up to 40 m/s) with strong generation of turbulence in the flow. Solidification takes place in few seconds, and the die is first in contact with a molten alloy at more than 700 Â°C and, after 30 - 40 seconds, with a sprayed lubricant at room temperature. For these reasons HPDC (as well as other Aluminium alloys casting processes, such as <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>casting</b> process) {{can be considered a}} âdefect generating processâ. Not only an average 5 - 10 % scrap is typically produced, but the type, size and severity of defects and imperfections are varying. From these considerations, it seems that the potential of high-pressure die-casting and <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>casting</b> processes will be completely exploited only when the quality level will be perfectly optimised. In this regard, the analysis of defects and imperfections allows the foundry to monitor the products quality respect to a quality standard. Further, the analysis of defects and imperfections provide to the foundry useful correlations between their type/distribution and their origin, so that it could be possible to define process modification for improving the quality. One of the current targets of the StaCast project is the compilation and dissemination of common tools to allow foundries to define a proper, comparable, quality standard. The first tool to be proposed is a common basis of language, i. e. a terminology and classification of defects and imperfections in order to help die-casting foundries to face with increased confidence and ability the defect-related issues, to assure quality and reliability of their products...|$|E
40|$|AZ 91 {{magnesium}} alloy hybrid composites reinforced with different hybrid ratios of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticulates were fabricated by semisolid stirring assisted ultrasonic cavitation. The {{results showed that}} grains of the matrix in the AZ 91 /(CNT + SiC) composites were obviously refined after adding hybrid CNTs and SiC nanoparticles to the AZ 91 alloy, and the room-temperature mechanical properties of AZ 91 /(CNT + SiC) hybrid composites were improved comparing with the unreinforced AZ 91 matrix. In addition, the tensile mechanical properties of the AZ 91 alloy-based hybrid composites were considerably improved at the mass hybrid ratio of 7 [*]:[*] 3 for CNTs and SiC nanoparticles; in particular, the tensile and yield strength were increased, respectively, by about 45 and 55 % after gravity <b>permanent</b> <b>mould</b> <b>casting.</b> The reason {{for an increase in}} the room-temperature strength of the hybrid composites should be mainly attributable to the larger hybrid ratio of CNTs and SiC nanoparticles, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between matrix and hybrid reinforcements, the dispersive strengthening effects (Orowan strengthening), and the grain refining (Hall-Petch effect) ...|$|E

The {{effect of}} rapid {{solidification}} on the microstructure of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys with 8 wt. % Zn- 2 wt. % Mg- 2. 3 wt. % Cu and 0. 2 or 0. 5 wt. % of Zr additions were investigated using X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD), scanning (SEM) and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis. Rapidly solidified ribbons with thickness of 70 - 100 Âµm were performed by melt spinning technique. The <b>mould</b> <b>cast</b> alloys {{as well as the}} melt spun ribbons revealed dendritic microstructure of Î±(Al) solid solution and Î· Mg(Zn,Cu) 2 phase in interdendritic areas. The refinement of the microstructure and reduction of the volume fraction of the Î· phase up to 1. 7 %, as compared to 4 % in the <b>mould</b> <b>cast</b> alloys was observed in the ribbons. Copper dissolution up to about 20 wt % in the Î· phase causes a decrease of the lattice parameters.
