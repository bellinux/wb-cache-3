40|$|AbstractNowadays, we {{are living}} in a world wherein the {{education}} {{is becoming more and more}} a self-development process for both its ends – teacher and student. The former must apply a trans-disciplinary approach during the development process of student's knowledge. In my point of view, when <b>planning</b> <b>classes</b> and curriculums, it is crucial to take into consideration the psycho-social traits and particularities of the participants and to elaborate methodologies based on active, non-formal strategies. In order to accomplish this very purpose, the institution of school must be cultural first but also multicultural. This should be the main objective of education in the Romanian society, given that several nationalities coexist for centuries in the same geographical area, especially in Transylvania (i. e. Hungarians, Germans, Gypsies). This research is a psycho-pedagogical experiment consisting in the implementation of an intercultural educational program, addressing teenagers in two of the most representative high-schools in Targu-Mures (a city from Transylvania renowned for its diversion of minorities). The stated purpose of the project is to develop the student's multicultural competencies and give a “wake-up call” to teachers in particular and the community in general about the need of multicultural education...|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement: In recent years, many {{educators}} and {{researchers in the}} field of education have made efforts to leverage the advantages provided by online peer assessment, leading to its extensive application in a range of domains, particularly higher education. However, studies on the roles of the reviewer and author in online peer assessment are often limited to student perceptions and feelings, rather than empirical data and it remains unclear how these influence learning. It is essential to determine which role benefits students more, or whether both roles together contribute to learning. In addition, the business experience of the parents to have a significant influence on the entrepreneurial spirit of the children. Therefore, entrepreneurial experience of the family and learning modes should be considered together when exploring students ’ business planning writing performance.

40|$|Since 1999, {{with the}} {{adoption}} of expansion policy in higher education by the Chinese government, enrollment and graduate numbers have been increasing at an unprecedented speed. Accustomed to {{a system in which}} university graduates were placed, many students are not trained in “selling themselves”, which exacerbates the situation leading to a skyrocketing unemployment rate among new graduates. The idea of emphasizing career services comes with increasing employment pressure among university graduates in recent years. The 1998 “Higher Education Act” made it a legislative requirement. Thereafter, the Ministry of Education issued a series of documents in order to promote the development of career services. All higher education institutions are required to set up special career service centers and to set a ratio of 1 : 500 between career staff and the total number of students. Related career management courses, especially career <b>planning</b> <b>classes,</b> are required to be clearly included as specific modules into the teaching plan with a requirement of no less than 38 sessions in one semester at all universities. Developing career services in higher education has thus become a hot issue. One of the more notable trends in higher education {{in recent years has been}} the transformation of university career service centers from merely being the coordinators of on-campus placement into full service centers for international career development. The traditional core of career services in higher education had been built around guidance, information and placements (Watts, 1997). This core was still in place, but the role of higher education career services has changed considerably in recent years and the nature of each part is being transformed (Watts, 1997). Most services are undertaking a range of additional activities, and the career guidance issue is emphasized much more than before. Career management courses, especially career <b>planning</b> <b>classes,</b> are given special focus in developing career services in the Chinese case. This links career services clearly and directly with the course provision function. In China, most career service centers are engaging in the transformation period from a “management-oriented” organization to a “service-oriented” organization. Besides guidance services, information services and placement activities, there is a need to blend them together with the new additional teaching function, which follows the general trend as regulated by the government. The role of career services has been expanding and this has brought more challenges to its development in Chinese higher education. Chinese universities still remain in the period of exploration and establishment in developing their own career services. In the face of the new situation, it is very important and meaningful to explore and establish a comprehensive career services system to address student needs in the universities. A key part in developing this system is the introduction of career courses and delivering related career management skills to the students. So there is the need to restructure the career service sectors within the Chinese universities in general. The career service centers will operate as a hub and function as a spoke in the wheel of this model system, providing support and information to staff located in individual teaching departments who are responsible for the delivery of career education, information, advice and guidance. The career service centers will also provide training and career <b>planning</b> <b>classes.</b> The purpose of establishing a comprehensive career services system is to provide a strong base for student career development. The students can prepare themselves well in psychology, ideology and ability before employment with the assistance of effective career services. To conclude, according to the different characteristics and needs of students, there will be appropriate services and guidance in different stages and different ways. In other words, related career services and career guidance activities would be started for newly enrolled freshmen and continue throughout their whole university process. For the operation of a comprehensive services system, there is a need for strong support by the government in the form of macro-control and policy guarantee, but support by the government in the form of macro-control and policy guarantee, but also a need for close cooperation with the academic administration and faculties to be actively involved in career planning and employment programs. As an integral function within the universities, career services must develop and maintain productive relationships with relevant campus offices and key stakeholders both within the universities and externally...|$|E
40|$|The {{dilemma for}} many college {{students}} ’ job search process is their overwhelming desire to locate any job {{rather than to}} satisfy their true passions. Thus, a job search can become a highly instrumental, task-oriented process, preventing students ’ opportunity to discover themselves and their life’s purpose. Self-awareness, however, is a central concept in career planning and development because understanding one’s self is crucial for job search success. Thus, self-assessment is a foremost topic in career <b>planning</b> <b>classes</b> because job satisfaction is closely linked to employees ’ interest in the tasks they perform. This study explores the effects of using Himalayan art in a career planning class on students ’ self-awareness and understanding in their job search preparation stage. The idea {{was inspired by the}} principle of Baruch College-Rubin Museum Project: that is, exposure to and participation in the arts enrich students ’ college experience and greatly enhance their ability to learn, understand, and function on a much higher than usual level throughout their lives. Twenty-five students from a career planning class in a community college in North America participated in this study. The findings support that a majority of students were able to query their life purpose, set career goals and connect art with the career planning subject. In addition, students ’ feedback supports the statement that art is an effective medium in supporting students ’ learning and in building connections with subject knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{education}} curriculum {{has a very}} broad set, because the knowledge standards are defined for triennial {{and not for the}} particular school year. Physical education teachers have therefor a lot of freedom <b>planning</b> <b>classes.</b> They determine according to the general knowledge of the pupils when the appropriate time would be to teach and assess certain standards. This freedom for physical {{education curriculum}} can be an advantage for seasoned teachers and a disadvantage for the beginners. Main goal of the research is to determine whether the teachers understand the physical education curriculum notes and consequentially which standards they assess most in the first and second triennial. In theoretical part we presented the meaning and ways of assessment and characteristics of good assessment. We described the meaning of games assessment and how to do that in an adequate manner. Important part of quality assessment is planning; therefore we described also the classes planning, the meaning and structure of curriculum plan. In this pattern we included 102 curriculums plans of first five grades. From fourteen schools (42 curriculums plans) we have acquired curriculums plans for all the grades of the first triennial and from fourteen schools (28 curriculums plans) we have acquired curriculums plans for the second triennial – fourth and fifth grade. Based on our research we wanted to find out whether teachers differentiate and individualize physical education assessment or if they assess the same knowledge standards in the same classes or if they assess all standards in one triennial, defined by the curriculum. Research has showed that standards are assessed mostly in all three grades within one triennial, but that the level of assessment gets more demanding each year. We have found out that the majority of teachers does not differentiate and individualize the assessment. Within the triennial most schools do not assess all standards, more than half of teachers assess the same standards in the same grades. We have presented our findings in tables and therefore made the overview which standards are most often assessed in first two triennials in physical education. ...|$|E

40|$|Finnish {{bachelor}} students in universities of applied sciences publish thousands of theses annually as a mandatory curricular requirement. A multitude of students, faculty and working life organizations {{are involved in}} the process. This study utilized the grounded theory method to produce a substantive grounded theory of the undergraduate business student's experience in the thesis planning stage. The data was collected between October 2011 and January 2013 from five thesis planning workshop implementations with a total of 138 enrolled students. The data consisted of documentary data gathered from students in the form of student emails and stories, and of participant observation notes taken on one-on-one faculty student consultancy sessions and classroom situations. The key outcome of the study was a substantive grounded theory focused around the core category "getting the thesis plan done". The theory highlights the internal mental processes of the student (motivation, meta-cognition and cognition, emotions), student's doing, the stakeholders in the thesis process (student, peers, working life, faculty), and the four different kinds of interactional relationships between these stakeholders. Each of these components was described in further detail through its properties and their dimensions. Findings clearly indicated that whether the students were motivated or not to engage in the thesis process, they tended to feel either suitably or overly challenged by it. Students wrestled with various motivational, cognitive, metacognitive and emotional challenges. Many sought faculty advising to resolve these concerns. Some faculty were motivated, committed and competent to advise, and facilitated students internal experience and doing. Other faculty failed to do so, often resulting in a negative motivational and emotional impact on the student. Students perceived commissioned working life theses as a motivating opportunity for professional learning, career building and networking. Negotiation, communication and collaboration between students and working life organizations proved, however, to be a problematic area for three reasons. Firstly, majority of students were not competent and self-reliant enough to liaise with organizations independently. Secondly, whilst many working life organizations were eager to work with young professionals, committed to build functioning collaboration relationship, and skilled at supporting the student, this was not true of all organizations. Students with unsuccessful working life encounters often suffered from negative motivational and emotional consequences. Faculty rarely attended joint meetings with the student and the organization. Dysfunctional faculty and working life encounters also delayed starting the thesis process. Students were at times suspicious of the usefulness of thesis <b>planning</b> <b>classes</b> and peer advising, but mostly the support was appreciated and utilized effectively. Recommendations for further research and implications for practice were built around a proposed quadripartite model of interaction. The motivation, competences and resourcing of, and the collaborative models between the four parties need further research and development. Student theses as RDI in collaboration with working life form a powerful dynamic and context for professional learning and development. To be effective, further work is needed...|$|E
