25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum <b>price</b> <b>means</b> that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E

50|$|In {{economics}} derived {{demand is}} {{demand for a}} factor of production or intermediate good that {{occurs as a result}} of the demand for another intermediate or Economics help - Derived In essence, the demand for one is dependent on that whose demand its demand is derived from. For example, if the demand for a good such as wheat increases, then this leads to an increase in the demand for labour. For another example, demand for steel leads to derived demand for steel workers, as steel workers are necessary for the production of steel. As the demand for steel increases, so does its price. The increase in <b>price</b> <b>means</b> manufacturers of steel can gain more in revenue if they produce more steel, thus leading to a higher demand for the resources involved in producing steel.|$|E

The Bradley Review’s recommendation of a demand-driven system of funding university places was made without explicit reference to labour market demand for particular skills and qualifications. It has been implemented without much regard for student demand by field of education. It {{is clear that the}} Government underestimated both students’ and universities’ reaction to the opening up of the system. For this reason, initial projections of the cost of a demand-driven system were understated. Student demand has shifted to more expensive fields (Science, Engineering and especially Health), increasing the fiscal cost of the demand-driven system. The gap between funding and costs is biggest in these more expensive fields, and demand-driven funding will reduce universities’ ability to cross-subsidise more expensive programs.

Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on better techniques, both of which will lead to {{increased}} output being sold on the global market. Economists assert that, as the demand for coffee, in particular, is highly inelastic, so an increased price for Fairtrade which produces a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. In addition the Fairtrade minimum <b>price</b> <b>means</b> that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, and particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees.

50|$|An at-the-market (ATM) {{offering}} {{is a type}} of follow-on {{offering of}} stock utilized by publicly traded companies in order to raise capital over time. In an ATM offering, exchange-listed companies incrementally sell newly issued shares into the secondary trading market through a designated broker-dealer at prevailing market prices. The broker-dealer sells the issuing company's shares in the open market and receives cash proceeds from the transaction. The broker-dealer then delivers the proceeds to the issuing company where the cash can be used for a variety of purposes. A higher stock <b>price</b> <b>means</b> a greater amount of money can be raised. The issuing company is able to raise this kind of capital on an as-needed basis with the option to refrain from offering shares if the available prices on a particular day are unsatisfactory. ATM offerings can be started and stopped at any point, and they can also become more aggressive by selling more shares and raising more money when there is an opportunity in the market or additional need by the issuing company. ATMs can be positioned in advance of an upcoming liquidity event or major milestone to take advantage of increased liquidity and a rising stock price.|$|E
5000|$|Flassbeck {{sees the}} need for a {{coordination}} of monetary policy, wage policy and fiscal policy. He assigns monetary policy an outstanding impact on growth and employment and refuses its shortening on retaining price stability. He declares Monetarism to control inflation through money supply failed. It had been practised in the 1980s by some federal banks in response to the oil crisis and the stagflation going along with it in the 1970s. But it had led to drop of investments and high unemployment and therefore had been abandoned in the 1990s at latest. Flassbeck thereby emphasises the speciality of the German and European monetary policy, which, on the contrary to the majority of central banks, had kept a monetarism agenda. Flassbeck cites that the monetary policy of the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB) at controlling the money supply ever had geared to the potential output of the past. If economic growth would exceed money supply respectively Gross National Product the estimated potential output, the ECB, today as in past, would swivel in the Bundesbank already in advance to a restriction course, without a noteworthy endangering of price stability existing in the shape of exceedance of the target inflation rate. One could never set a potential output beforehand. Flassbeck also considers the target inflation rate of the ECB too low and refers to the height at other major central banks. According to Flassbeck, wage policy should work towards a macroeconomic [...] "distribution neutral" [...] wage adjustment. The optimal rate of wage increases would result from the addition of inflation rate and rise of labour productivity. Flassbeck views the labour agreement on national area as solution best compatible with market economy. This mechanism would accomplish the Law of one <b>price,</b> <b>means</b> the law of same prices for same goods, against the labour market's imperfections and information asymmetries.|$|E
30|$|A {{different}} approach to understand this problem is based on calculating the unit price of exports (Rodrik 2006). To derive export quality of products from these calculations, we need to compare the unit prices of the same good exported by different countries, {{under the assumption that}} higher unit <b>prices</b> <b>mean</b> higher quality of goods. Yet, this interpretation is weakened by the fact that in import-intensive exported goods, high unit prices might be due to the high price of imported parts and components.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a linear cobweb model is {{developed}} {{to study the}} phenomenon of commodity price fluctuations and then a buffer stock incorporated into the model to stabilize the price of fresh tomatoes in Ghana. The model performed on the assumptions that fresh tomatoes have no equal substitutes, {{and that there is}} no foreign competition and also no exogenous shocks needed to generate price fluctuations. The analysis detected that the slope of the demand function of price was smaller than the slope of the supply function of price curve implying that the price and quantity supplied of the fresh tomatoes would oscillate around a fixed price and quantity and also spiral outward. The “Keep Supply at Average” (KSA) buffer scheme achieved price and quantity stability in the short run. The <b>mean</b> <b>price</b> of the scheme was GH¢ 17. 31, very close to actual <b>price</b> <b>mean</b> of Gh¢ 13. 40 in the first 16 quarters.

50|$|FAR 2.101 {{provides}} that“a commercial item means - (6) {{services of}} a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices for specific tasks performed or specific outcomes to be achieved and under standard commercial terms and conditions. This does not include services that are sold based on hourly rates without an established catalog or market price for a specific service performed or specific outcomes to be achieved. For purposes of these services -(i)catalog <b>price</b> <b>means</b> a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or vendor, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers and states prices at which sales are currently, or were last, made to {{a significant number of}} buyers constituting the general public; and(ii) Market prices means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors."Note the emphasis in the FAR 2.101 definition for commercial items on established market prices. The reason why simplified acquisition is permitted for items above the $100,000 simplified acquisition procedure threshold for commercial items is there is an efficient market pricing mechanism which pressures market participants to provide goods and services at a fair and reasonable price which represents very efficient / non-wasteful pricing mechanisms. Generally, the more efficient and well developed markets have a large number of participating vendors and information is freely available to consumers in that market on the relative merits of each vendor's products and pricing which permits easy comparison of each vendor's products to each other. FAR Part 12 commercial items acquisition authority was intended {{to take advantage of the}} WalMart's (R) and Microsoft's (R) of the world where there is no need to go through the extensive, formalistic and resource/time consuming process of a fully negotiated procurement, which requires vendors provide cost and pricing information, to verify a fair and reasonable price. In other words, FAR Part 12 was intended to increase the number of competitors available to the US Government by jettisoning all of the unique requirements, including cost accounting systems, which are forced upon Federal contractors by acquisition processes such as FAR Parts 14, 15, 36 etc.; instead, the Federal Government could act more like a normal buyer in a fully functioning commercial market where the Government was but one of a large number of consumers seeking the same or highly similar products or services. However, FAR Part 12 was never intended to apply where the US Government was the only or one of a very few buyers for an item or service not in demand by the commercial market place.|$|E
