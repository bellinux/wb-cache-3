The evidence for speciation {{in this case was}} morphology (physical appearance) and lack of natural interbreeding. These fish have complex mating rituals and a variety of colorations; the slight modifications introduced in the new species have changed the mate selection process and the five forms that arose could not be convinced to interbreed.|$|E

The selective process could not take place unless the selected variety was either better adapted to the conditions than the original stock, or adapted to other conditions than the original stock.

60|$|The {{population}} of the thirteen American States before the war was reckoned at about three millions.

It has been particularly remarked that the two Spanish provinces from which the greatest number of people emigrated to America, became in consequence more populous. Whatever was the original number of British emigrants that increased so fast in the North American Colonies, let us ask, why does not an equal number produce an equal increase in the same time in Great Britain? The great and obvious cause to be assigned is the want of room and food, or, in other words, misery, and that this is a much more powerful cause even than vice appears sufficiently evident from the rapidity with which even old states recover the desolations of war, pestilence, or the accidents of nature. They are then for a short time placed a little in the situation of new states, and the effect is always answerable to what might be expected. If the industry of the inhabitants be not destroyed by fear or tyranny, subsistence will soon increase beyond the wants of the reduced numbers, and the invariable consequence will be that population which before, perhaps, was nearly stationary, will begin immediately to increase.|$|E

40|$|In {{the broiler}} it is {{recognized}} that chick viability {{is related to}} breeder flock age. Young flocks produce eggs with a lower hatchability and chick survival than flocks beyond peak production. Field observations indicate that problems occur when chicks originating from younger flocks are mixed with chicks from older flocks and reared together, perhaps because of a difference in thermoregulation. In this experiment, heat production, rectal temperature after heat or cold stress, and T- 3 of chicks originating from two different aged <b>parent</b> <b>stocks</b> were determined. Chickens originating from older breeder flocks showed a remarkably better body weight and better thermoregulation after cold treatment than chickens originating from young breeder flocks.

At such a crisis, nothing but a decided resolution to stand or fall with their country could have dictated such an address, the direct tendency of which was to cut off all retreat, and to render them peculiarly obnoxious to an invader of their own communion. The address showed what I long languished to see, that all the subjects of England had cast off all foreign views and connections, and that every man looked for his relief from every grievance at the hands only of his own natural government.|$|E
