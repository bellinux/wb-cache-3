5|$|By {{the time}} the Interstate Highway System was in the {{planning}} stages, no <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> had yet entered the San Rafael Swell. The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the swell.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> {{was built}} from MS 2 to the Alcorn–Tishomingo county line. It was later {{extended}} to MS 25 in 1981, and was designated as MS 350 {{in the same}} year. No significant changes {{have been made to}} the route since.|$|E
5|$|Craters of the Moon is {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 {{cuts through the}} northwestern part of the {{monument}} and provides access to it. However, the rugged landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> across the northern end.|$|E

5000|$|Canada is {{the second}} largest {{country in the world}} in terms of land area, though it only has 1,350,581 km of <b>paved</b> <b>roads.</b> This is far less highway and road {{distance}} than the United States, which is smaller, but has more than 6,000,000 kilometers of <b>paved</b> <b>roads</b> and highways. However, Canada still has many more roads and highways than Russia, the largest country in the world in land area, with an estimated just 336,000 kilometers (208,000 miles) of <b>paved</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
5|$|Glenwood Canyon {{has served}} as the primary {{transportation}} artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and a dirt road was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E
5|$|Starting at an {{intersection}} with CR502 (Midway Drive) in Negaunee Township, CR510 runs northwesterly {{through the forest}} as <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> toward the Dead River. The road curves westward near the McClure Storage Basin, a reservoir formed by the McClure Dam on the river. CR510 follows {{the course of the}} basin on cliffs above it and then turns northward to cross the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoreline}} of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} {{surrounded by a}} <b>paved</b> <b>road,</b> which is atypical for a lake shoreline. Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development {{has occurred in the}} vicinity of the lake. A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E

5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an unpaved road ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an unnumbered <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 in Fayetteville, following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the unpaved road between Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b> The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto the <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered, unpaved road, the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered, <b>paved</b> <b>road,</b> and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered, unpaved road.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the state}} are the shorter Interstates 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around {{southern}} and eastern Sioux Falls. Several major U.S. highways pass through the state. U.S. routes 12, 14, 16, 18 and 212 travel east and west, while U.S. routes 81, 83, 85 and 281 run north and south. South Dakota and Montana are the only states sharing a land border which is not traversed by a <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee River. That year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b> The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|K-140's route was {{established}} in 1925 as U.S. Route 40S. By 1936, the route had become the primary route of US-40, with the old US-40N becoming U.S. Route 24. By 1969, after the majority of Interstate 70 had been completed, US-40 was rerouted to be concurrent with the newly constructed highway, and the old route of US-40 between Ellsworth and Salina was resigned as K-140. The routing of K-140 has remained unchanged since. The K-140 route has been a <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> since at least 1932.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 82 {{traverses}} it, in {{the process}} reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road. After Cottonwood Pass to the south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> {{in the state and}} the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season.|$|E
5|$|M-123 is {{designated}} as a Scenic Heritage Route north of M-28. Here it continues northwest to East–West Road and turns to run along the shores of Whitefish Bay and cross the Tahquamenon River near its mouth. Continuing along the bay as Whitefish Road, M-123 meets the community of Paradise, the northernmost point along the highway. It is here that M-123 intersects Whitefish Point Road, which continues north to Whitefish Point, home of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. In either direction, M-123 runs southbound from Paradise, changing direction. Continuing east of Paradise, M-123 is the only <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> that serves the Tahquamenon Falls State Park and the Whitefish Point region.|$|E

5|$|MT 48 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MT 1 as a two-lane, <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b> The highway proceeds northeastward through rural mining {{land for a}} short distance before intersecting S-273. The roadway continues northeast, running parallel to Spring Creek. After a short distance, the highway passes Bowman Field and several small reservoirs that were created for mining. The road proceeds northeastward through more rural mining land before slightly bending eastward. The highway continues in a slight northeastward direction {{near the town of}} Warm Springs, crossing the Montana Western Railway. The highway proceeds to its eastern terminus at an intersection with Interstate90's frontage road near exit 201.|$|E
5|$|Recreational Road 255 {{begins at}} its western {{terminus}} at an intersection with U.S. Route 69 as a two-lane, <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b> The highway proceeds eastward through mainly rural areas, passing several small farms. The roadway continues, intersecting County Route 3251 (CR 3251) and turning northeast. The road proceeds northeast before slowly bending east again and continuing. It proceeds {{through the small}} community of Oak Grove and turns northeasterly. RE 255 continues, passing several homes and the small Gregory Cemetery as well as intersecting several county roads and slowly bending east. The route continues easterly, passing through a large forest and intersecting CR 3725 before crossing the Neches River and exiting Tyler County.|$|E
5|$|As of 1965, {{the route}} {{was located in}} eastern Wilkinson and western Amite counties. All of the route was a two-laned <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b> MS 572 began {{at the center of}} Centreville, near a {{railroad}} track. The route then traveled down Park Road until it exited Wilkinson County and entered Amite County. After crossing the county line, MS 572 intersected MS 24 and MS 33, and MS 572 was also branded Lower Centreville Road. Continuing eastward, the route exited Centreville and crossed over Beaver Creek and emerged into the village of Olio. MS 572 left Olio, and ended few miles later at MS 569 at a T-intersection. Lower Centreville Road continued east, concurrent with MS 569. MS 572 was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Amite County, as part of the state highway system.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{improving}} road {{access to the}} Fort Dix Military Reservation {{at the onset of}} World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved the <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as Route S39, a state highway spur of Route 39 (now US206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield Square. Construction on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. Route S39 became Route 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an extension of Route 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with Route 70 and Route 72 at the Four Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the Route 68 corridor, running from a planned Route 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to Route 70 and Route 72; however, this was never built.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, the Kingsland–St. Marys highway was a sand or dirt road. When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an unimproved but maintained road. SR40 was under construction along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as a <b>paved</b> <b>road</b> by January 1936. The highway from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line was under construction by October 1936. The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was a paved highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise unimproved highway from there to SR110. SR40 between Colerain and the western edge of Kingsland was under construction by July 1939 and paving was completed in January 1941. The gap in Kingsland was placed under construction by April 1941 but was not completed until the beginning of 1943.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake (also {{known as}} Harvey Lake or Harvey's Lake) {{is a natural}} lake in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. It has a surface area of {{approximately}} 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. The lake is situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake. By volume, {{it is the largest}} natural lake in Pennsylvania, and by surface area, is the second-largest lake. It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a stone masonry dam. The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself, and the lake is surrounded entirely by a <b>paved</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
