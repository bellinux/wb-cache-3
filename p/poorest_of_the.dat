5|$|It targets the <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high {{compared to that of}} traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E
5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The second class were armed similarly to the first class, but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were {{established}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946. The IBRD was established {{with the original}} mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.|$|E

25|$|Those in the {{business}} have considered domesticating the mopane worms {{in a manner that}} is similar to the domestication of silkworms.

For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to the <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.|$|E

The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{development}} did {{not bring}} prosperity to all. During the 1960s many of the rural poor felt increasingly dissatisfied with their condition in society and disillusioned by their treatment by the central government in Bangkok. Efforts by the Thai government to develop poor rural regions often {{did not have the}} desired effect in that they contributed to the farmers' awareness of how bad off they really were. It {{is interesting to note that}} it was not always the <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor who joined the anti-government insurgency. Increased government presence in the rural villages did little to improve the situation. Villagers became subject to increased military and police harassment and bureaucratic corruption. Villagers often felt betrayed when government promises of development were frequently not fulfilled. By the early 1970s rural discontent had manifested itself into a peasant's activist movement.|$|E

Tor.com reviewer Keith DeCandido was less positive, feeling that it [...] "earned" [...] its reputation as the <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Next Generation seven seasons because [...] "the episodes were uneven, poorly plotted, ineptly scripted, and acted by actors who were still trying to figure their characters out".

500|$|From 2003 to 2007, {{the number}} of piracy {{incidents}} worldwide declined from 452 to 282; however, piracy increased by 100% in Somalia, which suffered from severe poverty and lacked an effective central government since the 1991 ouster of Siad Barre. By 2005, the International Maritime Bureau advised ships to stay 200 nautical miles off the Somalian coast. According to academics J. Ndumbe Anyu and Samuel Moki, [...] "the overwhelming majority of pirates in Somalia come from Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in the northeast of the country... where [...] <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor live." [...] By 2008, as Anyu and Moki write, Somalia was the [...] "epicenter of piracy," [...] with 100 ships attacked that year; pirate ransom demands had spiked [...] "from {{tens of thousands of}} dollars a few years before to between $500,000 and $3.5 million," [...] since shipowners were willing to pay relatively small amounts to recover much more expensive ships. Pirates extorted about $120 million in ransoms in 2008. Accordingly, insurance premiums for shipping in the Gulf of Aden increased ten times from 2007 to 2008, from $900 to $9,000. The pirates frequently targeted yachts or commercial ships, which are unarmed and may hold valuable cargo. They sometimes targeted ships bearing humanitarian aid, such as the MV Semlow and MV Miltzow in 2005, which were hijacked while delivering food to Somalia under the UN World Food Programme. Despite international naval patrols working to curb piracy, The Telegraph noted that the region remained [...] "the most dangerous in the world for pirate attacks," [...] with 24 attacks between April and June 2008. In addition, 94 mariners were captured in the Gulf of Aden in the first half of the year.|$|E
