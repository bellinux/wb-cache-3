Treatment of locally {{advanced}} breast cancer usually is started with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further self-determination for the surgical treatment strongly depends on the breast imaging, especially magnetic resonance. Aim of the study: To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging accuracy for residual breast tumor size assessment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Material and methods: A retrospective study of breast cancer patients with locally advanced disease treated in 2013 - 2016 in Hospital of LUHS Kauno Klinikos was carried out. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were compared to the results of histopathological analysis. Non-operated patients were excluded from the study. Information about the patient's age, MRI, core biopsy and final pathological examinations results were collected. For the statistical analysis statistical software packages Excel for Windows 2007 and 20. 00 SPSS were used.

40|$|Context: Complementary {{medicine}} like hypnotherapy {{is often}} used for pain and palliative care. Health professionals vary in views about hypnotherapy, its utility, value, and attitudes. Aims: To understand the opinions of health professionals on hypnotherapy. Settings and Design: A semi-qualitative method to survey opinions of the health professionals from various disciplines attending a programme on hypnotherapy was conducted. Materials and Methods : The survey form consisted of 32 statements about hypnosis and hypnotherapy. Participants {{were asked to indicate}} whether they agreed, disagreed, or were not sure about each statement. A qualitative feedback form was used to obtain further views about hypnotherapy. Statistical Analysis Used: <b>Percentage,</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution.</b> Results: The sample consisted of 21 participants from various disciplines. Two-thirds of the participants gave correct responses to statements on dangerousness of hypnosis (90 %), weak mind and hypnosis (86 %), and hypnosis as therapy (81 %).

Participants were not sure if one could not hear the hypnotist one is not hypnotized (43 %) about the responses on gender and hypnosis (38 %), hypnosis leading to revealing secrets (23 %). Conclusions: Despite patients using complementary medicine services, often health professionals are unaware of the issues associated with these services.

The research groups consist of voluntarily attended 369 academicians and from them 6 are private and 20 of them are academicians at state universities at physical education and sports sciences faculties. For the acquirement of the datum related to innovation sufficiency the Innovation Sufficiency Scale, developed by Eraslan (2014) was used.

There were four parts to the investigation: Firstly, a qualitative survey of fourteen sites showed eleven of the thirty-five British species of Simuliids to be present. Secondly, quantitative programmes showed streams to have three types of population structure: those with larvae present mainly in winter; mainly in summer; and throughout the year. Most streams were in the latter two categories, larval numbers being lower in winter at the higher altitudes. In summer 1972, absolute population estimates were obtained from two streams by removal trapping. More larvae occurred in the lower sections of the streams and, in the streams where the winter populations were low, larval numbers were larger early in summer; this was not true of the lower altitude stream.

Specifically the {{study examined}} the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, estimated the farm size of the farmers, identified reasons for not practicing mechanized farming, identified different innovations available to the farmers and identified the factors that affected agricultural productivity. Five communities were chosen randomly and from each of these communities, twenty farmers were randomly chosen. Data were collected, collated and analyzed using relevant techniques such as means, <b>percentages,</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that 85 % of the respondents practiced individual land tenure system alone. It was also revealed that the laws of inheritance and increase in population led to the subdivision and fragmentation of existing farmland {{in such a manner}} that the sizes of farm holdings discouraged agricultural commercialization. Also, it was found that fragmentation led to a great distance between the plot which increased the waste in man-hour and energy. It was also shown that mechanization of agriculture was impracticable under land fragmentation and adoption of modern innovation was reduced since just 35. 0 % of the respondents claimed to have adopted other forms of innovation. Lastly, the null hypothesis was rejected concluding that socio-economic factors affected the farmerâ€™s productivity in the area. It was recommended that formation of cooperatives by farmers is an imperative in farm land consolidation of the scattered farm holdings into economic size to encourage large scale operation and bulk input sourcing and procurement. land Tenure system, farm size, Agricultural productivity, innovation, Productivity Analysis,...|$|R

Tomato crop is considered {{as the most important}} vegetable crop in the country according to its economic and nutrition value. There are many pest and diseases retarding tomato production such as whitefly, American bollworm, TYLCV and powdery mildew. Therefore some IPM options for tomato and onion were validated in FFS in order to help farmers in controlling the most important pests and diseases. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of FFS on farmer's adoption of IPM options for tomato in the Gezira State, Sudan. Field survey was used to collect data from three Farmer Field Schools in the Gezira State namely: Um Dagarsi, Hantoub and Faris in the 2009 / 2010 growing season. All FFS participants were used, i. e. 30 FFS- participants from each school. Equal number of non-FFS participants (90) was used for comparison, by using the simple random sampling technique. The collected data were statistically analyzed and interpreted using <b>percentage,</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> and chi-square test. The results showed that the FFS schools were positively affected farmer's adoption of IPM options for tomato. It can be concluded that the FFS approach is very efficient in the transfer of farm technology for vegetable farmers through their participation in various activities of FFS schools. Thus, FFS approach must become national policy, share authority of extension organizations in control and execution of FFS activities with farmer unions for more effective participations of clientele in all activities of the schools and More efforts should be exerted in distribution of all inputs to farmers with reasonable prices through various agricultural centres. ...|$|E

The preliminary screening experiment with 150 nl lâˆ’ 1 concentrations of SO 2 and NO 2 in combination for 10 d, yielded well-defined sensitive and tolerant lines in both the stocks. However, the <b>percentage</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> of plants in different injury classes varied and stock S 2 showed a better segregation of different lines. In a subsequent experiment, treatment {{with a mixture of}} each gas at 100 nl lâˆ’lconcentration for 22 d caused a variable degree of growth reduction. As a result of air pollution treatment, most of the growth parameters were significantly (P < 0. 001) reduced in the sensitive lines of both the stocks, whereas the tolerant lines showed a marked resistance to the growth inhibitory effect of the pollutants. The magnitude of the difference between the sensitivities of different lines was usually double or more, and the effects were, more pronounced in stock S 2 than in stock SI. Root dry weight was more adversely affected than shoot dry weight in sensitive lines of both the stocks. The results indicated that inter-line differences in growth responses of these mutants were wide ranging, distinct and consistent. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that artificial mutations may cause a markedly broad base of variation in air pollution sensitivity of crop plants which may be used in future plant breeding programmes of pollution tolerant cultivars...|$|E
