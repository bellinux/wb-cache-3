50|$|Maynard invented many dental {{methods and}} instruments, but is most {{famous for his}} {{firearms}} inventions. He achieved lucrative fame for his first patent, an 1845 <b>priming</b> <b>system</b> which cycled a small mercury fulminate charge to the nipple of a percussion cap firearm. His system used a magazine from which a paper roll, not unlike modern cap guns, advanced a charge over the nipple as the gun was cocked; this was intended to accelerate the gun's rate of fire as the shooter could concentrate on loading and firing the gun. The system was quickly adopted by several commercial gun makers, and the United States government decided to test it.|$|E

The brass Maynard cartridge {{did not have an}} integral percussion cap; a small hole in the middle of its base fired it when the external cap was detonated. The cartridge, which had a wide rim permitting swift extraction, was reloadable up to 100 times. This proved to be a significant feature for the Confederate troops equipped with it. Another significant feature was that the use of a metallic cartridge prevented gas escape at the breech, a serious concern for early externally primed breechloaders.|$|E
50|$|In 1851, however, Maynard had {{patented}} a {{more successful}} idea: a simple lever-operated breechloading rifle, which used a metallic cartridge his own invention.

The grenade mounted a charge head within a steel sheet cylinder atop a long hollow wooden handle.

To use, a soldier would simply pull the string downwards, dragging a rough steel rod through the igniter within the fuse. The rod's abrasive contact would cause sparks and a flame to light from within, setting the fuse burning. This fuse took approximately four and a half seconds to reach the detonator before exploding.|$|E

40|$|Adoptive T cell {{transfer}} {{therapy is}} one of the most promising cancer immunotherapeutic approaches. In order to provide adequate and efficient T cells for cancer treatment, T cells targeting specific cancer antigens are commonly generated in a dendritic cell (DC) -based ex vivo T cell <b>priming</b> <b>system.</b> A cancer/testis antigen, NY-ESO- 1, is amongst the most immunogenic cancer antigens. It is expressed in various malignant tumors but not in normal tissues. Due to its restricted expression pattern and exceptionally strong immunogenicity, NY-ESO- 1 is considered as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. This study attempts to investigate the generation of NY-ESO- 1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a DC-based ex vivo T cell <b>priming</b> <b>system.</b> Several factors including antigen, co-stimulation and cytokines may affect the generation of antigen specific CTLs in ex vivo T cell priming. Since NY-ESO- 1 is a protein containing a complicated oligomeric structure, we first investigated the effectiveness of different oligomeric forms of the NY-ESO- 1 antigen on CD 8 + T cell immunogenicity. Second, we explored the functional role(s) of IL- 7 in enhancing the generation of NY-ESO- 1 specific CTLs in an ex vivo system. Finally, we examined the ability of IL- 12 to enhance the generation of NY-ESO- 1 specific CTLs ex vivo. For each part of the study, the effector function of generated NY-ESO- 1 specific CTLs was evaluated through interferon-γ (IFN-γ) releasing assay and cytotoxicity assay. Results indicated that IL- 12 could effectively enhance the generation of NY-ESO- 1 specific T cells and IL- 7 was capable of maintaining the survival of the primed T cells, whereas the alteration of NY-ESO- 1 oligomeric structure was not a feasible way to augment the generation of NY-ESO- 1 specific CTLs. In conclusion, the selection and administration of appropriate cytokines plays a critical role in the generation of NY-ESO- 1 specific T cells ex vivo...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} {{fragment of}} the phi X 174 viral circle sustains the primed start of complementary DNA strand synthesis in vitro, {{even though the}} intact circle permits primed starts at many sites. The 300 -nucleotide fragment from restriction nuclease digestion contains the recognition site for protein n', a DNA-dependent ATPase essential for priming phi X 174 DNA replication. This n' recognition site contains within it a 44 -nucleotide sequence with a potential hairpin structure and may {{be regarded as the}} starting signal for replication [Shlomai, J. & Kornberg, A.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are {{the most}} potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in priming naive T cells. Using an in vitro <b>priming</b> <b>system,</b> we show that DCs {{incubated}} with Ixodes ricinus tick saliva initiate the T h 2 differentiation of CD 4 + T cells. As determined with reverse transcription–PCR, the expression of IL- 4 mRNA by these cells is higher than IFN-γ mRNA. Early endogenous production of IL- 4 {{is thought to be}} important during the in vitro interaction of saliva-pulsed DCs with CD 4 + T cells. Its neutralization with specific mAbs inhibits the development of IL- 4 -secreting T h 2 cells. Moreover, differentiated T h 2 cells proliferate only when saliva-pulsed DCs and IL- 1 ß are added together early in the primary culture. As demonstrated by FACS analysis, the treatment in vitro of saliva-pulsed DCs by IL- 1 ß enhanced the expression of B 7 and mainly CD 40 co-stimulatory molecules, which provide sufficient signals to stimulate sensitized CD 4 + T cell proliferation. On the other hand, DCs treated with tick saliva only up-regulated mostly B 7 - 2 co-stimulator expression and this was associated with differentiation of naive CD 4 + T cells into T h 2 type of cells. The in vitro <b>priming</b> <b>system</b> is suitable to investigate the major elements implicated in the anti-tick immune response such as naive CD 4 + T cells, whole DCs population and tick saliva, and it can provide the possibility to delimit further the saliva molecules, the DC subsets and the type of host cells involved in the T h 2 polarization. Corresponding in vivo experiments involving subcutaneous injection of tick saliva-pulsed DCs into BALB/c mice also elicited a T h 2 immune response. Ex vivo cultures of draining lymph node T cells stimulated with tick saliva produced higher IL- 4 : IFN-γ ratios compared with controls, confirming the relevance obtained in the in vitro priming model. These experiments demonstrate the importance of tick saliva in priming DCs to initiate a T h 2 -biased immune response in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} prevent lane departures in car driving active safety devices have been developed. This paper assesses a new system {{designed}} to produce some motor priming (consisting of directional steering wheel vibrations) when a car is at risk of lane departure. The first objective {{was to determine if}} motor priming assistance can be of some benefit compared to more traditional auditory (lateralized sound) or vibratory (symmetric steering wheel oscillation) warning devices. Whilst on the one hand the motor priming mode was assumed to operate at the action level, on the other hand, other tested driving assistance devices were assumed to favour driving situation diagnosis. The second objective was to assess the possible advantage of using multimodal information by combining auditory warning with simple steering wheel vibration and motor priming. Observed behaviours showed that all tested devices improved drivers' steering performance; however, performance improvements were greater with a motor <b>priming</b> <b>system.</b> No performance enhancement was recorded when steering wheel vibration or motor priming systems were combined with auditory warning. This study confirms our hypothesis that the direct intervention of motor priming on motor action preparation is more effective than a simple warning which favours situation diagnosis.

In group 1, the teeth were bonded with conventional acid etching and priming method. In group 2, the teeth were bonded with clearfil protect bond self-etch primer, and transbond plus self-etch primer was used to bond the teeth in group 3. The samples were stored in 37 ΀C distilled water and thermocycled. Then, the SBS of the sample was evaluated with Zwick testing machine. Descriptive statistics and the analysis of variances (ANOVA) and Tukey′s test and Kruskal-Wallis were used to analyze the data. Results: The results of the ANOVA showed that the mean of group 3 was significantly lower than that of other groups. Most of the sample showed a pattern of failure within the adhesive resin.
