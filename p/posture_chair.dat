40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} the cognitive load {{of using a}} vibrotactile <b>posture</b> feedback <b>chair</b> while performing standard office tasks. Our specific application is seated posture guidance in the office environment. We have instrumented a standard office chair with sensors and vibrotactile actuators to detect and correct a user’s seated posture in real-time. A pilot study with 20 subjects (age 25 ± 3. 2 years, weight 71. 6 ± 17. 7 kg) was conducted to determine the impact on performance in a typing task while responding to the vibrotactile feedback. We found that 55 % of the subjects showed statistically significant decrease in typing perform-ance (p< 0. 05) during the phases with feedback compared to the phases without feedback. However, 70 % of the subjects exhibited an improvement in typing speed from the first to last feedback phases. These findings suggest that although the feedback system temporarily induces greater cognitive load, the load decreases with increased familiarity with the feedback system...|$|R

Computer work showed the lowest physical activity, together with upright trunk and head position and low backrest inclination. Conversation shows the highest activity of head legs and low back together with the highest cervical spine extension. In contrast, desk work provoked the most cervical spine flexion and showed the second lowest activity. The telephoning tasks showed medium activity and the highest kyphosis.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{systematically}} {{reviews the}} effect of chair backrests and reducing seated hip flexion on low back discomfort (LBD) and trunk muscle activation. Background: Prolonged sitting commonly exacerbates low back pain (LBP). Several modifications to seated <b>posture</b> and <b>chair</b> design have been recommended, including using chairs with backrests and chairs that reduce hip flexion. Method: Electronic databases were searched by two independent assessors. Part 1 of this review includes 26 studies comparing {{the effect of}} sitting {{with at least two}} different hip angles. In Part 2, seven studies that compared the effect of sitting with and without a backrest were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: Significant confounding variables and {{a relatively small number of}} randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with LBP complicates analysis of the results. There was moderate evidence that chair backrests reduce paraspinal muscle activation, and limited evidence that chair backrests reduce LBD. There was no evidence that chairs involving less hip flexion reduce LBP or LBD, or consistently alter trunk muscle activation. However, participants in several studies subjectively preferred the modified chairs involving less hip flexion. Conclusion: The limited evidence to support the use of chairs involving less seated hip flexion, or the effect of a backrest, is consistent with the limited evidence that other isolated chair design features can reduce LBP. Application: LBP management is likely to require consideration of several factors in addition to sitting position. Larger RCTs involving people with LBP are required. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

In order to investigate the aetiology of SADTI a new approach is under development: a musculo-skeletal model which can predict forces between the chair and the human body at different seated postures. This study focuses on comparing results from a model developed in the AnyBody Modeling System, with data collected from an experimental setup. A chair with force-measuring equipment was developed, an experiment was conducted with three subjects, and the experimental results were compared with the predictions of the computational model.

However, {{little is known}} about sonographers in China, where the awareness of ergonomics and MSD, workload, and available equipment/facilities may differ. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of MSD and associated risk factors in sonographers in central China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 381 sonographers from 14 randomly selected tertiary hospitals in Hubei province, central China. Musculoskeletal symptoms (using the Nordic Questionnaire) and risk factors (mostly derived from the Health Benefit Trust survey instrument and the Dutch Musculoskeletal Questionnaire) were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify associations between risk factors and MSD. The 12 -month period prevalence of MSD was 98. 3 %, being highest in the neck (93. 5 %) and shoulder (92. 2 %), followed by the lower back (83. 2 %), wrist/hand, upper back, and elbow. Factors contributing to neck pain were psychological fatigue, shoulder abduction and trunk bend-and-twist posture. Height-adjustable tables and chairs were protective factors. Shoulder pain was associated with female sex, health status, mental stress, shoulder abduction, and trunk bend-and-twist <b>posture.</b> Height-adjustable <b>chairs</b> and the awareness of adjusting the workstation before scanning were protective factors. Elbow pain was associated with health status and height-adjustable tables. Wrist/hand pain was associated with female sex, bending the wrist, and working with obese patients. Upper back pain was associated with shoulder abduction, height-adjustable chairs, and device location. Lower back pain was associated with the number of scans performed per day, awkward postures, bending the trunk, twisting or bending the neck forward, and using a footrest. This study suggests a high prevalence of MSD in sonographers in central China. Hence, it is necessary to improve the awareness of MSD by training, and the ergonomics of their current work environment by addressing physical workload, and psychological and equipment/facility-related factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} the cause of the increased horizontal force applied to the buttocks in the fully reclined position of back support on a reclining wheelchair with a rotational axis of back support which was located at the same position as the greater trochanter. The subjects were 15 healthy adult men. The forces were measured using a force plate on the experimental chair. And, we measured the trunk sliding distance along the back support. A comfortable sitting <b>posture</b> in the <b>chair</b> was selected for measurement. Under the rear-axis condition, the rotational axis of the back support was located at the point farthest back in the seat. Under the trochanter-axis condition, the rotational axis was located at the same position as the greater trochanter.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} people spend the {{majority}} of their working lives seated in an office chair. Musculoskeletal disorders, in particular low back pain, resulting from prolonged static sitting are ubiquitous, but regularly changing sitting position throughout the day is thought to reduce back problems. Nearly all currently available office chairs offer the possibility to alter the backrest reclination angles, but the influence of changing seating positions on the spinal column remains unknown. In an attempt to better understand the potential to adjust or correct spine posture using adjustable seating, five healthy subjects were analysed in an upright and reclined sitting position conducted in an open, upright MRI scanner. The shape of the spine, as described using the vertebral bodies’ coordinates, wedge angles, and curvature angles, showed high inter-subject variability between the two seating positions. The mean lumbar, thoracic, and cervical curvature angles were 29 ± 15 °, - 29 ± 4 °, and 13 ± 8 ° for the upright and 33 ± 12 °, - 31 ± 7 °, and 7 ± 7 ° for the reclined sitting positions.

40|$|Abstract—A textile {{pressure}} sensor {{has been designed}} for mea-suring pressure distribution on the human body. Electrodes built with conductive textiles are arranged {{on both sides of}} a compress-ible spacer, forming a variable capacitor. The use of textiles makes unobtrusive, comfortable, lightweight, and washable sensors pos-sible. This simplifies the goal to integrate such sensors into clothing in the future, to be simple, and fast to mount just as getting dressed. Hysteresis induced by the spacer of the sensor has been modeled with the Preisach model to reduce the measurement error from 24 % to 5 % on average and the maximal error from above 50 % to below 10 %. Standard textiles that are not specially optimized for low hysteresis can be used for designing the sensor due to the modeling. The model may also be used for other pressure or even strain sensors to reduce their hysteresis. The modeling enhances the accuracy of the textile sensor to those of commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mats. Furthermore, we used the sensor system for the classification of sitting <b>postures</b> in a <b>chair.</b> The data of nine subjects have been clas-sified with Naïve Bayes classifier, achieving an average recognition rate of 82 %.

40|$|AbstractMusculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) {{have been}} common complaints among workers involved in static work or tasks requiring the repetitive {{motion of the}} upper limbs and prolonged computer work. Call center workers are the one group which may impact on chronic musculoskeletal health problems. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess ergonomics risk for MSDs in work environment among call center workers. This was a survey study conducted among 216 call center workers in Khon Kaen province, Thailand. Call center workers who had experience jobs more than 6 months, working time at least 32 hours per week with computer at least 4 hours per days. Data were collected by the Rapid Office Strain Assessment (ROSA) which measured the sitting <b>posture,</b> workstation (<b>chair</b> height, pan depth, armrests, and back support), computer (monitor, mouse and keyboard), telephone and duration of spending time for each posture or activity. From ROSA, there were 4 levels of ergonomics risk classification (low, medium, high, very high). The results of this study showed that the call center workers were only at 2 level of risk (high and medium). The majority of the call center workers were at high risk level (score 5 - 7 points) for 52. 3 % (mean score 5. 3, 95 %CI: 5. 2 - 5. 4). The medium risk level (score 3 - 4 points) was 47. 7 % (mean score 3. 6, 95 %CI: 3. 5 - 3. 7). The top three highest frequencies of score of ergonomics risk were 5 points, followed by 4 points and 3 points which were at 37. 5 %, 28. 2 % and 19. 4 %, respectively. The mean score of that risk was 4. 5 (95 % CI: 4. 4 - 4. 6). By using the ROSA, this study showed that most of the call center workers were exposed to the high ergonomics risk for MSDs development. For prevention of MSDs, there should be ergonomics training for workers to be aware of ergonomics factors in the office. The personal working behaviors and the design of the workstations should be improved based on the ergonomics principles...|$|R

Pelvis alignment directly affects sitting posture, and systems that adjust and monitor pelvis angle simultaneously might {{be applicable to}} control body posture in sitting. The present study explores whether it is feasible to monitor pelvis angle from seat support forces. Pelvis angle estimation was based on equivalent “two-force member��? loading for which pelvis orientation equals {{the orientation of the}} equivalent contact force. Theoretical evaluation was done to derive important conditions for practical application. An instrumented wheelchair was developed for experimental validation in healthy subjects. Seat support forces were measured, and mechanical analysis was done to derive the equivalent contact force from which we estimated the pelvis angle. Model analysis showed a significant influence of pelvis mass, hip force, and lumbar torque on the relation between the actual pelvis angle and the predicted pelvis angle. Proper force compensation and minimal lumbar torque seemed important for accurate pelvis angle estimations. Experimental evaluation showed no body postures that involved a clear relation between the pelvis angle and the orientation of the equivalent contact force. Findings suggest that pelvis angle could not be estimated in healthy individuals under the described experimental seating conditions. Validation experiments with impaired individuals must be performed under different seating conditions to provide a better understanding whether the principle is of interest for clinical application...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Trigemino-cervical-spinal {{reflexes}} (TCSRs) {{are complex}} brainstem stereotyped nociceptive responses {{involved in a}} defensive withdrawal reaction of the head from facial nociceptive stimuli. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken {{to collect data on}} possible TCSR abnormalities in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and investigate any correlation with motor signs and L-DOPA administration. METHODS: TCSRs were registered from the semispinalis capitis and biceps brachii muscles after electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve in 18 patients with PD and 24 controls. The latency (L) and area (A), as well as the sensory (ST), painful (PT) and reflex (RT) thresholds were measured during the 'off' and 'on' state, and possible correlations with the UPDRS III total score, selected subscores (tremor, neck rigidity, upper limb rigidity, akinesia, rising from a <b>chair,</b> <b>posture</b> and posture instability) and duration of illness were investigated. RESULTS: Significant changes between controls and PD patients were found in the L, A, PT and RT of TCSRs. These results were not significantly influenced by L-DOPA treatment. A significant correlation was found between neck rigidity, postural instability scores and duration of illness and the TCSR L and A values in PD patients in the 'off' state. CONCLUSIONS: TCSRs abnormalities, combined with dopamine resistance, are consistent with a primary loss of brainstem neurons mediating a complex sensory-motor integration including neck muscle tone and postural control as well as the head withdrawal reaction to the nociceptive stimuli. SIGNIFICANCE: TCSRs may represent a useful tool for the assessment of brainstem sensory-motor function in PD as well as other movement and degenerative disorders...|$|R

Previously, the role of hand strength on successful pack opening has been explored in a seated position. However, because many people in hospital eat in bed, the present laboratory study examined the differences between participants opening a selection of products {{in a hospital bed}} and a chair. Methods The present study used a qualitative method (satisfaction) and quantitative methods (grip and pinch strength, dexterity, time and attempts) in two conditions (bed; chair) in a sample of well older community dwelling adults (n = 34). Packs tested included foil sealed thickened pudding, foil sealed thickened water, tetra pack, dessert, custard, jam, cereal, honey sachet and cheese portions. Results Honey sachets, cheese portions, foil sealed thickened pudding and tetra packs were the most difficult packs to open, with 15 % of cheese portions unable to be opened in either the bed or <b>chair</b> <b>posture.</b> Although grip strength was consistent for each posture, pinch grips and dexterity were adversely affected by the bed posture. Lying in a hospital bed required greater pinch strength and dexterity to open packs. Conclusions Eating in a seated position when in hospital has been shown to improve intake.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} effects of high {{frequency}} stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on axial symptoms occurring in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD).  METHODS—The efficacy of STN stimulation on total motor disability score (unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III) were evaluated in 10 patients with severe Parkinson's disease. The subscores were then studied separately for limb akinesia, rigidity, and tremor, which are known to respond to levodopa, and axial signs, including speech, neck rigidity, rising from a <b>chair,</b> <b>posture,</b> gait, and postural stability, which are known to respond less well to levodopa. Patients were clinically assessed in the "off" and "on" drug condition during a levodopa challenge test performed before surgical implantation of stimulation electrodes and repeated 6 months after surgery under continuous STN stimulation. A complementary score for axial symptoms from the "activities of daily living" (ADL) —that is, speech, swallowing, turning in bed, falling, walking, and freezing—was obtained from each patient's questionnaire (UPDRS, part II).  RESULTS—Improvements in total motor disability score (62 %), limb signs (62 %), and axial signs (72 %) obtained with STN stimulation were statistically comparable with those obtained with levodopa during the preoperative challenge (68 %, 69 %, and 59 %, respectively). When levodopa and STN stimulation were combined there was a further improvement in total motor disability (80 %) compared with preoperative levodopa administration. This consisted largely of an additional improvement in axial signs (84 %) mainly for posture and postural stability, no further improvement in levodopa responsive signs being found. Axial symptoms from the ADL showed similar additional improvement when levodopa and STN stimulation were combined.  CONCLUSION—These findings suggest that bilateral STN stimulation improves most axial features of Parkinson's disease and that a synergistic effect can be obtained when stimulation is {{used in conjunction with}} levodopa treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|Long {{hours of}} {{computer}} {{work in the}} modern workplace are associated with visual and musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders, which are recognized by the World Health Organization as major occupational health concerns. The rising age of the workforce imposes new challenges in office ergonomics due to the changes in vision and musculoskeletal characteristics of these computer users. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of oculomotor demands on the most common complaints associated with prolonged computer use, blurred vision, eyestrain, and irritation of the eyes, a within-subject design laboratory study with 17 young subjects was conducted. Subjective ratings of symptoms and objective static and dynamic accommodation and convergence responses were recorded during and after a 2 -hour visually demanding computer task. Each subject repeated the task over 6 days using different combinations of natural and optically-modified oculomotor demands. While there was little effect of viewing distance on symptoms, an elevated static accommodation response and a reduced dynamic divergence response were found for the natural near viewing distance condition (33 cm) compared to the far viewing distance (100 cm). Optical manipulation had no effect at the far viewing distance (100 cm), whereas artificially decreasing the accommodation demand at the near viewing distance increased eyestrain. Divergence limits {{was identified as a}} factor for predicting the symptom of eyestrain. A second within-subject, full-factorial design laboratory study with 19 young and 7 older, presbyopic subjects investigated the effects of age, font size, and reflective glare on productivity, upper body posture, and visual and upper body discomfort, in a setting where the subjects could freely adjust their <b>posture</b> and <b>chair</b> position while performing visually demanding tasks on a computer. Compared to the larger font size, the smaller fonts had significant negative effects on all outcome measures: productivity (speed and accuracy) was lower, visual and neck symptoms were higher, and viewing distance was decreased. The reduced viewing distance was primarily due to forward torso flexion (78 %), followed by moving the chair forward (4 %) and forward head movement (3 %). Screen glare induced non-neutral upper body postures, including neck flexion, torso forward flexion, and head movement to the side. There was little effect of age and presbyopia on the study findings. In summary, the first study demonstrated no difference in visual symptoms when viewing a computer monitor for 2 hours at 33 vs. 100 cm distance. However, there was some evidence of persistent oculomotor effects at the 33 cm distance. The second study demonstrated the benefits of a larger font size and eliminating screen glare on productivity, upper body postures, and symptoms when performing visually intensive tasks. The benefits were similarly experienced by both the younger and older computer users. The non-neutral, forward leaning postures, observed in many computer users, are likely due to font sizes that are small relative to visual acuity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} four office chairs on the postural angles of the lumbopelvic and cervical regions. Research question Which chair(s) produce an “ideal” spinal posture? Methods An experimental same subject design was used involving healthy subjects (n = 14) who conducted a typing task whilst sitting on four different office chairs; two “dynamic” chairs (Vari-Kneeler and Swopper), and two static chairs (Saddle and Standard Office with back removed). Data collection was via digital photogrammetry, measuring pelvic and lumbar angles, neck angle and head tilt which were then analysed within MatLab. A repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons was conducted. Results Statistically significant differences were identified for posterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis between the Vari-Kneeler and Swopper chairs (p = 0. 006, p = 0. 001) and the Vari-Kneeler and Standard Office chairs (p = 0. 000, 0. 000); and also for neck angle and head tilt between the Vari-Kneeler and Swopper chairs (p = 0. 000, p = 0. 000), the Vari-Kneeler and Saddle chairs (p = 0. 002, p = 0. 001), the Standard Office and Swopper chairs (p = 0. 000, p = 0. 000), and the Standard Office and Saddle chairs (p = 0. 005, p = 0. 001). This study confirms a within region association between posterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis, and between neck angle and head tilt. It was noted that an ideal lumbopelvic position does not always result in a corresponding ideal cervical position resulting in a spinal alignment mismatch. Conclusion In this study, the most appropriate posture for the lumbopelvic region was produced by the Saddle chair and for the cervical region by both the Saddle and Swopper chairs. No chair consistently produced an ideal posture across all regions, although the Saddle chair created the best <b>posture</b> of those <b>chairs</b> studied. Chair selection {{should be based on}} individual need...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the Philippines, {{there has}} been a growing {{population}} of businesses engaging in the industry of providing personal care services. From the statistics provided by the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics, in 2008 to 2010, {{there has been}} a 34. 7 % increase in the people employed in this sector. [1] These services include that of salons, with pedicure and manicure services consisting 23 % and 19 % respectively. [2] Manicurists and pedicurists suffer severe discomfort and pain due to the awkward posture and repetitive motions involved in their work. Manicurists and pedicurists are commonly seen hunching over, bowing and tilting their heads, and sitting in stools lower than their popliteal height. Because of this, the proponents of this study aim to design an ergonomically-fit chair suitable for manicurists and pedicurists. In line with this goal, the proponents conducted a survey in areas near the University of the Philippines Diliman to backup observations regarding the workers’ working posture and ailments occurring due to this. The need to change their working posture was analyzed through Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) and necessary anthropometric measurements were obtained. From the survey conducted among the workers, the body parts which most often experienced pain were the neck, shoulders, and back. In addition, the legs, back, and hands were the areas perceived to experience the most severe pain while working. The legs and the back were also seen to be the areas where pain frequently occurs, as well as the chest part. Furthermore, the nature of their job entails that manicurists and pedicurists frequently tilt and bow their heads while working. These factors were taken into consideration for the design of the <b>chair.</b> <b>Postures</b> of the workers were evaluated by the proponents to support the claims of the participants. REBA of their working posture revealed that manicurists and pedicurists adopt high-risk postures that require immediate investigation to implement change. Using all the data gathered, the proponents designed a chair allowing workers to have a better posture. Regarding the improved ergonomic chair design for nail salon workers, it was suggested that further studies could include customer's anthropometric measurements to supplement the design of the chair {{and come up with a}} better set up beneficial for both the worker and the customer. In addition, attention should also be paid to the selection of the materials used in the chair...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{physiopathology}} of gait {{and balance}} disorders in Parkinson's disease patients is still poorly understood. Levodopa treatment and subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation improve step length and walking speed, with less effect on postural instability. These disorders {{have been linked}} to dysfunction of the descending basal ganglia outputs to brainstem structures. In this study, we evaluated the effects of stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), on locomotion and balance in Parkinson's disease patients. Biomechanical parameters and leg muscle activity were recorded during gait initiation in seven selected patients operated for bilateral STN stimulation, out of 204 stimulated patients, with one contact of each electrode located within the SNr. Step length, anteroposterior and vertical velocities of the centre of gravity were studied, with special reference to the subjects' ability to brake the centre of gravity fall before foot-contact, and compared to seven controls. In Parkinson's disease patients, five treatment conditions were tested: (i) no treatment, (ii) levodopa treatment, (iii) STN stimulation, (iv) SNr stimulation and (v) combined levodopa treatment and STN stimulation. The effects of these treatments on motor parkinsonian disability were assessed with the UPDRS III scale, separated into 'axial' (rising from <b>chair,</b> <b>posture,</b> postural stability and gait) and 'distal' scores. Whereas levodopa and/or STN stimulation improved 'axial' and 'distal' motor symptoms, SNr stimulation improved only the 'axial' symptoms. Compared to controls, untreated Parkinson's disease patients showed reduced step length and velocity, and poor braking just prior to foot-contact, with a decrease in both soleus (S) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscle activity. Step length and velocity significantly increased with levodopa treatment alone or in combination with STN stimulation in both natural and fast gait conditions, and with STN stimulation alone in the fast gait condition. Conversely, SNr stimulation had no significant effect on these measures in either condition. In the natural gait condition, no fall in the centre of gravity occurred as step length was low and active braking was unnecessary. In the fast gait condition, braking was improved with STN or SNr stimulation but not with levodopa treatment, with an increase in the stance leg S muscle activity. These results suggest that anteroposterior (length and velocity) and vertical (braking capacity) gait parameters are controlled by two distinct systems within the basal ganglia circuitry, representing respectively locomotion and balance. The SNr, a major basal ganglia output known to project to pontomesencephalic structures, is postulated as being particularly involved in balance control during gait...|$|R
40|$|Ergonomics {{risk factors}} apply to everybody. Numerous adults have {{experienced}} disabling injuries related {{to use of}} computers {{and other forms of}} technology. Now children are using technology even more than adults. Increasingly ergonomics risk factors are being recognized as present in the world of children. Outreach to schools and the surrounding community by employers may help protect the future work force. A growing body of researchers believe that children can benefit from the early introduction of ergonomics awareness and preventative measures. While individual representatives of the educational system may embrace the concept of introducing ergonomics into the classroom, a number of barriers can prevent implementation of integrated programs. Some of the barriers to introducing ergonomics in schools have been absence of a tie to educational standards, the existing demands on teaching hours, and the absence of easily executable lesson plans. Ergonomics is rarely included in teacher training and professional ergonomics expertise is needed {{for the development of a}} class-based program. As part of Strategic Vision plan for 2025, a National Laboratory identified community outreach and the future workforces as key areas for initiatives. A series of hands-on interactive modules have been developed by professional ergonomics specialists. They are being tested with elementary, middle and high school students. Where possible, the content has been tied to the educational standards in the State of California in the USA. Currently the modules include grip strength, effective breathing, optimal keyboard and mouse positions, optimizing <b>chairs,</b> <b>posture</b> and movement, backpack safety and safe lifting. Each module takes the students through a related activity or experience. An individual worksheet asks them questions about the experience and guides them to consider implications in their activities of daily living. A module on hearing is under development. The goal is to have a toolkit that teachers can use in classrooms with minimal training. The kit will come with lesson plans, including background material, key points, questions and answers, possible homework assignments and references. It will include instructions and worksheets for students as well as the materials needed for each module. A pre- and posttest will be administered to test the awareness and understanding of the principles introduced in through the modules. This interactive session will offer the opportunity to for attendees to participate in some of the modules that have been developed to provide experiential demonstration of ergonomics principles. Attendees will experience ergonomics in action and be able to evaluate the applicability of the process in their own area in the world of ergonomics. The session will consist of 20 minutes introduction, 40 minutes working with the toolkit, finally another 30 minutes for questions or discussion for a total time of 90 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinical {{ergonomic}} {{advice for}} sitting posture has been inferred from anthropometry theory and physiology studies. Qualitative observation of posture {{has been used}} to argue that postures are too flexed, too extended, too static, too mobile, require insufficient muscle activity or require too much. In other fields of healthcare, evidence is progressed from basic science to clinical trials before an intervention is prescribed, but postural advice has been prescribed from basic science without quantitative studies of postural behaviour. Spinal neuromuscular control can predict development of low back pain, it is affected by spinal pain, and can be trained, but studies examining these variables rarely measure the spinal position of their test subjects. There is a need for more detail of how spinal positions affect regional muscle activity. Study Objectives: The overall aims of this thesis were to quantify sagittal spinal postures in sitting for comparison within and between subjects and tasks, and to detail paraspinal and abdominal muscle activity associated with sitting postures. The studies quantified regional spinal curves in - Study I: typical posture behaviour during a computer task in comparison with standing, - Study II: postures that are achievable in sitting, - Study III: the regional muscle activity associated with sitting postures that have been clinically advocated as ‘ideal’, - Study IV: cohorts with and without a history of low back pain for comparison of regional muscle activity. Results and Conclusions: For clinical trials quantifying postural behaviour, the postural variation within subjects and task conditions in Study I demonstrated the importance of measurement over a prolonged period and subjects performing relevant tasks (as opposed to brief measures such as radiography that have been the standard for posture assessment). The use of surface tracking to quantify regional spinal curves and sagittal balance establish a foundation to investigate the effect of interventions on <b>posture</b> behaviour (eg. <b>chair</b> geometry, <b>posture</b> training, task variables and subject cohorts). Study I also showed that typical sitting posture for a computer task was more flexed at the thoracolumbar spinal region than when subjects deliberately ‘corrected’ their sitting posture, and both sitting postures were flexed at the lumbar region relative to standing. Study II showed that most subjects were unable to sit with spinal curves like those adopted in standing unless facilitation and feedback were provided, although these curves have been clinically advocated as ‘ideal’ posture. If clinical theories about ‘ideal’ sitting posture are correct, then teaching individuals the awareness of spinal position or skill to adopt these postures could be as important for workplace health and safety as other variables such as design and adjustment of office furniture. Study III showed three upright sitting postures that have been clinically advocated as ‘ideal’ were distinguished by incremental changes in activity of the lumbar multifidus muscles. In Study IV, individuals with a history of low back pain showed more incremental activity at the longissimus thoracis muscle to achieve the same sitting postures. If particular postures are shown to be ‘ideal’ in clinical trials, then training for these postures may need to focus on muscular strategies as well as spinal position. The distinct differences in regional muscle activity observed with spinal curves and subject cohorts (Studies III and IV) imply that studies of spinal neuromuscular control should measure or control spinal curves during testing. If spinal posture were controlled, the flat posture (flat surface from ~T 5 to sacrum) would have the advantages of being achievable, commonly used in sitting and easily assessed. The flat posture also demonstrated the lowest muscle activity of the upright sitting postures examined, which may improve accuracy of determining muscle activity onset/offset used as an outcome measure for interventions, distinguishing cohorts or as a predictor for low back pain occurrence...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Prolonged sitting {{while working}} in an office has become a {{standard}} function in our society. While seated postures do conserve energy and permit a worker {{to focus on a}} task, the posture also involves a significant amount of spine flexion. Held for a prolonged period of time, this non-neutral posture has the potential to generate low back pain through the loading, strain and compression tissues of the low back and buttocks. Indeed, literature points to an association between prolonged occupational sitting and back pain: an expensive problem in terms of direct and indirect health care costs. Two factors involved in this problem, the flexed posture of the low back and the prolonged constrained nature of sitting, could be manipulated in order to reduce their respective contributions to pain and injury pathways. Specifically, decreasing low back flexion could be achieved with various office chair design features and the quasi-static loading scenario could be broken up with movement. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the effect of these two strategies on biomechanical parameters and perceived pain during prolonged sitting. The first part of this thesis explores the effect office chair design features including lumbar support, forward seat pan tilt and a scapular relief backrest have on low back posture, muscle activity and pain compared to a control chair configuration. The second part of this thesis explores the effect active (walking) and passive (lumbar spine manipulation) movement interventions have on those same biomechanical factors. Methods: Twenty-eight participants (14 male and 14 female) were recruited for a radiographic study of low back and pelvic postures adopted in standing, maximum flexion and each of the four office chair conditions: control configuration, lumbar support, anterior seat pan tilt and backrest with scapular relief. Measures of lumbar lordosis, intervertebral joint angles and sacral tilt were taken from lateral lumbar radiographs and compared between conditions. To assess these chair features in a more realistic way, this radiographic study was followed by an in-vivo laboratory study allowing for prolonged exposures to each condition. In this study, 31 (15 males and 16 females) completed a standardized word processing task while sitting {{in each of the four}} chair conditions (control, lumbar support, forward seat pan tilt and scapular relief, presented in a random order) during four 30 -minute blocks. Measures of spine posture (upper back, lower back and pelvis), torso muscle activity (abdominal, back and gluteal), seat pan pressure and perceived pain were collected throughout this two-hour exposure and compared between conditions. To assess the impact of walking breaks on biomechanical parameters and perceived pain throughout a two-hour sitting exposure, 32 subjects (16 males and 16 females) were recruited for two data collections. In a random order, the subjects experienced either a control experiment that consisted of completing a standardized word processing task while sitting for two-hours on a neutral office chair seat pan (backrest removed) or an intervention experiment that was identical to the control session with the exception of two, two-minute, self-paced walking breaks at 40 minute intervals. Measures of spine posture (upper back, lower back and pelvis), back and pelvic muscle activity, seat pan pressure and perceived pain were collected throughout these two-hour exposures and compared between conditions. The effect of a lumbar spine manipulation, a passive form of movement imparted to the body, on biomechanical parameters of muscle activity, back and pelvic posture and perceived pain was examined in a shorter intervention study. Twenty subjects (10 male and 10 female) received either a lumbar spine manipulation or a control maneuver (lumbar spine manipulation set-up with preload but no thrust) in a random order after 40 -minute blocks of sitting on an office chair seat pan (backrest removed) completing a standardized word processing task. Surface muscle activity for the low back and pelvis, indwelling activity of a deep back muscle, spine and pelvic postures and perceived pain were compared between conditions. Results: The radiographic study confirms the extensive lumbar spine flexion in sitting compared to upright standing and maximum flexion. Sitting in an office chair, regardless of design features to reduce spine flexion, results in postures of approximately 70 % of maximum range of low back flexion. No significant differences in low back posture were found between the chair features or control configuration, however; significantly more anterior rotation of the pelvis was found with the lumbar support and forward seat pan configurations. In the prolonged sitting experiment, Study 2, use of the lumbar support and seat pan tilt features were again found to impart significant anterior rotation of the pelvis but these features also resulted in significantly more upright spine postures as well. These improved postures were maintained actively by muscles in the seat pan tilt condition and passively by the backrest in the lumbar support condition. Chair conditions had minimal impact on seat pressure variables. Despite the improvements in posture with two of the chair features and regardless of muscle activity levels, perceived back pain steadily increased to clinically significant levels throughout the two-hour exposure. Analysis of the pain scores revealed the presence of statistically different sub-groups: non-pain developers, subclinical pain developers and pain developers. Reassessing the effectiveness of each chair condition in light of these groups revealed that pain developers demonstrated a clear intolerance for the seat pan tilt configuration. In the third study, brief walking breaks of self-selected intensity had no effect on most biomechanical factors with the exception of reduced seat pressure and seat pressure area. The walking breaks were able to provide a significant, but short-lived, reduction in perceived pain, however, they were not able to reduce the level of perceived pain that develops by the end of a two-hour exposure to prolonged sitting. Similar to the walking breaks examined in Study 3; lumbar spine manipulation does not appear to effect postures or ultimate perceived pain levels during prolonged sitting. However, the results from Study 4 show an immediate reduction in perceived pain following both the manipulation and control maneuvers and a significant reduction in muscle activity following spine manipulation. Conclusions: Both posture and movement interventions are important to consider when addressing the issue of low back pain associated with sitting. However, it does appear that altering seated <b>posture</b> through <b>chair</b> design features alone is not enough to solve this problem. Indeed, while features such as lumbar supports and forward seat pan tilt have been shown reduce the flexion of the low back and pelvis, there is the potential for these features to add to the problem as opposed to reducing it. Specifically, forward seat pan tilt without appropriate back support will likely increase pain in a portion of the population. Movement interventions appear to be more promising in solving this problem, however, the ratio of work/break and intensity, frequency and duration parameters need to be explored further. Brief walking breaks at 40 -minute intervals can provide significant immediate relief of sitting associated back pain, however, this intervention is not able to alter biomechanical parameters or ultimate perceived pain in prolonged sitting. Similarly, there is evidence that lumbar spine manipulation may provide short term relief from sitting induced pain as well as reduced muscle activity in sitting, but future work needs to determine the implication of reduced muscle activation as well as the intervention dosage required to obtain longer lasting relief from pain...|$|R
