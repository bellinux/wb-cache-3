25|$|With {{the death}} of Mr. Huntley, in 1885, Mrs. Huntley's {{independent}} literary life began, first as a political news writer from Dakota Territory to the Saint Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis dailies, next as editor and humorous <b>paragrapher</b> on the (now Minneapolis Star-Tribune, which was resigned for a similar position on the The Washington Post in 1890, where remained for a year, having charge of a woman's page and regular editorial and humorous paragraphs. This, in turn, was abandoned for independent work, which included a Congressional news bureau for the The Hutchinson News in Hutchinson, Kansas; short stories for the National Tribune at Washington, D.C.; Capitol gossip for New York City and Chicago papers; and tariff papers for The Economist. She was {{the editor of the}} Iowa City Republican in 1901. Pugh published two original Spoopendyke papers.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, De Casseres {{started working}} as an {{assistant}} to Charles Emory Smith, editor of the Philadelphia Press, for $4 per week. At the Press, De Casseres rose from his position {{as an assistant to}} become a [...] "copy boy," [...] editorial <b>paragrapher,</b> dramatic critic, proofreader, and (briefly) city editor. During his ten years at the press, De Casseres had a few publications, including one of his first signed editorials, an article that appeared in Belford's Magazine praising Thomas Brackett Reed.|$|E

5000|$|New York's 21 Club has two claims {{associated}} with it. One {{is that it}} was invented in the 1930s by a bartender named Henry Zbikiewicz, who was charged with mixing Bloody Marys. Another attributes its invention to the comedian George Jessel, who frequented the 21 Club. In 1939, Lucius Beebe printed in his gossip column This New York one of the earliest U.S. references to this drink, along with the original recipe: [...] "George Jessel's newest pick-me-up which is receiving attention from the town's <b>paragraphers</b> is called a Bloody Mary: half tomato juice, half vodka".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, I do," [...] Miss Penny replied. She looked sharply round the restaurant. [...] "I must just see if there are any of those horrible little gossip <b>paragraphers</b> here to-day. One doesn't want to figure in the social and {{personal}} column to-morrow morning: 'A fact which is not so generally known as it ought to be is, that Miss Penny, the well-known woman journalist, always ends her luncheon with a six-inch Burma cheroot. I saw her yesterday in a restaurant--not a hundred miles from Carmelite Street--smoking like a house on fire.' You know the touch. But the coast seems to be clear, thank goodness." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{grim and}} ghastly humor -- the humor that is {{born of a}} pathetic {{philosophy}} -- which now and then strikes me in reading the bright and keen-witted work of our American <b>paragraphers.</b> It is a humor that may be crystallized by hunger and sorrow and tears. It is not found elsewhere {{as it is in}} America. It {{is out of the question}} in England, because an Englishman cannot poke fun at himself. He cannot joke about an empty flour-barrel. We can: especially if by doing it we may swap the joke for another barrel of flour. We can never be a nation of snobs so long as we are willing to poke fun at ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|Hugh {{was indeed}} greatly troubled. He began to dislike and suspect Douglass. They had been antipathetic from the start, and no advance on the author's part {{could bring the}} manager nearer. It was indeed true that the young playwright was {{becoming}} a marked figure on the street, and the <b>paragrapher</b> of The Saucy Swells spoke of him not too obscurely as the lucky winner of [...] "our modern Helen," [...] which was considered a smart allusion. This paragraph was copied by the leading paper of his native city, and his father wrote {{to know if it}} were really true {{that he was about to}} marry a play-actress.|$|E
60|$|The {{experience}} of Florindo and Lindora is easily parallelable in that of innumerable other married pairs of American race, {{who were the}} primitive joke of the <b>paragrapher</b> and the caricaturist when the day of farm-boarding began. Though the sun of that day has long set for Florindo and Lindora, {{it seems to be}} still at the zenith for most young couples beginning life on their forgotten terms, and the joke holds in its pristine freshness with the lowlier satirists, who hunt the city boarder in the country and the seaside boarding-houses. The Florindos and the Lindoras of a little greater age and better fortune abound in the summer hotels at the beaches and in the mountains, though at the more worldly watering-places the cottagers have killed off the hotels, as the graphic parlance has it. The hotels nowhere, perhaps, flourish in their old vigor; except for a brief six weeks, when they are fairly full, they languish along the rivers, among the hills, and even by the shores of the mournful and misty Atlantic.|$|E
60|$|I {{would not}} have the young author, from this {{imaginary}} case; believe that it is well either to court or to defy the good opinion of the press. In fact, it will not only be better taste, but it will be better business, for him to keep it altogether out of his mind. There is only one whom he can safely try to please, and that is himself. If he does this he will very probably please other people; but if he does not please himself he may be sure that he will not please them; the book which he has not enjoyed writing no one will enjoy reading. Still, I {{would not have}} him attach too little consequence to the influence of the press. I should say, let him take the celebrity it gives him gratefully but not too seriously; let him reflect that he is often the necessity rather than the ideal of the <b>paragrapher,</b> and that the notoriety the journalists bestow upon him is not the measure of their acquaintance with his work, far less his meaning. They are good fellows, those hard-pushed, poor fellows of the press, but the very conditions of their censure, friendly or unfriendly, forbid it thoroughness, and it must often have more zeal than knowledge in it.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hardly}} {{necessary}} {{to say that}} the memorial tribute of Squire Adams was increased tenfold by the judges, inspectors, and clerks, and that the old man tottered back to Mammy, considerably heavier than he came. As both of the rival candidates were equally sure of his vote, and each had called upon him and offered a conveyance, it is but fair to presume they were equally beneficent. But Daddy insisted upon walking to the polls,--a distance of two miles,--as a moral example, and a text for the California <b>paragraphers,</b> who hastened to record that such was the influence of the foot-hill climate, that [...] "a citizen of Rough-and-Ready, aged eighty-four, rose at six o'clock, and, after milking two cows, walked a distance of twelve miles to the polls, and returned in time to chop a cord of wood before dinner." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though Century {{magazine}} published her poem, [...] "With a Copy of Shelley," [...] in 1889, {{she became}} disillusioned by the limited earnings available for poets, saying: [...] "The minor painter or sculptor was honored with large annual awards in our greatest cities, while the minor poet {{was a joke}} of the <b>paragraphers,</b> subject to the popular prejudice that his art thrived best on starvation in a garret." [...] She became a freelance correspondent to the Chicago Tribune, and was commissioned to write a commemorative ode for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. Her financial hardships were alleviated after she sued the New York World for publishing the poem without her consent and she was awarded $5,000 dollars in a settlement.With help from publisher Hobart Chatfield-Taylor, Monroe convinced one hundred prominent Chicago business leaders to sponsor the magazine Poetry by each committing to fifty dollars {{a year for a}} five-year subscription. The $5,000, coupled with her own settlement, was enough to launch the magazine on September 23, 1912, while upholding its promise to contributors of adequate payment for all published work. Monroe was editor for its first two years without salary, while simultaneously working as an art critic for the Chicago Tribune. By 1914, the magazine work became too much for her to accomplish while working other jobs, so she resigned from the Chicago Tribune and accepted a salary of fifty dollars per month from the magazine. For more than ten years she maintained herself on this stipend, raising it to one hundred dollars per month in 1925.|$|R
6000|$|There {{he stood}} in his wide-awake hat and his long black coat, his {{shoulders}} slightly bent with his fifty-eight years. Anyone who had known him in the olden days on his bush farm beside Tomlinson's Creek {{in the country of}} the Great Lakes would have recognized him in a moment. There was still on his face that strange, puzzled look that it habitually wore, only now, of course, the financial papers were calling it [...] "unfathomable." [...] There was a certain way in which his eye roved to and fro inquiringly that might have looked like perplexity, were it not that the Financial Undertone had recognized it as the [...] "searching look of a captain of industry." [...] One might have thought that for all the goodness in it there was something simple in his face, were it not that the Commercial and Pictorial Review had called the face [...] "inscrutable," [...] and had proved it so with an illustration that left no doubt of the matter. Indeed, the face of Tomlinson of Tomlinson's Creek, now Tomlinson the Wizard of Finance, was not commonly spoken of as a face by the <b>paragraphers</b> of the Saturday magazine sections, but was more usually referred to as a mask; and it would appear that Napoleon the First had had one also. The Saturday editors were never tired of describing the strange, impressive personality of Tomlinson, the great dominating character of the newest and highest finance. From the moment when the interim prospectus of the Erie Auriferous Consolidated had broken like a tidal wave over Stock Exchange circles, the picture of Tomlinson, the sleeping shareholder of uncomputed millions, had filled the imagination of every dreamer in a nation of poets.|$|R
60|$|It was {{his great}} fortune {{to have been}} mostly misunderstood, and to have reached the dense {{intelligence}} of his fellow-men after a whole lifetime of perfectly simple and lucid appeal, and his countenance expressed the patience and forbearance of a wise man content to bide his time. It {{would be hard to}} persuade people now that Emerson once represented to the popular mind all that was most hopelessly impossible, and that in a certain sort he was a national joke, the type of the incomprehensible, the byword of the poor <b>paragrapher.</b> He had perhaps disabused the community somewhat by presenting himself here and there as a lecturer, and talking face to face with men in terms which they could not refuse to find as clear as they were wise; he was more and more read, by certain persons, here and there; but we are still so far behind him in the reach of his far-thinking that it need not be matter of wonder that twenty years before his death he was the most misunderstood man in America. Yet in that twilight where he dwelt he loomed large upon the imagination; the minds that could not conceive him were still aware of his greatness. I myself had not read much of him, but I knew the essays he was printing in the Atlantic, and I knew certain of his poems, though by no means many; yet I had this sense of him, that he was somehow, beyond and above my ken, a presence of force and beauty and wisdom, uncompanioned in our literature. He had lately stooped from his ethereal heights {{to take part in the}} battle of humanity, and I suppose that if the truth were told he was more to my young fervor because he had said that John Brown had made the gallows glorious like the cross, than because he had uttered all those truer and wiser things which will still a hundred years hence be leading the thought of the world.|$|E
60|$|I {{hope that}} I {{have not been}} hinting that the author who {{approaches}} literature through journalism is not as fine and high a literary man as the author who comes directly to it, or through some other avenue; I have not the least notion of condemning myself by any such judgment. But I think it is pretty certain that fewer and fewer authors are turning from journalism to literature, though the 'entente cordiale' between the two professions seems as great as ever. I fancy, though I may be as mistaken in this as I am in a good many other things, that most journalists would have been literary men if they could, at the beginning, and that the kindness they almost always show to young authors is an effect of the self-pity they feel for their own thwarted wish to be authors. When an author is once warm in the saddle, and is riding his winged horse to glory, the case is different: they have then often no sentiment about him; {{he is no longer}} the image of their own young aspiration, and they would willingly see Pegasus buck under him, or have him otherwise brought to grief and shame. They are apt to gird at him for his unhallowed gains, and they would be quite right in this if they proposed any way for him to live without them; as I have allowed at the outset, the gains are unhallowed. Apparently it is unseemly for two or three authors to be making half as much by their pens as popular ministers often receive in salary; the public is used to the pecuniary prosperity of some of the clergy, and at least sees nothing droll in it; but the <b>paragrapher</b> can always get a smile out of his readers at the gross disparity between the ten thousand dollars Jones gets for his novel and the five pounds Milton got for his epic. I have always thought Milton was paid too little, but I will own that he ought not to have been paid at all, if it comes to that. Again I say that no man ought to live by any art; it is a shame to the art if not to the artist; but as yet there is no means of the artist's living otherwise and continuing an artist.|$|E
6000|$|Loyalty, like so {{many other}} things in England, is a {{convention}} to which the alien will tacitly conform in the measure of his good taste or his good sense. It is not his affair, and in the mean time it is a most curious and interesting spectacle; but it is not more remarkable, perhaps, than the perfect acquiescence in the aristocratic forms of society which hedge the King with their divinity. We think that family counts for much with ourselves, in New England or in Virginia; but it counts for nothing at all in comparison with the face value at which it is current in England. We think we are subject to our plutocracy, when we are very much out of humor or out of heart, in some such measure as the commoners of England are subject to the aristocracy; but that is nonsense. A very rich man with us is all the more ridiculous for his more millions; he becomes a byword if not a hissing; he is the meat of the <b>paragrapher,</b> the awful example of the preacher; his money is found to smell of his methods. But in England, the greater a nobleman is, the greater his honor. The American mother who imagines marrying her daughter to an English duke, cannot even imagine an English duke--say, like him of Devonshire, or him of Northumberland, or him of Norfolk--with the social power and state which wait upon him in his duchy and in the whole realm; and so is it in degree down to the latest and lowest of the baronets, and of those yet humbler men who have been knighted for their merits and services in medicine, in literature, in art. The greater and greatest nobles are established in a fear which is very like what the fear of God used to be when the common people feared Him; and, though they are potent political magnates, they mainly rule as the King himself does, through the secular reverence of those beneath them for their titles and the visible images of their state. They are wealthy men, of course, with so much substance that, when one now and then attempts to waste it, he can hardly do so; but their wealth alone would not establish them in the popular regard. His wealth does no such effect for Mr. Astor in England; and mere money, though it is much desired by all, is no more venerated in the person of its possessor than it is with us. It is ancestry, it is the uncontested primacy of families first in their place, time out of mind, that lays its resistless hold upon the fancy and bows the spirit before it. By means of this comes the sovereign effect in the political as well as the social state; for, though the people vote into or out of power those who vote other people into or out of the administration, it is always--or so nearly always that the exception proves the rule--family that rules, from the King down to the least attaché of the most unimportant embassy. No doubt many of the English are restive under the fact; and, if one had asked their mind about it, one might have found them frank enough; but, never asking it, it was with amusement that I heard said once, as if such a thing had never occurred to anybody before, [...] "Yes, isn't it strange that those few families should keep it all among themselves!" [...] It was a slender female voice, lifted by a young girl with an air of pensive surprise, as at a curious usage of some realm of faery.|$|E
6000|$|Here is [...] "another way," [...] as the cookery {{books have}} it. In your {{gratitude}} to your first publisher, covenant {{with him to}} let him have all the cheap editions of all your novels {{for the next five}} years, at his own terms. If, in spite of the advice I have given you, you somehow manage to succeed, to become wildly popular, you will still have reserved to yourself, by this ingenious clause, a chance of ineffable pecuniary failure. A plan generally approved of is to sell your entire copyright in your book for a very small sum. You want the ready money, and perhaps you are not very hopeful. But, when your book is in all men's hands, when you are daily reviled by the small fry of <b>paragraphers,</b> when the publisher is clearing a thousand a year by it, while you only got a hundred down, then you will thank me, and will acknowledge that, in spite of apparent success, you are a failure after all. There are publishers, however, so inconsiderate that they will not leave you even this consolation. Finding that the book they bought cheap is really valuable, they will insist on sharing the profits with the author, or on making him great presents of money to which he has no legal claim. Some persons, some authors, cannot fail if they would, so wayward is fortune, and such a Quixotic idea of honesty have some middlemen of literature. But, of course, you may light on a publisher who will not give you more than you covenanted for, and then you can go about denouncing the whole profession as a congregation of robbers and clerks of St. Nicholas.|$|R
