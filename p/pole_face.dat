25|$|Electric {{machines}} come in {{two basic}} magnet field pole configurations: salient-pole machine and nonsalient-pole machine. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the <b>pole</b> <b>face.</b> In the nonsalient-pole, or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> slots. A shaded-pole motor has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding {{in the field}} <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E
5000|$|Figure D. shows field flux and {{armature}} flux being about equal. The {{result is that}} the center of flux in the gap between the <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate and the armature has shifted. For a more detailed dawing, see Richardson. [...] Figure E. shows compensation wires in the field <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate that are carrying current opposed to the current in the armature wire adjacent to the gap. The flux in the gap has been restored to the same condition as the case where there is no {{armature flux}}. Even though the armature wires are next to wires carrying current in the opposite direction, the wires of the armature still experience magnetic force from interaction with the field flux.|$|E
50|$|The {{armature}} may be {{a permanent}} magnet, {{in which case the}} coil or coils can exert both repulsive and attractive force on the armature. If there are two coils, they will be wound and connected so that their like <b>poles</b> <b>face</b> each other, so that when (for example) the <b>poles</b> <b>facing</b> the armature are both negative, one pole will attract the armature's south pole while the other will repel its north pole. When the armature reaches the extreme of its movement, polarity to the coils is reversed.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly {{the motor}} {{can be made}} to have a very small outside diameter, but instead the <b>pole</b> <b>faces</b> are {{stretched}} lengthwise so the motor can still have very high torque while fitting in a small diameter space.|$|R
50|$|A {{linear motor}} is {{functionally}} {{the same as}} a rotary electric motor with the rotor and stator circular magnetic field components laid out in a straight line. Where a rotary motor would spin around and re-use the same magnetic <b>pole</b> <b>faces</b> again, the magnetic field structures of a linear motor are physically repeated across the length of the actuator.|$|R
50|$|Ernest Lawrence's first {{cyclotron}} {{was a mere}} 4 inches (100 mm) in diameter. Later, in 1939, {{he built}} a machine with a 60-inch diameter <b>pole</b> <b>face,</b> and planned one with a 184-inch diameter in 1942, which was, however, taken over for World War II-related work connected with uranium isotope separation; after the war it continued in service for research and medicine over many years.|$|E
50|$|Figure A. shows a {{cross-sectional}} {{view of a}} two pole DC shunt motor. Armature windings (A), field windings (F) and compensation windings (C) use the dot and cross convention where a circle with a dot is a wire carrying current out of the figure and a circle with a cross is a wire carrying current into the page. For each wire in the armature that is next to the field <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> plate there is a wire in the face plate carrying current in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|An unusual, adjustable-speed, low-torque {{shaded-pole}} motor {{could be found}} in traffic-light and advertising-lighting controllers.The pole faces were parallel and relatively close to each other, with the disc centred between them, something like the disc in a watthour meter. Each <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> was split, and had a shading coil on one part; the shading coils were on the parts that faced each other. Both shading coils were probably closer to the main coil; they could have both been farther away, without affecting the operating principle, just the direction of rotation.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} find out if there is any {{deformation}} of the PS-magnets due to the strong attracting magnetic force between the <b>pole</b> <b>faces</b> and to estimate how much this deformation could be, a series of inclination measurements was taken on the PS-main magnets near the extraction areas.

50|$|In certain smaller {{single-phase}} motors, starting is done {{by means}} of a shaded pole with a copper wire turn around part of the pole. The current induced in this turn lags behind the supply current, creating a delayed magnetic field around the shaded part of the <b>pole</b> <b>face.</b> This imparts sufficient rotational field energy to start the motor. These motors are typically used in applications such as desk fans and record players, as the required starting torque is low, and the low efficiency is tolerable relative to the reduced cost of the motor and starting method compared to other AC motor designs.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{single-phase}} motor is the {{shaded-pole motor}} {{and is used}} in devices requiring low starting torque, such as electric fans, small pumps, or small household appliances. In this motor, small single-turn copper [...] "shading coils" [...] create the moving magnetic field. Part of each pole is encircled by a copper coil or strap; the induced current in the strap opposes the change of flux through the coil. This causes a time lag in the flux passing through the shading coil, so that the maximum field intensity moves higher across the <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> on each cycle. This produces a low level rotating magnetic field which {{is large enough to}} turn both the rotor and its attached load. As the rotor picks up speed the torque builds up to its full level as the principal magnetic field is rotating relative to the rotating rotor.|$|E
50|$|To be able {{to exert}} torques on the {{microbeads}} at least two magnets are necessary, but many other configurations have been realized, reaching from only one magnet that only pulls the magnetic microbeads {{to a system of}} six electromagnets that allows fully controlling the 3-dimensional position and rotation via a digital feedback loop. The magnetic field strength decreases roughly exponentially with the distance from the axis linking the two magnets on a typical scale of about the width of the gap between the magnets. Since this scale is rather large in comparison to the distances, when the microbead moves in an experiment, the force acting on it may be treated as constant. Therefore, magnetic tweezers are passive force clamps {{due to the nature of}} their construction in contrast to optical tweezers, although they may be used as positive clamps, too, when combined with a feedback loop. The field strength may be increased by sharpening the <b>pole</b> <b>face</b> of the magnet which, however, also diminishes the area where the field may be considered as constant. An iron ring connection the outer poles of the magnets may help to reduce stray fields. Magnetic tweezers can be operated with both, permanent magnets and electromagnets. The two techniques have their specific advantages.|$|E

The unique field contours of this recording head with Alfesil <b>pole</b> <b>faces</b> are analyzed {{in relation to the}} recording of very short wavelengths. The field gradients of the unloaded head are computed for various conditions such as maximum magnetization depths, positions in the tape coating, and gap lengths. Comparison of the driven-gap-spacer head using Alfesil <b>pole</b> <b>faces</b> with the ferrite driven-gap-spacer head and the conventional ring-core head shows the Alfesil type to be the most effective for a-c bias VHF recording at very short wavelengths. Problems associated with short-wavelength recording and reproduction are reviewed. In spite of good short-wavelengths capabilities of the Alfesil head, the requirement for a high head-to-tape speed continues to be mandatory to minimize wavelength reproduction losses...|$|R
5000|$|A shim is {{a device}} used {{to adjust the}} {{homogeneity}} of a magnetic field. Shims received their name from the purely mechanical shims used to adjust position and parallelity of the <b>pole</b> <b>faces</b> of an electromagnet.

50|$|Magnetic {{materials}} and systems {{are able to}} attract or press each other apart or together with a force dependent on the magnetic field and {{the area of the}} magnets. For example, the simplest example of lift would be a simple dipole magnet positioned in the magnetic fields of another dipole magnet, oriented with like <b>poles</b> <b>facing</b> each other, so that the force between magnets repels the two magnets.|$|R

40|$|The power {{supplies}} of the <b>Pole</b> <b>Face</b> Windings of the PS are nowadays precise enough to control in a reproducible way the working point at low energy, {{instead of the}} dedicated quadrupoles, currently used during normal operation. The five PFW circuits, independently powered, allow the control, within certain limits, of both the horizontal and vertical tune and chomaticity. In addition the PS-LIU project foresees an increase of the PS injection energy, resulting in rms currents in the low energy quadrupoles that may go beyond todays limits, requiring possibly a replacement by a new design. In case the PFWs {{can be used to}} control the working point this replacement might not be required.

40|$|Computer Aided Optimum Design (CAOD) is {{employed}} in this dissertation to obtain optimum designs of some electromagnetic devices {{to satisfy the}} given performances. Real world problems are 2 ̆ 2 inverse problems 2 ̆ 2 in which {{a part of the}} device is unknown. In inverse problems, the performance of the device is given and the unknown part has to be identified. Inverse Problem Methodology (IPM), which is a CAOD technique, is a formal approach to solve inverse problems. In this approach, the device is described by variables; an object function is defined {{in such a way that}} the given performance is satisfied by the optimum design at the optimum point of the function. The optimum values of the variables have to be determined by optimizing the function. In the GIPM, gradient-based optimization techniques are combined with the Computer Aided Analysis (CAD) techniques. To obtain optimum designs of a capacitive transducer and an electromagnetic circuit, and to identify the dimensions of an electrostatic source, the optimization process was employed at multi-levels. The multi-level techniques are required to overcome the difficulties arose in identifying all the variables at the same time. The object functions corresponding to the transducer and the identification problem have several local minima and a narrow valley respectively. In this dissertation, Powell 2 ̆ 7 s conjugate directions method is modified and employed to find the global minima. The GIPM is applied first time to miniaturize a MOSFET device to avoid breakdown due to high electric fields.
