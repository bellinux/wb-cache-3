40|$|Abstract Background Growing {{levels of}} both obesity and chronic {{disease in the}} general {{population}} pose a major public health problem. In the UK, an innovative 'health and weight' cohort trials facility, the 'South Yorkshire Cohort', is being built in order to provide robust evidence to inform policy, commissioning and clinical decisions in this field. This protocol reports the design of the facility and outlines the recruitment phase methods. Method/Design The South Yorkshire Cohort health and weight study uses the cohort multiple randomised controlled trial design. This design recruits a large observational cohort of patients with the condition(s) of interest which then provides a facility for multiple randomised controlled trials (with large representative samples of participants, long term outcomes as standard, increased comparability between each trial conducted within the cohort and increased efficiency particularly for trials of expensive interventions) as well as ongoing information as to the natural history of the condition and treatment as usual. This study aims to recruit 20, 000 participants to the population based South Yorkshire Cohort health and weight research trials facility. <b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> <b>by</b> invitation letters from their General Practitioners. Data is collected using postal and/or online patient self completed Health Questionnaires. NHS numbers will be used to facilitate record linkage and access to routine data. <b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> eligible if they are: aged 16 - 85 years, registered with one of 40 practices in South Yorkshire, provide consent for further contact from the researchers and to have their information used to look at the benefit of health treatments. The first wave of data is being collected during 2010 / 12 and further waves are planned at 2 - 5 year intervals for the planned 20 year duration of the facility. Discussion The South Yorkshire Cohort combines the strengths of the standard observational, longitudinal cohort study design with a population based cohort facility for multiple randomised controlled trials in a range of long term health and weight related conditions (including obesity). This infrastructure will allow the rapid and cheap identification and recruitment of patients, and facilitate the provision of robust evidence to inform the management and self-management of health and weight. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{cross-sectional}} study compares {{the relationship of}} visceral and total abdominal adipose tissue (VAT and TAAT) measurements obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{and a range of}} 'simpler' techniques suitable for field or bedside use: BMI, waist circumference (WC), bioelectrical impedance (BIA) devices and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). METHOD: 120 <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited,</b> stratified <b>by</b> gender and BMI (20 men and 20 women within each group: lean, overweight and obese). Measurements included height, weight, WC (at midpoint), DXA L 2 -L 4 fat, and BIA (two whole-body and one abdominal device). MRI was used as the reference. RESULTS: MRI data showed that men have more VAT than women, (mean 147 vs. 93 cm(2)) despite less TAAT (362 vs. 405 cm(2)). Correlations of simpler abdominal fat measures showed significantly higher correlations with TAAT than with VAT in men and women. Similarly, trunk and whole-body fat measures were significantly more strongly correlated with TAAT than with VAT. CONCLUSION: None of the simpler techniques show strong correlations with VAT measured by MRI, but WC, abdominal BIA 'visceral fat level' and DXA L 2 -L 4 fat all show similar and strong correlations with TAAT and may be useful in large scale surveys...|$|R

30|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{to the knowledge}} elicitation that may arise in the E-lab and similar methodologies {{are connected to the}} «groupthink» phenomenon, i.e., a situation where ‘loyalty requires each member to avoid raising controversial issues’ [14, p. 12]. Some deem groupthink no better than a myth, others deem it a brilliant construct [15]. Thus, the composition of the expert group and its ways of communication are extremely important, since the output depends on the range of perspectives, knowledge and experiences and is vulnerable to one-eyed views. When an expert group work together and is too homogeneous, either by which stakeholder segment the <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> from or <b>by</b> professional education and training, they may end up as «thinking as one». This may result in constricted ideas and perspectives, not in an open debate on key assumptions, trends or possibilities (e.g., wild cards), etc. Surely, such a perverted atmosphere detracts from what can be deemed a novel output from an expert group exercise. Arguably, the E-lab helps avoid such fallacies.|$|R

AB- 140 "visceral fat level" showed significantly stronger correlations with MRI TAAT area than with MRI VAT area (r = 0. 94 vs. 0. 65 in men and 0. 92 vs. 0. 64 in women). AB- 140 WC showed good correlation with manual WC measurements (r = 0. 95 in men and 0. 90 in women).

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{provides a}} brief introduction to opt-in online panels {{and offers a}} comprehensive list of procedural principles that can help to improve data quality. The guidelines are organized according to the topics of recruitment, survey instrument quality, identifying careless responses, minimizing dropouts, and preparation for post-survey procedures. Amid the continued expansion of Internet access, strong demand for consumer data in commercial market research, the relatively low costs of Internet-based research, and declining response rates of more traditional phone-based survey research (Pew Research Center, 2012), the use of online surveys/experiments has become popular over {{the last fifteen years}} (Baker et al., 2010). However, although online surveys function as a powerful research tool, they are replete with methodological challenges. In particular, many online surveys/experiments that use volunteer, “opt-in panels ” face unique hurdles compared to more traditional probability-based samples and the convenience samples of a university laboratory setting. Opt-in panels consist of individuals who are willing to join a pool of online survey participants, usually in return for compensation like reward points, coupons, being entered in a drawing, or cash. Such <b>participants</b> might <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> <b>by</b> a banner ad on a website, direct mail, email (Baker et al., 2010), or by word of mouth. Companies that provide opt-in online panels include Qualtrics Panels, Survey Sampling International (SSI), Toluna (formerly Greenfield), and uSamp. There are also a few companies that use variations on opt-in panels. For example, YouGov (formerly Polimetrix) offers what it calls a “matched sample, ” using census data to guide the selection of participants from a large opt-in panel, and constructing weights that the company claims can be used to approximate a representative sample (Rivers, & Bailey, 2009) ...|$|R

They did not feel it was relevant to their work given limited evidence of its effectiveness, and because they were not engaged in its implementation. Organizations provided little support for implementation, training, monitoring and feedback, which are needed to overcome these, and other individual and team factors that challenged SSC adherence. Responses <b>were</b> similar across <b>participants</b> with different characteristics. Multiple processes and factors influenced SSC adherence. This may explain why, in studies evaluating SSC impact, outcomes were variable. Recommendations included continuing education, time for pilot-testing, and engaging all staff in SSC review. Others may use the implementation fidelity framework to plan SSC implementation or evaluate SSC adherence. Further research is needed to establish which SSC components can be modified without compromising its effectiveness...|$|R
