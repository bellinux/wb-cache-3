40|$|Establishment {{of a test}} {{facility}} and associated 11 -in. -diameter motor for hybrid propulsion technology development at NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center is discussed in this paper. Results of twenty 11 -in. -diameter motor tests with a UTF- 29901 (60 percent <b>polycyclopentadiene,</b> 40 percent hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) /gaseous oxygen propellant system are presented. Tests at this scale have developed fuel regression correlations for comparison with results of yet-to-be-completed, 24 -in. -diameter motor tests; demonstrated combustion efficiency levels in the 95 percent range for both single- and multiple-port grain configurations; have shown smooth and stable throttling characteristics over flight-type throttle ranges; and have begun to establish criteria for stable combustion in hybrid motors. The testing of 24 -in. motors has not as yet been initiated and is not addressed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{offshore}} industry polymer coatings {{are widely used}} to ensure thermal insulation of steel pipes, and to avoid over-cooling of the hot oil inside. Because of very severe service conditions (i. e. high temperature, high pressure and presence of seawater) and an expected life time of 20 years, durability of these coatings is a major issue for this industry. Polypropylene and polyurethane are often used for this application, nevertheless these polymers have some limitations in terms of processing time for polypropylene and maximum service temperature for polyurethane. <b>Polycyclopentadiene</b> (pDCPD) shows good processing characteristics and low thermal conductivity, so this polymer {{could be a good}} alternative coating in {{the offshore}} industry, but the durability of this polymer under offshore conditions is unknown. This paper present results from an accelerated ageing study of pDCPD in sea water at temperatures from 90 °C to 180 °C for 18 months. Polymer evolution during ageing is characterized using both mechanical (tensile test and DMA) and chemical (FTIR, NMR) analyses. For ageing at temperatures below Tg (i. e. 155 °C) the only degradation mechanism is oxidation, whereas for ageing temperatures above Tg secondary polymerization process of the material is observed...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{theoretical}} evidence illustrating that cyano derivatives of conducting polymers such as polythiophene, <b>polycyclopentadiene</b> and polyfulvene have smaller intrinsic band gaps than their parent polymers. The geometric and electronic {{properties of the}} parent and the derivative polymers are studied {{with the use of}} two methodologies: (1) the pseudo one-dimensional band structure calculations performed {{at the level of the}} semiempirical molecular orbital theory (Modified Neglect of Diatomic Overlap (MNDO) and Austin Model 1 (AM 1)) and (2) oligomer calculations performed at the level of the ab initio molecular orbital theory. In particular, we have found that an organic polymer, poly-(dicyano-methylene-cyclopenta-difulvene) (PCNFv) has a comparable (possibly lower) band gap to the one observed in poly-(dicyano-methylene-cyclopenta-dithiophene) (PCNTH) (which has a band gap of 0. 8 eV). The precursor of PCNFv is poly-(dicyano-methylene-cyclopenta-dicyclopentadiene) (PCNCY) in which two cyclopentadiene rings are connected by a dicyanomethylene group. Trends in structural properties indicate that the lower band gap in the cyano substituted polymers is accompanied by greater charge delocalization in the aromatic or trans-cisoid forms and by greater charge localization in the quinoid or cis-transoid forms in comparison to their parent polymers. Other important factors that contribute to band gap lowering are maximum planarity, weak interactions of the chain backbone with the bridging groups, enhanced π character of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied bands and the additional stabilization of the conduction bands due to the charge transfer phenomena. The comparison of the heats of formation for the compounds indicates that polymers in planar-anti conformation are more stable than those in twisted-syn conformation...|$|E
40|$|In 1970, {{solid phase}} direct fluorination, using modern flow control techniques, was pioneered in the {{laboratories}} of John Margrave. Modern direct fluorination {{is rooted in}} these developments. The direct fluorination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pyrene, coronene, perylene, etc [...] .) and several commercially available polymeric materials (polyethylene, poly (vinyl fluoride), poly (vinyl chloride), and polystyrene) are here reexamined. The previously unreported direct fluorination of the new polymer, <b>polycyclopentadiene,</b> has been carried out. The direct fluorination of the natural materials; coal and gilsonite; along with man-made petroleum coke affords a rapid, direct synthesis of potentially useful perfluorocarbon compound mixtures. The tentatively successful exhaustive fluorination of these starting compounds {{have been carried out}} using longer reaction times, and heated reaction vessels. By using extensive mass spectral, FT-IR, and differential scanning calorimetry data, a more complete description of the course of polymer fluorination is made possible. The vacuum pyrolysis mass spectra of polymers of varying fluorine contents are now reported. Several characteristic stages of fluorination can be identified. The superior thermal stability of fluorinated polymers is demonstrated using differential scanning calorimetry. DSC curves were secured for polymers in all stages of fluorination and are compared with those of the respective starting materials. Chemical reactions of an active carbon derived "CFX" are here reported. Slurries of the compound were contacted with a variety of nucleophilic reagents, most notably, alcoholic KOH and an assortment of amines. The products were examined using diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), and elemental analysis. The susceptibility of the substance to nucleophilic attack was confirmed. Defluorination and rearomatization were the most readily apparent results. Hydroxy groups were detected in the products of the KOH/ethanol reactions using ESCA...|$|E
