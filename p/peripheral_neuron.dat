Sodium current results from the rapid induction of a novel sodium channel transcript, also found in peripheral neurons, and from the long term induction of brain type II/IIA mRNA. Expression of the type II/IIA sodium channel requires activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase), whereas induction of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuron</b> type sodium channel occurs through an A-kinase-independent signal transduction pathway.

These neurons extend axons through the dorsal roots and collateral branches into the dorsal horn. In contrast, superficial cutaneous innervation is absent.

Here we show that DNA methyltransferase 3 B (DNMT 3 B) is responsible for the loss of competence of dorsal neural tube cells to generate emigrating neural crest cells. DNMT 3 B knockdown results in up-regulation of neural crest markers, prolonged neural crest emigration, and subsequent precocious neuronal differentiation of the trigeminal ganglion. We find that DNMT 3 B binds to the promoter of Sox 10, known to be important for neural crest emigration and lineage acquisition. Bisulfite sequencing further reveals methylation of the Sox 10 promoter region upon cessation of emigration in normal embryos, whereas this mark is reduced after DNMT 3 B loss.

To model viral trafficking in <b>peripheral</b> <b>neurons,</b> we intramuscularly injected mice with poliovirus, which follows a muscle–sciatic nerve–spinal cord– brain route. Only 20 % of the poliovirus population successfully moved from muscle to brain, and three barriers limiting viral trafficking were identified.

Surprisingly, the retrograde axonal transport barrier was equivalent in strength to the IFN barrier. Illustrating the importance of barriers created by the IFN response and inefficient axonal transport, IFN a/b receptor knockout mice with muscle damage permitted 80 % of the viral population to access the brain, and succumbed to disease three times faster than mice with intact barriers.

Constriction-injury-dependent neuropathic pain is abolished when Nav 1. 7 is deleted in sensory neurons, unlike nerve-transection-related pain, which requires the deletion of Nav 1. 7 in sensory and sympathetic neurons for pain relief. Sympathetic sprouting that develops in parallel with nerve-transection pain depends {{on the presence of}} Nav 1. 7 in sympathetic neurons. Mechanical and cold allodynia required distinct sets of neurons and different repertoires of sodium channels depending on the nerve injury model.

Less is known about how initial target contact regulates changes in gene expression associated with these developmental processes. One early consequence of contact between growing sympathetic neurons and their cardiac myocyte targets is the inhibition of neuronal outgrowth. Analysis of neuronal gene expression following this contact revealed coordinate regulation of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -dependent growth pathway in which basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors and downstream neurofilament expression contribute to the growth dynamics of developing sympathetic neurons. BMP 2 had dose-dependent growth-promoting effects on sympathetic neurons cultured in the absence, but not the presence, of myocyte targets, suggesting that target contact alters neuronal responses to BMP signaling. Target contact also induced the expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP), a regulator of BMP function in the vascular system. Increased MGP expression inhibited BMP-dependent neuronal growth and MGP expression increased in sympathetic neurons {{during the period of}} target contact in vivo. These experiments establish MGP as a novel regulator of BMP function in the nervous system, and define developmental transitions in BMP responses during sympathetic development...|$|E

40|$|Alterations in {{sodium channel}} {{expression}} and function {{have been suggested}} as a key molecular event underlying the abnormal processing of pain after peripheral nerve or tissue injury. Although the relative contribution of individual sodium channel subtypes to this process is unclear, the biophysical properties of the tetrodotoxin-resistant current, mediated, at least in part, by the sodium channel PN 3 (SNS), suggests that it may play a specialized, pathophysiological role in the sustained, repetitive firing of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuron</b> after injury. Moreover, {{this hypothesis is supported}} by evidence demonstrating that selective “knock-down” of PN 3 protein in the dorsal root ganglion with specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides prevents hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by either chronic nerve or tissue injury. In contrast, knock-down of NaN/SNS 2 protein, a sodium channel that may be a second possible candidate for the tetrodotoxin-resistant current, appears to have no effect on nerve injury-induced behavioral responses. These data suggest that relief from chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain might be achieved by selective blockade or inhibition of PN 3 expression. In light of the restricted distribution of PN 3 to sensory neurons, such an approach might offer effective pain relief without a significant side-effect liability...|$|E

A hierarchical ramification from the branchial cord into nerve rootlets and subsequently into the small nerve fibres within the demibranch epithelium was evident throughout this organ. In both vis-ceral ganglia and demibranchs, immunoreactivity of serotonin was relatively higher in female than male tissues, suggesting a role of serotonin in female reproductive functions. Administration of sero-tonin to the demibranchs, the sites of larval settlement, stimulated synchronous parturition in a dose-dependent manner.

Moreover, immunohistology confirmed that SKPs could secrete basic FGF and VEGF in the ischemic region and further markedly increase the proliferation of endogenous nestin+ and βIII-tubulin+ neural stem cells.

These data suggest that SKPs induced endogenous neurogenesis and angiogenesis and protected neuron from hypoxic-ischemic environment.

We find that the transplanted ganglia extend numerous axons distributed roughly equally in all directions. When these CNS projections reach and make contact with peripheral sensory axons they are used as guides for <b>peripheral</b> <b>neurons</b> to grow toward and into the ectopic ganglia even when this means following novel pathways that cross the midline and/or segmental boundaries. The peripheral sensory axons turn and grow toward the ectopic ganglia only when in physical contact with CNS axons, suggesting that diffusible chemoattractants are not a factor.

AmphiCoe is expressed in the central nervous system and in a small number of scattered ectodermal cells on the flanks of neurulae stage embryos. These cells become at least largely recessed beneath the ectoderm. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine embryos in which the ectoderm had been partially peeled away. This revealed that these cells have neuronal morphology, and we infer that they are the precursors of epidermal primary sensory neurons.

Its {{incidence}} in France is estimated at 2. 5 per 100, 000 population and its prevalence between 5 and 8 per 100, 000 inhabitants. Good prognostic factors are age of early onset, a longer time to diagnosis, initial damage to the spinal onset, early management of undernutrition and restrictive respiratory failure.

In contrast to inflammatory pain, SNS-PKG 1 -/- mice developed stronger neuropathic hyperalgesia associated with an impairment of nerve regeneration, suggesting specific repair functions of PKG 1. Although PKG 1 accumulated at the site of injury, its activity was lost in the proximal nerve due to a reduction of oxidation-dependent dimerization, which was a consequence of mitochondrial damage in injured axons. In vitro, PKG 1 deficiency or its redox-insensitivity resulted in enhanced outgrowth and reduction of growth cone collapse in response to redox signals, which presented as oxidative hotspots in growing cones. At the molecular level, PKG 1 deficiency caused a depletion of phosphorylated cofilin, which is essential for growth cone collapse and guidance. Hence, redox-mediated guidance required PKG 1 and consequently, its deficiency in vivo resulted in defective repair and enhanced neuropathic pain after nerve injury.
