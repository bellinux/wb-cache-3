40|$|Smart {{materials}} for stress applications are both sought after {{in the industry}} and are also of academic interest. Motivated by the unexpected drastic differences in the cyclic thermomechanical responses between Tg and Tm shape memory polyurethanes (SMPU), we discovered {{a new class of}} polymers known as stress-memory materials. We revealed that stress memory is not guaranteed by the shape-memory effect (SME), but instead manifests itself as a unique behaviour of shape memory polymers (SMPs) possessing the extra characteristic of an enthalpy switch. Stemming from our findings on a rubbery switch, memory stress is realized from the entropic elasticity within rubbery chains of the SMP soft segments. Enthalpy in a Tm-switch, crystal switch, can modulate this entropic energy leading to stress-memory, whereas the Tg-switch is a second-order thermodynamic transition. Thus, a model needs two basic elements: entropy domination for spring elasticity and enthalpy modulation of entropy as a switch for the stress-memory polymer networks. This forms a fundamental platform for materials development in energy, smart devices, artificial muscles, biological and physical <b>massage</b> <b>systems</b> with polymers, and high entropy ceramics and metals.

40|$|The {{development}} process of car seats is very complex and many factors {{have to be}} considered in the development, such as anthropometry, physiology, safety, design and comfort. A factor making it more complex is the fact that future cars should be more sustainable, making the need for weight reduction more prominent. Improving comfort {{and at the same time}} reducing weight is a new challenge. Car seat research in the area of comfort is mainly focused on the decrease of discomfort. The most that can be achieved in this respect is that the person no longer notices the discomfort. Another possibility is to implement physiological knowledge in the seat research process, to increase the comfort and health in such a way that people will notice it. This is the chosen area of research in this PhD thesis. This knowledge can help car and seat manufacturers to address the issue of comfortable and healthy lightweight car seats and to stay ahead of the competition. Possibilities to improve comfort in this way studied in this thesis are a <b>massage</b> <b>system</b> an automatic seat surface adjustment resulting in an optimal pressure distribution, a head rest with special features for the neck, a new lumbar support and a special seat contour developement process.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for car manufacturers is complying with the stringent environmental regulations without compromising driving comfort and pleasure. Reducing the overall weight of a car reduces fuel consumption and increases acceleration. However weight reduction seems in contradiction with another important aspect of car-sales; comfort. In this PhD thesis five experiments are presented proving that weight reduction and comfort improvement can go hand in hand. In these studies specific details for car interior design are described and a conceptual model is created to generalize the outcomes. First the concepts comfort, pleasure and well-being are discussed and a model is created to describe, develop and understand products contributing {{to the well-being of}} humans. This model is illustrated in two studies focusing on improving the driving experience of the driver while reducing the overall weight of the car. In the first study a rather comfortable seat based on the human surface anatomy is developed with a new patented technique using 3 d scanning of the human contour. A seat form following this contour is developed and compared to a traditional seat. Occupants liked the “contour seat”, which was almost half the weight of a normal seat. In the second study an additional experiment was performed. To improve the driving experience, a seat should elicit the same feeling as the car exterior communicates e. g. a seat in a sports car should feel sporty. This study describes the contours of three different car seats objectively and records the corresponding emotional and tactile experiences of people sitting in them. The results show that hard seats with rather high wings in the seat are rated sporty and seats that are softer are rated more luxurious. Three other studies focus on the passenger. The goal of these studies was to make the rear seat more pleasurable without adversely affecting the weight of the car. What people want to do and how they sit during travel and leisure situations was investigated in the first study. Low and medium level activities like watching, talking/discussing and reading were observed the most. The analysis suggests a significant relationship between the activity and the position of the head, trunk and arms during transportation situations. When designing rear seats facilitating low level activities like sleeping and relaxing, adequate support for head and arms is important. For medium level activities the back seats should offer freedom of movement. The next study describes {{the development of a new}} lightweight way of entertaining the passenger in the rear seat. To create a new environment experience the road ahead was projected onto the back of the front seat. A test with a simple prototype showed that driving with road projection was rated more pleasant and the interior was experienced as less confined. However the feeling of safety decreased. In future research an improved, more automotive specific prototype should be tested on various road-conditions, but the results of this first user test are promising. Another innovation which was intended to improve the passengers’ driving experience, was an extension of the current <b>massage</b> <b>system.</b> With this new system the passenger can control a game with his upper body by pressing the shoulder in the back seat. The effects of these movements were compared to normal car activities and a difference in muscle activity and variability were found. It is comparable to moderate intensive activity based on a preliminary heart rate study. The discomfort ratings of all activities are low but subjects felt more challenged during the ride and fitter and more refreshed afterwards only when using the active seating system. Although improvements for the current prototype were discovered during this study the results show that active seating has much potential for improving comfort. Connecting the studies to the conceptual models at the beginning of the thesis leads to the conclusion that, opposed to the more general character of discomfort, comfort is very personal. Hard seats and bad smells are experienced as uncomfortable by most drivers and passengers. However it depends strongly on the personal goals, values, wishes (concerns) etc. of users whether road projection or active seating makes a car comfortable or pleasurable. So, generalisation of this statement is more difficult. Therefore the advice for product design in general and car manufacturers in particular is to look at the human concerns of the target group and try to develop hedonic product attributes to create personal products or systems that can be turned on and off. Another conclusion is that limitations in a design process, such as stringent environmental regulations in the car industry, can also be seen as great triggers for innovation. It is not only challenging for designers, but higher management is often very committed to innovations based on external forces like regulations or better competitive products. This thesis has given examples of design-ideas that can improve the comfort and pleasure experience for drivers and passengers while reducing the weight of the car and therefore contribute to environmental friendlier cars with comfortable car interiors.

40|$|Context:Massage is {{the most}} common {{complementary}} and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy used in hospitals in the United States. As such, it is often the first CAM therapy to be integrated with conventional medicine. However, few academic medical centers have a written standard policy to guide this integration. This lack of standard policy may impede institutions from offering massage therapy as a clinical service, and may put health care professionals and institutions at risk through a failure to clearly address criteria for practice credentials or malpractice liability. Objective: To create a clinical policy for therapeutic massage that may be used as a template for development of policy in academic health centers. Results: We present a clinical policy for therapeutic massage, developed by the University of Michigan Health System, that defines therapeutic massage, provides guidelines for the credentialing and professional conduct of massage therapists, lists indications and contraindications for therapeutic massage, and addresses malpractice in accordance with the specific culture and needs of academic health centers.

The management of dacryocistitis includes nasolacrimal massage and topical broad spectrum antibiotics since chloramfenicol and gentamicin are widely used in regional hospital primary health care in Indonesia, {{the effectiveness of the}} two antibiotics require an assessment. This study was conducted to compare the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of gentamicin and chloramfenicol for infant dacryicistitis to describe the etiologic bacterial and its sensitivity pattern. Design and Method: A randomized control trial study included 46 patients divided equally into two groups. Group K received one drop chloramfenicol six times per day and group G receive one drop gentamicin six times per day. Both of groups received therapy for 14 days. Clinical evaluation was done on week I and week II. Microbiological evaluation was performed before treatment {{and at the end of}} week two. Criteria for clinical recovery were the disappearance of the sign and symptoms of dacryocistitis, while microbiologic recovery ruled out when there is no bacteria find out on secret and lacrimal system. Antibiotics eye drop was applied after digital <b>massage</b> on lacrimal <b>system</b> and clean the secret. Grams staining, bacterial culture and sensitivity test were performed in microbiology laboratory. Result: Clinical and microbiological recovery for chloramfenicol and gentamicin were 43. 5 % (p = 0. 832) and 52. 2 % (p = 0. 670) respectively. The most frequent bacteria on infant dacryocistitis were Staphylococcus aureus (45. 7 %) followed by Pseudomonas (21. 7 %), Enterobacter sp (17. 4 %), Escherichia coli (10. 9 %) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (4. 3 %).

The Baltic eHealth project focuses on telemedicine as a tool for rural development. The purpose of the eRadiology pilot is therefore to test the telemedicine solution between the Funen hospital and the radiological departments of Vilnius University Hospital and East Tallinn Central Hospital. In the pilot, it will be investigated if the solution is technically, financially, culturally and linguistically feasible. "nPatients and Methods: Internet- based health care networks are a step forward compared to first generation health care networks, which has been limited to pushing text - based <b>massages</b> between different <b>systems.</b> An internet- based network can also "pull" data - and not only text but any digital data - for instance images and video sequences. The internet-based networks can fulfil the vision to access to regardless of time and location more effectively. "nResults: The main result of the Baltic eHealth project is the Baltic Health Network (BHN), which connects not only all hospitals in Norway, Sweden and Denmark but also two hospitals in Lithuania and Estonia. This is demonstrated in the project in two pilots. In the eUltrasound pilot the midwives in the rural areas of V&auml;sterbottan County, Sweden, are awaiting the establishment of BHN to get access to second opinions from specialists at National Center for Foetal Medicine at the University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway. In the eRadiology pilot we try to overcome the problem of a lack of radiologists in Denmark, which leads to vacant positions and discomfort to patients as they have to wait months for simple radiological examinations.
