40|$|Emotion {{is now a}} {{consideration}} for industrial design within the health sphere to help speed the recovery of patients. Communication design however, lags behind other design disciplines in this regard. This paper demonstrates the historical reasons for this: That the health and pharmaceutical graphic aesthetic is {{the embodiment of the}} Neue Schweizer Grafik. I will firstly establish that there is a general aesthetic in this genre of graphic design, and secondly that it comes from post-war Switzerland. This mid-century modernist approach to graphics which held designers in thrall into the 1980 s still has a stranglehold in those industries where its aseptic appearance seems to be appropriate: medicine, <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>chemistry.</b> This paper explains some of the flaws in the modernist graphic approach, specifically in its rejection of illustration and humour, and argues for design based on psychology and emotion rather than flawed and outdated manifestos...|$|R

2500|$|As a {{synthetic}} drug, synephrine {{first appeared in}} Europe in the late 1920s, {{under the name of}} Sympatol. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, Sympatol was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, [...] "of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough)." [...] However, synephrine was dropped from the Council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine stated, with reservations, that synephrine was [...] "advertised as an antihistaminic {{to be used in the}} treatment of the common cold...", under the trade name of [...] "Synephrin Tartrate", and indicated that the dose was 100mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the Textbook of Organic Medicinal and <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Chemistry</b> described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was [...] "less effective than epinephrine", and which had been used [...] for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.|$|E

This article describes the exploration of using wiki to promote the study of a degree in Pharmacy, particularly in the area of <b>Pharmaceutical</b> and Organic <b>Chemistry,</b> by creating a collaborative network that encourages group interaction instead of individual achievement. Our initiative is aimed at developing a number of skills and abilities of students and improving their academic performance and their comprehensive training. This work has been carried out with students, who followed <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Chemistries</b> I and II, compulsory courses of the degree in Pharmacy, and it has been extended to other compulsory (Organic Chemistry II) and optional courses (Advanced Chemistry of Drugs), for a total of 200 students. Students have worked in teams on topics related to the subjects above indicated and have used wiki to develop their work. Opinion polls have shown a degree of satisfaction between high and very high in their performance, highlighting the benefits of using wiki in learning.|$|R
