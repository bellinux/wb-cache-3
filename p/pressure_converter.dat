40|$|A sound {{operated}} {{directional control}} valve (SODC-Valve) is proposed which opens and closes {{in response to the}} sound of a specific frequency propagated inside the gas supply tube and therefore needs no electric wiring to convey the control signals. By using multi-frequency sound, several valves can be controlled simultaneously and resultantly the pneumatic multi-degree wearable system can be constructed compactly. Firstly, the sound-gas <b>pressure</b> <b>converter</b> is proposed and improved so that self-excited vibration can be suppressed. Secondly, the basic characteristic of the sound-gas <b>pressure</b> <b>converter</b> is investigated to show that the back pressure is different depending on whether the sound of specific frequency is added or not. Furthermore, a pilot valve is developed. Because the pilot pressure change of the pilot valve developed is only 20 kPa, a main valve is proposed and developed. Finally, a pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable power-assist system is constructed by using a Dry Ice Power Cell as the portable gas supply, wearable actuators developed in the previous study, and two sound operated {{directional control valve}}s developed. Experimental results show that the sound operated directional control valve is feasible and practical in the pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable system...|$|E

40|$|The current {{development}} of solar power converters with air as working fluid focuses mostly on concentrating collectors combined with hot-air engines, and on very low temperature solar tower concepts. Whilst concentrating collectors and Stirling engines need complex technology, solar tower converters have very low efficiencies and require large installations. Pressurized containers as energy converters offer {{the advantage of}} simplicity, but appear {{not to have been}} investigated in detail. In order to assess their performance potential, an idealised thermal <b>pressure</b> <b>converter</b> was analysed theoretically. Two improvements to increase the initially low efficiency derived from theory were found. Neglecting losses, maximum theoretical efficiencies ranged from 6. 7 % for a temperature difference of 60 K to 17. 7 % for a difference of 195 K.

This device is composed of a compressor, an Electro-pneumatic <b>Pressure</b> <b>Converter</b> (EPC) and an Inflatable Textile fabric Pocket (ITP). The later has interesting mechanical properties and is fabricated using Jacquard knitting technique which allows automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving without any mould.

The pressure dynamics inside the ITP are considered by taking into account the air flow rate, variation of the volume of ITP and the length of pneumatic lines joining ITP with compressed air source.

40|$|Further {{exploitation}} of hydroelectric power is one strategy {{that may help}} European Union member states meet targets to increase the proportion of electricity produced by renewable means. Government subsidies and novel technologies are aiding the development of previously uneconomic, very low-head (< 2. 5 m) hydropower sites. Legislation requires that environmental impacts of hydropower development must be assessed and mitigated for. This study incorporated numerical blade strike models (BSMs), open channel flume experiments, and field observations to determine the importance of behaviour when assessing impacts of a novel hydropower device (the Hydrostatic <b>Pressure</b> <b>Converter</b> [HPC]) on downstream moving fish. A Stochastic BSM predicted a lower probability of strike for small fish that travelled downstream faster, and when blades rotated slowly. When empirical data were incorporated into a BSM, predicted probability of strike was in agreement with that observed during a validation test in which freshly euthanised hatchery reared brown trout (Salmo trutta) were recorded passively drifting through a prototype HPC under an experimental setting. Forty-four percent of trout were struck by a blade, of these, 64 % sustained obvious visible physical damage. Behavioural observations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla) suggest that fish will pass through an unscreened HPC. When behavioural parameters (fish velocity, orientation/degree of body contortion) were incorporated into the BSM, probability of strike increased and decreased for trout and eel, respectively, compared with an assumption of passive drift with the flow. Field observations supported the suggestion that salmonid behaviour may increase risk of mortality during passage through small-scale hydropower devices. This study {{highlights the importance of}} considering interspecific variation in behaviour when developing BSMs and conducting Environmental Impact Assessments of hydropower development...|$|E
40|$|Much of the world's {{available}} hydropower potential {{has been}} exploited, {{and within the}} western world attention is increasingly being focussed on hydropower sites with very low head dierences. These are sites where the vertical distance through which water falls is less than ve metres, and remain unexploited {{as there is a}} recognised lack of hydropower technology avaiable to exploit these low-power sites economically. The aim of this work was therefore to develop a novel hydropower machine which could be used to viably exploit very low head dierences in river environments. A review of the hydropower technologies determined that the established machinery is primarily driven by the operational principles of impulse, reaction, or potential. It was however noticed that some less well established designs appear to be driven directly by the hydrostatic pressure which could be generated by a depth of owing water. This observation had not been previously acknowledged. It was also recognised that investigation into this operational principle could potentially result in machines that were both relatively simple, and have high ow and power capacities when compared to the established technologies. It was identied that there could be two approaches to exploiting hydrostatic pressure, and ideal theories were developed to describe both approaches. The resulting physical concepts were called Hy- drostatic Pressure Converters. Scale models of these concepts were hydraulically tested, veriying the proposed theories, and providing data from which estimates of full scale performance were made. These predicted that the two proposed designs of Hydrostatic <b>Pressure</b> <b>Converter</b> were suitable for head dif- ferences below 2. 5 m, normally the domain of the traditional waterwheel. They would operate with high hydraulic eciency, at around 80 %, but have a signicantly greater ow capacity and power output per unit width of machine, at 500 % that possible using a traditional waterwheel. In conclusion this work has identied, analysed and prototyped a novel approach to exploiting very low head hydropower potential. The resulting Hydrostatic Pressure Converters are a signicant and promising development in the eld of very low head hydropower. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Submerged <b>pressure</b> differential <b>converters</b> frequently use flexible membranes as the working surface between the ocean and the power take-off system. Membranes offer the advantage over rigid structures of being compliant and low mass, which can produce more direct coupling with the wave’s energy.

40|$|This thesis {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} a novel low-head hydropower device, the Hydrostatic <b>Pressure</b> <b>Converter</b> (HPC), on downstream moving fish, and investigated factors that may limit both up- and down-stream fish pass efficiency. This was achieved {{through the use of a}} blade strike model (BSM) and experimental studies conducted in large open channel flumes. A BSM predicted a lower probability of strike with a HPC blade for small fish that travelled downstream faster, and when blades rotated slowly. A major pinch-point between the blade tips and the base of the flume caused severe damage to euthanized brown trout (Salmo trutta) as they passively drifted through a prototype HPC. Damage ranged from abrasive scale loss to skeletal deformation and breakage. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla) did not exhibit avoidance behaviours when approaching the intake to a HPC located within a flume. When behavioural data (speed of downstream movement and orientation) were incorporated into BSM simulations, probability of strike increased and decreased for trout and eel, respectively, compared with an assumption of passive drift with bulk flow. Species specific behaviours influenced probability and severity of strike with a HPC blade. Management recommendations are made to ensure HPC developments meet the required environmental standards. Ensuring efficient fish passage around low-head hydropower developments presents a major ecological challenge. Behavioural data on individual fish encountering conditions ubiquitous to fish pass structures was used to investigate and identify factors that may limit passage efficiencies. Although upstream migrant adult river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), a species of conservation concern in Europe, were predicted to avoid areas of elevated turbulence, little evidence in support of this was found. Instead lamprey appeared to alter their migration strategy based primarily on water velocity. Behaviours were indicative of a time conservation strategy, i. e. altering behaviour to expedite passage through energetically expensive environments. For downstream moving fish, delay due to avoidance of conditions created at bypass entrances (e. g. abrupt accelerations of velocity) can negatively impact fitness. Velocity gradients created by a constricted flume section had a clear influence over downstream moving brown trout. Avoidance behaviours occurred at a similar threshold spatial velocity gradient when dark (ca. 0. 4 cm s- 1 cm- 1), and the addition of a light stimulus served to reduce this threshold by approximately 50 %. Elevated avoidance to velocity gradients was also evident when downstream migrant juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were able to navigate using mechanosensory and visual senses. Avoidance behaviour significantly impacted subsequent rate of passage. Information provided in this thesis significantly enhances our understanding of how fish respond to environmental stimuli, has direct application to fish passage, and the potential to improve fish survival at low-head hydropower developments...|$|E

The chips include tightly integrated instrumentation amplifiers, analog-to-digital <b>converters,</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature sensors, and control circuitry that provides excellent signal quality over standard digital bus interfaces. The resulting array electronics can be easily encapsulated with soft polymers to provide robust and compliant grasping surfaces for specific hand designs. The use of standard commercial-off-the-shelf technologies means that only basic electrical and mechanical skills are required to build effective tactile sensors for new applications. Performance evaluation of prototype arrays demonstrate excellent linearity (< 1 % typical) and low noise (< 0. 01 N). External addressing circuitry allows multiple sensors to communicate on the same bus at over 100 Hz per sensor element.

However, due to limitations and problems faced, piezoelectric method will be discussed by assuming the design of power generator.
