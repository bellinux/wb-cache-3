5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the <b>patient</b> <b>at</b> risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E

40|$|Background. To {{increase}} {{the coverage of}} influenza vaccination in groups of <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> risk, an experiment was conducted in 1993, aimed at logistic support of general practitioners (GPs). Methods. Support was given to 56 GPs with 133 000 patients to select and invite <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> risk. The coverage of vaccination {{as a result of}} this experiment has been compared with the results obtained from the Health Interview Survey, in The Netherlands as a total. Results. About 15 000 <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> risk were invited for vaccination, of whom 75. 5 per cent were vaccinated. In The Netherlands as a total, the coverage of <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> risk was 43 per cent. Conclusion. Because the selection and invitation of <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> risk is still a problem for many GPs, owing to the lack of computerization, logistic support can ease these tasks and thus help {{increase the}} coverage of vaccination against influenza in groups of <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> risk...|$|R

5|$|Joseph Stalin's Great Purge {{started at}} about the same time the Laskers arrived in the USSR. In August 1937, Martha and Emanuel Lasker decided to leave the Soviet Union, and they moved, via the Netherlands, to the United States (first Chicago, next New York) in October 1937. In the {{following}} year Emanuel Lasker's patron, Krylenko, was purged. Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions, as he was now too old for serious competition. In 1940 he published his last book, The Community of the Future, in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems, including anti-Semitism and unemployment. He died of a kidney infection in New York on January 11, 1941, at the age of 72, as a charity <b>patient</b> <b>at</b> the MountSinaiHospital.

5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the <b>patient</b> <b>at</b> increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
30|$|After the {{diagnosis}} of sarcoidosis was established, oral steroid treatment was initiated with 60  mg (n =  2), 40  mg (n =  10), 30  mg (n =  1), or 20  mg (n =  3) of daily prednisone based on the severity of symptoms and of cardiac/radiological studies.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} and safety profile of adalimumab {{in patients with}} severe, recalcitrant chronic plaque psoriasis, and to assess short-term overlapping of other systemic treatment with adalimumab to prevent flaring of disease. METHODS: This was a retrospective study comprising 39 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis treated with adalimumab between October 2005 and January 2008. All had failed treatment with other systemic agents, including biological therapies in 59 % of patients. Patients were started on adalimumab 40 mg weekly or fortnightly, as clinically indicated. Severity of psoriasis was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Therapeutic response was assessed by 75 % improvement on PASI (PASI 75). All adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Results were analysed separately for those treated with adalimumab only and those on combination treatment. PASI 75 was achieved in 38 % (8 of 21 <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> week 16), 62 % (13 of 21 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 24, 69 % (9 of 13 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 48 % and 71 % (5 of 7 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 72 in the adalimumab-only group, compared with 56 % (5 of 9 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 16, 50 % (4 of 8 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 24, 80 % (4 of 5 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 48 % and 67 % (2 of 3 <b>patients)</b> <b>at</b> week 72 in the combined group. Of the 39 patients, 15 (38 %) achieved a PASI of 0 {{at some point in}} their treatment. Adalimumab was well tolerated; 38 % of patients experienced side-effects, which were generally mild.

The most frequently chosen tidal volume (VT) size was 500 ml, or 7 to 9 ml kg- 1 predicted body weight, slightly lower in <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> increased risk of PPCs. Levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were slightly higher in <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> increased risk of PPCs, with 14. 3 % receiving more than 5 cmH 2 O PEEP compared with 7. 6 % in <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> low risk of PPCs (P < 0. 001).
