5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would <b>prick</b> the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Pricking,</b> {{classified}} as {{female genital cutting}} (FGC) type IV by the World Health Organization, is an under-researched area gaining momentum among diaspora communities. Our aim was to explore factors associated with being supportive of <b>pricking</b> among Somalis in Sweden. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, attitudes and knowledge regarding FGC, and measures of socioeconomic status, acculturation, and social capital, were assessed by a 49 -item questionnaire in four municipalities in Sweden. Data were collected in 2015 from 648 Somali men and women, >= 18 years old, of which 113 supported the continuation of <b>pricking.</b> Logistic regression {{was used for the}} analysis. Results: Those more likely to support the continuation of <b>pricking</b> were older, originally from rural areas, and newly arrived in Sweden. Further, those who reported that they thought <b>pricking</b> was: acceptable, according to their religion (aOR: 10. 59, 95 % CI: 5. 44 - 20. 62); not a violation of children's rights (aOR: 2. 86, 95 % CI: 1. 46 - 5. 61); and did not cause long-term health complications (aOR: 5. 52, 95 % CI: 2. 25 - 13. 52) had higher odds of supporting <b>pricking.</b> Religion was strongly associated with the support of <b>pricking</b> among both genders. However, for men, children's rights and the definition of <b>pricking</b> as FGC or not were important aspects in how they viewed <b>pricking,</b> while, for women, health complications and respectability were important. Conclusions: Values known to be associated with FGC in general are also related to <b>pricking.</b> Hence, {{there seems to be a}} change in what types of FGC are supported rather than in their perceived values...|$|R
5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin <b>prick</b> or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, {{it consists of}} 340 vellum leaves, or folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside {{of each other and}} sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. <b>Prick</b> marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and <b>prick</b> the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E

5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to <b>prick</b> her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of the sensory neurons within the skin accounts for the large and overlapping receptive fields of the skin.

Therefore, it is more likely that a stimulus caused by the <b>prick</b> of a needle be detected by more than a hundred nerve endings all sharing the same receptive field, than for that same needle <b>prick</b> to be detected by only one nerve ending.|$|E
