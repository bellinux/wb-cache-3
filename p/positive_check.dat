60|$|In {{examining}} the principal states of modern Europe, we shall find that {{though they have}} increased very considerably in population since they were nations of shepherds, yet that at present their progress is but slow, and instead of doubling their numbers every twenty-five years they require three or four hundred years, or more, for that purpose. Some, indeed, may be absolutely stationary, and others even retrograde. The cause of this slow progress in population cannot be traced to a decay of the passion between the sexes. We have sufficient {{reason to think that}} this natural propensity exists still in undiminished vigour. Why then do not its effects appear in a rapid increase of the human species? An intimate view of the state of society in any one country in Europe, which may serve equally for all, will enable us to answer this question, and to say that a foresight of the difficulties attending the rearing of a family acts as a preventive check, and the actual distresses of some of the lower classes, by which they are disabled from giving the proper food and attention to their children, act as a <b>positive</b> <b>check</b> to the natural increase of population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Impacts of Malthusian <b>positive</b> <b>checks</b> are {{investigated}} {{using data}} {{compiled by the}} United Nations Development Program. We show how the intensity of Malthusian <b>positive</b> <b>checks</b> are correlated with indicators describing {{the standard of living}} such as ecological footprint, income per capita, severe poverty, access to pure water and access to sanitation facilities. We then show that mortality increases exponentially with the intensity of Malthusian <b>positive</b> <b>checks</b> (adult mortality, under-five mortality, maternal mortality and deaths by polluted water). However, total fertility rate also increases exponentially. The surprising result of our analysis is that the growth rate and the rate of natural increase are directly proportional to the intensity of Malthusian <b>positive</b> <b>checks.</b> The regenerating impacts triggered by Malthusian <b>positive</b> <b>checks</b> do not just keep the growth undisturbed – they stimulate growth and make it even faster. Using data for Africa, we show that while the death rate increases with the intensity of hunger, total fertility rate, birth rate and the rate of natural increase also increase. Records from China also show that Malthusian <b>positive</b> <b>checks</b> of wars and famines triggered the intensified growth of population. Thus, contrary to the generally promoted interpretations, hunger and famines do not necessarily suppress the growth of population. Similar patterns of stress-induced growth are also observed in nature. This study is closely related to the problem of controlling the growth of human population. Keywords.

60|$|New writers {{now appear}} who add {{gradually}} stone after stone {{to the good}} foundation already laid, and raise the edifice to fairer proportions. The first considerable addition comes from a contribution by a country clergyman, Thomas Robert Malthus,(30) in his “Essay on the Principles of Population” (1798). Against the view of Pitt that “the man who had a large family was a benefactor to his country,” Malthus argued conclusively that “a perfectly happy and virtuous community, by physical law, is constrained to increase very rapidly.... By nature human food increases in a slow arithmetical ratio; man himself increases in a quick geometrical ratio, unless want and vice stop him.” In his second edition (1803), besides the <b>positive</b> <b>check</b> of vice and want, he gave more importance to the negative check of “self-restraint, moral and prudential.” The whole theory was crudely stated at first; and it raised the cry that such a doctrine was inconsistent with the belief in a benevolent Creator. In its essence, the law of population is simply that a tendency and ability exist in mankind to increase its numbers faster than subsistence, and that this result actually will happen unless checks retard it, or new means of getting subsistence arise. If an undue increase of population led to vice and misery, in Malthus’s theory, he certainly {{is not to be}} charged with unchristian feelings if he urged a self-restraint by which that evil result should be avoided. Malthus’s doctrines excited great discussion: Godwin says that by 1820 thirty or forty answers to the essay had been written; and they have continued to appear. The chief contributions have been by A. H. Everett, “New Ideas on Population” (1823), who believed that an increase of numbers increased productive power; by M. T. Sadler, “Law of Population” (1830), who taught that human fertility varied inversely with numbers, falling off with density of population; by Sir Archibald Alison, “Principles of Population” (1840), who reasoned inductively that the material improvement of the human race is a proof that man can produce more than he consumes, or that in the progress of society preventive checks necessarily arise; by W. R. Greg, “Enigmas of Life” (1873); and by Herbert Spencer, “Westminster Review” (April, 1852), and “Principles of Biology,” (part vi, ch. xii and xiii), who worked out a physiological check, in that with a mental development out of lower stages there comes an increased demand upon the nervous energy which causes a diminution of fertility. Since Darwin’s studies it has been very generally admitted that it is the innate tendency of all organic life to increase until numbers press upon the limit of food-production; not that population has always done so in every country.(31) Malthus’s teachings resulted in the modern poor-house system, beginning with 1834 in England, and they corrected some of the abuses of indiscriminate charity.|$|E

Unconventionally, he sought information from animal breeders. In September 1838, while investigating variation, averages and population statistics, he read Malthus’ An Essay on the Principle of Population, and wrote: [...] We ought to be far from wondering of changes in numbers of species, from small changes in nature of locality. Even the energetic language of [...] Malthus [...] Decandolle does not convey the warring of the species as inference from Malthus. — increase of brutes must be prevented solely by positive checks, excepting that famine may stop desire. — in nature production does not increase, whilst no check prevail, but the <b>positive</b> <b>check</b> of famine & consequently death. Population is increase at geometrical ratio in far shorter time than 25 years — yet until the one sentence of Malthus no one clearly perceived the great check amongst men That sentence is on page 6 of {{the first volume of}} Malthus' Essay, 6th edition: [...] "It may safely be pronounced, therefore, that the population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio." [...] At first Darwin suggested species competing for resources, six months later he saw competition between individuals of the same species: in mid March 1839 he wrote of the [...] "dreadful but quiet war of organic beings. going on the peaceful woods. & smiling fields" [...] in which [...] "a grain of sand turns the balance", a month later he wrote, of the [...] "innumerable seeds" [...] of a bulrush, [...] "if a seed were produced with infinitesimal advantage it would have better chance of being propagated". He began to see a similarity between farmers selecting breeding livestock and what he came to call natural selection, still thinking of this as a benevolent law ordained to create adaptation. [...] In his 1842 sketch expanding his theory, Darwin wrote that [...] "De Candolle's war of nature,—seeing contented face of nature,—may be well at first doubted", but [...] "considering the enormous geometrical power of increase in every organism" [...] countries [...] "must be fully stocked" [...] referring to [...] "Malthus on man": later in the sketch he used the phrase [...] "struggle of nature", and on the back of one sheet [...] "struggle of existence". In his 1844 Essay Darwin began his section on Natural Means of Selection with [...] "De Candolle, in an eloquent passage, has declared that all nature is at war, one organism with another, or with external nature", and described this [...] "war" [...] as [...] "the doctrine of Malthus applied in most cases with ten-fold force." [...] In later sections, including the summary, he used the phrase [...] "struggle for existence", which he had read in several books including Lyell's Geology. On 3 March 1857 he wrote chapter 5 of his [...] "big book" [...] on his theory, initially headed [...] "On Natural Selection". The relevant section, titled [...] "Struggle of Nature" [...] had as an alternative title [...] "War of Nature". At a later date he changed the chapter heading to [...] "The Struggle For Existence As Bearing On Natural Selection" [...] and made the section title [...] "The Struggle for existence", making this his main theme to allow a broader interpretation than one of war between organisms: he used the phrase [...] "in a very large sense" [...] to include mutual dependency and the physical environmental as when [...] "a plant {{on the edge of a}} desert is often said to struggle for existence" [...] due to its need for moisture.|$|E
