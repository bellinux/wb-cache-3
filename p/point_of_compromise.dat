The second evidence is the tacit and total neglect of the scientific question in all the departments {{in which it is}} not an employment question; as, for instance, the marriages of the princely, patrician, or merely plutocratic houses. I do not mean, of course, that no scientific men have rigidly tackled these, though I do not recall any cases. But I am not talking of the merits of individual men of science, but of the push and power behind this movement, the thing that is able to make it fashionable and politically important. I say, if this power were an interest in truth, or even in humanity, the first field in which to study would be in the weddings of the wealthy. Not only would the records be more lucid, and the examples more in evidence, but the cases would be more interesting and more decisive. For the grand marriages have presented both extremes of the problem of pedigree--first the [...] "breeding in and in," [...] and later the most incongruous cosmopolitan blends. It would really be interesting to note which worked the best, or what <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> was safest. For the poor (about whom the newspaper Eugenists are always talking) cannot offer any test cases so complete. Waiters never had to marry waitresses, as princes had to marry princesses. And (for the other extreme) housemaids seldom marry Red Indians. It may be because there are none to marry. But to the millionaires the continents are flying railway stations, and the most remote races can be rapidly linked together. A marriage in London or Paris may chain Ravenna to Chicago, or Ben Cruachan to Bagdad. Many European aristocrats marry Americans, notoriously the most mixed stock in the world; so that the disinterested Eugenist, with a little trouble, might reveal rich stores of negro or Asiatic blood to his delighted employer. Instead of which he dulls our ears and distresses our refinement by tedious denunciations of the monochrome marriages of the poor.|$|E

30|$|The {{simplest}} {{approach to}} implement a CA is to assign CA task to single node. One of the main problems {{of this approach is}} its availability and it can bring the entire MANET to a halt if it moves out of the MANET. Furthermore, it acts as a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> failure if it is compromised by an attacker. A replicated CAs can be used to solve availability problem of previous scheme [1]. Therefore, using x replica, the system can withstand (x - 1) failures because the CA service is available {{as long as there is}} at least one operational CA. But, this approach creates consistency problems when CA nodes cannot find each others. Also, if any CA node is compromised, we will have several <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> in MANET. To solve all of these problems, we must use distributed certificate authority (DCA). The rest of the article is organized as follows: In Section 2, DCAs in MANET are discussed.

30|$|Given {{that the}} Internet has been {{developing}} enormously all around the world, publishing becomes easier, and broadcasting emerges from the state’s monopoly. The alternative media also has been growing in recent years. However, the pressure and constraint {{with which they are}} faced remain persistently as the discursive struggle which does not direct to a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> or ultimate dominance. The rapid expansion of new ICT technologies provides a great opportunity to propagate the various modernist discourses by alternative media, including feminist approaches, liberal politics, environment advocacy perspectives, and leftist criticism. Considering the substantial modality of alternative media, including digitality, virtuality, interactivity, hypertextuality, networking, and simulating [41], the expansion of new ICT technologies facilitate alternative media practices, as different practitioners from different social strata could actively participate in the flow of communication and generate alternative contents through alternative channels like citizen journalism, telegram channels, advocacy group websites, and activist hidden forums. On the other hand, surveillance technologies are developed simultaneously by the state regime; hence, the traditional powerful institutions possess the more effective equipment to ban, block, filter, or slow down different parts of the Internet. It also enhances the ability of security organizations dominated by traditionalists to track dissident activities, keep records of their deficiency, and accuse them of dissident views and activities in their ordinary life. Consequently, not only the new ICT technologies create a new open virtual space to listen to more varying modernist voices through the alternative media but also they make it possible to suppress these voices by threatening modern individuals to disclose their personal information or prosecution of modernist advocacy groups based on media evidence.|$|E
40|$|Secret {{splitting}} {{has been}} shown to improve reliability, reduce the risk of insider threat, and remove the issues surrounding key management in distributed long-term datastores. However, to date there has been little or no adoption of this technique in production environments. When it has been implemented, it was done relying on fixed-key encryption for various parts of the system, e. g. during ingestion to maintain user privacy, or pre-indexing to facilitate searching since the inherent security of such a datastore normally precludes it from being directly searched without reassembling the data. Fixed-key encryption, unfortunately, is not well suited for long-term applications due to its introduction of a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> and failure as well as its key management issues. Furthermore, even if the data remains intact after a long period of time, since standard reconstruction methodologies rely upon external knowledge to perform the reconstruction, they will eventually fail. When they do, information loss is almost certain in applications of sufficient size to make reconstruction combinatorially prohibitive. The most recent method to mitigate this risk has a high runtime, and limits the inherent security of the secret-split datastore. To address the need of a reliable, long-term, distributed storage system free of fixed-key encryption, we propose Percival: a novel system that enables searching a secret-split datastore, maintains information privacy, and does not rely on external information to ensure reconstruction remains feasible. It is built upon the knowledge gained from conducting an in-depth comparison of file migration activity on the mass storage system (MSS) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) during two periods, one in the early 1990 s, and another nearly twenty years later. To accommodate real-world user access patterns, Percival allows one to search the secret-split data while both keeping the bulk of the work on each client and the data custodians blinded to both the contents of a query as well as its results. Furthermore, to ensure reconstruction is feasible for even very large secret-split datastores, we also present two novel disaster recovery methods that greatly reduce the number of reconstruction attempts required during reconstruction; this enables recovery of the original data, where previously the data would have been lost...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the poor optical angular properties displayed by the majority of automatically darkening welding filters currently on the market that are based on liquid crystal technology. It is shown that by reducing the twist-angle present in the liquid crystal cell to below that of 90 together with employment of a novel polariser arrangement, an optical shutter design based on a double-cell construction is obtained that boasts a reduced angular transmittance variation when in the activated phase. This gives an optical filter possessing a wide central viewing cone whilst maintaining the remaining optical parameters at a high level. The only <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> comes from the voltage increase requirement upon reduction of the twist- angle in order to maintain cell contrast. Although this inflates the power consumption of the system, beneficial effects upon the total light scattering provoked by the device are also observed. The final sections deal with a new mode of operation for a twisted-nematic liquid crystal cell when placed between crossed polarisers together with an interference filter possessing a high optical transmittance over {{the central part of the}} visible spectrum. This mode of operation means that the cell is in a dark state when inactivated. Application of a small stimulating voltage transmutes the unit into the light state, where upon further increment of the driving electronics beyond this point reverts the system back into a low transmittance phase. Such a mode of operation for a twisted-nematic cell offers several advantages over that of the normally white mode when considering the optical lens of an automatically darkening welding filter. In particular, a dark, fail-safe state is provided should the controlling electronics malfunction preventing the unit from holding in a potentially hazardous light phase, a property usually associated with the normally black mode of operation, whilst the fast switching speed from the light to the dark state associated with the normally white mode of operation is maintained. It is shown that there are only two cell types that display this phenomenon and the optical properties of these two systems are analysed in some detail with the view of developing an automatically darkening welding filter based on this technology.

40|$|Data {{loss from}} web {{applications}} at different <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> {{has become a}} major liability in recent years. Existing security guidelines, policies, and tools fail often, ostensibly for reasons stemming from blatant disregard of common practice to subtle exploits originating from complex interactions between components. Current security mechanisms focus on “how to stop illicit data transfer”(i. e., the “syntax”), and many tools achieve that goal in principle. Yet, the practice of securing data additionally depends on allowing administrators to clearly specify “what data should be secured” (i. e., the “semantics”). Currently, translation from “security semantics” to “security syntax” is manual, time­consuming, and ad hoc. Even a slight oversight in the translation process could render the entire system insecure. Security semantics frequently need modifications due to changes in various external factors such as policy changes, user reclassification, and even code refactoring. This dissertation hypothesizes that adaptation to such changes would be faster and less error prone if the tools also focused on automating translation from semantics to syntax, in addition to simply executing the syntax. With this approach, we build following low ­maintenance security tools that prevent unauthorized sensitive data transfer at various vantage points in the World Wide Web ecosystem. We show how the security tools can take advantage of inherent properties of the sensitive information in each case, making the translation process automatic and faster: ● Appu, a tool that automatically finds personal information(semantics) spread across web services, and suggests actions(syntax) to minimize data loss risks. ● Newton, a tool that formalizes the access control model using web cookies. Using this formal approach, it improves the security of the existing session management techniques by detecting(semantics) and protecting(syntax) privileged cookies without requiring input from the site administrator. ● SilverLine, a system for cloud­based web services that automatically derives data exfiltration rules(syntax) from the information about sensitive database tables & inter­table relationships(semantics). Then, it executes these rules using information flow control mechanism. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this piece of work {{concerns}} the safeguards granted to the individual under the Italian administrative trial. More specifically the work {{is dedicated to the}} guarantees provided to the individuals by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and European Union law. The ECHR and the EU law (the latter, in particular, through the Charter of Fundamental Rights) provide individuals with a series of procedural guarantees whose compliance is the basis for the "fair trial". The administrative trial, however, presents some peculiarities that generate a number of doubts in the practical application of such guarantees. The Public Administration (necessary part of this judgment) from the procedural stage is already bound to comply with certain principles (therefore much earlier than the commencement of any litigation). Such principles are imposed by the law, Constitution, ECHR and EU law in order to achieve a "fair administrative trial". By consequence, the administrative act should therefore be "legitimate" in itself. Furthermore, while the claimant is pursuing its own (legitimate) individual interest, which may have been harmed by the contested measure or unlawful conduct adopted by the Public Administration, the aim pursued by the administration itself is only the overall interest of the community. The administrative trial contains an internal asymmetry between the positions of the parties involved. Such asymmetry is originated by the presumption of legality of the administrative actions, {{as well as by the}} public interest on which it is linked. In fact, under Italian law, as well as in most European countries, Administrative trial has always been separated from the civil trial. The question of the balance between the values at stake as a fundamental valuation criteria for the Constitutional Court, the Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice, is absolutely unique in this field. How much the procedural rights of the individuals shall be safeguarded when such protection inevitably collides with the overriding public interest that the Public Administration shall enforce (which in turn takes the form of defense of other fundamental values, also protected by the Constitution, the ECHR and Union law) ? In the development of this work the way in which the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice deal with this difficult balance will also be analyzed. The analysis will be focused in particular on the case law of the Italian administrative procedure law. In addition, special attention will be paid to the way the Italian Constitutional Court, the Court of Cassation and the Trial Court deal with the jurisprudence of the European courts. The outcome is the finding of the existence of various levels of dialectical relationship between the jurisdictions which are characterized by moments of dialogue and other of breaking. Therefore the target is finding an "European" concept of "administrative fair trial" and analyzing in which way it practically develops within the Italian law. In this sense, no one can hardly overlook the objective efforts made by the legislator who, through the reform of article 111 of the Constitution and the entry into force of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CPA), has shown the intention of incorporating into our system the principles of fair trial as outlined (also) through an alignment of the levels of protection granted in the civil and in the administrative trial. However, despite these efforts, in some fields of Italian procedural law, it still persists a situation of advantage in favour to the Public Administration. The work is divided in three chapters. In the first one, after an overview of the universal generic obligations suitable to affect the administrative process in Europe, we will try to determine which guarantees the ECHR and the EU law (and, particularly, the Bill of Rights) are applicable to the administrative trial. In the second, the investigation focuses on the ways the Italian law suits the procedural guarantees of the ECHR and the EU law and on the possible intersections (both from the perspective of conflict and integration) between such guarantees or between them and the Constitution. This will be obtained by not forgetting the need for a coordination between the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights and Constitutional Court. In the third chapter, after a brief presentation of the Italian system of split of jurisdiction, the investigation focuses on the manner in which the domestic, international and EU courts have organized the delicate balance that is studied in this work. This is done by outlining some problematic issues that arise in practice in the application of the principle of fair trial in the Italian administrative procedural system. To do this, it will be indicated some possible solutions related to certain interpretative issues still unresolved in our domestic law, or about cases of clear incompatibility between Italian law and the principle of fair trial, through an interpretation of internal rules that guarantees the enforcement of human rights. Upon completion of this work, based on the outcome outlined herein, the reader shall be able to understand if the process of development of the individuals' rights in the administrative process has arrived at a stable <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> between opposing interests, or rather should continue and overlaps to areas where the public administration still enjoys the typical privileges deriving from its particular status. ...|$|E

This research paper is {{made on the basis of}} the information, received from textbooks and scientific literature of domestic and foreign authors, as well as from other sources. The main methods, used in this work are as follows: method of system analysis, method of the theory of operations’ research, prognostics. Application of these methods allows forecasting material flows, creating the integrated management systems and controlling their movements, developing systems of logistic service, to optimize supply stock and solve a number of other tasks. A logistic approach to form a modern system of logistics will save time, reduce costs for the purchase of material resources, their delivery and storage. In modern conditions of the market economy, the considered time parameters of the logistic chain are essential for manufacturing enterprises because their records significantly increase the efficiency of the logistical system. Logistics is equipped with a special complex of economic and mathematical models, the main feature of which is the adaptability, i. e. ability to solve complex optimization problems in the operational mode and in the process of the management of material flows. The primary role of these models in a market economy is to identify quickly <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>compromise.</b> Dynamics to functional cycles gives the necessity to align resource needs «input» and «output». «Input» functional cycle is an order that specifies requirements for a product or service. Logistical system, which is able to complete fully the order of any size, as a rule, needs in the «combined» functional cycles, including different transactions and operations at different stages. The «output» of the system – expected results to perform the logistics operations. We can talk about the effectiveness of the functional cycle structure due to the operational needs. The effectiveness of the functional cycle is directly related to the resource cost. The efficiency and productivity of the functional cycles are the key indicators in logistical management. Functional cycles are forming a single supply chain and link its participants. Thus, the functional cycle is the main object of the design and operational management in logistical systems, its structure is the basis for making the integrated logistics. </p...|$|R

Thus, compromise enables and constrains interaction because it carries on irreversibility in the organizational process. From a case study based on the development of an Information System for Human Resource Management in a bank during the financial crisis, I illustrate the conceptual framework, and I discuss three roles and effects <b>of</b> <b>compromises</b> in organizational process: the importance <b>of</b> the first <b>compromise</b> in organizational process, the compromise as an ongoing update equilibrium between concession and gift, and the materialization <b>of</b> <b>compromise</b> to objective modalities. compromise; organizational process; coordination; Actor Network Theory;...|$|R
