25|$|On 5 July 2012, the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) {{found that}} {{the causes of the}} {{accident}} had been foreseeable, and that the <b>plant</b> <b>operator,</b> Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), had failed to meet basic safety requirements such as risk assessment, preparing for containing collateral damage, and developing evacuation plans. On 12 October 2012, TEPCO admitted {{for the first time that}} it had failed to take necessary measures for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} raised significant {{public and}} political issues related to energy security, adequacy of existing infrastructure, contingency planning, {{and the role of}} regulatory agencies. The plant took three months to repair, although partial supplies were restored within six weeks of the explosion. A major investigation was launched by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA), with separate investigations conducted by the <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> and several other government agencies. NOPSA's report was published on 10 October 2008, and confirmed early suggestions that the explosion was caused by structural failure of the export pipeline due to significant corrosion. A Senate Committee inquiry was established to investigate the economic impacts and the state government's response to the crisis. The committee's report was handed down on 3 December 2008.|$|E

An American physician reported Japanese doctors have considered banking blood for future treatment of workers exposed to radiation. Tepco has started a re-assessment of the approximately 8300 workers and emergency personnel who have been involved in responding to the incident, which has revealed that by 13 July, of the approximately 6700 personnel tested so far, 88 personnel have received between 100 and 150 mSv, 14 have received between 150 and 200 mSv, 3 have received between 200 and 250 mSv, and 6 have received above 250 mSv.|$|E

A reporter for the Lincoln Journal Star compared Blinky to a rainbow trout with two mouths caught in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2005. The fish was mentioned in a National Review article discussing a legislation {{which would make it}} illegal to import, possess or release alive into California any live transgenic fish: [...] "Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of The Simpsons with Blinky, the three-eyed fish that swims by the nuclear-power plant." [...] Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay, which, {{according to a study by}} the University of California, Davis, had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay. In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant, Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure, [...] "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted." [...] Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay: [...] "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay? Probably not, but local environmentalists are worried that digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago." [...] In his article about the nuclear power <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> Exelon, Thomas M.

2500|$|Most {{engineering}} simulations entail mathematical {{modeling and}} computer assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. [...] Simulation of fluid dynamics problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. [...] In these cases the physical models require dynamic similitude. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in chemical engineering, for example, process simulations {{are used to}} give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for <b>plant</b> <b>operator</b> training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil and to power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. Mimic is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.|$|E
