25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the Libyan Civil War has been characterized by marked change {{in the social and}} political order of Libya after the overthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi in the Libyan Civil War. The country has been subject to ongoing <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> Islamic insurgencies, sectarian violence, and lawlessness, with spillovers affecting neighboring countries including Mali.|$|E
25|$|The Cooperative Threat Reduction {{program of}} the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was {{established}} after {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union in 1991 to aid former Soviet bloc countries in the inventory and destruction of their sites for developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and their methods of delivering them (ICBM silos, long-range bombers, etc.). Over $4.4 billion has been spent on this endeavor to prevent purposeful or accidental <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> from the former Soviet arsenal.|$|E

500|$|Chomsky's main {{argument}} in Hegemony or Survival {{is that the}} socio-economic elite who control the United States have pursued an [...] "Imperial Grand Strategy" [...] {{since the end of}} World War II in order to maintain global hegemony through military, political and economic means. He argues that in doing so they have repeatedly shown a total disregard for democracy and human rights, {{in stark contrast to the}} US government's professed support for those values. Furthermore, he argues that this continual pursuit of global hegemony now threatens the existence of the human species itself because of the increasing <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction.|$|E
500|$|The CPG policy {{document}} {{is regarded as}} self-contradictory {{for at least two}} reasons. Firstly, it identified the two greatest threats to NATO as terrorism and the <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction (WMD), whilst simultaneously reaffirming the 1999 Strategic Concept as [...] "remaining valid" [...] {{despite the fact that it}} barely mentioned these threats. Secondly, the document states that collective defence remains the core purpose of NATO, but at the same time emphasizes potential NATO contributions to conflict prevention and crisis management, and the potential planning and management of missions like that in Afghanistan. The Riga Declaration even described the capability for such missions as NATO's [...] "top priority". Additionally, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer wanted and expected a new Strategic Concept to be debated and agreed upon by 2008, reinforcing already existing views that the CPG will most likely last much less than the 10 to 15 years as the guiding {{policy document}}.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union {{dismissed}} the Baruch Plan as a US attempt to secure its nuclear dominance, {{and called for}} the US to halt weapons production and release technical information on its program. The Acheson–Lilienthal paper and Baruch Plan would {{serve as the basis}} for US policy into the 1950s. Between 1947 and 1954, the US and Soviet Union discussed their demands within the United Nations Commission for Conventional Disarmament. A series of events in 1954, including the Castle Bravo test and spread of fallout from a Soviet test over Japan, redirected the international discussion on nuclear policy. Additionally, by 1954, both US and Soviet Union had assembled large nuclear stockpiles, reducing hopes of complete disarmament. In the early years of the Cold War, the US approach to nuclear control reflected a strain between an interest in controlling nuclear weapons and a belief that dominance in the nuclear arena, particularly given the size of Soviet conventional forces, was critical to US security. Interest in nuclear control and efforts to stall <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> to other states grew as the Soviet Union's nuclear capabilities increased.|$|E
