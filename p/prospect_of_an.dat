5|$|On 13 March, the New Zealand Division {{moved to}} Syria to build fortifications in the Beqaa Valley, {{to protect against}} the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Axis attack from Turkey. The {{regiment}} had to build roads at Laboue and Wadi Fa'rah, camping at Djedeida. In mid-May the road-building was finished and the regiment prepared for manoeuvres with the 4th and 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigades. On 21 May, the regiment moved into the desert for the manoeuvres. When the exercises were completed on 1 June, it returned to Djedeida for more training.|$|E
5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|While Britain {{may have}} been militarily secure in 1940, both sides {{were aware of the}} {{possibility}} of a political collapse. If the Germans had won the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe {{would have been able to}} strike anywhere in southern England and with the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion, the British government would have come under pressure to come to terms: the extensive anti-invasion preparations demonstrated to Germany and to the people of Britain that whatever happened in the air, the United Kingdom was both able and willing to defend itself.|$|E

5|$|Hamdanid {{relations}} with Byzantium collapsed completely in 985–986, after the Fatimids took the Byzantine fortress of Balanyas. Sa'd al-Dawla refused to continue paying tribute. As a result, the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas invaded his territory and sacked Killis before retracing their steps and marching south to an unsuccessful siege of Apamea. In retaliation, Sa'd al-Dawla sent his troops to raze the famous monastery of Qal'at Sim'an. However, soon after that, in May 986, the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> imminent {{conclusion of a}} peace between Byzantium and Egypt forced Sa'd al-Dawla {{to return to his}} earlier allegiance, and he re-affirmed his tributary status on the same terms as before. This did not prevent Sa'd al-Dawla from supporting the Byzantine general Bardas Skleros in his second rebellion against Basil II, once he was released from Buyid captivity in December 986, nor of recognizing Fatimid suzerainty in the same month, especially as Byzantium now descended into a civil war that lasted until 989.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E

The remaining soldiers of the garrison marched into captivity. During the month-long siege, the French suffered losses of 30 killed, 56 wounded, and 1,450 captured. Spanish losses are not known.|$|E

25|$|Parliament was {{dissolved}} {{and house}} elections scheduled for 24 July 1988, with Prem again not standing for election.

25|$|FitzGerald was {{the heir}} to the earldom of Desmond, but in 1585 his late father's estate was attainted by the Irish {{parliament}} and all its property confiscated by the crown. Most of the hereditary lands in the province of Munster then underwent a radical plantation by English settlers (see Plantation of Munster), but such was the loyalty attached to the FitzGerald name there that the government had good cause to fear a future rebellion. These events occurred during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), and English fear was increased with the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intervention by the Spanish, who had an historical affinity with the west coast of Ireland.|$|E
