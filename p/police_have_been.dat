Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted <b>police</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle.

25|$|A {{large number}} of Muslims in Egypt {{unambiguously}} consider all non-Muslim religions as heresy. Persecution against Christians during Pope Shenouda III's reign was chiefly conducted by private individuals and organizations, especially radical Salafis, although the state continued to enforce long-standing discriminatory policies and engage in occasional Christian-baiting. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist Salafi {{groups such as the}} Gama'at Islamiya during the 1980s was accompanied by attacks on Copts and on Coptic churches.

25|$|Foreign missionaries {{are allowed}} in the country if they {{restrict}} their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing. The Coptic Pope Shenouda III was internally exiled in 1981 by President Anwar Sadat, who then chose five Coptic bishops {{and asked them to}} choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President Hosni Mubarak restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife.

25|$|Prostitution {{is often}} {{directly}} linked to low-level government corruption. Many local officials believe that encouraging prostitution in recreational business operations will bring economic benefits by developing the tourism and hospitality industries and generating {{a significant source of}} tax revenue. On occasion, <b>police</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> implicated in the running of high grade hotels where prostitution activities occur, or accepting bribes and demanding sexual favours to ignore the existence of prostitution activities. Government corruption is also involved in a more indirect form — the widespread abuse of public funds to finance consumption of sex services. Pan Suiming contends that China has a specific type of prostitution that entails a bargain between those who use their power and authority in government to obtain sex and those who use sex to obtain privileges.|$|E
25|$|The <b>police</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{known to}} {{occasionally}} use excessive force against detainees in prisons, {{as well as}} foreigners and other minority groups, although no police officer has ever been arrested or charged. This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality. Their rights have still not been fully restored. Due to their lack of rights and legal status, {{it is difficult to}} hold police accountable for offences committed against them. It is argued that authorities {{turn a blind eye to}} any allegations that arise because often the victims are from ethnic minorities, and there is a culture of racism amongst parts of the police force. When investigations are made, they are often ineffective. Several cases have been brought before the European Court concerning people who have died in police custody because Slovenian Police used excessive force and failed to properly investigate it. Most of these cases are still pending and there has yet to be an outcome.|$|E
