25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia {{does not}} have {{overlapping}} County and City jurisdictions, whereas in the other 49 states most municipalities fall within (and share jurisdiction and many other governmental responsibilities with) a County. In Virginia, governmental <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> down from the State (or in Virginia's case, Commonwealth) directly to either a County or an Independent City. Thus, policing in Virginia is more streamlined: the County Sheriff's Office/Department or County Police Department does not overlap with an Independent City Police Department. Unincorporated Townships remain part of their parent County, but may have Town Police Departments to augment their County law enforcement. Town Police Departments are often small, and may deploy a combination of paid and nonpaid, full and part-time law enforcement officers, including auxiliary officers who typically serve as part-time, unpaid volunteers. If present, Independent City Sheriff's Offices usually follow the Restrictive model shown below for Sheriff's Departments, with limited law enforcement authority including warrant service, jail bailiff, etc. Mutual assistance compacts may exist where neighboring law enforcement agencies will assist each other, however, in addition to State (Commonwealth) law enforcement resources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{difference}} between schedule <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> and online <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> {{is that the}} former has no corresponding physical <b>power</b> <b>flow,</b> while the latter is the reappearance of existing physical <b>power</b> <b>flow.</b> Owing to the different premise, the selection of <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> calculation’s known quantities can be different. A schedule <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> schedules physical <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> for <b>power</b> system, so the selection of known quantities has strict requirements, such as active power and reactive power regulation capability. Since the physical <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> exists, the selection of online <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> calculation’s known quantities can be more flexible. For example, we can choose load bus as slack bus or replace PQ bus with PV bus. The example demonstrated that we could locate the stealing electricity buses by choosing load bus as slack bus. Considering that voltage amplitude measurement accuracy is higher than reactive power measurement accuracy, we can replace PQ bus with PV bus and make the <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> calculation results more consistent with the physical <b>power</b> <b>flow.</b> Finally, the examples show that online <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> calculation’s known quantities can be selected flexibly according to the actual situation rather than strictly following the classical <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> calculation requirements...|$|R

2500|$|The {{policies}} of Weltpolitik, especially the Tirpitz Plan {{brought about a}} period of Anglo-German tension {{in the first years}} of the 20th century. Chamberlain who detested the land of his birth had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain who came to hate Britain expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own. In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom.. in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined...We find ourselves in such a time today." [...] Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and the good of the rest of the world. In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of [...] "stupid" [...] Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood, without the German blood in the House of Romanov [...] "nothing would remain but a decaying matière brute" [...] in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a [...] "Dollar dynasty", writing: From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will live only so long as the stream of European spiritual <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> there, not a moment longer. That part of the world, it may be proven, creates sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past. Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: [...] "The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth". To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing, völkisch Pan-German League.|$|E
