The aircraft immediately returned to Fukuoka Airport.

5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their <b>parked</b> <b>car,</b> he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E

50|$|With {{perpendicular}} parking, {{also known}} as bay <b>parking,</b> <b>cars</b> are <b>parked</b> side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall.

5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's <b>parked</b> <b>car.</b> In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam, thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in a <b>parked</b> <b>car</b> at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to establish the effectiveness of <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> in urban street canyons as passive controls on pedestrian pollutant exposure. A numerical model of a generic street canyon was developed using a large eddy simulation (LES) model to compare personal exposure on the footpath with and without the presence of <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b> Three configurations of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> systems were investigated (parallel, perpendicular & 45 o parking) {{in addition to the}} influence of wind speed, wind direction and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> occupancy. A tracer gas (CO 2) was used as a representative pollutant from vehicular sources within the street canyon models. The results indicated that <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> may act as a temporary baffle plate between traffic emissions and pedestrians on the footpath. Reductions in exposure of up to 35 % and 49 % were attained on the leeward and windward footpaths in perpendicular wind conditions, with parallel winds allowing up to 33 % pollutant reduction on both footpaths for parallel parking. The perpendicular and 45 o <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> configurations investigated proved less successful as passive controls on air pollution exposure and an increase in pollutant concentration occurred in some models. An investigation of parking space occupancy rates was carried out for parallel <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b> The fraction of <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> influenced the level of reduction of pollutants on the footpaths with steady reductions in perpendicular winds, yet reductions were only evident for occupancy rates greater than approximately 45 % in parallel wind conditions. One negative impact associated with the <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> study was the increase of pollutant levels on the roadway as the <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> acted as a baffle wall, which trapped pollutants in the road. The paper underlines the potential of on-street <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> for reducing the personal exposure of pollutants by pedestrians and the optimum parking layout to achieve maximum health protection...|$|R

Without this, Monk was unable to play in any New York venue where liquor was served, and this severely restricted his ability to perform for several years.
