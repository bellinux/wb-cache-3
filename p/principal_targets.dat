5|$|During the Second World War, Devonport was the {{headquarters}} of Western Approaches Command until 1941, and Sunderland flying boats were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an important embarkation point for US troops for D-Day. The city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, {{in a series of}} 59 raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the <b>principal</b> <b>targets,</b> much of the city centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. This was largely due to Plymouth's status as a major port. Charles Church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz, but has not been demolished. It has been designated as an official permanent monument to the bombing of Plymouth during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, Edwards became {{commanding}} officer of No. 105 Squadron replacing the previous incumbent, {{who had been killed}} in an anti-shipping raid on Stavanger. At that time, the Squadron was engaged in a series of daylight operations against Germany and the occupied countries, with its <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> being enemy shipping, power installations, shipbuilding yards, locomotives, steelworks and marshalling yards. On 15 June, by now an acting wing commander, Edwards led six Blenheims on a search for enemy shipping and soon sighted a convoy of eight merchantmen anchored near The Hague. He launched an attack at low level, his bombs striking a 4,000 ton ship. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.|$|E
5|$|The large convoys of East Indiamen {{were among}} the <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> for any French raider. These huge ships sailed from Britain with general cargo, or often {{military}} stores and troops, to India or other ports in the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, or China. There they would sell their cargoes and take on spices, tea, silk and other luxury goods before making the return journey to Britain. A round trip took over a year and an East Indiaman sailing to Britain would routinely carry {{hundreds of thousands of}} pounds worth of trade goods; one large convoy that sailed from Canton in January 1804 was worth over £8 million. East Indiamen were well-protected, armed with up to 30guns, and generally travelled in large convoys in which the ships could provide one another with mutual protection. Such convoys often had a Royal Navy escort, usually including a ship of the line.|$|E

25|$|Finally, 109 {{species of}} fish species have been {{identified}} by the IMNA alone, with a clear dependence on altitude. The largest specimens, which are the <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> of commercial and subsistence fishing - such as sábalo, barred surubim, and pacú - are restricted to the alluvial plains, below 700 m. Above just 1000 m, the fish diversity diminishes dramatically.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{strategic}} {{proximity to the}} northern coast of France and its naval pre-eminence, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, an event known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the <b>principal</b> <b>targets,</b> the two main shopping centres, most of the civic buildings and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. Charles Church has been left in its ruined state as a memorial to those civilians who died. On the Hoe stands a memorial to the {{many members of the}} Royal Navy from Plymouth who were killed in both World Wars.|$|E

5000|$|When War Plan Red was declassified in 1974, {{it caused}} a stir in American-Canadian {{relations}} because Canada, codenamed [...] "Crimson" [...] in the plan, {{was to have been}} the <b>principal</b> <b>target</b> of American forces.|$|R
25|$|After {{the attack}} {{aircraft}} had finished their bombing runs the six transports, {{which had been}} holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga {{at an altitude of}} 200 feet (60 m). Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop. However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect - due to the reconnaissance scaling errors - and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up. The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise. The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on {{the eastern side of the}} camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990).|$|E

He fell on his {{shoulder}} and, after receiving medical attention, abandoned the race with a suspected broken collarbone. That evening, it was announced that, though his collarbone was not broken, he had suffered a dislocation in his shoulder and would miss the Spring Classics season, including his <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> at Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders.|$|E
500|$|The German {{strategy}} {{was based on}} using so-called [...] "blitzkrieg" [...] methods that had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe. Their effectiveness was confirmed during the invasion of Yugoslavia. The German command again coupled ground troops and armour with air support and rapidly drove into the territory. [...] Once Thessaloniki was captured, Athens and the port of Piraeus became <b>principal</b> <b>targets.</b> Piraeus, was virtually destroyed by bombing {{on the night of}} the 6/7 April. The loss of Piraeus and the Isthmus of Corinth would fatally compromise withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces.|$|E

500|$|With his <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> out of reach, Inman {{called off}} the attack {{during the early}} morning and withdrew his ships. He had lost one man killed and 17 wounded, all but six of the latter coming from Dart (some sources only record the men wounded on Dart in the total). French {{casualties}} were far more severe, with more than 100 men killed or wounded, mostly on Désirée, which had taken the brunt of Darts attack. Recognising {{that he had no}} room for prisoners and that many of the French wounded required urgent treatment, Inman ordered the wounded men to be sent back to Dunkirk, although it appears this amnesty was subsequently extended to all the prisoners. By midday on 8 July 1800 the British squadron had returned to its position off the coast while Désirée was sent to Britain, later commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Desiree under the command of Captain Inman. Prize money was paid for the captured frigate, but head money, an award made for enemy servicemen killed, wounded or captured, was not paid, probably due to the return of the prisoners. For their services, Commander Campell and Lieutenant M'Dermeit were promoted, the former transferring from Dart into the much smaller sixth rate HMS Aridane. The French ships returned from the Braak Sand during the morning and repairs were conducted in Dunkirk. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Capture of the Desiree" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
2500|$|Eugenics had two {{essential}} components. First, its advocates {{accepted as}} axiomatic that {{a range of}} mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses {{could be used as}} the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that “mental defectives” should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity. The <b>principal</b> <b>targets</b> of the American sterilization programs were the intellectually disabled and the mentally ill, but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with epilepsy, and the physically deformed. While the claim was that the focus was mainly the mentally ill and disabled, the definition of this during that time was much different than today's. At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being “feeble-minded" [...] because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.|$|E
