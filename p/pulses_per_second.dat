5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
25|$|Frame rate: High frame rates (i.e. images {{acquired}} per second) {{are needed}} to visualize fast motion without stroboscopic effects. However, the higher the frame rate, the higher the radiation dose. Therefore, the frame rate should be chosen according to the clinical need and be as low as reasonably possible. For example, in pediatric cardiology, frame rates of 60 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> are required compared to 0.5 p/s for slowly moving objects. A reduction to half pulse rate reduces dose by about half. The reduction from 30 p/s to 7.5 p/s results in a dose saving of 75%.|$|E
25|$|The flow of {{reactants}} {{into the}} reaction chamber and subsequent ejection {{occur in a}} series of about 70 pulses, {{at a rate of about}} 500 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles' survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{can resolve}} rapid {{movements}} better than humans, for whom flickering {{at a rate}} greater than 50 light <b>pulse</b> cycles <b>per</b> <b>second</b> appears as continuous movement.

50|$|It {{is similar}} to <b>Pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (PPS) because it {{indicates}} {{the start of each}} second using a pulse. PTTI also provides the full Time Of Day (TOD) in hours, minutes, and seconds.|$|R
2500|$|Later {{stepping}} switches {{were arranged}} in banks, {{the first stage}} of which was a linefinder. If one of up to a hundred subscriber lines had the receiver lifted [...] "off hook", a linefinder connected the subscriber's line to a free first selector, which returned the subscriber a dial tone to show that it was ready to receive dialed digits. The subscriber's dial pulsed at about 10 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration.|$|E
2500|$|LORAN {{stations}} {{were built in}} pairs, one master and one slave, typically separated by about [...] Each pair broadcast on one of four frequencies, 1.75, 1.85, 1.9 or 1.95MHz (as well as the unused 7.5MHz). In any given location it was common {{to be able to}} receive more than three stations at a time, so some other means of identifying the pairs was needed. LORAN adopted the use of varying the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) for this task, with each station sending out a string of 40 pulses at either 33.3 or 25 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E

50|$|Electrified {{palisade}} fences {{are usually}} made from painted mild steel, galvanized steel, stainless steel or aluminium. Typically the fences are 2.4 m.

5000|$|The cycle {{frequency}} {{is primarily}} {{dependent on the}} length of the engine. For a small model-type engine the frequency may be around 250 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> whereas for a larger engine such as the one used on the German V-1 flying bomb, the frequency was closer to 45 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The low-frequency sound produced resulted in the missiles being nicknamed [...] "buzz bombs." ...|$|E

50|$|The Observatory is {{in charge}} of {{determining}} the official time of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. This is carried out using a Cesium Atomic Clock, Model HP5061A made by a Desausser, and a frequency amplifier. The clock produces a pattern of a <b>pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> output and has an auxiliary power supply.|$|R
30|$|The PMU {{receives}} a one <b>pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> signal from a GPS-locked time source. This {{is used as}} the basis for measurement synchronization and is particularly important as a reference for phase angle measurements. However, between these pulses the internal PMU clock relies on a crystal oscillator to maintain time and resets itself when the next pulse is received. In this case, the oscillator is not able to keep time correctly. Therefore, the PMU clock time and, consequently, the angle measured by the PMU will drift in the time between receiving the one <b>pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> signals. This can be seen in Fig.  10, as the saw tooth resets every second. This problem can be overcome by replacing the crystal oscillator in the PMU and a maintenance program to upgrade the affected PMUs has already begun.|$|R
5000|$|The WSR82D radar {{installed}} in 1982 had a fiberglass laminate radome, and a parabolic reflector with {{a diameter of}} 6.1m and linear horizontal polarisation. Its gain was 48 dB. The radar emitted a 260kW beam with a frequency of 5625 MHz and wavelength of 5.33cm having a beam width of 0.65 degrees. In conventional operation, it had a pulse duration of 2µs, pulse repetition frequency of 250 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> and performed 6.0 scanning rotations per minute. In Doppler operation, it had a pulse duration of 0.5µs, pulse repetition frequency of 892 or 1190 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> and a scan rate of 0.75 rotations per minute. [...] In long-range Doppler operation, a pulse repetition frequency of 650 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and a scan rate of 2 rotations per minute were used.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{virtually}} {{indistinguishable from the}} Cope's gray treefrog, H. chrysoscelis, the only readily noticeable difference being that Cope's Gray Treefrog has a shorter, faster call. However, the call rates of both gray treefrogs are temperature dependent and at lower temperatures Hyla chrysoscelis can have a call rate approximating that of Hyla versicolor. The difference in call can be heard, but it is best quantified by {{counting the number of}} <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in their whistled trills. Hyla versicolor has a pulse rate of 16-34 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> while Hyla chrysoscelis has a pulse rate of 34-60 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Even though there is potential for overlap, because of the temperature dependence of the pulse frequency the two species are easily distinguished where they occur together. At a given temperature, the pulse frequency for Hyla versicolor is approximately 1/2 that of Hyla chrysoscelis.|$|E
50|$|Another side effect, not yet {{demonstrated}} in practical use, is the cycle time. A traditional pulsejet tops out at about 250 <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> {{due to the}} cycle time of the mechanical shutters, but {{the aim of the}} PDE is thousands of <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> so fast that it is basically continuous from an engineering perspective. This should help smooth out the otherwise highly vibrational pulsejet engine — many small pulses will create less volume than a smaller number of larger pulses for the same net thrust. Unfortunately, detonations are many times louder than deflagrations.|$|E

50|$|Radar signals were {{detected}} by some amateur radio operators in the 9.2-19.745 MHz frequency band. Pulse repetition rate is 50 <b>pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> bandwidth about 14 kHz, frequency modulation on pulse (FMOP) is used.

50|$|Dials at user {{stations}} typically produced pulses at {{the rate}} of ten <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (pps), while dials on operator consoles on Crossbar or electronic exchanges often pulsed at 20 pps.|$|E
50|$|The pulse {{repetition}} frequency (PRF) {{is the number of}} pulses of a repeating signal in a specific time unit, normally measured in <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The term is used within a number of technical disciplines, notably radar.|$|E
50|$|Hartley then {{combined}} the above quantification with Nyquist's {{observation that the}} number of independent pulses that could be put through a channel of bandwidth B hertz was 2B <b>pulses</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> to arrive at his quantitative measure for achievable line rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} transmitters {{were constantly}} upgraded, first from 100 kW of the Orfordness system to 350 kW for the deployed system, {{and then again}} to 750 kW to offer greatly increased range. To aid in detection at long range, a slower 12.5 <b>pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> rate was added. The four-tower transmitter was later reduced to three towers.|$|R
50|$|Each LORAN {{station is}} {{equipped}} with a suite of specialized equipment to generate the precisely timed signals used to modulate / drive the transmitting equipment.

50|$|A {{frequency}} counter is an electronic instrument, or component of one, {{that is used}} for measuring frequency.

50|$|The pulse {{repetition}} rate was historically determined {{based on the}} response time needed for electromechanical switching systems to operate reliably.

50|$|It was not {{previously}} possible to combine high pulse energy with high repetition rate. The Vulcan {{was a high}} pulse, low repetition (in order of pulse per hour) laser.

50|$|These first “Pin-Bar” TEA lasers, {{operating}} at around one <b>pulse</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> were easy and cheap to construct. By {{operating at}} atmospheric pressure, complex vacuum and gas-handling systems could be avoided. They could produce MW peak powers {{of a few}} 100 ns duration capable of breaking down air if brought to a focus with a short focal-length lens. Disadvantages were poor gain symmetry, dissipation in the resistors and size.|$|R
50|$|Many master clocks {{include the}} {{capability}} to synchronize devices like computers to the master clock signal. Common features include the transmission of the time via RS-232, a Network Time Protocol, or a <b>Pulse</b> <b>Per</b> <b>Second</b> (PPS) contact.
