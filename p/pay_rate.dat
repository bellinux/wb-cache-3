5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> in economic growth. A trend decline in government <b>pay</b> <b>rates,</b> expressed relative to what an economy can afford, is identified in many developing countries. The decline is attributed to the erosion of economic rents. Drawing on the theoretical insights of the Harris- Todaro two sector model, the study argues that static and dynamic benefits from the erosion of rents would lead to a negative relationship between government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> and economic growth. Utilizing the pooled regression models as well as the feasible two-stage generalized method of moments estimator, the study concludes that relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> are negatively related with economic growth in developing countries; hence, high government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> penalize economic growth.

40|$|The {{search for}} the optimal form of {{government}} has long {{attracted the attention of}} economists. As of the late 1980 s, empirical studies of the size of government were weighted to the view that the international trend to larger governments was impeding economic growth. This view has been contested by more recent studies drawing on endogenous growth theory and improved estimation techniques. This study highlights the importance of government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> as well as government size. International panel data indicate that an international trend to higher government employment shares has been associated with a decline in government relative <b>pay</b> <b>rates.</b> This study hypothesized rents have been embedded in government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> in many developing countries and that static and dynamic benefits of the erosion of these rents embodied would lead to a negative relationship between relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> and economic growth in developing countries. This hypothesis follows the theoretical framework of the Harris-Todaro two sector model. Utilizing the pooled regression models as well as the feasible two-stage generalized method of moments estimator, the study concludes that relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> are indeed negatively related with economic growth in developing countries; hence, high government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> penalize the economic growth.

25|$|Vancouver was {{the site}} of major {{celebrations}} in 1936, in part to bolster civic spirit {{in the midst of the}} depression, as well as to celebrate Vancouver’s Jubilee. Mayor McGeer provoked considerable controversy by organizing expensive celebrations at a time when the city was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and civic employees were working at a significantly reduced <b>pay</b> <b>rate.</b> Nevertheless, he did find a great deal of support from those that agreed a celebration would ultimately be good for the city’s prosperity. While some large expenditures were roundly criticized – for example, the “ugly” fountain erected in Stanley Park’s Lost Lagoon – others drew significant financial and public support, such as the construction of a new (and the current) city hall on Cambie Street. The next major civic celebration was the 1939 Royal visit of the King and Queen as part of their tour of Canada which marked the end of the depression and the likelihood of another world war.|$|E
25|$|In early 1980, Byrne did {{his first}} work for DC Comics, penciling {{the first issue}} of The Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries. Byrne had always wanted to draw Batman, and had a three-month window of time during which he was not under {{contract}} to Marvel. Hearing about the Untold Legend series, Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest. DC took him up on his offer, {{but it was not until}} the second month of his three-month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue. Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel <b>pay</b> <b>rate,</b> after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate. Byrne penciled the first issue, which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended for Terry Austin. This experience soured Byrne on DC for quite some time.|$|E
25|$|Airline unions fought Lorenzo and Continental {{at every}} step. In the Federal courts, they un{{successful}}ly sued {{to stop the}} company's reorganization. They were successful in working to persuade Congress to pass a new bankruptcy law preventing bankrupt companies from terminating contracts as Continental had successfully done, but the law {{was too late to}} affect Continental. Lorenzo took Continental into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 23, 1983, after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a lower <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> with labor unions. Chapter 11 saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs. Continental became vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but employee attitudes and loyalty were adversely affected. By the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50million profit. Pilots went on strike in 1983, but were unsuccessful due to Continental pilots and new hires who crossed the picket line.|$|E

A 2012 {{agreement}} between the BBC, the Writers' Guild of Great Britain and the Personal Managers' Association set out the <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> for EastEnders scripts as £137.70 per minute of transmission time (£4,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 percent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series. The writers would be paid 75 percent of that fee for any repeats of the episode. In 2011, {{it was reported that}} actors receive a per-episode fee of between £400 and £1,200, and are guaranteed a certain number of episodes per year, perhaps as few as 30 or as many as 100, therefore annual salaries could range from £12,000 to £200,000 depending on the popularity of a character. Some actors' salaries were leaked in 2006, revealing that Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Fowler) was paid £150,000, Cliff Parisi (Minty Peterson) received £220,000, Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) and Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) each received £360,000 and Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler) had a salary of £370,000. In 2017, it was revealed that Danny Dyer (Mick Carter) and Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale) were the highest paid actors in EastEnders, earning between £200,000 and £249,999, followed by Laurie Brett (Jane Beale), Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts), Tameka Empson (Kim Fox), Linda Henry (Shirley Carter), Scott Maslen (Jack Branning), Diane Parish (Denise Fox), Gillian Taylforth (Kathy Beale) and Lacey Turner (Stacey Slater), earning between £150,000 and £199,999.|$|E
500|$|Henneberger gave Wright {{full control}} of Weird Tales, and did not get {{involved}} with story selection. [...] In about 1921, Wright had begun to suffer from Parkinson's disease, and {{over the course of}} his editorship the symptoms grew gradually worse. [...] By the end of the 1920s he was unable to sign his name, and by the late 1930s Bill Sprenger was helping him get to work and back home. [...] The first issue with Wright as editor was dated November 1924, and the magazine immediately resumed a regular monthly schedule, with the format changing back to pulp again. [...] The <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> was initially low, with a cap of half a cent per word until 1926, when the top rate was increased to one cent per word. [...] Some of Popular Fiction Publishing's debts were paid off over time, and the highest <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> eventually rose to one and a half cents per word. [...] Although Popular Fiction Publishing continued to be based in Chicago, the editorial offices were in Indianapolis for a while, at two separate addresses, but moved to Chicago towards the end of 1926.

Landsborough {{was concerned about}} the workload, and also felt {{it would be difficult to}} find enough good material; Hamilton refused to increase the <b>pay</b> <b>rate,</b> which was not high enough to attract the best stories. A compromise was reached, and Authentic was born as a monthly magazine in paperback format, with a single novel and a short editorial feature in each issue, plus an occasional short story.

500|$|The {{last few}} years of Galaxys life were marked by stories of unpaid contributors. John Varley, for example, {{reported}} {{that he was still}} owed money for his stories five years after they appeared. [...] Submissions from well-known writers fell away, and the lack of financial support from UPD meant that the <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> was an unattractive one cent per word. [...] Higher postal rates, higher paper costs, and continuing competition from the paperback science fiction market all added to the pressure on Galaxy. These problems were not resolved by the sale to McCaffrey, who did not even have enough money to pay for circulation postage, with the result that not every Galaxy subscriber received a copy of the final issue. [...] Frederik Pohl places the blame for Galaxys demise on Arnie Abramson, who, Pohl contends, [...] "simply did not perform [...] basic functions of a publisher": paying the authors, ensuring subscribers received copies, and meeting other obligations.|$|E

[...] Two other magazines launched at about the same time, Cosmic Stories and Stirring Science Stories, edited by Donald A. Wollheim, both paid nothing at all to writers, on the basis that if the magazines were successful, money might be available in the future. [...] This annoyed Tremaine, and Isaac Asimov, who gave Wollheim a story for Cosmic Stories, later recalled Tremaine telling him that [...] "any author who donated stories to Wollheim, and thus contributed to the destruction of competing magazines who paid, should be blacklisted in the field". [...] Asimov was sufficiently upset that he later obtained token payment from Wollheim so that he could assert he had been paid for his story.|$|E

[...] Weinberg regards Dolgov's illustration for Robert Bloch's [...] "Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper" [...] as one of his best works. [...] Weird Tales paper was of very poor quality, which meant that the reproductions were poor, and along with the low <b>pay</b> <b>rate</b> for art this meant that many artists treated Weird Tales as a last resort for their work. [...] Damon Knight, who sold some interior artwork to Weird Tales in the early 1940s, recalled later that he was paid $5 for a single-page drawing, and $10 for a double-page spread; he worked slowly and the low pay meant Weird Tales was not a viable market for him.|$|E
