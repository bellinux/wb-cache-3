40|$|Abstract: A {{self-reconfigurable}} robot is {{a robotic}} device {{that can change}} its own shape. Self-reconfigurable robots are commonly built from multiple identical modules that can manipulate each other to change {{the shape of the}} robot. The robot can also perform tasks such as locomotion without changing shape. Pro-gramming a modular, self-reconfigurable robot is however a complicated task: the robot is essentially a real-time, distributed embedded system, where con-trol and communication paths often are tightly coupled to the current physical configuration of the robot. To facilitate the task of programming modular, self-reconfigurable robots, we are currently developing a functional, domain-specific language that allows the programmer to use pattern matching and higher-order functions to program closely coordinated groups of modules. In more detail, higher-order functions are used to specify behaviors that are applied to groups of modules and a distributed pattern matching mechanism is used to select specific behaviors from these functions depending {{on the state of the}} individual modules. We have implemented our language for a virtual machine running on the ATRON self-reconfigurable robot. 1 Presented at TFP’ 08, published in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>proceeding...</b>|$|E

Child witnesses are often treated with greater distrust than adult witnesses as, according to traditional views, they don't have the same observing and mnemonic ability, they are more vulnerable to leading questions and they have difficulty in distinguishing reality from fantasy as well as truth from lie. The whole of literature emphasizes the responsibility of the interviewer who will determine the course of the interview and have a significant effect upon the disclosure procedure. His personal characteristics as well as his specialized knowledge and counselling skills will play a major role.

40|$|The {{proposal}} {{to develop a}} new city at Monarto in South Australia during the 1970 s was an important project of the reforming government of Don Dunstan. Dunstan’s view was that Monarto would be a city environmentally suited to the tough conditions of its site, and to an ‘Australian way of life’. As planning and <b>preliminary</b> design <b>proceeded</b> from 1972 to 1975, the landscape potential of the city’s selected site became central to its conception. This paper draws on new research comprising interviews with key participants and archival material to examine four issues: the adoption of an environmental orientation in Australian urban planning and discourse in the 1970 s; strategies in the design proposals that seemingly gave Monarto validity even as the demographic and political drivers for it dissolved away; the investigations that supported Monarto’s landscape strategies; and attitudes to social and cultural history that the Monarto project adopted. While ultimately the plan for Monarto was abandoned, the projected city’s landscape {{can be seen as a}} theatre for competing values in relation to natural and cultural heritage and design ambitions. The paper situates Monarto within national and international urban discourse that is more complex than has been previously acknowledged, indicative of competing values and ideologies in the planning, landscape and design discourses of the period...|$|R

40|$|The {{restriction}} of fish movement along the streams of south-eastern Australia {{is an important}} planning and management issue. All 66 indigenous freshwater fishes in this region require some degree of passage along streams. Fish movement has been impeded by many dams and weirs, built {{in response to a}} climate of low and variable rainfall. While 47 fishways have been built in the region, most have been ineffective. A particular difficulty in providing fish passage in coastal systems is the abundance of catadromous and amphidromous fishes, whose young must migrate upstream past barriers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Steric stabilisers were synthesised via the copolymerisation of styrene with acrylic macromonomers. The macromonomers were prepared by end capping reactions of poly 2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate (PEHA) prepolymer with vinyl containing species. <b>Preliminary</b> reaction routes <b>proceeded</b> via the use of oxalyl chloride to create an acyl chloride intermediate followed by end capping with hydroxy ethyl methacrylate. This process {{was found to be}} inefficient due to the moisture sensitivity of the acyl chloride. The second route involved the direct end capping of the PEHA pre-polymer with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). Macromonomer conversion levels were improved for the GMA route via the use of high temperatures and tertiary amine catalysts. An optimum set of conditions was achieved using 1. 4 diazabicyclo [2. 2. 2. ] octane as the catalyst and a reaction temperature of 160 QC. Non aqueous dispersion polymerisations of methyl methacrylate were performed. The factors affecting particle size in both single stage and twin stage polymerisation schemes were studied. Increases in the particle sizes of these dispersions were observed with increases in the total monomer concentration and also with decreases in the total stabiliser concentration. Increases in the particle size could also be achieved by increasing the proportion of the total monomer in the seed stage of the twin stage reaction and also by decreasing the proportion of the total stabiliser in the seed stage. The importance {{of the role of the}} seed upon the final particle size was firmly established. The rheology of these non aqueous dispersions was studied over a range of concentrations and under increasing shear stresses. At Iow and intennediate volume fractions the dispersions were observed to be predominantly Newtonian. Non-Newtonian behaviour was only observed at the extremes of the shear stress ranges studied. At high volume fractions of the dispersions non-Newtonian behaviour was observed over the range of shear stresses studied. Maximum volume fractions (m) were calculated for these dispersions using the Kreiger-Dougherty equation. When these dispersions were blended in size ratios of 2 : 1 it was observed that 4 >m could be increased due to improved particle packing efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between financial reporting choices of not-for-profit (NFP) hospitals and bond financing and tax exemption decisions. The model empirically tested is that NFP hospital bond financing and tax exemption decisions are a function of reported earnings, which are a function of financial reporting choices. Observations from practice suggest that hospitals have adopted reporting practices for affiliated entities that affect reported profitability which may affect users 2 ̆ 7 decisions. ^ Fixation theory suggests that decision makers {{may be influenced by}} the form of financial reporting rather than its economic substance. Based on fixation theory, two sets of NFP hospital financial statements (based on actual data) were prepared that changed the form of reporting for affiliated entities, but not the economic substance (i. e., profitability and cash flows). ^ Using a between-subject design, members of quasi-governmental bond financing authorities made decisions about whether the NFP hospital should be granted <b>preliminary</b> approval to <b>proceed</b> with bond financing. Findings revealed that the form of disclosure did not appear to influence bond authority members 2 ̆ 7 decisions. ^ Tax practitioners from public accounting firms made decisions about whether the NFP hospital should maintain federal and state income tax, and local property tax exemptions. A between-subject design was used with cases at two dimensions; i. e., report form as in the bond financing task, and level of charitable care (high or low). Findings revealed that the main effects of report form and charitable care do not independently appear to affect tax exemption decisions. ^ However, a significant interaction between report form and charitable care was found for all three types of tax. This finding suggests that fixation on reported profitability is mediated by the level of charitable care. Low amounts of charitable care coupled with high reported earnings may trigger a challenge to a hospital 2 ̆ 7 s tax-exempt status. Thus, users 2 ̆ 7 decisions appear to be affected by the form of reporting rather than its economic substance. This finding has implications for accounting standard setting bodies that have been working to develop better criteria and disclosure practices for consolidation that includes NFP organizations. ...|$|R
