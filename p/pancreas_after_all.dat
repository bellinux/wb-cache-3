40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{pancreas}} transplantation on diabetic retinopathy remains inconclusive. Herein, we report six patients with {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus (DM) who underwent pancreas transplantation and developed acute macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate with rapid progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, diabetic patients who underwent pancreas transplantation in a single medical center and developed symptomatic acute macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate within 3 months after the operation were enrolled. The complete ophthalmic course and medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Diabetic retinopathy and progression following treatment <b>after</b> <b>pancreas</b> transplantation were measured. Results: Six Chinese women with type 1 DM were enrolled in this study. Mean hemoglobin (Hb) A 1 c was 13. 4 % prior to transplantation and decreased rapidly to 6. 5 % within 2 months postsurgery. The patients had no or mild pretransplant diabetic retinopathy and developed acute symptomatic macular edema and peripapillary soft exudate in both eyes <b>after</b> <b>pancreas</b> transplantation. <b>All</b> macular edema resolved either with or without treatment. Five cases progressed to proliferative diabetic retinopathy and received panretinal photocoagulation. Diabetic retinopathy remained stable in <b>all</b> eyes <b>after</b> treatment, and the visual prognosis was good, except in one eye that had macular branch retinal artery occlusion with foveal involvement. Conclusion: Acute macular edema <b>after</b> <b>pancreas</b> transplantation has a favorable treatment outcome despite rapid progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|During embryogenesis, the {{pancreas}} develops from separate dorsal and ventral buds, which fuse {{to form the}} mature pancreas. Little {{is known about the}} functional differences between these two buds or the relative contribution of cells derived from each region to the <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> fusion. To follow the fate of dorsal or ventral bud derived cells in the <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> fusion, we produced chimeric Elas-GFP transgenic/wild-type embryos in which either dorsal or ventral pancreatic bud cells expressed GFP. We found that ventral pancreatic cells migrate extensively into the dorsal <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> fusion, whereas the converse does not occur. Moreover, we found that annular pancreatic tissue is composed exclusively of ventral pancreas-derived cells. To identify ventral pancreas-specific genes that {{may play a role in}} pancreatic bud fusion, we isolated individual dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds, prior to fusion, from NF 38 / 39 Xenopus laevis tadpoles and compared their gene expression profiles (NF refers to the specific stage of Xenopus development). As a result of this screen, we have identified several new ventral pancreas-specific genes, all of which are expressed in the same location within the ventral pancreas at the junction where the two ventral pancreatic buds fuse. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of one of these ventral-specific genes, transmembrane 4 superfamily member 3 (tm 4 sf 3), inhibited dorsal-ventral pancreatic bud fusion, as well as acinar cell differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of tm 4 sf 3 promoted development of annular pancreas. Our results are the first to define molecular and behavioral differences between the dorsal and ventral pancreas, and suggest an unexpected role for the ventral pancreas in pancreatic bud fusion...|$|R

40|$|Repeated pancreatectomy for {{pancreatic}} carcinoma {{is extremely}} rare. We report two such patients who underwent pancreatectomy for carcinoma developing in the pancreatic remnant after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PpPD) for invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma. One patient underwent PpPD for invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a low-density {{mass in the}} remnant pancreas, which was diagnosed as a carcinoma by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology 5 years 10 months after PpPD.

The tumor shrank, and the patient underwent curative resection of the remnant pancreas 3 years 1 month after the initial operation.

Similar results were presented in another study, where the organosomatic indices of the brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, spleen and stomach from mice exposed to LDH nanoparticle via the oral route were remarkably unaffected even at 2, 000  mg/kg of the nanoparticle concentration [32]. However, in a related study, an inorganic nanodelivery system of zinc oxide was shown to cause weight loss in the heart, lung, kidneys, spleen, liver and <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> oral administration [29].

40|$|Abstract- There {{had been}} {{few if any}} study for second {{pancreas}} transplant outcome and consequences in patients with simultaneous kidney <b>pancreas</b> transplant <b>after</b> failure of the first pancreas allograft. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the patient and graft survival and clinical outcomes and complication of the second pancreas transplant in patients with simultaneous kidney pancreas, compared with <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> kidney transplantation in patients with no history of previous failed pancreas graft failure. Two groups of patients, patients with simultaneous kidney pancreas transplantation with pancreas graft failure (11 patients) and kidney transplant patients with no history of previous pancreas transplant having first pancreas transplantation (6 patients) were statistically compared. Immediate and short time difference in survival rate between group 1 and group 2 was 63 % and 33 %, respectively. The difference was attributable to more vascular thrombosis ending in graft loss in group 1, but this dose not achieve a statistical significance (P = 0. 7); although long term survival rate difference was more evident and significant (P = 0. 002). The only other statistically difference found between two groups was the donor’s age with a P value of 0. 02, in favor of the patients in group 2, who have received grafts from younger donors. The long term pancreas graft survival rate in patients with the history of previous pancreas transplantation in the setting of SKP is worse than pancreas graft survival in previously kidney transplanted patients, receiving their first <b>pancreas</b> in <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> kidney setting...|$|R

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{whether and}} how IGF-I {{is involved in the}} regeneration of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> partial pancreatectomy, IGF-I mRNA expression, IGF-I protein synthesis, orni-thine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and DNA replication in the remnant pancreas were determined in the dog. After pancreatectomy, IGF-I mRNA expression was re-markably enhanced in the remnant pancreas, showing the maximal value at post-operative day (POD) 1. Subse-quently, IGF-I synthesis in the tissue was significantly stimulated at POD 2, and its maximal concentration was observed at POD 3. Following IGF-I synthesis, ODC activity was induced and its maximal activity was also obtained at POD 3. Finally, DNA replication was induced in the remnant pancreas, and its maximal level was observed at POD 5. These responses in the remnant pancreatic tissue to partial pancreatectomy were greatly enhanced as the resection rate was increased up to 95 %. Positive correlations were observed between IGF-I con-centrations in the remnant pancreas and the activities of ODC and DNA synthesis in the tissue after 95 % pancrea-tectomy. These results suggest that the gene expression of IGF-I is rapidly induced in the remnant <b>pancreas</b> <b>after</b> partial pancreatectomy, and subsequently synthesized en-dogenous IGF-I peptides may stimulate ODC and other cell growth-related activities in the tissue in paracrine and/or autocrine manners eventually to induce DNA replication and tissue regeneration...|$|R

We analyzed the three groups (PAK, KTA-E, KTA-I) for differences in patient characteristics, glycemic control, renal function, patient and kidney graft survival rates, and causes of death. Kidney graft survival rates (actuarial) were similar in the PAK vs. KTA-E groups at one, five, and 10 yr post-transplant: 98 %, 82 %, and 67 % (PAK) vs. 100 %, 84 %, and 62 % (KTA-E) (p = 0. 9).
