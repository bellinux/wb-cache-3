The remains were found after {{the construction of a}} road between the villages of Miragaia and Sobral. The rear half of the skeleton was probably destroyed by the roadcut. The fossils were dug up in August 1999 and August 2001. Among the recovered bones were most of the snout, a right postorbital, both angulars of the lower jaws, fifteen neck vertebrae (the first two, which articulated with the skull, were absent), two anterior dorsal vertebrae, twelve ribs, a chevron, the shoulder bones, most of the forelimbs including a possible os carpi intermedium, a right first metacarpal and three first phalanges; and thirteen bony plates plus a spike. The bones were not articulated but dispersed over a surface of about five to seven metres, though there was a <b>partial</b> <b>concentration</b> of fossils that could be salvaged within a single block. ML433 was found in the Miragaia Unit of the Sobral Unit, Lourinhã Formation, which dates to the late Kimmeridgian-early Tithonian (Late Jurassic, approximately 150million years ago).|$|E

Pentobarbital solutions and water were concurrently available on identical reinforcement schedules from separate liquid-delivery systems during 3 -hour sessions. Under a fixed-ratio 16 schedule of drug availability, a descending series of drug concentrations was tested (4, 2, 1, 0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125, and 0. 0625 mg/ml, followed by a retest at 4 mg/ml). <b>Partial</b> <b>concentration</b> series beginning with the highest concentration were repeated with fixed-ratios of 32 and 64, with a fixed-ratio 128 for two monkeys, and with fixed-ratio 256 for one.

Drug intake (mg/kg/session) increased directly with drug concentration. As the fixed-ratio size was increased, the number of liquid deliveries decreased. For each drug concentration, when the numbers of drug deliveries at fixed-ratios of 32, 64, and 128 responses were plotted as percentages of those obtained at fixed-ratio 16, the following orderly relationship emerged: the higher the drug concentration, the less that drug deliveries were decreased by increases in fixed-ratio size.

40|$|Background: In {{conventional}} {{approaches to}} plastid and mitochondrial genome sequencing, the sequencing steps are performed separately; thus, plastid DNA (ptDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{should be prepared}} independently. However, {{it is difficult to}} extract pure ptDNA and mtDNA from plant tissue. Following the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, many researchers have attempted to obtain plastid genomes or mitochondrial genomes using high-throughput sequencing data from total DNA. Unfortunately, the huge datasets generated consume massive computing and storage resources and cost a great deal, and even more importantly, excessive pollution reads affect the accuracy of the assembly. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method that can generate base sequences from plant tissue and that is suitable for all plant species.

40|$|The <b>partial</b> <b>concentration</b> index (PCI) is {{commonly}} used {{as a measure of}} income related inequality in health after removing the effects of standardising variables such as age and gender which affect health, are correlated with income, but not amenable to policy. Both direct and indirect standardisation have been used to remove the effects of standardising variables. The paper shows that with individual level data direct standardisation is possible using the coefficients from a linear regression of health on income and the standardising variables and yields a consistent estimate of the PCI. Indirect standardisation estimates the effects of the standardising variables on health from a health regression which excludes income. The coefficients on the standardising variables include some of the effects of income on health if income is correlated with the standardising variables. Using these coefficients to remove the effects of the standardising variables also removes some of the effect of income on health and leads to an inconsistent estimate of the PCI. Indirect standardisation underestimates the PCI irrespective of the signs of the correlations of standardising variables and income {{with each other and with}} health. An adaptation of the PCI when the marginal effect of income on health depends on the standardising variables is also proposed. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

Design: The relation between individual health and a non-linear transformation of equivalised income, allowing for sex, age, country, and year effects, was estimated by multiple regression. The share of health attributable to transformed income and the Gini coefficient for transformed income were calculated. Inequality in health {{was measured by}} the <b>partial</b> <b>concentration</b> index, which is the product of the. Gini coefficient and the share of health attributable to transformed income. Participants and setting: Representative annual samples of the adult population living in private households in Great Britain 1979 - 1995. The total analysed sample was 299 968 people. Main results: Pro-rich health inequality was largest in Wales and smallest in England over the period because the effect of increased income on health was greatest in Wales and least in England. In all three countries, pro-rich health inequality increased throughout the period. In the early 1980 s this was primarily attributable to increases in income inequality. Thereafter the increased share of health attributable to income was the principal cause. Conclusions: Reductions in pro-rich health inequality can be achieved by reducing income inequality, reducing the effect of income on health, or both...|$|E

The Newman model [1, 2] has been modified to include a continuous solvent reduction reaction responsible for the capacity fade and power fade. The temperature variation inside the cell is accurately predicted using a distributed thermal model coupled with the internal chemical heat generation. The model is further improved by linking the porosity variation with the electrolyte <b>partial</b> molar <b>concentration,</b> thereby proving a stronger coupling between the battery performance and the chemical properties of electrolyte. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer growth is estimated for different cut-off voltages and charging current rates.

The choice of an electrolyte decides the conductivity and <b>partial</b> molar <b>concentration,</b> which is found to have a strong influence on the capacity fade of the battery.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of Na and NO on the (0001) surface of graphite {{and the influence}} of coadsorbed water on these reactions have been studied by thermal desorption spectroscopy. The products of the NO+Na reactions are dependent on the <b>partial</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the initial coadsorbed layer. For NO:Na dose ratios less than 1 : 1, N 2 formation is dominant. For higher NO doses, this is superseded by N 2 O formation. In all cases sodium is oxidized by the NO. This leads to carbonate formation, which subsequently decomposes to release CO 2 and CO. The addition of H 2 O at low coverages to the Na+NO system complicates the reactions. It results in ammonia formation by two independent mechanisms. The formation of NH 3 is strongly dependent on the water dose. In addition to generating NH 3, coadsorbed water alters the sodium oxidation pathway resulting in an enhanced formation of CO 2 at certain coverages. Large H 2 O coverages block the NO reaction pathways by forming an inert "hypermetalated" hydroxide overlayer. The surface composition of this hydroxide is of the type Na 2 OH or Na 3 OH. Decomposition of this overlayer results in the desorption of a significant fraction of stable Na 2 OH molecules...|$|R

Moreover, a new microwave assisted method was used to synthesize La(1 -x) Ca(,) M(x) nO(3) (LCM) perovskites with various calcium content (x = 0. 2 and 0. 4). Then, the physicochemical properties of the materials such as crystal structure, particle size, surface area, reducibility and band gap energy were investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), High resolution Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscope (HR-SEM and HR-TEM), BET analysis, Temperature-programmed Reduction (TPR) and UV-visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-VIS DRS). The increase in <b>partial</b> <b>concentration</b> of calcium resulted in a high specific surface area, larger particle size and an enhanced reducibility along {{with an increase in}} the band gap energy. In addition, cyclic voltammetry was applied to LM and LCM perovskites to determine the effect of calcium incorporation on the capacitance of the electrochemical cell. It showed that the capacitance decreases with the amount of Ca 2 + incorporated into the LM structure. This effect is linked to the formation of Mn 4 +, which hinders the electron transfer in the structure. The decline in the charge transfer is revealed by the specific capacitance. Finally, our findings showed that the microwave assisted method provides a green, efficient and time-saving route for perovskite synthesis and the calcium incorporation induces a negative effect on the capacitance properties of the LM perovskites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective The {{objective}} of this retrospective descriptive study was to assess overall survival and disease free survival of patients treated for epithelial ovarian cancer by a gynaecologic-oncologist in a single Dutch peripheral teaching hospital and to identify independent prognostic factors. Study design A retrospective series of 242 patients treated for epithelial ovarian cancer between 1999 and 2011 at Meander Medical Centre was reviewed. Data on patient, tumour and treatment characteristics were collected. Outcomes were overall survival and progression free survival. Data were analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method, log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. Results Median follow-up was 35 months (range 1 – 203). Staging procedures were performed in 81 patients of which 63 % were complete. 61 % of patients had advanced stage disease. In 46 %, debulking surgery was complete. Five-year overall survival and progression free survival for all patients was 52 % and 47 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified performance status [HR = 1. 89 and 1. 92 for performance status 2, HR = 7. 01 and 2. 69 for performance status 3], FIGO stage [HR = 3. 59 for stage II, HR = 5. 43 and 5. 64 for stage III, HR = 12. 17 and 10. 21 for stage IV] and residual disease after debulking surgery [HR = 2. 01 and 1. 72 for incomplete debulking] as independent prognostic factors for overall survival and progression free survival respectively.
