50|$|Leaving Pelzer {{in charge}} {{turned into a}} {{disaster}} very soon. On Nov. 19, 1847, a group of <b>Pawnees</b> were camped about one-fourth of {{a mile from the}} fort. The soldiers were assembled inside the fort walls. After Sixty-five or so <b>Pawnees,</b> under a white flag, approached the assembled troops were dismissed. Pelzer and some of the officers ventured outside the walls to meet the Indians and a peace pipe was eventually passed amongst the <b>Pawnees</b> and officers.|$|R
50|$|The {{region of}} present-day Red Cloud was {{intermittently}} occupied {{and used as}} hunting grounds by the <b>Pawnees</b> until 1833. In that year, a treaty was signed in which the <b>Pawnees</b> surrendered their lands south of the Platte River. According to George Hyde, {{it is likely that}} the <b>Pawnees</b> did not realize that they were thereby giving up their lands, and that they were led to believe that they were only granting the Delawares and other relocated tribes permission to hunt in the area.|$|R

5|$|However, in one scene, a <b>Pawnee</b> {{character}} {{is accompanied by}} a voiceover in Inupiak, which is spoken in Arctic Alaska, thousands of kilometers away and a different language family from <b>Pawnee.</b> The voiceover was taken from a John Luther Adams recording; the words originally came from an Inuit woman named Uvavnuk, an angakkuq (shaman) and oral poet.|$|E

60|$|As {{illustrations}} {{of the general}} theory here presented, we may now take two tribal religions among the North American Indians. The first {{is that of the}} equestrian <b>Pawnees,</b> who, thirty years ago, were dwelling on the Loup Fork in Nebraska. The buffaloes have since been destroyed, the lands seized, and the <b>Pawnees</b> driven into a 'Reservation,' where they are, or lately were, cheated and oppressed in the usual way. They were originally known to Europeans in four hordes, the fourth being the Skidi or Wolf <b>Pawnees.</b> They seem to have come into Kansas and Nebraska, at a date relatively remote, from Mexico, and are allied with the Lipans and Tonkaways of that region. The Tonkaways are a tribe who, in a sacred mystery, are admonished to 'live like the wolves,' {{in exactly the same way}} as were the Hirpi (wolf tribe), of Mount Soracte, who practised the feat of walking unhurt through fire.[6] The Tonkaways regard the <b>Pawnees,</b> who also have a wolf tribe, as a long-separated branch of their race. If, then, they are of Mexican origin, we might expect to find traces of Aztec ritual among the <b>Pawnees.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{neighboring}} Osages {{were not}} so affected, as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present-day Illinois.

The <b>Pawnees</b> moved northward into Nebraska, possibly because of news that modern weapons were available from traders on the Platte.|$|R
