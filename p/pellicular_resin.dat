40|$|AbstractIt is {{generally}} accepted that in frog full-grown oocytes glycolysis is absent and that carbon metabolic flux is largely directed to glycogen synthesis. Use of an anion exchange <b>pellicular</b> <b>resin</b> for analytical resolution of intermediates in perchloric acid extracts of oocytes has {{allowed us to}} observe the formation of labelled lactate after microinjection of [U- 14 C]glucose. Further, formation of [32 P]ATP was observed after microinjection of 32 P-labelled glucose- 6 -P, fructose- 6 -P or fructose- 1, 6 -bis-P, either in {{the presence or absence}} of 0. 1 mM cyanide. The presence of phosphofructokinase activity, previously thought to be absent in oocytes, is also reported. These findings indicate that glycolysis to lactate is operative in frog oocytes...|$|E
40|$|Chromatographic techniques, and in {{particular}} ion-exchange methods, have long been used {{for the analysis of}} inorganic ions using diverse monitoring techniques such as conductivity, polarography and spectrophotometry. A major advance in this field occurred in 1975, when Small et al. described a novel system for the chromatographic determination of inorganic ions, in which a specially developed <b>pellicular</b> <b>resin</b> was used to effect the separation and a second ion-exchange column to reduce the background conductivity of the eluent in order to improve the detection limits for the eluted analyte ions. This system, which is described in detail later, illustrated the enormous potential of chromatography for inorganic ion analysis and deservedly received considerable research attention for some years. An important side effect of this development was to stimulate greatly research into alternative chromatographic methods suitable for inorganic ions, and over the past 7 years a considerable volume of material has been published. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to review these alternative methods, and therefore those articles which employ the same or a similar technique to that used by Small et al. will be discussed only briefly in order to provide a basis for comparison with other methods. Further to the above specific restriction, this review will be confined to a discussion of methods that are chiefly applicable to anion analysis, because until very recently these methods have far outnumbered those for cation analysis. The preponderance of research into chromatographic methods for anions strongly reflects the paucity of alternative analytical procedures. This situation does not apply to cations, for which a number of excellent rapid and sensitive spectroscopic techniques (such as atomic-absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometry) and electrochemical methods (such as polarography and anodic-stripping voltammetry) are available. Moreover, many of these are multi-element techniques and so duplicate one of the chief attractions of chromatography for inorganic cation analysis. Despite this, much of the experience gained from the intensive development of chromatographic approaches to inorganic anion analysis has recently been applied successfully to inorganic cations. At this stage, however, it is fair to say that these chromatographic methods for cations are generally inferior to the existing spectroscopic and electrochemical methods mentioned above. In contrast, the use of chromatography for anion analysis has proved so successful that chromatographic methods are among the best available and have been applied to a wide range of inorganic species. This success can be attributed to concurrent advances in separation technology and detection methods, and in this review these two aspects will be described separately...|$|E
40|$|Several liquid-chromatographic systems {{involving}} anion-exchange resins and linear acetate {{gradient elution}} {{have been reported}} previously {{for the analysis of}} ultraviolet-absorbing constituents in human urine. We describe a high-performance liquid. -chromatographic system on which a macroreticular anion-exchange resin, and stepwise elution are used. Separations were more rapid with am-monium chloride/acetonitrile stepwise elution than with acetate stepwise elution, and urine constituents could be detected at 225 nm with the former system. Analytical conditions were convenient and the method has proven to be useful for routine blinical analysis. Much useful information on body functions can be obtained by liquid-chromatographic analysis of physiologic fluids (1 - 3). Many systems have been proposed for analysis of constituents in urine (4 - 6). Katz et al. (7) showed that an anionexchange chromatographic system with ultraviolet detection, originally developed by C. D. Scott and coworkers, was a useful tool for evaluation of metabolic profiles. The analysis time was dras-tically reduced to 8 h by using sequential columns of micro-reticular and <b>pellicular</b> <b>resins</b> (8). Sets (9, 10) further proposed a liquid-chromatographic system with a macroreticular anion-exchange resin by which 100 ultraviolet-absorbing constituents in human urine could be separated within 2 h. In these liquid-chromatographic systems, constituents were separated by linear acetate gradient elution. The baseline of the chromatograms driftedsignificantly,because ofultraviolet absorption at 254 nm by the eluent, ammonium acetate. It seemed that detection at a shorter wavelength than 254 nm would be difficult in these systems. We report a high-performance liquid-chromatographic system, based on a stepwise elution,for analysis of ultravio-let-absorbing constituents in human urine, and we compare ammonium acetate with ammonium chloride/acetonitrile as the mobile phase...|$|R
40|$|Sample {{complexity}} {{is one of}} the key {{challenges facing}} contemporary proteomic analysis. A variety of methods is commonly employed to reduce this complexity, both at an intact protein and digested peptide level. For complex lysates containing many thousands of proteins, orthogonal (mutually independent), multidimensional separation methods must be employed to provide sufficient resolution to characterize the appropriate number of different species. The most common of these methods are two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DGE) of proteins and multidimensional liquid chromatographic separation (MuDPIT) of peptides, which rely on isoelectric focusing followed by mass separation in the former, and ion exchange followed by reversed phase separation in the latter. These methods have significant drawbacks in terms of sample bias, sample preparation and reproducibility, and therefore a new methodology that combines the positive aspects of both separation technologies in an automatable, reproducible form is highly desirable. New developments in column technology have allowed rapid improved-resolution separation of intact proteins in complex samples, coupled to improved methodology for peptide and protein identification. The separation of complex protein mixtures using both on- and off-line 2 D liquid chromatography using derivitized polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) <b>pellicular</b> ion-exchange <b>resins</b> and PS-DVB monolithic reversed-phase columns is described. Proteolytic digestion of the fractions followed by rapid liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was used to complete the analysis. An alternative methodology, relying on direct analysis of the second dimension eluents by top-down (mass spectrometric analysis of intact proteins) methodology, using an Apex IV 12 T Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) and an HCT ion trap (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with electron transfer dissociation has allowed in-depth analysis of intact proteins. Sample types investigated to establish the utility of the methodology include bacterial lysates (Bordetella parapertusis, and Escherichia coli), a eukaryotic parasite (Leishmania donovani), and transformed human cell lines. These developments lead to a multidimensional intact protein separation methodology suitable for small-sample proteomics (minimum effective protein load of 200 μg) and good reproducibility (1. 5 % variation in the ion exchange dimension, 0. 5 % variation in the reversed phase dimension). Analysis of the digested fractions gave good coverage of the proteome as well as a high predicted dynamic range, capable of detecting proteins with codon adaptation index scores ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 99, out of a logarithmic scale from 0 to 1. Proteins representing low (8 kDa) and high (500 kDa) molecular mass and extremes of predicted pI were identified, as well as a number of membrane proteins. Resolution of the overall protein separation was such that single protein species often occurred in one or two fractions for both the ion-exchange and reversed phase separations, with the fractions varying in complexity. Separation of modified proteins in the ion-exchange dimension demonstrated separation of isoforms. Most analyses coupled anion-exchange chromatography in the first dimension to monolithic reversed phase separation in the second dimension. To provide alternative first dimension methodologies for specific sample types, external gradient chromatofocussing (based on separation by isoelectric point) and high-pH ion-pair reversed phase were evaluated as additional techniques. In particular the pISEP (CryoBioPhysica) technique for chromatofocussing constituted an effective orthogonal separation methodology for separation, and its use in a proteomics context was compared to that of the original anion-exchange, reversed phase technology. To rapidly analyse the large number of fractions generated by the technique, bottom-up protocols required improvements in the throughput of peptide separations. PS-DVB monoliths were employed for rapid peptide separations and conditions for analysis were evaluated and optimized. The implementation of a parallel 200 μm monolith system for tryptic peptide separations ensured minimal sample loss and improved sample throughput with little loss of sensitivity. For simple mixtures, reversed-phase separation times could be reduced to a few minutes without significantly affecting data content, although rapid scanning capability is essential due to the very narrow peak widths. Quantitation is of paramount importance to any proteomic technique, and liquid chromatographic separation of intact proteins provides flexibility for differential analysis of complex samples. Three categories of quantitative analysis were evaluated for two dimensional intact protein separation by liquid chromatography: ultraviolet-absorbance maps, isotopic labeling and label-free computational analyses. UV-absorbance maps of wild-type and pentamidine resistant Leishmania donovani were compared using standard two dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis software and resulted in the identification of a small number of quantitiative differences. Modifications to the isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) and isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation (ITRAQ) protocols were developed to allow protein labeling prior to separation, and the related methodologies ExacTag, isotope coded protein label (ICPL) and stable isotope labels for amino acids in culture (SILAC) were evaluated. Finally, label-free techniques have been employed for protein quantitation by liquid chromatography (LC) /Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). A particular niche for liquid chromatographic separation of intact proteins is in top-down analysis, in which mass spectrometric analysis of intact proteins is performed. The separation technology was directly coupled to high-resolution FT-ICR MS for analysis of standards, mixtures, and cellular lysates, leading to the identification of an intact Leishmania protein and post-translational modification (PTM) mapping of histone H 4. In addition, the recently developed electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation methods coupled with proton transfer reaction (PTR) for charge reduction allowed analysis of standards and isotopically labeled cellular lysates using an ion trap instrument. In summary, we have developed a general proteomic methodology with unique flexibility as well as applicability to top-down analysis. It has been applied to multiple complex samples in a variety of analysis conditions including quantitation methodologies and state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques. In general, the method equals other separation methods in terms of protein identification rates, is substantially more reproducible and automated, but is more time-consuming. Currently, two dimensional intact protein separation by liquid chromatography using polystyrene-divinylbenzene-based columns is particularly applicable to top-down analysis of heavily modified proteins. However, there is considerable remaining room for optimization and improvement of methodologies, and further development will enhance the technique for general use...|$|R
