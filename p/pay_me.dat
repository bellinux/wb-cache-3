25|$|In September 2011 Massow set up <b>Pay</b> <b>Me</b> My, {{a trading}} name of Massows Limited, which offered {{customers}} a rebate of 80% of the 'trail' commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies {{to the agency}} of <b>Pay</b> <b>Me</b> My, who would take 20% as their fee. Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions {{that it would not}} be viable following changes to financial regulation in the UK due to start on 1 January 2013; however, it ceased trading in August 2013 after it announced that its business model was loss making and could not be sustained. The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated. This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission.|$|E
25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E
500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because I {{wanted to know what}} it was like to be other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E

Ron Perelman, the cosmetics firm's chief, congratulated her, saying how happy he was that she modeled for his company. She replied, [...] "Of course, you'll have to <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> more." [...] Perelman stalked off in a rage. In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity. She said, [...] "This moment is so much bigger than me. This is for every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened." ...|$|E

It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording!

[...] "He was like, hey, I'll front you the money, and we'll split the profits until you <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> back," [...] {{recalled}} Hoppus in 2001. The two had met when Secor transferred from a north San Diego location. The two became friends quickly, despite Secor's seniority of post. [...] "At that point they'd played around enough to get their chops up so I took all the money I had in savings and we went into the studio for two days," [...] said Secor.|$|E

I just wanted my brother to intimidate him so that he would continue to <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> my allowance. But he didn't {{want to have anything to}} do with it, so a violent quarrel broke out.

Well, I'm a jobbing actor... {{as long as they}} <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title". Although Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, he became known as [...] "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days". He felt his characterisations owed [...] "a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence" [...] and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of [...] "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".|$|E

500|$|After partnering {{for one of}} Kindt's {{previous}} works, , Dark Horse Publisher Mike Richardson asked Kindt {{to pitch}} another book. Kindt sent the proposal for MIND MGMT and was happy when it was accepted because Dark Horse was [...] "the only publisher able to <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> a living wage and also let me do exactly what I wanted no matter what." [...] The series was initially approved for over 50 issues, but Kindt pruned away excess material and reduced the run to 36 issues. Despite the reduction in length, the final product is still almost {{identical to the original}} pitch. Diana Schutz, editor of 3 Story, was originally slated to work with Kindt again, but the project was handed to newly promoted editor Brendan Wright very early in production. Kindt described their input as [...] "invaluable" [...] and considers Wright to be a collaborator.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s Gielgud {{appeared}} {{in more than}} twenty films. Morley singles out as noteworthy The Elephant Man (1980), {{as the chairman of}} the Royal London Hospital, Chariots of Fire (1981), as the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, Gandhi (1982), as Lord Irwin (the latter two winning Academy Awards as Best Picture), The Shooting Party (1984) and Plenty (1985), directed by David Lynch, Hugh Hudson, Richard Attenborough, Alan Bridges and Fred Schepisi respectively. Tony Palmer's Wagner (1983) was the only film in which Gielgud, Richardson, and Olivier played scenes together. Gielgud made cameo appearances in films of little merit, lending distinction while not damaging his own reputation. He told an interviewer, [...] "They <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> very well for two or three days' work a month, so why not? It's nice at my age to be able to travel all over the world at other people's expense." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury {{at the end}} of {{the film}} Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an {{unprecedented}} nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios. However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> if they're gonna put my name in it. Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as [...] "connective tissue" [...] for The Avengers.

Immediately {{after winning}} the Interim Heavyweight title, Mir found Lesnar in the crowd and shouted, [...] "You've got my belt".

Lesnar also made a disparaging comment about the pay-per-view's primary sponsor Bud Light, claiming they [...] "won't <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> nothin and promoted Coors Light instead. Lesnar later apologized for his remarks at the post-fight press conference, where he held a bottle of Bud Light and endorsed their product.|$|E

Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include [...] "They didn't <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> enough", and [...] "They weren't that nice". In late 2007, reports emerged claiming that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January. According to a Fox News article, Hayes' agent Christina Kimball, herself a practicing Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park. Stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, commenting that [...] "There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him, and I believe it... It was a brutal, up-close, personal thing with Isaac. If you look at the timeline, something doesn't add up."
