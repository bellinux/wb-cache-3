5000|$|Improving Process Control Immunity To Supply Voltage Sags In Petroleum And Chemical Industries [...] 330 (6 of 6) Column 1 PNEUMATIC HOLD IN RELAYS [...] A {{commonly}} used technique to keep motors and pumps energized during momentary voltage variations is the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>relay.</b> [...] These devices use a screw selectable air bladder {{to perform a}} time delayed dropout of the circuit contacts. [...] While they are not extremely precise, {{it is very easy}} to select approximate hold in levels [...] in one half second increments out to several seconds.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{instrument}} is the one originally constructed for this church by Hele & Co of Plymouth in 1894 {{at a cost of}} £750. At that time, the Choir and some slides on the Great and Swell were only “prepared for”. In 1926 it was given a clean and overhaul by Henry Speechly & Sons of London, who also added the Choir stops and soundboard, the reed stops at 16' and 4' on the Swell, 8’ on the Great, and 16’ on the Pedal. They also installed the electric blower to replace the hand blowing apparatus previously used. In 1950, Roger Yates of Michaelstow cleaned all the pipe work, and added the Swell Tremolo, the Pedal 4' Nachthorn, and the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>relay</b> to enable the Pedal Quint to be derived from the Bourdon/Bass Flute rank.|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that defects in brake system {{contribute significantly to}} fatal crashes involving commercial vehicles. Hence {{there is a need}} for developing preventive and active safety measures for assessing the performance of an air brake system in trucks. Existing techniques for assessing the performance of brakes are infrastructure intensive, time and labor intensive. The premise of this thesis is that model-based diagnostic techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations of existing tech- niques. The design of a model-based diagnostic system requires the development and experimental corroboration of a mathematical model of the evolution of pressure in each brake chamber of a truck in response to the application of brake pedal input by the driver, when there are no faults or defects in the brake system. This thesis is aimed at modeling and experimentally corroborating a subsystem of an air brake system, namely the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>relay</b> valve. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>relay</b> valve takes a input signal from the primary delivery of a treadle valve and meters air from a storage reservoir to Type 30 rear brake chambers. A description of the development of the model, the experimental setup and corroborating experimental results are provided...|$|E

40|$|The motive of this {{research}} is to develop a good stacking method with an automatic material handling system and the procedures that can increase productivity, reduce production costs, and prevent labor injury. A diversity of products leads to a number of different kinds of stacking problems. Much research has been done focusing on two-dimensional arrangement for rectangles, circles or irregular shapes, and threedimensional regular-shaped objects such as rectangular boxes. To solve stacking problems, many algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and other heuristic algorithms have been proposed. The three-dimensional stacking problem has a practical application in the transportation, manufacturing, and construction industries. There has been relatively little emphasis on three-dimensional irregular objects; however, stacking three-dimensional irregular objects has become more common in industry. In this thesis research, three heuristic algorithms are proposed to stack irregular stone pieces nested in a container with multiple layers. Primary functions of the heuristic algorithms include three major parts. First, it approximates irregular shapes to a cluster of straight lines. Secondly, it arranges the approximated angles one-by-one with the proposed step-by-step rule. Finally, it considers the weight of the stone pieces from the pixel calculation for reasons of stability. The first and second algorithms are based on the area and angle of the stone piece and the third one is based on the approximated weight of the stone. An automatic real-time stacking system including <b>pneumatic</b> devices, sensors, <b>relays,</b> a conveyor, a programmable logic controller, a robotic arm, and a vision system was developed for this study. The algorithms developed were tested by this automatic stacking system for better utilization. Three performance measures were presented in the experimental result. Comparisons between the results from three proposed algorithms and that from the bottom-back-left algorithm are made. Experimental data demonstrate that the utilizations and the stabilities of the three proposed algorithms are statistically better than that of the bottom-back-left algorithm. However, the cycle times of the three proposed algorithms have no statistical difference from that of the bottom-back-left algorithm. In addition, a statistical test between each proposed algorithm is also conducted. Both the utilizations and stabilities have statistical differences between each proposed algorithm while the cycle times do not. The results of this study show that the algorithm developed works effectively for solving the stone-pieces stacking problem...|$|R
