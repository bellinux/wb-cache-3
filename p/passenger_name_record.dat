50|$|Following the {{controversial}} <b>Passenger</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Record</b> (PNR) agreement {{signed with the}} European Union (EU) in 2007, the Bush administration provided an exemption for the Department of Homeland Security and the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) from the U.S. Privacy Act. ADIS is intended to authorize people to travel only after PNR and API (Advance Passenger Information) data has been checked and cleared through a US agency watchlist. The Automated Targeting System is also to be exempted. The Privacy Act does not protect non-US persons, which is problematic for the exchange of <b>Passenger</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Record</b> information between the US and the European Union.|$|E

40|$|After 9 / 11 the United States of America as well {{as other}} {{countries}} discovered the collection and evaluation of flight passenger data, so called <b>passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>records</b> (PNR), as a new tool to track terrorists and other criminals.

Despite being criticized for fundamental rights violations, the EU is on the threshold of imitating the American PNR system. This contribution analyses the current state of play of the proposed EU PNR system by taking into account its scope and its compliance with basic European data protection rules...|$|R

50|$|I {{am writing}} to you in reply to your letter of 4 May {{concerning}} the two draft Proposals for Council Decisions on (i) the conclusion and (ii) the signature of the Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of <b>Passenger</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Record</b> (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.|$|E
50|$|The program {{regulates the}} {{exchange}} of <b>passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>record</b> information between the EU and the US.

40|$|From the Introduction]. In 30 May 2006, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{held that}} the <b>Passenger</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Records</b> (PNR) Agreement between the EU and the US on the {{processing}} and transfer of personal data by air carriers to the US was unlawful. Headlines in the UK’s Daily Telegraph indicate the seriousness with which industry has taken the judgment: “EU privacy ruling threatens chaos on flights to US” (31 May 2006). The Financial Times was even more alarmist: “EU airline ruling puts terror deal in doubt”. Clearly something important had happened, notwithstanding {{the fact that the}} ECJ preserved the application of the two contested measures until 30 September 2006, in order to provide time for a new agreement to be negotiated...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional military usage, civilian industry uses the alphabet to avoid similar problems in the transmission of messages by telephone systems. For example, it is often used in the retail industry where customer or site details are spoken by telephone (to authorize a credit agreement or confirm stock codes), although ad hoc coding is often used in that instance. It has been used often by information technology workers to communicate serial/reference codes (which are often very long) or other specialised information by voice. Most major airlines use the alphabet to communicate <b>Passenger</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Records</b> (PNRs) internally, and in some cases, with customers. It is often used in a medical context as well, to avoid confusion when transmitting information.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{declared}} the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights. The Council's Legal Services {{have been reported}} to have stated in closed session that paragraph 59 of the European Court of Justice's ruling [...] "suggests that general and blanket data retention is no longer possible". A legal opinion funded by the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament finds that the blanket retention of data of unsuspicious persons generally violates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, both in regard to national telecommunications data retention laws and to similar EU data retention schemes (<b>Passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>records,</b> Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme, Terrorist Finance Tracking System, law enforcement access to the Entry-Exit-System, Eurodac, Visa Information System).|$|R
5000|$|Today, DCS mostly (98%) manage e-tickets using {{interfaces}} from {{a number}} of devices, including check-in kiosks, online check-in, mobile boarding cards, and baggage handling. DCS are able to identify, capture and update reservations from an airline's computer reservation system for passengers stored in a so-called <b>passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>record</b> (PNR). A DCS is used to update reservations, typically as checked-in, boarded, flown or another status.|$|E
50|$|Passengers on flights {{entering}} {{and leaving}} the UK are screened by the NBTC. The airlines pass data (<b>passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>record,</b> or PNR) of each passenger to the NBTC, including date of birth. The NBTC tracks former flights taken by each individual going back up to a decade, and determines whether an individual's flight history could be suspicious. Each individual is checked against criminal record databases. They even check ferries sometimes.|$|E
5000|$|ACTE {{serves as}} a non-political global {{advocacy}} platform for its international membership on critical issues facing the industry.

40|$|January 2015 : the {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris require law scholars to reflect quickly about public security, balancing that need with the protection of rights. Particularly, the EU is engaged in the delicate regulation of <b>passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>records</b> (PNR) transfers. Two positions are facing: some countries (first of all, the USA) that asked to receive those data from airline companies in order to strengthen their security against terrorism, and the EU, more interested in protecting privacy and personal data contained in PNR information. More over, {{this is also the}} right moment to consider the situation of migrants in Italy without any prejudice or spoiled thought (connected to bad theories about religion) : a new culture for a religious pluralism is necessary, avoiding to think that Islam can be a risk for public security in itself...|$|R
5000|$|On July 13, 2005, Baker was {{appointed}} by President George W. Bush to be Assistant Secretary (acting as Under Secretary-equivalent) for Policy for the United States Department of Homeland Security. His nomination was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 7, 2005. News of his nomination was greeted with mixed reviews by privacy advocates and those concerned about his position on civil liberties; and the Department {{has been unable to}} elevate his position to an Under Secretary level. He negotiated several agreements between DHS and European governments concerning European privacy law and a U.S. legal requirement that airlines provide reservation data about US-bound passengers to the US government (<b>Passenger</b> <b>name</b> <b>records</b> or PNRs). One of these agreements had a [...] "side letter" [...] that abrogated significant parts of the published agreement.|$|R
5000|$|Among key campaigns {{launched}} by European Digital Rights are, in 2003 and 2011, against <b>Passenger</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Records</b> (PNR), in 2005, against Data retention and in 2010 and {{in favour of}} a copyright reform.EDRi actively participated in the vast campaign against ACTA which successfully ended with {{the rejection of the}} proposal by the European Parliament in July 2012. During the European elections 2014, EDRi led an innovative campaign to raise the profile of digital rights issues. To this end, EDRi’s members drafted a 10-point Charter of Digital Rights that candidates running for the European Parliament could promise to defend. Amongst these principles following are included: promotion of transparency and citizen participation, the support for data protection and privacy, unrestricted access to the Internet, an update for copyright legislation, promotion of online anonymity and encryption, multistakeholderism, and open source software.|$|R
