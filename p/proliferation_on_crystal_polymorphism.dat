40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that nanofiltration of aqueous glycine solutions has a pronounced effect on laser-induced nucleation. Two nucleation regimes {{were observed in}} nonfiltered, irradiated solutions under isothermal conditions: a rapid initial regime associated with laser-induced nucleation and a second much slower spontaneous nucleation regime. Filtration of the solutions prior to irradiation greatly suppressed the rapid regime, while the slow regime was similar regardless of filtration or irradiation, for all supersaturations studied. A clear effect of filtration <b>on</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>polymorphism</b> was also observed. Nonfiltered irradiated solutions at a lower supersaturation almost exclusively yielded the α-polymorph, while at higher supersaturations there was significant presence (∼ 40 %) of the γ-polymorph. On the other hand, filtered solutions almost exclusively yielded the α-polymorph of glycine at all supersaturations studied. These surprising results challenge some established ideas about laser-induced nucleation, showing that previously reported laser-induced nucleation phenomena in glycine aqueous solutions can be effectively suppressed by filtration, so that the underlying mechanism {{is unlikely to be}} based on molecular scale interactions involving just the solute and the solvent alone. Instead, laser-induced nucleation in this system appears to be related to either colloidal scale solution clusters or foreign solid or molecular impurities that can be removed by nanofiltration...|$|R
40|$|Lipid-based lyotropic liquid {{crystals}} (LLCs) show {{great potential}} for applications in fields as diverse as food technology, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, or structural biology. Recently, these systems have provided {{a viable alternative to}} the difficult process of membrane protein crystallization, owing to their similarities with cell membranes. Nonetheless, the process of in-meso crystallization of proteins still remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that in-meso crystal morphologies of lysozyme (LSZ), a model hydrophilic protein, can be controlled by both the composition and symmetry of the mesophase, inferring a possible general influence of the LLC space group <b>on</b> the protein <b>crystal</b> <b>polymorphism.</b> Lysozyme was crystallized in-meso from three common LLC phases (lamellar, inverse hexagonal, and inverse bicontinuous cubic) composed of monolinolein and water. Different mixing ratios of mesophase to crystallization buffer were used in order to tune crystallization both in the bulk mesophase and in excess water conditions. Two distinct mechanisms of crystallization were shown to take place depending on available water in the mesophases. In the bulk mesophases, protein nuclei form and grow within structural defects of the mesophase and partially dehydrate the system inducing order-to-order transitions of the liquid crystalline phase toward stable symmetries in conditions of lower hydration. The formed protein crystals eventually macrophase separate from the mesophase allowing the system to reach its final symmetry. On the other hand, when excess water is available, protein molecules diffuse from the water channels into the excess water, where the crystallization process can take place freely, and with little to no effect on the structure and symmetry of the lyotropic liquid crystals...|$|R

40|$|Control {{of calcium}} oxalate crystal {{structure}} and cell adherence by urinary macromolecules. <b>Crystal</b> <b>polymorphism</b> is exhibited by calcium oxalates in nephrolithiasis, {{and we have}} proposed that {{a shift in the}} preferred crystalline form of calcium oxalate (CaOx) from monohydrate (COM) to dihydrate (COD) induced by urinary macromolecules reduces crystal attachment to epithelial cell surfaces, thus potentially inhibiting a critical step in the genesis of kidney stones. We have tested the validity of this hypothesis by studying both the binding of monohydrate and dihydrate crystals to renal tubule cells and the effect of macromolecular urinary solutes <b>on</b> <b>crystal</b> structure. Renal tubule cells grown in culture bound 50 % more CaOx monohydrate than dihydrate crystals of comparable size. The effects of macromolecules on the spontaneous nucleation of CaOx were examined in HEPES-buffered saline solutions containing Ca 2 + and C 2 O 42 - at physiologic concentrations and supersaturation. Many naturally occurring macromolecules known to be inhibitors of crystallization, specifically osteopontin, nephrocalcin and urinary prothrombin fragment 1, were found to favor the formation of calcium oxalate dihydrate in this in vitro system, while other polymers did not affect CaOx crystal structure. Thus, the natural defense against nephrolithiasis may include impeding crystal attachment by an effect of macromolecular inhibitors on the preferred CaOx crystal structure that forms in urine...|$|R

40|$|At room temperature, calcium {{tantalite}} (CaTa 2 O 6) {{is known}} to exhibit three stable polymorphs, depending <b>on</b> the <b>crystal</b> growth conditions. In this work, the laser-heated pedestal growth method was used to obtain CaTa 2 O 6 single crystal fibers in its quenched (ordered) cubic polymorph, attractive for optical applications. X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and infrared spectroscopy showed that the fibers grew into the centrosymmetrical Pm 3 space group. The growth axis was determined as [001]. The cylindrical fibers (20 mm long and 400 μm wide) showed good optical quality, without cracks or striations, but with small facets, parallel to crystal edges or to in-plane edge bicetrices. A comprehensive set of the optical phonons for this cubic structure was obtained, consisting of 13 (of 16 foreseen) triply degenerate polar phonons, and all the 21 predicted Raman modes. By using special scattering geometries, the Raman bands were attributed to their corresponding irreducible representations. In general, the phonons showed rather large damping constants, which do not compromise the designed optical applications in compact lasers but increase the losses in the microwave range, even though the dielectric response is quite adequate for microwave applications. Quenched defects and <b>crystal</b> <b>polymorphism</b> can be at {{the origin of the}} large phonon damping. CNPqFINEPFAPEMIGFAPES...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Methods {{capable of}} exhaustively {{screening}} for <b>crystal</b> <b>polymorphism</b> remain an elusive goal in solid-state chemistry. Particularly promising {{among the new}} generation of approaches is polymer-induced heteronucleation (PIHn), a tool utilizing hundreds of unique polymers for granting kinetic access to polymorphs. Here PIHn is redeployed in a high density format in which 288 distinct polymers, each acting as a heteronucleant, are arrayed on one substrate. This format allows determining the outcome of thousands of crystallizations in an automated fashion with only a few milligrams of sample. This technology enables the study of a broader range of targets, including preclinical candidates, facilitating determination of polymorphism propensity much earlier in the drug development process. Here the efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using four pharmaceutically relevant compounds: acetaminophen, tolfenamic acid, ROY, and curcumin...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{structure}} of actin in its various conformational states is important for understanding the diverse motile activities carried out by eukaryotic cells. Profilin:actin crystals provide a unique system for studying conformational states of actin, because they exhibit a high degree of polymorphism in response to environmental conditions while maintaining crystalline order. A preliminary comparison of two states of profilin:beta-actin crystals shows that <b>crystal</b> <b>polymorphism</b> involves movements of actin subdomains at hinge points homologous to those found in hexokinase, a protein whose polypeptide fold is related to actin. The homology of the hinge points in actin to those in hexokinase suggests that actin subdomain movements in profilin:beta-actin crystals have functional significance.
