5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by <b>press</b> <b>forming</b> the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E

The Proton Jumbuck infamously scored one star out of a potential five in its ANCAP test in 2009. Proton responded by raising safety standards significantly during the development of the Prevé. The Reinforced Safety Structure (RESS) frame was developed specifically for the new car.

40|$|Aluminium alloys 6082. 25 and 7021. 50 were {{evaluated}} and compared as potential base materials for processing by <b>press</b> <b>form</b> hardening. Both extruded profiles and rolled sheets were assessed, however the rolled 7021 material was neglected {{early in the}} project due to time constraints. The effect of deformation at the relevant high temperatures and strain rates on the workability and microstructure of the materials was assessed. The artificial age hardening response subsequent to hot deformation was investigated for the 6082 rolled material. The flow stress and workability of all investigated materials was highly favorable for forming at all temperatures relevant to <b>press</b> <b>form</b> hardening. These properties were most favorable at the solution heat treatment temperatures of the respective alloys. Materials that do not recrystallize during solution heat treatment appeared to give an advantageous grain structure in the finished parts. The extruded materials in this work did not recrystallize in bulk during solution heat treatment nor hot deformation, however recrystallization in the surface layers was not assessed. No disfavor of the fibrous grain structure associated with extruded materials was observed regarding workability at the relevant temperatures, thus extruded materials could be particularly suitable as base materials for <b>press</b> <b>form</b> hardening. The AA 7021. 50 extruded material appeared especially suitable for <b>press</b> <b>form</b> hardening due to a particularly high workability and low flow stress at the relevant forming conditions. The superior resistance to recrystallization in this material further favored it as a suitable base material for <b>press</b> <b>form</b> hardening. No detrimental effect of the hot deformation on the artificial ageing response was observed in the AA 6082. 25 rolled material. This should however be further and more thoroughly assessed for all potential base materials...|$|R

50|$|The third {{generation}} Saga features a stronger body structure than its second generation predecessors. Torsional rigidity has been increased to 12,000 Nm/deg from 10,000 Nm/deg previously. The new Saga is {{fitted with a}} number of ultra high strength steel (UHSS) components at critical sections throughout its body structure to reinforce and protect the passenger compartment {{in the event of a}} collision. The front and rear crumple zones have both increased courtesy of longer front and rear overhangs.

In the event of an accident, the Iriz's body control module automatically unlocks all doors to facilitate an emergency exit. The Head Restraint reduces the risk of whiplash by preventing the driver's head from tilting backwards during a rear-end collision.

50|$|The new Persona {{features}} Proton's hot <b>press</b> <b>forming</b> (HPF) technology. First {{offered in}} the 2012 Prevé, the new HPF manufacturing process has since {{found its way into}} the Suprima S, Iriz and BH Persona. Like the Iriz, eight HPF components have been incorporated into key points of the Persona's Reinforced Safety Structure (RESS). The main purpose of the HPF components is to reinforce and protect the passenger compartment {{in the event of a}} collision. HPF manufacturing begins with the super-heating of high strength carbon steel to 900 degrees Celsius, which is then rapidly cooled to 4 degrees Celsius and subsequently stamped into a preset mould. This quenching process makes the HPF steel five times stronger than conventional cold rolled steel. The HPF components are also lighter and more rigid, helping improve performance, handling and fuel efficiency on top of safety.|$|E
50|$|On 11 August 2014, a {{summarised}} {{specifications sheet}} for the Proton Iriz was leaked online. while on 22 August 2014, Proton Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Abdul Rashid Musa held a media briefing on the upcoming P2-30A. The briefing detailed that two new engines will be offered, a 1.3 litre and a 1.6 litre, {{both of which}} incorporate variable valve timing (VVT) technology for more power and improved fuel-efficiency. The new Proton {{will be able to}} travel from Bukit Kayu Hitam in the very north of the Malay Peninsula to Johor Bahru in the very south, a journey of around 800 kilometres (500 miles) in just a single tank of petrol. It is however worth noting that Proton's older CamPro CPS and more recent CamPro CFE also offer VVT technology. The new 1.3 and 1.6 engines will also offer reduced emissions, in line with Proton's intentions to sell the P2-30A in markets which impose taxes based on emissions such as the European Union. The car will also be offered with an electric power steering (EPS) system for ease of steering and improved fuel-efficiency, along with a choice of either manual or automatic transmission. Proton claims that the new engines will be 10% more fuel-efficient in comparison to the older CamPro engines. Additionally, Azlan Othman, Proton's Head of Styling mentioned that the new GSC will maintain Proton's design philosophy of ‘timeless beauty’. In his words, “We don’t need to be trendy, and then forgotten. We need to be timeless, to have designs that last.” In terms of safety, the Proton GSC will launch as the safest Proton car yet, safer even than the bigger and more expensive Prevé and Suprima S. It will be equipped with no less than 10 computerised electronic systems, 6 airbags and Proton's Reinforced Safety Structure (RESS) with Hot <b>Press</b> <b>Forming</b> (HPF) technology. The P2-30A will be offered in at least 3 variants, namely ‘Standard’, ‘Executive’ and ‘Premium’, in a range of seven different colours. Proton also iterated that the GSC is not a direct successor or replacement to the Savvy as initially believed by the media, but is instead a separate new segment for Proton. The GSC will be a larger B-segment 5-door hatchback, unlike the much smaller A-segment Savvy.|$|E
