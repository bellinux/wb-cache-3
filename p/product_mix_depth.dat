40|$|According to {{a recent}} {{dynamical}} model, the depth of a well-mixed water column should have contrasting effects on the abundances of sinking and nonsinking phytoplankton taxa. Because of increasing light limitation, nonsinking taxa should decline monotonically with increasing <b>mixing</b> <b>depth,</b> and because of sinking loss limitation at low <b>mixing</b> <b>depths,</b> sinking taxa should peak at intermediate <b>mixing</b> <b>depths.</b> Along a gradient of <b>mixing</b> <b>depths,</b> the position of this maximum should increase with increasing taxon-specific sinking velocity and decrease with increasing background turbidity. In two field-enclosure experiments, we investigated the effects of <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> and background turbidity {{on a variety of}} sinking and nonsinking phytoplankton taxa. We exposed the natural, 100 -µm screened phytoplankton community of a clear, unproductive, but silica-rich lake to a gradient of <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> (1. 5 - 15 m) during 4 - 6 weeks. To mimic two different background turbidities, the transparent enclosure walls were surrounded by either white or black foliage. Although diatoms suffered from high sedimentation losses at low <b>mixing</b> <b>depths,</b> they dominated biomass at all <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> throughout both experiments.

Specific gross growth rates of most common taxa were negatively related to <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> In both experiments, the abundances of most sinking taxa showed a unimodal pattern along the <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> gradient, while two of three motile taxa declined monotonically with <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> The depths where these taxa reached their maximal abundances were positively related to taxon-specific sinking velocity and negatively related to background turbidity...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to establish the effect of anthropogenic heat flux on the formation of <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> specially in urban areas. In this study an energy balance <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> model was developed for the simulation of <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> incorporating the heat island effect. To demonstrate the effect of heat island, <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> were simulated under two conditions. Under the first condition, hourly gridded anthropogenic heat flux and variant surface characteristics were considered, while under the second condition anthropogenic heat flux term was ignored and constant surface characteristics were considered throughout the modelling domain. The release of anthropogenic heat flux in the urban environment was found to be responsible for the growth of the unstable layer in the lower atmosphere even during the night. This resulted in higher <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> values in urban areas compared to the surrounding countryside. The maximum differential surfaces sensible heat flux between urban and rural areas was estimated as 130 W/m 2. From the simulation of <b>mixing</b> <b>depth,</b> it was revealed that the maximum increment in <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> in urban areas was 300 m due to the heat island effect.

40|$|Most primary {{production}} of lakes and oceans {{occurs in the}} well-mixed surface layer that is subject to strong seasonal and geographical variation. With increasing <b>mixed</b> surface layer <b>depth</b> average light supply and specific nutrient supply decrease and so do light-dependent production rates and depth-dependent sinking loss rates of phytoplankton. Changes in <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> {{are expected to have}} important consequences for the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass, algal nutrient stoichiometry, light availability and nutrient retention in the mixed layer. Light absorption by enhanced concentrations of abiotic substances (humic substances, clay particles) furthermore negatively affects light availability and production. I tested the predictions of a dynamical “closed system” model concerning the effects of <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> and background turbidity (Kbg) on phytoplankton biomass, light climate and nutrients in a field enclosure experiment. The natural phytoplankton community was exposed to high and low background turbidity along a gradient of <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> For sinking algae, the model predicts that phytoplankton biomass should be most strongly limited by sedimentation losses in shallow mixed layers, by mineral nutrients at intermediate <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> and by a lack of light in deep mixed layers. As predicted, phytoplankton volumetric and areal biomasses showed a unimodal relationship to <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> and were negatively affected by background attenuation. With increasing Kbg the biomass peak shifted towards shallower <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> The concentrations of dissolved and total nutrients were positively affected by increasing <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> but only marginally related to Kbg most likely due to a variable carbon to phosphorus cell quota. For thermally stratified lakes I derived the following predictions from a dynamical “open system” model which includes variable algal cell quota: within a realistic <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> range (3 - 12 m) light availability, phytoplankton density, and the carbon:phosphorus ratio of algal biomass should all be negatively related to <b>mixing</b> <b>depth,</b> while algal standing stock should be unimodally related, and total and dissolved nutrients be horizontally or positively related to <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> All these prediction were in qualitatively good agreement with data from 65 central European lakes sampled during summer stratification. Notably, I observed the predicted negative relationship between phytoplankton density and <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> in spite of the rather limited range of <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> typical for medium sized temperate lakes. Furthermore, I found a strong negative relationship among zooplankton biomass and <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> In a comprehensive comparative lake study of 40 northern German lakes, I sampled the surface mixed layers for a set of variables and focused on the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and the relationships of taxonomic classes to environmental variables. I used high performance liquid chromatography to analyse the phytoplankton samples for 13 photosynthetic pigments and calculated the contributions of seven algal classes with distinct pigment signatures to total chlorophyll a using CHEMTAX, a matrix factorisation program. In multiple regression analyses, I examined the relationships of phytoplankton biomass and composition to total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total silica (TSi), <b>mixing</b> <b>depth,</b> water temperature, and zooplankton biomass. Total Chl-a was positively related to TN and TP and unimodally related to <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> TN was the factor most strongly related to the biomasses of single taxa. I found positive relationships of chrysophytes, chlorophytes, cryptophytes, and euglenophytes to TN, and of diatoms and chrysophytes to TSi. Diatoms were negatively related to TN. Cryptophytes and chlorophytes were negatively and cyanobacteria positively related to zooplankton. Finally, the relative biomasses of chrysophytes and cryptophytes were negatively related to <b>mixing</b> <b>depth.</b> Most results were consistent with theoretical expectations. Some relationships may, however, have been masked by strong cross-correlations among several environmental variables...|$|R

Current methods of assessing benthic habitat quality often reference this mixed layer as an indicator of benthic activity. Whilst a great deal of effort has been devoted to linking macro-invertebrate activity to the <b>mixing</b> <b>depth,</b> less attention has been given to defining what the <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> represents in terms of ecosystem process and function. Here, in situ sediment profile images are analysed using grey scale intensity analysis to distinguish the mixed zone and relate it to the physicochemical environment {{in order to determine the}} biological, chemical and physical variables most influential in its formation. Significant differences were found between biogeochemical conditions within the mixed layer relative to the underlying historic sediment layer. These were attributed to a combination of environmental variables (Fe, Mn, Si, chlorophyll a and NO 3 –) rather than a single dominant driver of change. Although these findings are consistent across multiple locations, the driver(s) that influence the <b>depth</b> of the <b>mixed</b> layer are site- and season-specific. The <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> thus provides a reasonable approximation of benthic ecosystem functioning, but when considering ecosystem process the link between the <b>mixing</b> <b>depth</b> and its driving factors (faunal mixing, food input, environmental conditions) is highly context-dependent.

Under these conditions, near-surface wind speeds drop well below 1 m s− 1 and nocturnal <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> vary from ∼ 25 m to less than 10 m above ground level (a. g. l.). Combining nocturnal radon with daytime ceilometer data, {{we were able to}} reconstruct the full diurnal cycle of <b>mixing</b> <b>depths.</b> Average daytime <b>mixing</b> <b>depths</b> at this flat inland site range from 1200 to 1800 m a. g. l. in summer, and 500 – 900 m a. g. l. in winter. Using tower observations to constrain the nocturnal radon-derived effective <b>mixing</b> <b>depth,</b> we were able to estimate the seasonal range in the Bucharest regional radon flux as: 12 mBq m− 2 s− 1 in winter to 14 mBq m− 2 s− 1 in summer. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{theoretical}} {{literature has}} given {{relevance to the}} study of the relationship between <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> changes and firm productivity. In this paper, taking advantage of a rich dataset for manufacturing plants in Chile during the period 1996 - 2000, we use matching techniques and a difference in difference approach to estimate the causal impact of <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> changes on productivity and other plant-specific outcomes. Our results suggest a positive and increasing impact of <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> changes on total factor productivity and labor productivity after two years the <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> changes are introduced. We also find positive effects on employment and sales. Nevertheless, this positive effect is mainly driven by firms that add and drop products at the same time. Our results are in line with recent theoretical developments on the study of productivity determinants on multiproduct firms and illustrate how products creation and destruction are a source of within-firm productivity growth...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{trade flows}} are {{dominated}} by high-productivity firms, that have a large range of products. Since the product range of firms reflects partly trade flows, it {{is a source of}} economic differences in space. In this paper, I analyze the effects of the <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> of firms on agglomeration. I build a theoretical model of multiproduct firms 0 la Mayer, Melitz, and Ottaviano (2014, AER), expand it with skilled, mobile workers and a spatial equilibrium. I show that a larger <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> of firms in a region favours dispersion. The <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> influences the indirect utility through two channels, the wage and consumer surplus. A larger <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> decreases the wage differential between the two regions through a more competitive environment and thus strengthening the dispersion force. More competition means less profits and therefore a lower wage for skilled workers. On the other hand a more competitive environment means a higher consumer surplus which diminishes agglomeration forces...|$|R
