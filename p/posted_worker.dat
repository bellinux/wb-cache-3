In particular, this note attempts to explain how the current Directive 96 / 71 /EC (the Posted Workers' Directive) sets out mechanisms that produce socially inefficient levels of minimum protections for such <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> that have to be provided by their employers. This note argues that none of the methods by which host Member States may set such levels of minimum protection (namely positive legislation, universally binding collective agreements, and other qualifying collective agreements) allow for real and credible participation by, and representation of, such <b>posted</b> <b>workers,</b> so much so that this is arguably a defining characteristic of the Directive. Whatever response the competent Community institutions may take, a way will have to be found to provide for sufficient outlets for the voice of <b>posted</b> <b>workers,</b> in order to achieve socially efficient levels of minimum protection.

The construction sector is the area who employs most <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> among the 7400 employees who monthly enters the market. It’s also the sector where {{a big part of}} the work-related deaths occurs. The purpose of this study is therefore to contribute to a greater understanding of the regulation regarding <b>posted</b> <b>workers,</b> their work environment and the consequences of it. I have been using the right dogmatic method and a social science perspective as complement in order to answer the purpose of the study.  The application of the <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> directive has been criticized for opening opportunities for false self-employment and limiting the trade unions rights. Combined with the Laval-case the trade unions have restricted possibilities to enforce the collective agreements and protect the <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> rights. Subcontracting processes complicates the investigation regarding which employer who has the overall responsibility for safety regulations and work environment. Foreign workers tend to be a big part in these subcontractor chains with major linguistic difficulties and lack of legislation knowledge which increases the risk of accidents.  Arbetsmiljöverket is the authority who has the general responsibility for monitoring that the health and safety legislation are respected by all employers. Their investigations are partially based on the statistics of work-related accidents. But when it comes to foreign workers only more serious accidents are reported to the authority. Which means that minor incidents regarding foreign workers never reaches the statistics.           In summary, conclusion is drawn that the inspection of <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> working environment are unsatisfied. The hands of the trade unions are tied by the legislation while the inspections by the monitoring authority are based on inadequate statistics. All that combine with the fact that <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> tend to be unwilling or lack the knowledge to take action for their rights, leads to openings for employers to take advantage of foreign workers...|$|R

40|$|Directive 96 / 71 /EC {{concerning}} the <b>posting</b> of <b>workers</b> {{in the framework}} of the provision of services has as its main purpose to prevent social dumping throughout the European Union. This stated purpose is obtained by establishing conditions that posting employers have to comply with regarding for example wages. These conditions will be implemented in the Member States through laws, collective agreements or arbitrations that has general effect. Previously the implementation of a directive through a collective agreement has not been allowed but with this new directive even the Swedish model of collective agreements has been accepted as a method of implementation. Most of the regulations in the Directive have been implemented in the Swedish law on <b>posted</b> <b>workers.</b> In this law there are references to already existing Swedish legislation regarding the different areas. Rules concerning minimum wages are found in the Swedish collective agreements, as Swedish legislation regarding this area, do not exist. In the Swedish law on <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> there are no references that refer to the collective agreements in these matters. There are however rules stipulating that Arbetsmiljöverket, the Swedish office of relations, will give needed information {{concerning the}} employment- regulations that have to be applied when sending <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> in Sweden. Companies that are interested in sending <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> to Sweden will have to contact Arbetsmil-jöverket in order to get information about the applicable collective agreements and minimum wages. Arbetsmiljöverket has however recieved critique for not fulfilling this responsibility in a satisfying way. When foreign employers arrive to Sweden with <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> they mostly sign a local collective agreement in order to be bound by the conditions stated there. Foreign employers also have the possibility to get a temporary membership in a Swedish employers’ association in order to be bound by the collective agreement that already exists between the association and the corresponding employee association. The employers’ association, above all Teknikföretagen, has recieved critique from the Swedish unions for allowing temporary memberships in their organisations. The unions find that they, in those situations, lack satisfying opportunities to control the foreign employers. If a foreign employer refuses to sign a Swedish labour contract, the union may take offensive action to force the employer to sign the contract. According to the rules of Lex Britannia, the union also has the possibility to force foreign employers to sign a labour contract although they might already be bound to a contract in their native country. These rules have received a great deal of criticism for being contrary to EC-law. Most recently the issue was raised in the “Vaxholm-case”. This case made the Swedish labour court request a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice, in accordance with article 234 in the EC-treaty. It is difficult to ensure that foreign employers do not breach the Swedish labour con-tracts they have signed, for example by not paying the salaries they are obliged to pay. According to § 19 MBL, the Swedish union has the right to collect information from the employer if their employees are members of the union. This has caused problems when it comes to <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> since it is very rare that they are members of a Swedish union. There is a proposal to extend the § 19 MBL. If the proposal is accepted the Swedish union will also be allowed to control employees that are employed by a company even if they are not members of the union. An alternative to the Swedish system of collective contract is the system of contract with general effect that is used in Finland. Finland has a labour legislation that is relatively similar to the Swedish legislation. Both sides on the Swedish labour market are however satisfied with the Swedish system. The system allows great amount of flexi-bility as it is not influenced by the Swedish government. The current Swedish system sufficiently guarantees minimum wages to <b>posted</b> <b>workers.</b> With some changes the system could however become even better. Arbetsmiljöverket must, for example, control that the information given is enough and also that it is understandable for foreign employers. If the suggested changes in the 19 § of MBL will be accepted, the Swedish system will become even more secure regarding the possibility of guaranteeing minimum wages to <b>posted</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ The {{regulation}} of transnational {{employment in the}} European Union operates at the crossroads between private international law and internal market rules. The private international law rules are currently laid down in the Rome I Regulation. This regulation is complemented by the <b>Posted</b> <b>Workers</b> Directive, a directive based on the competences of the EU {{in the field of}} free movement of services. The current contribution first describes the rules which determine the law applicable to the employment contract under Article 8 Rome I Regulation and the way these rules are interpreted by the CJEU before critically analysing these rules and the reasoning that seems to lie behind the court’s interpretation (section 2). The law applying to the contract is, however, only of limited relevance for the protection of <b>posted</b> <b>workers.</b> This is due inter alia to the mandatory application of certain rules of the country to which the <b>workers</b> are <b>posted,</b> even if a different law governs their contract. This application of host state law is based on Article 9 Rome I Regulation in conjunction with the <b>Posted</b> <b>Workers</b> Directive. Section 3 describes the content of these rules and the – to some extent still undecided – interaction between the Rome I Regulation and the PWD. The conclusion will be that there is an uneasy match between the interests informing private international law and the interests of the internal market, which {{is not likely to be}} resolved in the near future...|$|R
40|$|France fared {{relatively}} {{well at the}} start of the current economic crisis, but has experienced low economic growth and high unemployment rates in the recent years. As a result it has been a less popular destination with Southern Europeans and EU migrants in general in search of economic opportunities. Although their numbers have increased and represent a growing proportion of recent flows to France, they remain low compared to numbers observed in Germany and the UK. Despite this statistical reality, EU mobility and more generally the role of the EU in economic and social policy have been at the forefront of debates in France since the start of the 2000 s, thus well before the start of the crisis. These debates have focused on two populations – the Roma and <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> – with both groups being portrayed as threats to the French welfare state. Although <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> are not migrants, according to official EU definitions, their characteristics and experiences are similar to other groups of temporary migrant workers. Southern Europeans account for an increasing number of <b>posted</b> <b>workers,</b> and although they have not been the primary nationalities targeted in discussions concerning this issue, the debates and policy changes introduced in the recent years concern them as well. Moreover, we argue that the focusing of political debates on other populations in France has contributed to the relative invisibility of Southern European immigrants in this country...|$|R

40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{complicated}} {{relationship between the}} EU legal framework for <b>posting</b> of <b>workers</b> and collective labour law. It examines this topic {{from the perspective of}} EU law and of international labour law. In doing so, it builds upon a solid interdisciplinary foundation, which looks at sociological and economic aspects of the posting phenomenon, taking also into account issues related to industrial relations. However, the immediate focus of the present book is on the creation and evolution of the said EU legal framework. Hence, it provides an in-depth analysis of the drafting process of the <b>Posting</b> of <b>Workers</b> Directive (96 / 71) as well as an exhaustive examination of the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU dealing with <b>posting</b> of <b>workers.</b> This evolving legal framework is subsequently considered in its broader context. Two tensions are thus identified. On the one hand, the book investigates the growing conflict between the EU framework for <b>posting</b> of <b>workers</b> and the international protection of social rights. It argues that, as regards the relationship here at stake, the EU is presently violating the standards set by the Council of Europe and by the International Labour Organisation. On the other hand, the book critically considers the impact of the trend towards decentralisation of collective bargaining on the application of collective agreements to <b>posted</b> <b>workers.</b> In particular, it analyses the so-called “New Economic Governance” of the EU, and its role in fostering such a trend. The author outlines the far-reaching implications of the lack of coherence between the action of the EU institutions involved in the “New Economic Governance” and the case law of the Court of Justice dealing with <b>posting</b> of <b>workers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Labour {{mobility}} {{within the}} European Union {{continues to be}} a limited phenomenon. This concerns both long-term intra-EU mobility and more temporary forms of mobility such as <b>posting</b> of <b>workers,</b> i. e. <b>workers</b> <b>posted</b> to another member state in the framework of cross-border service provision. Yet, despite the limited nature of posting, this topic is far from being absent from the public and political debates. Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, a surge in the number of <b>posted</b> <b>workers</b> has been noticed over the recent years and increased attention has therefore been paid to this issue. Quite a few economic sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and social work, are very concerned by this trend. Secondly, several types of abuses have been recorded such as letter-box companies, bogus self-employment and exploitation of the posted workers' vulnerable situation. Thirdly, questions have been raised as to whether the balance struck by the EU legislator in 1996 (when adopting the <b>Posted</b> <b>Workers</b> Directive) between the freedom to provide crossborder services and the workers' social rights is still valid today. These elements highlight the need for a policy adjustment in order to preserve the legitimacy of the citizens' and workers' freedom to move and, to a certain extent, of the social dimension of the European project. In this context, the European Commission published a proposal to revise the 1996 Directive in order to strike a better balance between economic and social rights. But is this proposal sufficient to ensure a level playing field between economic actors and equal treatment between workers? How will this proposal affect the implementation of other EU initiatives aiming to tackle fraud and abuse? What else is needed to address the tensions between the Single Market principles and the EU's social objectives?

40|$|One of the {{patterns}} European firms follow {{to work in}} various European countries is that of providing services in countries different from the country of origin. This can occur through the temporary mobility of <b>workers</b> – the <b>posting</b> of <b>workers.</b> The <b>posting</b> of <b>workers</b> {{gives rise to a}} mutual conflict between legal systems, because it allows firms to exploit inter-country differences in pay and stringency of labour law standards, and to enter new markets without complying with regulations and local rules. In other words, the <b>posting</b> of <b>workers</b> could be a shortcut to the exploitation of the benefits of a less protective labour law (social dumping) and could be exploited to provoke the destabilization of national social rights. In this article we study, from a legal and economic point of view, the relationship between the phenomenon of the <b>posting</b> of <b>workers</b> and labour market regulation in the EU area. We first describe the issue in the light of current law; then we propose an empirical analysis of the causal relationship between the number of <b>workers</b> <b>posted</b> across Europe, at country level, and disaggregated indicators of labour market regulation (OECD) for each country. The econometric analysis is carried out on an original dataset. The results show that inter-country temporary worker mobility rises, in general, with increasing employment regulation.
