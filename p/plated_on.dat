25|$|The {{bacteria}} that penetrated the cells and remained alive are now released, {{and they are}} <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> solid medium plates.

25|$|To {{quantify}} {{the number of}} cells in a culture, the cells can be simply <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> a petri dish with growth medium. If the cells are efficiently distributed on the plate, it can be generally assumed that each cell will {{give rise to a}} single colony or Colony Forming Unit (CFU). The colonies can then be counted, and based on the known volume of culture that was spread on the plate, the cell concentration can be calculated.|$|E

25|$|Although theoretically, any living cell {{might be}} used as the {{background}} to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast S. cerevisiae has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms. Yeast cells often {{do not have the same}} post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.|$|E
2500|$|Kaiseki, closely {{associated}} with tea ceremony (chanoyu), is a high form of hospitality through cuisine. The style is minimalist, extolling the aesthetics of wabi-sabi.

50|$|The {{zinc-bromine battery}} can be {{regarded}} as an electroplating machine. During charging zinc is electroplated onto conductive electrodes, {{while at the same time}} bromine is formed.

It can be left fully discharged indefinitely without damage.|$|E
5000|$|One {{technique}} {{to improve the}} efficiency is to reduce amount of material that does not carry current by making the conductor of hollow tubing. The large surface area of the tube conducts the current with much less resistance than a solid wire with the same cross-sectional area would. The tank coils of high power radio transmitters are often made of copper tubing, silver <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> the outside, to reduce resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Cryptococcus albidosimilis is {{a species}} that has been {{isolated}} from soil in Antarctica. [...] When <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> agar it produces colonies that are shining white. The colonies appear to be mucosoid in appearance when <b>plated</b> <b>on</b> agar. When grown in liquid media, the yeast fails to grow well unless the media is constantly agitated. [...] This species is considered mesophilic, with optimal growth temperature is at 25°C, with a maximum growth temperature. [...] On the microscopic level, the cells are ovoid in shape, and produce a capsule. C. albidosimilis reproduces through budding, {{and it does not}} appear s though this species reproduces through any sexual means. When mature, the cell size is approximately 4.9μm to 6.6μm. C. albidosimilis can use L-arabinose, cellobiose, citrate at pH 6.0, ethanol, D-glucitol, gluconate at pH 5.8, glucuronate at pH 5.5, myo-inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, melezitose, α-methylglucoside, L-rhamnose, salicin, soluble starch, succinate at pH 5.5, sucrose and xylose as sole carbon sources. This cell can also use L-lysine, nitrate and cadaverine as sole nitrogen sources. This species cannot ferment. C. albidosimilis is DBB positive, and produces amylose.|$|E
