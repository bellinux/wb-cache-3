50|$|Drake, a Californian by birth, {{loved the}} water and sailing. In 1964, over a {{discussion}} on water sports over a brandy {{at his home in}} Southern California, Drake and his former Rockwell boss and now good friend Fred Payne, who worked at The Pentagon, discussed options for creating a wind-powered water-ski which would allow Payne to travel on the Potomac River. That night they developed the idea of a kite <b>powered</b> <b>surfboard.</b> On later reflection, Drake didn't like the integrity of the idea and dismissed it. There were already a number of sailboard designs available, and Drake also was concerned about the integrity of a design needing taut wire close to a human body to keep the sail upright.|$|E

50|$|The Jetboard was {{an early}} <b>powered</b> longboard <b>surfboard.</b> It {{is one of the}} {{earliest}}, if not the earliest motorized sufboard, produced from 1965 to 1968. The original designer was a former engineer from Boeing Aircraft. It was designed to use an aircraft trim tab roller control with your foot for acceleration. There was a simple ingenious safety OFF switch, using a magnet that connected two electrical terminals across a point, located close by the engine's surface watertight hatch. The rider would attach a strap to his ankle with a flexible wire line to the magnet. When he fell off, it would stop the engine.|$|R

Galactus declares the Surfer's exile ended. The Surfer immediately revisits his homeworld, but Shalla-Bal, in his absence, had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and is unable to renew their romance.|$|R
