From IMF 1 to IMF 6 -end, six subdivided <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> were achieved by MEMD, including the mainly center <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> IMF 1 (0.15 to 0.25  Hz), IMF 2 (0.08 to 0.15  Hz), IMF 3 (0.03 to 0.08  Hz), IMF 4 (0.02 to 0.05  Hz), IMF 5 (0.01 to 0.03  Hz), and IMF 6 -end (0 to 0.02  Hz), respectively.

In this paper a <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> analysis of AD EEG signals is presented, with the aim of improving the diagnosis of AD from EEG signals. Relative power in different EEG <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> is used as features to distinguish between AD patients and healthy control subjects. Many different <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> between 4 and 30 Hz are systematically tested, besides the traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> e. g., theta band (4 – 8 Hz). The discriminative power of the resulting spectral features is assessed through statistical tests (Mann–Whitney U test). Moreover, linear discriminant analysis is conducted with those spectral features. The optimized frequency ranges (4 – 7 Hz, 8 – 15 Hz, 19 – 24 Hz) yield substantially better classification performance than the traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> (4 – 8 Hz, 8 – 12 Hz, 12 – 30 Hz); the <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> 4 – 7 Hz is the optimal frequency range for detecting AD, which is similar to the classical theta <b>band.</b> The <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> were also optimized as features through leave-one-out crossvalidation, resulting in error-free classification.
