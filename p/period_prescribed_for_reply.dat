40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the recovery from neuromuscular fatigue following plyometric and resisted squat exercises performed to exhaustion. Previous research has shown that recovery from neuromuscular fatigue is dependent on training status of the subject and the time, type and intensity of the exercise performed. In spite of this finding, the recovery <b>period</b> <b>prescribed</b> <b>for</b> plyometric training is similar to that of slow movement resisted exercise training. Plyometric and resisted squat exercises utilize a unique yet natural movement known as the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC), however due to the differing movement velocities of the exercises, the nature of the SSC performed is very different. This difference is believed to impose distinctive mechanical and neural stresses on the musculoskeletal system. Ten moderately trained subjects and four highly trained subjects completed two SSC trials to exhaustion. Subjects performed continuous drop jumps from a 30 cm platform during the plyometric trial and continuous squats with a load of 65 % of their one-repetition maximum during the resisted squat trial. There was no difference in the neuromuscular recovery response following plyometric and resisted squat exercises performed to exhaustion. However, the duration of the plyometric trial was dependent on the training status of the subject; highly trained (HT) subjects (athletes who trained for their sport for 6 or more hours a week) (68. 2 %) than the moderately (MT) subjects (individuals who participated in 3 or more hours of physical activity a week) and the duration of the plyometric trial was significantly longer (67. 1 %) than resisted squat trial for the HT subjects.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of pathogens resistant to antimicrobials has prompted political initiatives targeting {{a reduction in}} the use of veterinary antimicrobials in Denmark, especially for pigs. This study elucidates the tendency of pig farms with a significantly higher antimicrobial use to remain in clusters in certain geographical regions of Denmark. Animal Daily Doses/ 100 pigs/day were calculated for all three age groups of pigs (weaners, finishers and sows) for each quarter during 2012 - 13 in 6, 143 commercial indoor pig producing farms. The data were split into four time periods of six months. Repeated spatial cluster analyses were performed to identify persistent clusters, i. e. areas included in a significant cluster throughout all four time <b>periods.</b> Antimicrobials <b>prescribed</b> <b>for</b> weaners did not result in any persistent clusters. In contrast, antimicrobial use in finishers clustered persistently in two areas (157 farms), while those issued for sows clustered in one area (51 farms). A multivariate analysis including data on antimicrobial use for weaners, finishers and sows as three separate outcomes resulted in three persistent clusters (551 farms). Compared to farms outside the clusters during this period, weaners, finishers and sows on farms within these clusters had 19 %, 104 % and 4 % higher use of antimicrobials, respectively. Production type, farm type and farm size seemed to have some bearing on the clustering effect. Adding these factors as categorical covariates one at a time in the multivariate analysis reduced the persistent clusters by 24. 3 %, 30. 5 % and 34. 1 %, respectively...|$|R
