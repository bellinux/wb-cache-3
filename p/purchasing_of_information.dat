40|$|A new {{economic}} order has developed that {{is referred to}} as the New Economy and has brought about a shift in focus from manufactured goods and services to an economy that places emphasis on knowledge and the application thereof within a specific context (Leung, 2002). Furthermore, this economy places emphasis on the saliency of information and how it can be used as a competitive and commercial tool. The New Economy is characterised by a unique consumer that functions within it called the New Consumer and this individual functions as a ubiquitous entity that is always on as this individual uses mobile devices that enables them to conduct business and communicate anywhere and at any time. The New Consumer is characterised by being individualistic, involved, independent and informed but also suffers from scarcities such as time, attention and trust. In view hereof, value has become a pivotal matter that all organisations should place emphasis on when delivering products and services to this consumer. Furthermore, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has brought about a technological revolution in the New Economy and has changed the way in which the consumer works and conducts business. Mobile devices form an important component of the New Economy as it also offers organisations the opportunity to adopt new business models, using wireless technology, that enable mobile business (m-business) solutions. M-business refers to the <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> goods and services via a mobile device (Anon., 2000 c) and organisations offering m-business in the New Economy are enabled to offer the advantages such as delivering just the right information, to just the right people at just the right time which means that convenient and personalised location-based information can be delivered to the individual. One industry that has adopted the m-business solution, as a value-added service, is the banking industry and various banks are offering the mobile financial solution to consumers meaning that they can access their accounts, pay their bills and make transfers using a mobile device. As many banks have adopted m-banking, as a value-added m-business offering, a credible source that elaborates on the implementation of m-banking and the industry requirements pertaining to the implementation process is Mobey Forum who has published the Mobey Forum White Paper (Anon., 2004 p) that explains the implementation requirements of mobile financial services such as customer proposition, business priorities, technical issues and implementation issues. This study focuses on the industry requirements of m-banking, as set out by the Mobey Forum White Paper (Anon., 2004 p). Absa, a South African bank, has been utilised as a one-shot case study todetermine how the industry requirements of mobile banking, as a value-added m-business offering, is implemented by the bank.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} social embeddedness {{effects on}} ex antemanagement of economic transactions. We focus on dyadic embeddedness, {{that is the}} history of prior transactions between business partners and the anticipation of future transactions. Exantemanagement through, for example, contractual arrange-ments is costly butmitigates risks associatedwith the transaction, suchas risks from strategic and opportunistic behavior. Dyadic embeddedness can reduce such risks and, hence, the need for ex ante management by, for instance, mak-ing reciprocity and conditional cooperation feasible. The chapter presents a novel theoretical model generating dyadic embeddedness effects, together with effects of transaction characteristics and management costs. We stress the interaction of the history of prior transactions and expectations of future business. Hypotheses are tested using new and primary data from an extensive survey of more than 900 <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> technology (IT) products (hard- and software) by almost 800 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

40|$|During {{the latter}} part of the 1990 s, U. S. {{economic}} growth was boosted by sizable increases in business <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processing equipment and software, otherwise known as high-tech capital goods. Beginning in 2000, though, firms began to curtail these expenditures; by 2001, high-tech and other forms of business investment were falling sharply. Indeed, much of the downturn in the growth of U. S. economic activity can be traced to the sharp decline in investment spending. Several explanations have been offered, from the acceleration in labor productivity—the so-called “New Economy” story—to the stock market surge and subsequent collapse. One explanation that has not been explored in much detail is the surge in business <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> hardware and software in preparation for the century date change (Y 2 K). Because many information processing systems and much of the hardware and software were not Y 2 K compliant as late as 1998, it was thought that business investment in high-tech equipment and software would increase appreciably to fix this problem. Although solid Y 2 K spending data are lacking, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that the magnitude and timing of Y 2 K-related expenditures make it unlikely that the investment boom and bust was a Y 2 K event.

However, for purchasing consumers lower perceived initial transaction utility correlates with larger bundle sizes. The results are derived empirically from a natural experiment of custom music CD sales. The results of this research suggest that sellers can effectively adjust the characteristics of multipart pricing schemes influence purchase decisions with regards to custom information good bundle creation...|$|R

The federal government spent more than $ 87 billion in services [...] a 24 percent increase in real terms from fiscal year 1990. Some service procurements are not being done efficiently, putting taxpayer dollars at risk. In particular, agencies are not clearly defining their requirements, fully considering alternative solutions, performing vigorous price analyses, and adequately overseeing contractor performance.

Moreover, strong support was found for the existence of a specific sequence in dealing with ex-post problems. Nearly all SMEs at least communicate the problem to the supplier; if that does not solve the issue, it is almost always followed by active deliberation with the supplier about a solution. If that does not help, about half of the SMEs impose some kind of sanction (most of the time delaying the payment). If that still does not settle the issue, virtually all SMEs give up on it.

Industry traditionally manages these risks by purchasing information (seismic, well testing, appraisal drilling, reservoir simulation, market capacity and price studies, etc.) about the project and making incremental investments as new information reduces the uncertainties to acceptable levels. Traditional discounted cash flow analyses cannot readily deal with valuing information. We suggest that the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about a project has considerable value and can be treated as purchasing an option on the project. As with options on equities, if the information leads to the expectation of a positive investment outcome, the project should be funded. Similarly, options on capital investment projects also have a time factor dictating value and the proper time to undertake the investment.

As a further extension of OPT to capital investment projects, we create a dynamic model to identify investment alternatives to capture additional value over the project's lifetime.
