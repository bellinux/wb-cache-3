5|$|After a premiering out of {{competition}} at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, U2 3D showed at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and had its limited theatrical release in late January 2008, followed by its wide release the following month. The film was distributed by National Geographic Entertainment and was only released in IMAX 3D and digital 3D theaters. It peaked at number 19 at the United States box office, and earned over $26million worldwide, ranking {{as one of the}} highest-grossing concert films. It received widely positive reviews, with critics praising the 3D technology and innovation. U2 3D won several awards, and its reception convinced some of the creators that the project marked a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> in filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 {{and lasted}} about {{one and a}} half years. The game was {{unveiled}} at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game, and developer tri-Ace was hired to help with the game's design, art, and programming. The development team wanted to exceed Final Fantasy XIII in every aspect while making the story's tone mysterious and darker than the previous game. The game builds upon the <b>Paradigm</b> <b>Shift</b> battle system used in Final Fantasy XIII and includes a less linear overall design.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} pioneered {{the use of}} {{graphics}} processing units (GPUs), PlayStation3s, Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors), and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> from traditional computing methods. As part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.|$|E
40|$|Here, an {{overview}} of Hans Küng’s understanding of <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> in theology is provided {{with a focus on}} its ecumenical aims. In the analysis of <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> as an ecumenical tool the strengths and weakness of this approach are presented, largely indicating that though <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> seem to occur and offer possibilities for ecumenism, there are problems with how Küng elaborates his programme. To strengthen the case for the occurrence of <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> in Christianity a reflection is offered, in germ, on the role that irruption and eruption play in Eucharistic bread-breaking, where the irruption of brokenness and confusion is made whole in a new way via the eruption of the Spirit. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Four major <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> {{in water}} {{management}} include the shift from: government to governance, centralization to decentralization, {{water as a}} gift of God to water as an economic good, and sectoral to integrated water resource management. Are these <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> compatible with cultural/institutional practices in Ghana? Using theoretical and empirical arguments, this paper affirms that Ghana often adopts such <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> due to exogenous pressures but the absence of domestic ownership, inadequate resources, and institutional mismatches, often result in limited implementation. This paper recommends water governance which focuses more on prioritization, indigenizing exogenous ideas, and working within existing cultural practices...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{conceptual}} framework of the social factors enabling and inhibiting <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> in urban water supply and sanitation. We understand <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> as radical changes in the metabolism of urban water services, whereby change is informed by a distinct ethos. We reframe <b>paradigm</b> <b>shifts</b> as the function of two factors: 1) the agency of paradigm advocacy; 2) the institutional legitimacy of competing paradigms, which defines the landscape of opportunities for paradigm advocacy. Multigroup assessments of the social desirability and sustainability of competing paradigms are made in light of aspirations to normative coherence under conditions of bounded rationality. Finally, we suggest directions for further inquiry...|$|R
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E
25|$|After a given {{discipline}} {{has changed}} from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a scientific revolution or a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift.</b> It is often this final conclusion, {{the result of the}} long process, that is meant when the term <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.|$|E

25|$|The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll {{responded that}} Grinder has not {{understood}} Kuhn's {{text on the}} history and philosophy of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified {{in a field of}} science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> in that field and (c) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an instructive text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) paradigm that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence a <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift,</b> i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm.|$|E
