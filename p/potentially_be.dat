On the other hand, Skaði may <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
5|$|Starlings' {{droppings}} {{can contain}} the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, {{the cause of}} histoplasmosis in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings.

5|$|The only {{species that}} can <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium {{and the absence of}} a white line below the black face mask.|$|E
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} on the tracks, was an early and vocal {{opponent}} of electrification.

5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride can be doped p-type with {{beryllium}} and n-type with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped {{with carbon}} and nitrogen. Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy {{corresponding to the}} UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV light in the range 215–250nm and therefore can <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers.|$|E

5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket salient. The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E

Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only be slightly affected if at all.

Parts of the body only thinly covered can also <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> subjected to an outbreak.|$|E

5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E

5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> detrimental to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile {{great spotted woodpecker}}s often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker. The Sind woodpecker {{is very similar to}} the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.|$|E
5|$|Vinson Massif, {{the highest}} peak in Antarctica at , {{is located in}} the Ellsworth Mountains. Antarctica {{contains}} many other mountains, on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on Ross Island is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on Deception Island, which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> active. In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers.|$|E
