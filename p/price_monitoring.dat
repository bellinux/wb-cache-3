The model examines the customer's decision of whether to shoplift or not {{as well as the}} store's profit-maximizing <b>price</b> and <b>monitoring</b> intensity. The paper challenges the conventional wisdom that the observed rise in shoplifting calls for intensified <b>monitoring</b> and higher <b>prices,</b> showing that a rational response to increased shoplifting involves a reduction in both <b>monitoring</b> and <b>prices.</b> Shoplifting <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Price</b> determination Public shame...|$|R
