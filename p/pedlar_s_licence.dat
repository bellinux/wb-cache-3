40|$|While {{state legislatures}} have enacted laws that remove men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>licence</b> to rape women {{with whom they}} share marital or {{established}} relationships, our understanding of whether this resulted in effectively changing the social, cultural and legal response to sexual violence by male intimate partners is surprisingly limited. Reports from Australian women, and research findings overall, suggest few inroads {{have been made in}} identifying the scope of male partner sexual violence or in considering how to prevent it. While a reluctance to respond to male partner sexual violence is shown to exist within the practice and enforcement of law, it is also reflected in our failure to acknowledge the difficulties women face in naming their experience of rape, by a range of services marginalising their responses to rape, and through our neglecting to identify the particular health effects, and emotional impact of rape. It is this notion of reluctance that structures this issues paper by Melanie Heenan...|$|R

This paper {{concentrates on the}} micro production processes of today s correspondent {{as he or she}} goes about the job of newsgathering 2 ̆ 7 on the road 2 ̆ 7, and considers the changing nature of the correspondent 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy. It inserts the missing character in foreign newsgathering - the locally hired fixer - and explores how this person affects the correspondent 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy. An analysis of interviews with 20 foreign correspondents and five fixers leads {{to the conclusion that the}} foreign correspondent is rarely the sole editorial figure on the road but is instead the main actor representing the creative interplay of a succession of fixers or 2 ̆ 7 local producers 2 ̆ 7. This deconstruction of the ways in which a correspondent builds an ad-hoc newsgathering team each time he or she lands in d new place allows for a deeper understanding of the modus operandi of reporters. <br /...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the Crown protected the Elizabethan stage against attacks from the corporation of London and other enemies of the theatre. Queen Elizabeth and influential members of the Privy Council, such as the Earl of Leicester and Lord Hunsdon, patronized major companies of players, authorizing them to play throughout England. There were, however, times when the central government appeared {{to act as if}} they were actually an enemy of the stage themselves. In 1597, the Privy Council ordered the demolition of all the purpose-built theatres in London. In l 598, it issued a decree restricting playing in and around the city of London to only two companies. In l 600, it further ordered these two troupes to limit performance to a single playhouse each and not to play more than twice a week. Some critics believe that these decrees issued by the Privy Council against the stage, together with the system of dramatic censorship by the Master of the Revels established in Elizabeth 2 ̆ 7 s reign, were intended to curtail the growth of the expanding theatre industry. The present paper questions this notion, arguing that, in spite of these ostensibly antitheatrical measures, the central government had no intention of restraining the stage. It was one thing to issue an order but quite another to see that it was enforced. There {{is no evidence that the}} output of the London theatre industry was diminished during the period 1597 - 1600 when the Privy Council issued the orders against the stage. The Privy Council minutes and other records strongly suggest that it made little or no effort to have any of these antitheatrical decrees vigorously enforced. (The order of 1597 for the destruction of all playhouses did not in fact destroy any of them.) Dramatic censorship by the Master of the Revels did not check the growth of the theatre industry either, but rather promoted it. The Master censored all plays being prepared for the stage according to the royal patent granted to him in l 581. This system of censorship, by which the Master licensed the plays to be acted, made it easier for companies of players to operate in London as well as in the countryside, because the Master 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>licence</b> for playing protected the players against mayors and other local officials who wanted to suppress their performances, lt is true that the central government, with the Master of the Revels as their agent, exerted control over the stage, but they regulated the stage in a way that protected the theatre industry rather than placing limits on it...|$|R
40|$|All {{continental}} life {{stages of}} eel are exploited in England and Wales. The main fisheries for glass eel are by estuarine dip-nets in the southwest. The main fisheries for yellow and silver eel occur in {{southern and eastern}} England, with fyke nets being the preferred instrument. Fishing effort is not directly recorded but is inferred from licence sales. Around 1100 glass eel licenses were sold annually from 1980 to 1994, increasing to around 2500 in 1998, but declined to about 800 per annum since 2001. Declared catches of glass eel have been below 1 – 2 t since 2001, compared to 10 – 70  t in the 1970 s and 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Licence</b> sales for yellow and silver eel fisheries (combined) varied from around 1100 to 2900 over the period 1983 – 2007, peaking in the mid- 1980 s, mid- 1990 s and again in 2005 – 2007. Declared catches peaked in the late 1980 s and mid- 1990 s (peak 280 t), but have been low since 2001 (mean 29 t). Nett export data suggests catches may be 4 times higher. Eel landings are reported as bycatch from various marine fisheries around the UK coasts, with landings from 2001 to 2007 ranging from 0. 2 to 13. 7 t per annum. Assessment of stock status is based mainly on catch and catch per unit effort data as {{there has been little}} fishery independent survey of eels. There has been a general decreasing trend in both glass eel catches reported to the Agency and in nett export data. Comparing maximum catch levels in the late 1970 s–early 1980 s with minimum levels in the 2000 s suggests that the catch has declined by around 75 – 95 %. Trends in CPUE are similar, at least until 1998. It is concluded that current glass eel recruitment to the western coast of the UK is approximately 30 % of the pre- 1980 level of recruitment. Yellow and silver eel indices derived from HMRC nett exports or reported catches per licence sold, both suggest that the current estimate of stocks derived from these data are 20 % those of the late 1980 s and mid 1990 s. The Reference Condition Model has been used to assess compliance with the EC target (EU regulation 1100 / 2007). Assessment is at the River Basin District (RBD) level and in most cases a single river has been used to represent the whole RBD. The assessment therefore has a low level of confidence attached to it, and work to improve this is outlined in the paper. A number of options to increase silver eel escapement are presented, specifically reducing fishing pressure, improving access and habitat quality, reducing the impacts of entrainment, controlling predators and stocking, with the interplay of options varying between rivers and basins depending on local priorities...|$|R

This research was conducted in Sleman Regency, especially in Depok Sub-District. The type if this research is empirical legal research that used the primary data sources as the main data beside secondary data. Method of collecting data was conducted through field research by used interview toward the respondent and source person and also from the literary study. Mean while the data analysis used qualitative analysis that used inductive method. From the result of current research, there is a problem emerged. A lot of society are not care if their buildings or houses doesn't have the Licence to Build, the procedure of registering the Licence to Build is difficult, most cost expensive, and they feel need no Licence to Build because they build above their own land. The large amount of classical house before 1990 <b>s</b> had no <b>Licence</b> to Build. With these problems, hopefully from the local regional goverment and the concerned party i. e.

40|$|The {{provision}} of water supply, its usage and discharge, are major concerns for all mines, often accounting {{for a significant}} portion of the daily running costs. To reduce these costs, mines will collect as much site runoff as possible, and recycle the water whenever economically feasible. The constant recycling of on-site waters can mean that, over time, the levels of salinity, acidity or alkalinity, or other contaminants may build up within the internal water management system to a point which may lead to problems with licensed discharge requirements. This project investigated the water quality at West Cliff Colliery, in order to develop an improved system for managing water resources with minimal environmental impact. While West Cliff Colliery is totally self sufficient and independent of any town water supply, issues have arisen with the quality of water being discharged into the receiving waterways, Brennans Creek and the upper Georges River. To alleviate these issues, a new water management system (WMS) has been established to try and maintain an adequate supply of clean recycled water and to prevent uncontrolled discharges to the environment outside West Cliff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Environment Protection <b>Licence</b> (EPL) requirements. This paper reports on the design of the new WMS, results of monitoring its effectiveness results, and implications for mine operations and environmental licence compliance...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) {{involves}} both biomedical {{and traditional}} medical training, which makes well-trained TCM doctors inexpensive {{health care providers}} for primary health care. The Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Commerce recognised this potential, and in the mid- 1990 <b>s</b> issued short-term <b>licences</b> for private TCM enterprises. In Dar es Salaam, some of these practices experiences a period of considerable growth, but by the year 2000 a degree of ambivalence if not resentment existed against Chinese medical doctors who were accused of unlawfully using biomedical medication, and the government refused to issue further licences. In addition, some 'doctors' had insufficient training or minimal clinical experience (though I also met some notable exceptions). This article asks why Tanzanian patients turn to the Chinese for medical treatment, and who patients know about Chinese medicine and medication. One of the chief findings is that the Swahili term dawa ya Kichina is vague, which allows patients to transfer their positive experiences with Chinese biomedical doctors {{during the period of}} socialist orientation onto the current, entrepreneurial TCM doctors. Dawa ya Kichina is often considered a rapidly effective 'advanced' 'traditional' medicine; its ready-made patent formulas, which make it look 'scientific' and 'modern', are easy to consume; and its entrepreneurial set-up has several advantages over the bureaucratic structures of 'hospital medicine'. Chinese anti-malarials, artesiminin derivatives, reduce malarial fevers within hours, and though, strictly speaking, they are biomedical drugs, they are indeed dawa ya Kichina. Moreover, patients of TCM doctors sometimes experience rapid recovery mostly due to skilled integration of biomedical and Chinese medical treatment. Further research is recommended to investigate the primary health care potential of such integrated Chinese and biomedical treatment. N. B. The full-text of this article is not available in ORA.

40|$|The {{provision}} of water supply, its usage and discharge, are major concerns for all mines, both underground and opencut, often accounting {{for a significant}} portion of the daily running cost of mining. To reduce these costs, mines will often collect as much site runoff as possible, and recycle the water whenever economically feasible. The constant recycling of on-site waters can mean that, over time, the levels of salinity, acidity or alkalinity, or other contaminants may build up within the internal water management system to a point which may lead to problems with licensed discharge requirements. This project investigated the water quality at West Cliff Colliery, an underground coal mine, in the Illawarra Coal Measures, in order to develop an improved system for managing water resources with minimal environmental impact. While West Cliff Colliery is totally self sufficient and independent of any town water supply, issues have arisen with the quality of water being discharged into the receiving waterways, Brennans Creek and the upper Georges River. To alleviate these issues, a new water management system (WMS) has been established to try and maintain an adequate supply of clean recycled water and to prevent uncontrolled discharges to the environment outside West Cliff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Environmental Protection <b>Licence</b> (EPL) requirements. To monitor changes in the WMS, a new operation of the system involved a daily testing and monthly sampling regime of the key water quality parameters pH, EC, temperature and ORP. These parameters were measured at designated sites within the WMS using probes and meters that had been freshly calibrated each day. Monthly grab samples were also taken from the same designated sites for laboratory analysis of trace (heavy) metals. Chemical speciation modelling was also carried out in order to determine the ecotoxicity of dissolved trace metals in the discharge water. Operating the WMS in the new manner prescribed led to a significant reduction in uncontrolled discharges to the environment, a reduction in salinity of the WMS water, a reduction in the concentrations of potentially ecotoxic elements As, Cu, Ni, and Zn. It also maintained a high level of compliance with the mines current EPL and provided a more constant environmental flow in the upper Georges River without having to resort to much more costly forms of water treatment...|$|R
