25|$|Chevrolet Rounded-Line K Fleetside, K Stepside, K Blazer, and K Suburban - <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (1973-1979) {{two-speed}} New Process 203 transfer case, center differential with 50:50 {{torque split}} and lock. An Eaton Automatic Differential Lock was optional for the rear hypoid differential.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{features}} for the Audi V8 included a 32-valve, {{double overhead camshaft}} (DOHC) V8 engine and a four-speed electronically controlled ZF 4HP24A automatic transmission providing Audi's quattro <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system. A five-speed (later in production six-speed) manual transmission was also available.|$|E
50|$|System type: <b>Permanent</b> {{asymmetric}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car has <b>permanent</b> {{intelligent}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with 50/50 {{torque split}} and a two-speed transfer case for {{high and low}} range options. This h to maintain traction and stability in challenging conditions on-road, off-road, or when towing.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz M-Class (W163) was {{available}} with <b>permanent</b> 4Matic <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> which routed torque to all four wheels through all open front, center, and rear differentials. The system used a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4409 transfer case with reduction gearing, and Mercedes' new Four-wheel Electronic Traction System (4-ETS). 4-ETS simulated three differential locks {{on all three}} open differentials, via aggressively braking one or more spinning wheels.|$|R
25|$|GMC Rounded-Line K Wideside, K Fenderside, K Jimmy, and K Suburban - <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (1973-1979) {{two-speed}} New Process 203 transfer case, center planetary differential with 50:50 {{torque split}} and lock. An Eaton Automatic Differential Lock was optional for the rear hypoid differential.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover was a body-on-frame {{design with}} a box section ladder type chassis, like the {{contemporary}} Series Land Rovers. The Range Rover used coil springs as opposed to leaf springs, <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> and four-wheel disc brakes. The Range Rover was originally powered by various Rover V8 engines and diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|Based on the A6 platform, the RS6's {{internal}} combustion engines are front-mounted and longitudinally oriented, while the transmission is mounted immediately {{at the rear}} of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle. Like all S and RS models, the RS6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' Torsen-based quattro <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|New {{features}} in the 2006 M-Class include the 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission, optional Active Curve-Illuminating Bi-Xenon headlights which [...] "steer" [...] {{in the path of}} the vehicle, and an adjustable-height air suspension. The manual transmission has been dropped. <b>Permanent</b> 4Matic <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> remained, with one-speed transfer case (no low range), center limited-slip differential and four-wheel electronic traction system (4-ETS). In most countries except the U.S., an Off-Road Pro package with center and rear differential locks, 4-ETS, two-speed transfer case with reduction gearing, and adjustable ground clearance was available as an option increasing the original fording depth from 500 mm to 600 mm.|$|R
50|$|K-Series pickups {{included}} either Conventional, <b>Permanent,</b> or Shift-on-the-move <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> The latter {{system was}} introduced for 1981. Regardless {{of the type}} of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system equipped, all K-Series pickups featured four-corner Vari-Rate multi-leaf springs, front live axle with symmetrical (inline) shock absorber geometry, and the Load Control rear suspension system. K-Series pickups also featured an off-road oriented design, with the transfer case bolted directly to the transmission and running gear tucked up as high as possible under the vehicle to reduce the chances of snagging vital components on obstacles, as well as to achieve a low silhouette and optimal ground clearance. Exposed brake lines wrapped in steel were standard, with underbody skid plate armor optional for further protection.|$|R
50|$|Jeep uses {{a variety}} of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> systems on their various vehicles. These range from basic {{part-time}} systems that require the driver to move a control lever to send power to four wheels, to <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> systems that monitor and sense traction needs at all four wheels automatically under all conditions.|$|R
25|$|The Evoque was {{equipped}} with either two-wheel drive or a generation IV Haldex <b>permanent</b> <b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system until the 2014 model year update when the Haldex system was replaced by two optional All-Wheel Drive Systems (Standard Driveline or Active Driveline) by GKN Driveline. The Evoque also comes standard with Land Rover's latest version of Terrain Response, which maximises traction {{in a variety of}} conditions by altering throttle response, power distribution, and suspension settings. The Terrain Response system also includes electronic stability control, roll stability control, traction control, and an optional hill descent control which automatically applies braking to control speed when moving down an incline.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover used <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> {{rather than}} the {{switchable}} rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E
2500|$|... "Stage 1" [...] {{refers to}} {{the first stage of}} {{investment}} by the British Government in the company to improve the Land Rover and Range Rover product offerings, which eventually led to the Land Rover 90 and 110. The use of the Range Rover engine and drive train made it the only Series III vehicle to have <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> systems {{included}} Command-Trac, {{a part-time}} unit offering temporary 4-wheel assistance; Command-Trac was dropped from lineup {{in conjunction with}} the SE trim in 1996. Selec-Trac had the option of either full-time or part-time operation; both shift-on-the-fly Command-Trac and Selec-Trac were already available for the Cherokee, and they were adapted to the Grand Cherokee. Exclusive to the Grand Cherokee was the introduction of Quadra-Trac system with <b>permanent</b> all-time <b>four-wheel</b> assistance. This was optional on all models. Low-range required using a manual shift lever for all three systems.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{generation}} 2011 Ford Explorer (U502) replaced automatic ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{with automatic}} Intelligent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and Terrain Management.|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> demand {{increased}} significantly, with Versatile {{becoming one}} of the leaders in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> development and production. By the late 1970s the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150.|$|R
2500|$|The 16C Galibier uses a front-mounted, 8.0 L twin-supercharged W16 {{engine that}} {{delivers}} power via <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> The engine {{is derived from}} the quad-turbocharged unit used in the Bugatti Veyron. It will also incorporate an option for a hybrid powertrain, primarily to reduce pollution in urbanised environments. Performance figures have not been specified, but it has a power output in excess of [...] while exceeding speeds of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The RS6 {{was only}} {{available}} with Audi's Torsen-based quattro <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> utilising the Torsen T-2 dynamic 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential (diff), a modified unit which {{was being used}} in the 6.0-litre W12-powered Audi D2 A8. [...] The torque from the engine is first routed from the gearbox output shaft to the Torsen centre diff, and then automatically divided and apportioned between the front and rear axles.|$|E
2500|$|Rover {{continued}} {{to develop its}} '100-inch Station Wagon', which became the ground-breaking Range Rover, launched in 1970. This also used the ex-Buick V8 engine {{as well as the}} P6's innovative safety-frame body structure design and features such as <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and all-round disc brakes. [...] The Range Rover was initially designed as a utility vehicle which could offer the off-road capability of the Land Rover, but in a more refined and car-like package.|$|E
50|$|For {{vehicles}} that have partial <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> the term two-wheel drive {{refers to the}} mode when <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is deactivated and torque is applied to only two wheels.|$|R
50|$|Access to both {{sections}} of the park requires a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicle. <b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles on Fraser Island need to obtain a vehicle permit. Both sections have numerous camping areas.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} {{also saw the}} introduction of Super Select 4WD (SS4) as ActivTrak 4WD in some markets, multimode ABS, which were firsts on Japanese <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives,</b> and electronic shock absorber. SS4 was ground-breaking {{in the sense that}} it combined the advantages of part-time and full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with four available options: 2H (high-range rear-wheel drive), 4H (high-range full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive),</b> 4HLc (high-range <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with locked center differential) and 4LLc (low-range <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with locked center differential). Another advantage of this {{second generation}} system is that it gave the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel <b>drive</b> and full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> at speeds up to 100 km/h (62 mph), whereas the first generation Pajero had to be stationary to switch from rear-wheel <b>drive</b> to <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (but not from <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> back to rear-wheel drive). In addition to the SS4, an air locking differential was included as factory option. Either 4HLc or 4LLc mode must be engaged to perform this operation. Multimode ABS, on the other hand, was equally innovative. This meant ABS would be fully functional in all modes of SS4, as braking with a locked center differential requires completely different braking parameters. The new electronic shock absorber was also factory option with three settings: S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard). This meant driver can change ride quality and handling depending on road conditions via a switch on center console.|$|R
2500|$|Between October 1998 and September 1999, Bugatti {{introduced}} {{a series of}} Giugiaro-designed concept vehicles, each with <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and powered by the Volkswagen-designed W18 engine. [...] The first, the EB118, was a 2-door coupé presented at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. [...] The next, the EB218, was a 4-door sedan presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. [...] A third, the 18/3 Chiron, was a mid-engined sports car presented at the 1999 International Motor Show in Frankfurt.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "RS" [...] {{initials}} {{are taken}} from the —literally translated as [...] "racing sport", and is the Audi marque's highest trim level, positioned above the [...] "S" [...] model specification of Audi's regular model line-up. [...] Like all Audi [...] "RS" [...] cars, the RS4 pioneers some of Audi's latest advanced technology, and could therefore {{be described as a}} [...] "halo vehicle". [...] Furthermore, it is only available with Audi's Torsen-based [...] "trademark" [...] quattro <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system.|$|E
2500|$|Like all Audi [...] "RS" [...] models, the RS 6 is {{fitted with}} Audi's 'trademark' quattro <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> as standard. This {{version of the}} RS 6 uses the latest {{asymmetric}} dynamic 40:60 front-to-rear default torque distribution from the Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential. [...] This latest incarnation of the Torsen quattro, first seen in the B7 RS 4, can automatically dynamically apportion up to a maximum 100% torque to the rear axle, or up to 80% to the front, dependent on traction conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{introduced}} {{the option of}} the F-Series in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> Previously a conversion outsourced to Marmon-Herrington, Ford {{was the first of}} the [...] "big three" [...] U.S. manufacturers to manufacture <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> trucks on its own.|$|R
50|$|The Jensen FF is a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> grand tourer {{produced}} by British car manufacturer Jensen Motors between 1966 and 1971. It {{was the first}} non all-terrain production car equipped with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and an anti-lock braking system.|$|R
50|$|The {{gravel road}} is {{accessible}} by all vehicles {{but it would}} be advisable to have a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (4WD) in wet conditions. The Panhandle Fire Trail is a 9.5 km <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> trail located within the park.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{focus of}} the B7 RS 4 was on the {{introduction}} of the latest development of Audi's 'trademark' quattro <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system. [...] This utilised the 'third generation' asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential, featuring a 'default' 40:60 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions. [...] Audi stressed that this would result in a more neutral response in corners, and a more dynamic driving experience. [...] Also, a more aggressive Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) was used, and set to 4:1, as opposed to 2:1 (and later variants 3:1 TBR) on standard A4. [...] That means that one side of the differential can handle up to 80%, while the other side would have to only handle 20% of applied torque.|$|E
2500|$|Rover {{acknowledged}} the emerging recreational off-road market in 1967 under Charles Spencer King, {{and began the}} [...] "100-inch Station Wagon" [...] program to develop a radical competitor. Rover bought a Bronco, which featured the sort of long-travel coil spring suspension necessary for the required blend of luxury car comfort and Land Rover's proven off-road ability. [...] King {{is said to have}} been convinced of coil springs while driving a Rover P6 across rough scrubland on part of the Solihull factory site that was being redeveloped. [...] He was also convinced that a <b>permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> transmission was needed both to provide adequate handling and reliably absorb the power required for the vehicle to be competitive. The cost of developing a totally new transmission was spread between the 100-inch SW project and one working on what would become the Land Rover 101 Forward Control. Powerful, light and sturdy, the Buick alloy V8 earned off-road modifications such as carburetors that maintained fuel supply at extreme angles and provision for cranking the engine with a starting handle in emergencies.|$|E
50|$|System type: <b>Permanent</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the convertible in 1981, a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version of the coupé was also added. The <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was developed by Ferguson Research who also offered it for installation into the Opel Senator/Vauxhall Royale.|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is {{the brand}} name of a {{selectable}} automatic full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system offered by Ford Motor Company. The <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was designed and developed at BorgWarner under its TorqTransfer Systems division in the mid 1980s. BorgWarner calls the system Torque-On-Demand (TOD). ControlTrac was the first automatic system to use software control and no planetary or bevel geared center differential. Instead of a planetary or bevel geared center differential, the system uses a variable intelligent locking center multi-disc differential.|$|R
