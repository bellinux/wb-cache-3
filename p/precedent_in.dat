5|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{acknowledged}} that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with The Daily Stormer, but that the move set a dangerous <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> which other political views including left-wing ones could be denied legal protection.

5|$|The case, and {{the earlier}} Tinker v.

While subsequent court rulings have varied on when Hazelwood applies, the case remains a strong <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> the regulation of student speech. However, the New Voices bill of 2016, passed by 18 states, ignores the Hazelwood decision {{and returns to the}} Tinker precedent.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{along with}} the next continental US tests in 1951 set a <b>precedent.</b> <b>In</b> subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada test site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.|$|E
5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E

5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party {{commented that}} the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> any other nation in the world. Boscawen was {{critical}} of {{the effect that the}} ETS will have on households and farmers, stating that the average power bill will rise 10%, fuel bills will rise by 7 cents per litre and dairy farms will face an increase in costs before agriculture enters the scheme of NZ$7,500 per year as a result of associated increases in fuel, electricity and the cost of processing milk products. Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1916, Italy demanded {{explanations}} {{from the}} French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its ambassador, {{stating that the}} establishment of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë violated the Treaty of London. Austria-Hungary used the French <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> Korçë to justify the proclamation of the independence of Albania under its protectorate on January 3, 1917 in Shkodër. The Kingdom of Italy followed suit when proclaiming the independence of Albania under its protectorate on June 23, 1917 in Gjirokastra.|$|E
5|$|The Burger King v. Hoots {{trademark}} {{dispute and}} its resulting decision {{went beyond the}} original case, it established a major legal <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> the United States {{in regards to the}} Lanham Act. The ruling states that while the senior user of the state service mark or trademark has prior usage of the common law marks, federal statute overrides the earlier, state service mark and prohibits the senior user from preventing the junior user from exercising the use of the federally registered mark outside a defined geographic reach of the senior user.|$|E

5|$|The High Court's {{judgment}} {{marked a}} successful appeal for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian regulator of anti-competitive conduct, having lost {{at first instance}} and on appeal in the Federal Court of Australia. The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration, ending eight years of litigation between the parties. The High Court's judgment was received as a significant <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set a <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> state and federal courts {{that led to the}} erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court {{continued}} along this path in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> their {{decision}} {{making it possible for}} different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company {{troubles}} did not {{end with}} its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico Bottling Company and its sole stockholder, Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico Bottling Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed the flies and filed suit against Grapico Bottling. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion that serve as <b>precedent</b> <b>in</b> Mississippi for the rule that a stockholder of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works became the sole supplier of Grapico to Mississippi.|$|E
