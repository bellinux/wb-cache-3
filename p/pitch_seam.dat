30|$|The future {{potential}} for alternate uses {{is affected by}} important mining related variables that include: (1) seam thickness, seam <b>pitch,</b> <b>seam</b> pitch orientation and their variation, (2) areal extent {{and shape of the}} mining property, (3) overall size of the reserve and expected subsidence-influence area, (4) mining depth, (5) panel size, (6) mining advance rate, (7) multiple coal seams, and (8) mining width to depth ratio. Any surface or mining-related variables that directly or indirectly affect surface deformations must be considered. There is generally very little control on most of these variables. However, there may be some flexibility in panel orientation, panel width to depth ratio, and mining advance rate to control surface deformations and optimize CMR planning. Similarly, the presence of pre-existing water storage areas and water drainage patterns may allow some flexibility in CMR planning.|$|E
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for extracting underground minerals such as coal, which avoids the need for sending personnel underground and which enables the mining of steeply <b>pitched</b> <b>seams</b> of the mineral. The method includes {{the use of a}} narrow vehicle which moves underground along the mineral seam and which is connected by pipes or hoses to water pumps at the surface of the Earth. The vehicle hydraulically drills pilot holes during its entrances into the seam, and then directs sideward jets at the seam during its withdrawal from each pilot hole to comminute the mineral surrounding the pilot hole and combine it with water into a slurry, so that the slurried mineral can flow to a location where a pump raises the slurry to the surface...|$|R

2500|$|Swing bowlers {{cause the}} ball to move {{laterally}} through the air, rather than off the <b>pitch</b> like <b>seam</b> bowlers. Normal or conventional swing bowling is encouraged by the raised seam of the ball, and conventional swing is usually greatest when the ball is new and therefore has a pronounced seam. As the ball gets older, the wear makes swing more difficult to achieve, but this can be countered if the fielding team systematically polishes {{one side of the}} ball while allowing the other to become rough. When the ball has been polished highly on one side and not on the other and if the ball is bowled very fast (over 85 miles per hour), it produces a reverse swing such that the ball swings in the opposite direction as in conventional swing. Contrary to popular opinion, this swing is not produced by air flowing faster over the smooth or [...] "shiny" [...] side as compared to the rough side.|$|R
25|$|Seam {{deliveries}} can be bowled at any pace, {{but most}} specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace.

The seam of the ball is raised and will cause variations in bounce and movement if it is {{the first part of the}} ball to hit the pitch.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because {{it is very}} {{important}} to study the coal pillar stability, a lot of methods to do this have been proposed. But most of those methods do not consider the nature of coal material and only study the coal pillar that is level. To solve this problem suitably, here a new method is proposed. In this method, the plastic softening nature of coal material is considered. And also, the coal <b>seam</b> <b>pitch</b> is considered in our analysis. Based on real deformation of coal pillar and the previous study, the limiting equilibrium method is applied. At last, the rationality of our method is verified through a strip mining engineering example. And the results show that, the computing results of our method are coincided with measuring results very well and our method can be applied in real engineering practice very well...|$|R

500|$|Mike Selvey {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 1991 that Ambrose had [...] "the sort of easy, repetitive, no-sweat action {{which is the}} key to unyielding accuracy. There is no respite and all his other qualities are byproducts." [...] At his peak, Ambrose did not rely on {{pronounced}} swing or seam movement of the ball. Instead, he repeatedly bowled into the same areas of the pitch and the height from which he delivered the ball made him extremely difficult to face. The ball bounced sharply after pitching, sometimes deviating slightly from a straight line after <b>pitching</b> on the <b>seam,</b> and frequently took the edge of the batsman's bat to be caught behind the wicket. His 1992 citation as Wisden Cricketer of the Year states that he had [...] "outright pace and he generates a disconcerting, steepling bounce from fuller-length deliveries... His height and a slender, sinewy wrist contribute greatly to the final velocity , the wrist snapping forward at the instant of release to impart extra thrust". Writing in 2001 following Ambrose's retirement, Michael Atherton, whom Ambrose dismissed more often than any other batsman, said: [...] "At his best, {{there is no doubt that}} [...] moved beyond the fine line that separates the great from the very good.
