40|$|Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA {{methylation}}, {{are widely}} studied in cancer {{as they are}} stable and easy to measure genome wide. DNA methylation changes {{have been used to}} differentiate benign from malignant tissue and to predict tumor recurrence or patient outcome. Multiple genome wide DNA methylation studies in breast and <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers</b> have identified genes that are differentially methylated in malignant tissue compared with non-malignant tissue or in association with hormone receptor status or tumor recurrence. Although this has identified potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, what is highlighted by reviewing these studies is the similarities between breast and <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers.</b> In particular, the gene families/pathways targeted by DNA methylation in breast and <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers</b> have significant overlap and include homeobox genes, zinc finger transcription factors, S 100 calcium binding proteins, and potassium voltage-gated family members. Many of the gene pathways targeted by aberrant methylation in breast and <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers</b> are not targeted in other cancers, suggesting that some of these targets may be specific to hormonal cancers. Genome wide DNA methylation profiles in breast and <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers</b> will not only define more specific and sensitive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis but also identify novel therapeutic targets, which may be direct targets of agents that reverse DNA methylation or which may target novel gene families that are themselves DNA methylation targets.

40|$|SummaryThere is {{substantial}} heterogeneity among primary <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers,</b> {{evident in the}} spectrum of molecular abnormalities and its variable clinical course. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of 333 primary prostate carcinomas. Our results revealed a molecular taxonomy in which 74 % of these tumors fell into one of seven subtypes defined by specific gene fusions (ERG, ETV 1 / 4, and FLI 1) or mutations (SPOP, FOXA 1, and IDH 1). Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH 1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA 1 mutant tumors having {{the highest levels of}} AR-induced transcripts. 25 % of the <b>prostate</b> <b>cancers</b> had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI 3 K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19 %.

25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is poor. In light of this the rate of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> does not suggest that they reduce the risk of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> although additional research is needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Consuming fish may lower <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> especially more advanced cancers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{extremely}} rare in orchidectomised transgender {{women who have}} been treated with oestrogens for a prolonged period of time.

As such, and in accordance with the fact that androgens are responsible for the development of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> HRT appears to be highly protective against <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> in transgender women.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the causes of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> remains elusive. The primary risk factors are obesity, age and family history. <b>Prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is very uncommon in men younger than 45, but becomes more common with advancing age. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. However, many men never know they have <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Autopsy studies of Chinese, German, Israeli, Jamaican, Swedish, and Ugandan men who died of other causes have found <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> in 30% of men in their fifties, and in 80% of men in their seventies. Men who have first-degree family members with <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> appear to have double the risk of getting the disease compared to men without <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> in the family. This risk appears to be greater for men with an affected brother than for men with an affected father. In the United States in 2005, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> and 30,000 deaths due to <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Men with high blood pressure are more likely to develop <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> There is a small increased risk of <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> associated with lack of exercise.
