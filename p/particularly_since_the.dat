5|$|George Hudson {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} daylight saving in 1895. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on April 30, 1916.

5|$|The {{riots in}} which Blakelock died took place within {{a wave of}} social unrest across England. Since the 1980 St. Pauls riot in Bristol, and <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1981 Brixton riot in south London, a series of {{incidents}} had sparked violent confrontations between black youths and largely white police officers.|$|E

5|$|The kibbutz was {{established}} in 1926 by pioneers from the Hashomer Hatzair movement, who moved to Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah from Poland. It was the first Jewish settlement {{in the southern part}} of the Jezreel Valley. It soon became a center of the Hashomer Hatzair, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first regional school of the Kibbutz Arzi network was set up there. In April 1948 the kibbutz was the epicenter of an important battle when it successfully resisted the first large-scale attack of the Arab Liberation Army commanded by Fawzi al-Qawuqji.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E

5|$|In 1831 slate {{duty was}} abolished, and this helped {{to produce a}} rapid {{expansion}} in the industry, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> duty on tiles was not abolished until 1833. The Ffestiniog Railway line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded slate waggons could be run by gravity downhill {{all the way from}} Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in 'dandy' waggons. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had previously had to cart the slate to Maentwrog to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the River Dwyryd to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels. There was further expansion at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed road. After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the Llechwedd quarry. A fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842 led to a demand for slate for rebuilding, and Germany became an important market, particularly for Ffestiniog slate.|$|E
