5|$|The liberty ship SS Richard Montgomery, {{built in}} 1943, was sunk in 1944 in the Thames Estuary. Its cargo of 3,173 tons of munitions {{continues}} to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> {{threat to the}} local area.|$|E

Lack of consensus on {{the source of this}} artery <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> dilemma to surgeons during management of haemorrhagic episodes. Determination of the exact source of this artery is therefore pivotal.|$|R
5|$|The {{oil shale}} waste heaps <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> {{spontaneous}} ignition risk {{due to their}} remaining organic content. The waste material, particularly semi-coke, contains pollutants including sulphates, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{some of which are}} toxic and carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|The water {{needed in}} the oil shale {{retorting}} process offers an additional economic consideration: this may <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> problem in areas with water scarcity.|$|E
5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark {{forms an}} {{important}} component of the commercial gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E

5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does not <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons {{do not fully}} coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{is in the}} South Volcanic Zone, {{where many}} volcanoes <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to human life. Among the other active volcanoes of the South Volcanic Zone are Mount Hudson, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima {{together}} have more than 80 reported episodes of volcanism since 1558, and at least 40 South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions.|$|E

5000|$|A threat may {{be either}} {{empirical}} (an outside observer may {{agree that the}} event or circumstance <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> threat) or a priori (an outside observer would not agree that the event or circumstance <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> threat). What {{is important to the}} individual, in terms of the body’s response, is that a threat is perceived.|$|R

5|$|Critics have {{objected to}} {{the killing of the}} sea lions, {{pointing}} out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} Gator Bowl, Louisville's scoring offense was ranked {{third in the}} country—averaging 45.2points per game—and was held under 30points just once in their {{preceding}} 21games. The high-powered Cardinals' offense was predicted to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> challenge for the Virginia Tech defense.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in {{the areas in which}} it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The viral infection causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> significant {{threat to}} human life near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E

5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E
5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E
