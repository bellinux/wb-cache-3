These observations {{were carried out}} using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the W. M. Keck-I Telescope {{as part of a}} program to study galaxy-scale gravitational lenses. From our spectra we found the redshift of the background source in <b>CLASS</b> <b>B</b> 0128 + 437 (z_s= 3. 1240 +- 0. 0042) and the lensing galaxy redshifts in <b>CLASS</b> <b>B</b> 0445 + 123 (z_l= 0. 5583 +- 0. 0003) and <b>CLASS</b> <b>B</b> 0850 + 054 (z_l= 0. 5883 +- 0. 0006). Intriguingly, we also discovered that <b>CLASS</b> <b>B</b> 0631 + 519 may have two lensing galaxies (z_l, 1 = 0. 0896 +- 0. 0001, z_l, 2 = 0. 6196 +- 0. 0004). We also found a single unidentified emission line from the lensing galaxy in <b>CLASS</b> <b>B</b> 0128 + 437 and the lensed source in <b>CLASS</b> <b>B</b> 0850 + 054.

40|$|<b>Class</b> <b>B</b> floral {{homeotic}} genes {{are involved in}} specifying stamen and petal identity in angiosperms (flowering plants). Here we report that gymnosperms, the closest relatives of the angiosperms, contain at least two different clades representing putative orthologues of <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes, termed GGM 2 -like and DAL 12 -like genes. To obtain information about the functional conservation of the <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes in seed plants, the representative {{of one of these}} clades from Gnetum, termed GGM 2, was expressed {{under the control of the}} CaMV 35 S promoter in Arabidopsis wild-type plants and in different <b>class</b> <b>B</b> mutants. In wild-type plants and in a conditional mutant grown at a permissive temperature, gain-of-function phenotypes were obtained in whorls 1 and 4, where <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes are usually not expressed. In contrast, loss-of-function phenotypes were observed in whorls 2 and 3, where <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes are expressed. In different <b>class</b> <b>B</b> gene null mutants of Arabidopsis, and in the conditional B mutant grown at the non-permissive temperature, a partial complementation of the mutant phenotype was obtained. In situ hybridization studies and <b>class</b> <b>B</b> gene promoter test fusion experiments demonstrated that the gain-of- function phenotypes are not due to an upregulation of the endogenous B genes from Arabidopsis, and hence probably involve interactions between GGM 2 protein homodimers and <b>class</b> <b>B</b> protein target genes other than the Arabidopsis <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes itself. To our knowledge, this is the first time that partial complementation of a homeotic mutant by an orthologous gene from a distantly related species has been reported. These data suggest that GGM 2 has a function in the gymnosperm Gnetum which is related to that of <b>class</b> <b>B</b> floral organ identity genes of angiosperms. That function may be in the specification of male reproductive organ identity, and in distinguishing male from female reproductive organs...|$|R
