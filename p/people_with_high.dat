5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> blood pressure are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> blood lead concentrations.|$|E

50|$|<b>People</b> <b>with</b> lower {{socio-economic}} status receive information slower than <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> {{socio-economic status}}. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> lower SES receive information slower {{because they are}} less educated compared to <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> SES; they have less time to spend on reading information (they {{spend more time on}} working to maintain living quality), have restricted from some information that the high SES have the right or easily access to, and less access to information. Young consumers of the newspaper are <b>people</b> <b>with</b> lower socio-economic status, they read less, spend less time on reading newspaper and require smaller amount of information compare to the older consumers. As the <b>people</b> <b>with</b> lower SES reduce time to read newspapers, their social/political knowledge will decrease as the same time which widened the knowledge gap between <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> SES and lower SES. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> lower SES tend to gain information from TV, but the information bias to the entertainment than accurate information which make people lower SES learn poorly.|$|R
40|$|Dysfunctional social {{behavior}} has {{been implicated in}} the experience of depression. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of depressive symptoms report more frequent negative social interactions and react more strongly to them. It remains unknown, however, whether reaction strength differs depending on whether social interactions are positive or negative. Drawing on socioevolutionary models of depression (N. B. Allen & P. B. T. Badcock, 2003), the authors propose that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of depressive symptoms should react more strongly not only to negative social interactions but also to positive social interactions and a sense of belonging. Using nonclinical samples, 2 daily process studies examined the role of depression in people’s reactivity to social interactions in natural, ongoing, social contexts. In Study 1, the number of positive and negative social events showed a stronger relation to well-being among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of depressive symptoms. Study 2 extended this finding to perceptions of belonging in memorable social interactions, finding a stronger link between belonging and well-being among <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> levels of depressive symptoms. Together these studies provide the first indication that depressive symptoms may sensitize people to everyday experiences of both social rejection and social acceptance...|$|R

40|$|Grossman's {{model of}} demand for {{healthcare}} has been developed by separating health capital from theory of human capital. According to this model, everybody is an active producer {{of his or her}} own health (capital) using purchased healthcare and his/her own time as inputs. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> income demand greater amount of health capital to reduce number of sick days. Therefore they invest in healthcare more. On the contrary, <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> education need to invest less in healthcare, because they are more effective producers of health capital. Data obtained from CZSO (Czech Statistic Office) confirm the validity of Grossman conclusions also in the Czech Republic, although it is a country with compulsory part of investments into health capital - health insurance. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> income do try to minimize the outage in income in such a way, that they spend less time on sick leave as <b>people</b> <b>with</b> lower income...|$|R

Historically, Steinkjer has produced a higher than average amount of university students. Only 25% of the students return to Steinkjer. Steinkjer is therefore a municipality that produces many <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> education students. In Norwegian, municipalities such as Steinkjer that produce many <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> education who leave the municipality are known as oppvekstkommuner (lit. upbringing municipalities).|$|R

25|$|There is {{considerable}} variation within and overlap among these categories. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> IQs are found {{at all levels}} of education and occupational categories.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{competing}} theories {{trying to make}} sense of this apparent paradox. Doctor James White postulates that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> IQs are more critical of information and thus less likely to accept facts at face value. While marketing campaigns against drugs may deter individuals with lower IQs from using drugs with disjoint arguments or over-exaggeration of negative consequences, <b>people</b> <b>with</b> a <b>higher</b> IQ will seek to verify the validity of such claims in their immediate environment. White also eludes to an often-overlooked problem of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> IQ, the lack of adequate challenges and intellectual stimulation. White posits that high IQ individuals that are not sufficiently engaged in their lives may choose to forgo good judgment for the sake of stimulation.|$|R

Its effects can vary according to its causes. They might include muscular weariness, hallucinations, and/or mental fatigue. Chronic insomnia can cause double vision.|$|E
25|$|One {{criticism}} {{of the works of}} Mayer and Salovey comes from a study by Roberts et al. (2001), which suggests that the EI, as measured by the MSCEIT, may only be measuring conformity. This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>high</b> EI).|$|E
