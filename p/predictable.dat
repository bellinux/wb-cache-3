5|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of DCS is not easily <b>predictable,</b> many predisposing factors are known. They may be considered as either environmental or individual.|$|E
5|$|Much {{is still}} unknown about the radius of maximum wind in {{tropical}} cyclones, including {{whether or not}} it can be <b>predictable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Word {{stress is}} non-contrastive and <b>predictable</b> — it {{falls on the}} last vowel in a word (including schwa).|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium. Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with <b>predictable</b> intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) {{is useful}} as a gamma ray source {{because it can be}} {{produced}} in <b>predictable</b> quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33MeV.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Fischer was <b>predictable</b> in his use of {{openings}} {{and variations}} of those openings. Despite this seeming disadvantage, {{it was very difficult}} for opponents to exploit this limitation, because Fischer's knowledge of the openings and variations that he used was extensive.|$|E
5|$|GameSpots {{retrospective}} on real-time strategy history {{said the}} game's AI was unintelligent and <b>predictable,</b> and Scott Love said a difficulty setting would {{have increased the}} game's longevity. Reviewers found the pathfinding poor. Both Scott Love and the J-Man said the game runs very slowly during large battles.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its {{significant}} and highly <b>predictable</b> migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect the sharks and public health.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Hudner visited Pyongyang in {{an attempt}} to recover Brown's remains from the crash site. He was told by North Korean {{authorities}} to return in September when the weather is more <b>predictable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Owing to its <b>predictable</b> {{organization}} and readily inducible LTP, the CA1 hippocampus {{has become the}} prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP, and is therefore {{the focus of this}} article.|$|E
5|$|Stress in Khmer {{falls on}} the final {{syllable}} of a word. Because of this <b>predictable</b> pattern, stress is non-phonemic in Khmer (it does not distinguish different meanings).|$|E
5|$|The event drew 197,000 {{pay-per-view}} buys, and {{was attended}} live by 11,000 people. Reviews {{for the event}} were generally negative, with reviewers criticizing the endings of the matches, stoppages for blood, and <b>predictable</b> match results. Five wrestlers sustained legitimate injuries {{during the course of}} the show.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest <b>predictable</b> geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not <b>predictable),</b> also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{while the}} output {{from a single}} turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more {{turbines}} are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more <b>predictable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vagrant {{birds have}} been {{recorded}} in Kazakhstan, Lebanon and several European countries, {{as well as in}} North America. Although Alaskan records, like those in western Europe, are mainly from late September to November, occurrences in Canada are less <b>predictable</b> although mostly in autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Wind power {{hardly ever}} suffers major {{technical}} failures, since failures of individual wind turbines have hardly {{any effect on}} overall power, so that the distributed wind power is reliable and <b>predictable,</b> whereas conventional generators, while far less variable, can suffer major unpredictable outages.|$|E
5|$|A story arc from A Town Where You Live {{was adapted}} into an {{original}} video animation called A Town Where You Live: Twilight Intersection by Tatsunoko Production. Gonzo later adapted the series into an anime under its manga name; Gonzo's anime {{resulted in a}} radio program, drama CD, and an image song. Reception towards the manga was mixed with reviewers praising the plot for its realism or panning it as <b>predictable</b> and cliché.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from <b>predictable</b> interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a <b>predictable</b> fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties for PC was {{released}} in North America on October 23, 2007. The Mac version {{was released}} on August 5, 2008. The game was generally received well by critics, mostly praising graphics, and sometimes criticizing <b>predictable</b> aspects of the game. It earned a 79% score on GameRankings and an 81% on Metacritic.|$|E
5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and <b>predictable</b> stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|At Newmarket {{five days}} later she faced only one opponent, a colt called Dunure, in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes. She started at odds of 1/40 and won the £1,000 prize in a <b>predictable</b> canter. In the Newmarket Oaks on 11 October she ran lazily but won very easily by a length from Golconda, to whom she was conceding {{nineteen}} pounds.|$|E
5|$|Belle is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming {{daughter of an}} inventor. Belle yearns to abandon her <b>predictable</b> village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} <b>predictable,</b> with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|During the manufacturer's flight tests, the Yak-19 {{became the}} first Soviet {{aircraft}} to exceed 900km/h. Major Sergei Anokhin was the primary test pilot and reported that the aircraft had pleasant and <b>predictable</b> flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for the average pilot. Before the testing was completed, Anokhin led the jets participating in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's {{scale is}} about how people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and <b>predictable</b> from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|Meteor showers {{should be}} <b>predictable,</b> but some meteors are cometary debris and so require {{calculations}} of orbits which are currently impossible to complete. Other events noted by ancients include aurorae, sun dogs and rainbows {{all of which}} are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Some comets are <b>predictable,</b> {{most famously}} Halley's Comet. Yet {{as a class}} of object they remain {{unpredictable}} and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy orbital periods which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the Solar System once and so are inherently unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} praised for its direction, cinematography, and the {{chemistry}} between its lead actors. Khan and Sharma were lauded for their performances, though the movie's <b>predictable</b> plot drew criticism. At {{the end of}} its theatrical run Jab Tak Hai Jaan received a number of awards, including four Filmfare Awards, which included trophies for Best Supporting Actress (Anushka Sharma) and Best Lyrics for Gulzar.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and <b>predictable,</b> while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the Big Four is generally seen {{to have had a}} positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being from European countries, this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America. It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game <b>predictable</b> or even boring.|$|E
5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful {{not to make the}} story <b>predictable.</b> The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.|$|E
5|$|The wettest {{conditions}} {{persist in}} the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time. Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland {{are not in a}} stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and <b>predictable</b> periods.|$|E
5|$|Transits of Venus {{are among}} the rarest of <b>predictable</b> astronomical phenomena. They occur in a pattern that {{generally}} repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years. The periodicity {{is a reflection of}} the fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} L7 albums, Slap-Happy {{features more}} varied and slower-paced songs, {{some of which}} borrowing elements from other genres like hip hop. Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics and suffered dismal sales {{partly due to the}} poor distribution and support by Bong Load. Some critics found the album <b>predictable</b> and too similar to previous L7 albums, but others highlighted certain songs for their nifty musical style.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less <b>predictable</b> causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|A second, {{far smaller}} storm cell passed along a similar {{route to the}} first {{later in the evening}} of 14 April. This cell was never given the {{classification}} of 'severe' by the Bureau of Meteorology, nor did it develop into a supercell like its predecessor. Therefore, the route of the second cell was more direct and <b>predictable</b> than the first, following the general movement of the cold front (see conditions and climatology), and the Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings to all residents in the second cell's projected path to expect further storm activity.|$|E
