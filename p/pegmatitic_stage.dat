40|$|Cordierite clusters” up {{to about}} 3 cm in {{diameter}} abundantly found in Sarugajo-type granitic rock (aplitic adamellite) from Takakumayama, Kagoshima, Japan, were examined using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, and X-ray analytical microscopy. The “cordierite clusters” were composed mainly of quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, garnet, cordierite, biotite, muscovite and clinochlore. Compositional maping of the “cordierite cluster” revealed that microcrystalline clinochlore colored the cluster. An abundance of Fe in the cordierite indicates that it was formed in the <b>pegmatitic</b> <b>stage</b> during cooling of the Takakumayama Granite. ...|$|E
40|$|The growth history {{reconstruction}} of tourmaline macro-crystals from pegmatite pockets in the aplite veins of Grotta d'Oggi (island of Elba, Italy) {{was carried out}} using a multi-disciplinary and multi-analytical approach [X-ray diffraction topography (XRDT) and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) ]. The work covered in this paper {{is closely related to}} the previous crystal-chemical characterization of the same macro-crystals (Bosi et al. 2005). The tourmalines examined here are bi-colored crystals exhibiting greenish-yellow to colorless zoning perpendicular to and parallel to the c axis: the transition from the inner yellow regions to the colorless ones occurs suddenly. XRDT and EMPA studies show relationships between color and chemical zoning and crystal growth evolution, thus identifying two main growth stages, which developed under different conditions. The first stage corresponds to greenish-yellow Mn-tourmaline grown {{as a result of a}} 2 D-growth mechanism in a F-rich pegmatitic environment; the second one corresponds to colorless elbaitic tourmaline, which developed chiefly by a spiral growth mechanism in an OH-rich hydrothermal environment. The structural defects found in greenish-yellow Mn-tourmaline (growth bands, absence of dislocations, near-uniform chemical element concentrations) are the same as those observed in beryl crystals from pegmatite pockets of the island of Elba. Therefore these features are growth marks that characterize the <b>pegmatitic</b> crystallization <b>stage</b> and differentiate it from the hydrothermal stage, in which the dislocations normal to the growing faces occurred. Hence, the role of tourmaline as a petrogenetic indicator can be extended from chemical composition to crystal growth, reflecting both chemical environment and growth mechanism, and contributing to a better understanding of mineral genesis in pegmatitic crystallization...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-pressure}} charnockites (P = 8 to 9 Kb., T = 700 to 800 C CO 2 -rich fluid regime) of the Nilgiri hills show {{evidence of}} retrogression related to shear deformation within the Moyar and Bhavani shear belts. Two types of retrogression have been noticed: (1) retrogression along shear planes, and (2) retrogression along <b>pegmatitic</b> veins. Initial <b>stages</b> of retrogression {{results in the}} formation of irregular, 2 to 3 cm to one meter wide bleached zones with the removal of greasy grey color of charnockites. Minor structures which were earlier obscured in charnockites are clearly seen in bleached areas. In intensely shear areas, formation of highly fissile grey gneiss results often with the development of flaser and mylonitic structures. Fluid inclusion studies and geochemical investigations carried out for serial samples collected from charnockite to gneiss indicate following features: (1) there is a gradual decrease in density of CO 2 -rich fluids from 1. 073 to 0. 821 g/cu cm; (2) interestingly, in many sections of the gneisses studied, there is almost complete absence of fluid inclusions suggesting that they would have decrepitated (this may be due to large pressure difference (2 to 3 Kb.) created between the interior and exterior of the fluid inclusions); and (3) presence of mixed CO 2 -H 2 O inclusions were noticed...|$|R
