5|$|For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden {{commissioned}} an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport. The aeroplane {{was converted}} into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically. It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from customers.|$|E
5|$|Geffen's press {{promotion}} for Nevermind {{was lower}} than that typical of a major record label. The label's publicist primarily targeted music publications with long lead times for publication as well as magazines in the Seattle area. The unexpectedly <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from critics who had received the album convinced the label to consider increasing the album's original print run.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E

25|$|Soil {{respiration}} and its rate across ecosystems {{is extremely}} important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays {{a large role in}} global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> with global climate change. <b>Positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be effected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.|$|R
5|$|Keechaka Vadham was {{the first}} silent film made in South India. It was shot in five weeks at Nataraja Mudaliar's studio, India Film Company. Since the cast members were from Tamil Nadu, it was viewed as the first Tamil film. Released in the late 1910s, it became a commercially {{successful}} venture and received <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from critics upon its release.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> loop.|$|E
5|$|Stefani's first {{performance}} of the track was on the UK's television show Ant & Dec on September 29, 2007. She performed the original version of the song, but ended with a reggae mix. The song was also added on the setlist of The Sweet Escape Tour. The concert segment received <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> for the overall energy of the performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate system}} {{includes}} {{a range of}} feedbacks, which alter {{the response of the}} system to changes in external forcings. <b>Positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing, while negative feedbacks reduce it.|$|R
50|$|Current melting of ice is {{predicted}} to increase the size and frequency of volcanic eruptions. In particular, lateral collapse events at stratovolcanoes are likely to increase, and there are potential <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> between the removal of ice and magmatism.|$|R
50|$|Love in a Puff had a {{very poor}} opening weekend, mainly due to the Category III rating. However, <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> on Facebook and tweets {{resulted}} in a strong rebound, generating HK$5 million cumulative box office revenues after three weeks.|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} {{if the air}} is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Melanie was {{primarily}} negative; critics expressed disapproval of {{her decision to}} support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as her inability to properly care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt drawn to her relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two NAACP Image Awards and a Teen Choice Award for the role.|$|E
5|$|The Sm3 {{had a long}} {{prototype}} phase {{before the}} main series was ordered, with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time. Negative reporting continues to haunt the series' reputation. Reliability problems cannot be proven, as no statistics of specific train types are available. The train has not managed to cope with harsh Finnish weather conditions, and the time benefit of the tilting mechanism will not {{be taken into account}} in timetables of winter 2011–2012. Nevertheless, the Sm3 has also received <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the Finnish rail network.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor is}} the {{increased}} aridity occurring with glacial maxima, which reduces the precipitation available to maintain glaciation. The glacial retreat induced by {{this or any other}} process can be amplified by similar inverse <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> as for glacial advances.|$|R

40|$|The coupled {{evolution}} of land plants, CO 2, and climate {{over the last}} half billion years has maintained atmospheric CO 2 concentrations within finite limits, indicating the involvement of a complex network of geophysiological feedbacks. But insight into this important regulatory network is extremely limited. Here we present a systems analysis of the physiological and geochemical processes involved, identifying new <b>positive</b> and negative <b>feedbacks</b> between plants and CO 2 on geological time scales. <b>Positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> accelerated falling CO 2 concentrations during the evolution and diversification of terrestrial ecosystems in the Paleozoic and enhanced rising CO 2 concentrations across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary during flood basalt eruptions. The existence of <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> reveals the unexpected destabilizing influence of the biota in climate regulation that led to environmental modifications accelerating rates of terrestrial plant and animal evolution in the Paleozoic...|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} work of Drushyam was undertaken by Suresh Balaje and George Pious. Music {{for the film}} was composed by Sharreth. The cinematography was led by S. Gopal Reddy and the editing by Marthand K. Venkatesh. Principal photography commenced on 8 March 2014 and lasted three months. It was shot primarily in Kerala, similar to the original, and also filmed at Araku, Simhachalam, Vizianagaram and Hyderabad. The post-production phase ended after one month. Drushyam released on 11 July 2014 to <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from critics. It {{went on to become}} one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of the year, collecting a worldwide distributor share of 200 million.|$|E
5|$|The series {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with particular}} praise going towards its witty and satirical humor. Its second season holds {{a score of}} 84 out of 100 on Metacritic. However, despite such <b>positive</b> <b>feedback,</b> the show's debut only drew in 5.64 million viewers and continued to have extremely low ratings. Although many expressed skepticism that it would return, it was renewed for a second season. On May 13, 2010, ABC officially canceled the series due to low viewing figures. Two episodes were unaired in the United States, but are available to view on Netflix, Amazon Video on Demand, Xbox Live Marketplace, and iTunes.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E

40|$|Relevance {{feedback}} [1] {{has been}} {{a powerful tool for}} interactive Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). During the retrieval process, the user selects the most relevant images and provides a weight of preference for each relevant image. User's high level query and perception subjectivity can be captured to some extent by dynamically updated low-level feature weights based on the user's feedback. However, in MARS [2] only the <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks,</b> i. e., relevant images are considered. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed by providing both <b>positive</b> and negative <b>feedbacks</b> for Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning. The SVM learning results are used to update the weights of preference for relevant images. Priorities are given to the <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> that have larger distances to the hyperplane determined by the support vectors. This approach releases the user from manually providing preference weight for each positive example, i. e., relevant image as before. Experimental results show [...] ...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|At Imageworks, as per Leon, he {{was asked}} to develop an {{improved}} digital film review software as an alternative to a then existing software. Leon released the initial version within two months of having been assigned the job; after receiving <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> from the artists using the software, Leon kept updating various functionalities of the software over the years. This digital 3D film review software, itView, led Leon to get an Academy Award in 2016. Leon mentions working alone on the project for many years, and that he was over time given a team when the project achieved significant growth. In a 2016 media interview, Leon says that he worked on the itView technology for eight years as the chief contributor.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge <b>positive</b> <b>feedback</b> processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E
40|$|Plant {{impacts on}} soil {{microbial}} communities and plant-microbe feedbacks {{have become the}} focus of much research. Recent advances in plant-microbe interactions investigations show that plants are able to shape their rhizosphere microbiome through diverse mechanisms. In this review, we gather findings from across multiple studies on the role of plants in altering the structure and functions of microbes in the rhizosphere. In addition, we discuss the roles of diverse phytochemicals in mediating these effects. Finally, we highlight that selective enrichment of specific microorganisms in the rhizosphere has either negative feedbacks, with pathogen accumulation in the rhizosphere; or, perhaps most importantly, <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> {{as a result of the}} recruitment of a beneficial microflora. Insights into the mechanisms that underpin plant selection of microbial communities with <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> will provide new opportunities to increase crop production. ...|$|R
40|$|Matrix {{approximation}} (MA) {{methods are}} popular in recommendation tasks on explicit feedback data. However, in many real-world applications, only <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are explicitly given whereas negative feedbacks are missing or unknown, i. e., implicit feedback data, and standard MA methods will be unstable due to incomplete <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> and inaccurate negative feedbacks. This paper proposes a stable matrix approximation method, namely StaMA, which {{can improve the}} recommendation accuracy of matrix approximation methods on implicit feedback data through dynamic weighting during model learning. We theoretically prove that StaMA can achieve sharper uniform stability bound, i. e., better generalization performance, on implicit feedback data than MA methods without weighting. Meanwhile, experimental study on real-world datasets demonstrate that StaMA can achieve better recommendation accuracy compared with five baseline MA methods in top-N recommendation task...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{makes the}} case that the {{biomedical}} workforce in the United States is characterized by <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> The paper begins by setting out background information on (1) the way in which research is structured in the biomedical sciences; (2) the reward structure among biomedical researchers; and (3) the funding enterprise for biomedical sciences. After addressing these three key components, the paper examines what these mean in terms of the market for graduate stud ents, postdocs and faculty. It then explores ways in which the positive-feedback mechanisms could be dampened. It concludes that the presence of <b>positive</b> <b>feedbacks</b> in the biomedical workforce is a result of system-wide problems. Any fix requires changing incentives. This is unlikely to occur as long as the U. S. Congress and faculty have their way. ...|$|R
