5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 <b>psychiatric</b> {{hospitals}} and 21,103 <b>psychiatric</b> beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 <b>psychiatric</b> {{hospitals and}} 33,772 <b>psychiatric</b> beds, and by 1955 there were 200 <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals and 116,000 <b>psychiatric</b> {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for <b>psychiatric</b> patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} <b>psychiatric</b> beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a <b>psychiatric</b> disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a <b>psychiatric</b> illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with <b>psychiatric</b> disorders than in persons without <b>psychiatric</b> disorders.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of <b>psychiatric</b> treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals or <b>psychiatric</b> prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E
5|$|In the 1988 and 1989, {{about two}} million people {{were removed from the}} <b>psychiatric</b> {{registry}} at the request of Western psychiatrists. It was one of their conditions for the re-admission of Soviet psychiatrists to the World <b>Psychiatric</b> Association. Yury Savenko has provided different figures in different publications: about one million, up to one and a half million, about one and a half million people removed from the <b>psychiatric</b> registry. Mikhail Buyanov provided the figure of over {{two million people}} removed from the <b>psychiatric</b> registry.|$|E

5|$|<b>Psychiatric</b> {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. <b>Psychiatric</b> symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only <b>psychiatric</b> symptoms are present.|$|E

5|$|A SS-Sonderkommando unit led by SS-Sturmbannführer Herbert Lange murdered 1,201 <b>psychiatric</b> {{patients}} at the Tiegenhof <b>psychiatric</b> hospital in the Free City of Danzig, 1,100 patients in Owińska, 2,750 {{patients at}} Kościan, and 1,558 patients at Działdowo, as well as hundreds of Poles at Fort VII, where the mobile gas van and gassing bunker were developed. In 1941–42, SS-Sonderkommando Lange set up and managed the first extermination camp, at Chełmno, where 152,000 Jews were killed using gas vans.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by <b>psychiatric</b> associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid <b>psychiatric</b> treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of <b>psychiatric</b> abuses in the past, the use of <b>psychiatric</b> doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic <b>psychiatric</b> examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E
5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive <b>psychiatric</b> assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other <b>psychiatric</b> disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or <b>psychiatric</b> nurses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Southard {{returned}} to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized. He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts <b>Psychiatric</b> Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals. The third would report on the expansion of <b>psychiatric</b> social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of <b>psychiatric</b> beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 {{population}}, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent <b>Psychiatric</b> Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent <b>Psychiatric</b> Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and <b>psychiatric</b> hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. <b>Psychiatric</b> disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe <b>psychiatric</b> disturbances. The most prevalent <b>psychiatric</b> symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. <b>Psychiatric</b> symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
