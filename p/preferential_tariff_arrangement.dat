It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential access is less generous than it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of origin. Thus lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is {{likely to lead to}} a net increase in market access for many developing countries, with gains in market access offsetting losses from preference erosion. Furthermore, comparing various tariff-cutting proposals, the research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by higher tariff cuts in agriculture.

Two reasons are complex rules of origin and erosion of preference margins {{as a result of}} multilateral trade liberalization. Our paper contributes to this research by providing evidence from high-quality disaggregated customs data of the utilization rate for Australia's preferential trading arrangements in the period 2000 - 9. A pattern of low ratios of imports receiving <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> treatment to the total value of bilateral imports applies to all six of Australia's PTAs. Over half of Australian imports from New Zealand, the Pacific Island Forum economies, Thailand and Chile claimed preferential treatment in 2000, but all had lower utilization rates by 2009. This is primarily because of the increasing number of zero MFN tariff lines. Where MFN <b>tariffs</b> are positive, <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs</b> are utilized and preferred trading partners pay lower customs duties.

This paper examines in detail the prospects and challenges for trade expansion in the two most prominent arrangements in eastern and southern Africa: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It finds that possibilities of growth in intraregional trade may be limited, but that the two arrangements offer opportunities for member countries to gain policy credibility for trade reforms and tariff liberalization and to address structural weaknesses. In this regard, the negotiation of the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union can also have a significant impact.

First, the paper examines the effect of <b>preferential</b> and external <b>tariff</b> reduction on import growth from ASEAN insiders and outsiders across HS 6 -digit industries. The analysis finds no evidence that preferential liberalization has led to lower import growth from nonmembers. Second, it examines the relationship between <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction and MFN tariff reduction. The analysis finds that preferential liberalization tends to precede external tariff liberalization. To examine whether this tariff complementarity {{is a result of}} simultaneous decision making, the authors use the scheduled future <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> reductions (agreed to in 1992) as instruments for actual <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> changes after the Asia crisis. The results remain unchanged, suggesting that there is a causal relationship between <b>preferential</b> and MFN <b>tariff</b> reduction. The findings also indicate that external liberalization was relatively sharper in the products where preferences are likely to be most damaging, proving further support for a causal effect. Overall, the results imply that the ASEAN agreement has been a force for broader liberalization.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} related to the theoretical analysis of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Nevertheless, there has been as yet very little empirical research on the topic, in particular, on the negotiating dynamics {{of these types of}} agreements. This paper attempts to make a contribution in this direction examining {{the relationship between the two}} most important market access instruments in the case of NAFTA negotiations: the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> phase-outs and the accompanying rules of origin (RoO). The traditional literature has viewed market access negotiations solely in terms of tariff (and non-tariff) negotiations. From an analytical point of view, the role of RoO, that is the rules that are designed to determine the origin of products in international trade, has usually been restricted to a "secondary" or "supportive" function. As such, RoO were seen to assist in the application or implementation of other "primary" instruments. In the case of preferential RoO, they help to determine when a particular good will be granted <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> treatment. Using a newly constructed data set this paper estimates a simultaneous equation model where the endogenous variables are the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> phase-outs between Mexico and the United States and the RoO under the NAFTA agreement. The empirical findings of this paper support the view that in accordance with recent literature, the NAFTA RoO were used as an independent commercial policy instrument with a "primary" market access function as it is the case with the traditional <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs...</b>|$|R
