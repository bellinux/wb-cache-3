5|$|The defense, {{to support}} their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing <b>purse.</b> Conley claimed in court that he saw Frank place the <b>purse</b> in his office safe, {{although}} he denied having seen the <b>purse</b> before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open {{and there was no}} <b>purse</b> in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 <b>purse</b> {{was set at}} $150,000, {{but fewer}} than 15 mushers {{finished}} the race that year, meaning the money allotted for the final two prizes were distributed {{to each of the}} 13 mushers who finished. The <b>purse</b> peaked at $200,000 in 2007, and winner Lance Mackey took home $40,000. In 2014, the <b>purse</b> was $115,000, but only 11 mushers finished the race, fewer than the number of paying positions. Rather than distribute the extra money to the finishers, the race chose to roll over the unused prize money into the 2015 race. As a result, the 2015 Yukon Quest will have a <b>purse</b> of more than $127,000.|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} the main types of bags (<b>purses)</b> found on the early Mordovian sites in Vad and Tsna River basins in 7 th – 10 th centuries.

Leather bags of variant 2 fi nd broad analogies on the Volga Bulgarian sites, while variant 1 is found on Vetluga-Vyatka sites and in Sweden (Birka).

5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the <b>purse,</b> connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the <b>purse</b> and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the <b>purse</b> is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the <b>purse</b> directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1mm wide and about 2.5mm long.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the 2007 school year, a confrontation between a school security guard and a student led to an unusual student protest that made international news. In February 2007, parents were notified of a new regional policy that prohibited students from carrying their books, school work, and belongings in backpacks between classes, as well as banning jacket wearing. The policy was intended for both student health concerns, safety concerns, and to limit the possibility to conceal weapons and other contraband. The new regulations still allowed girls to carry <b>purses</b> to hold their personal items. Some female students used larger <b>purses</b> that would accommodate their school materials as well, functioning as a book bag. [...] After the boys of the school complained on the basis of gender discrimination, the school announced the policy would be amended to ban <b>purses</b> as well. Some of the students misunderstood the announcement, belieing that the size of the <b>purses</b> was all that mattered. Rumors quickly began spreading that girls would only be allowed to carry <b>purses</b> during their menstrual periods.|$|R

5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy <b>Purse,</b> to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy <b>Purse.</b> Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E

5|$|Sarah was {{completely}} oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, {{and was therefore}} surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private.

It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened. After questioning servants and Royal Household for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present and had given Abigail a dowry of £2000 from the Privy <b>Purse.</b> This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as Keeper of the Privy <b>Purse,</b> Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.|$|E
