Po ly (methy l methacry late-co- 3 -oximino- 2 -butanone methacrylate) (P (lVI-OM) (94 : 6)), a resist that absorbs in the 220 - 250 nm range, has been sensitized for both this and the 280 - 320 nm range (an area where the new Perk in Elmer Pr inter is capable of making ex-posures). Its inherent sensit ivity can also be improved by the incorporation of methacrylonitr i le. Sensitized P(M-OM-CN) has a sensit ivity of 75 mJ /cm 2 and is capable of better than 1 ~m resolution.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, we {{reported}} the electrical and photoluminescent properties of copper(I) thiophenolate. 1 The complex, {{for which a}} linear S-bri dged polymeric structure was postulated, had an electrical resistivity of 5. 1 x 1 O 4 ohm cm at room temperature with a relati vely low thermal activation energy for conduction (Ea = 0. 11 ev). When exci ted by 3650 A ultraviolet light at room temperature, it appeared pink-red. Prel iminary spectral work indicates that the <b>photol</b> umi nescent behavior may be intrinsic and not caused by any impuri ty or photochemi cal reaction.

Table S 2 summarizes all the chemical reactions that were selected and grouped together {{to calculate the}} rates of radical fluxes. Note that peroxyacyl radicals (RCO 3) are differen-tiated from peroxy radicals (RO 2) since RCO 3 exhibit different sources (photolysis of me-thyl glyoxal and unsaturated dicarbonyl species) than RO 2 and can react with NO 2 to form peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) species. Radical initiation steps displayed in Table S 2 are characterized by photolytic reactions (<b>Photol)</b> and ozonolysis reactions of unsaturated compounds (Unsat + O 3). The latter reactions are displayed with their associated radical yields in RACM (Stockwell et al., 1997). Termination mainly occurs through radical-NOx reactions.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of valuable compounds from byproducts is at present a priority topic for social, environmental, and economic reasons. In this work we {{report for the}} first time the preparation of luminescent calcium phosphate (CaP) bioceramics from waste codfish bones. Codfish bones were treated in aqueous Eu(NO 3) 3 solu- tions of different concentrations, followed by thermal treatment at either 700 °Cor 1100 °C. The resulting materials consisted of hydroxyapatite (HAp), b-tricalcium phosphate (b-TCP) and a small amount of Eu 2 O 3. Chemical and structural charac- terization showed that the Eu ions were successfully introduced into the bones and, hence, in the thermally treated CaP phases obtained from them, although mainly in the b-TCP lattice. <b>Photol</b> uminescence investigatio n revealed that all the materials are luminescent, with samples treated at 1100 °C having more intense luminescence than those prepared at 700 °C. In vitro evaluation of cell-materials interaction indicated that all the samples displayed good cytocompatibility toward osteoblast cells. This work demonstrates that a simple and effective process, employing Eu as a dopant, can convert fish industry byproducts into highly valu- able luminescent CaP bioceramics, having potential applications in biology and medicine for bio-imaginginfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The current MCMv 2. 0 consists of around 10500 reactions and 3500 species and the web site is located at: [URL] MCM chemistry updates The degradation schemes of MCMv 1. 0 have been revised and updated in several areas. The inorganic chemistry section and generalized rate parameters have been completely reviewed. Updates incorporate data available in the open literature through 1997, including the evaluations in the IUPAC (Atkinson et al., 1997 a, 1997 b) and JPL (DeMore et al., 1997) publications. Photolysis parameter updates have been made using a newly developed UV-flux model (<b>photol)</b> with an improved representation of the effect of elevated concentrations of particles, ozone and nitrogen dioxide in the boundary layer. An important revision has been the incorporation of recently published quantum yields for ozone photolysis. Details of the model calculations are given in an earlier project report (Jenkin et al., 1997). Revised parameters are now available, which define the photolysis rate as a function of solar zenith angle for 28 reactions, for conditions appropriate to the boundary layer over NW Europe. The schemes for aromatic VOC have been completely revised since MCMv 1. 0, to take account of data available in the open literature through July 1997 (eg.

40|$|A new {{technique}} for measurement of tensile stress in thin films is described. Motivated {{by the need}} for stress de-terminat ion in thin films for IC applications, this tech-n ique employs equipment common to most IC labs. Sev-eral researchers have reported the use of suspended thin film membranes on semiconductor substrates (1, 2) for the determinat ion of mechanical properties. In this paper, the load-deflection behavior of suspended membranes under concentrated loading is {{used to determine the}} residual ten-sile stress in the film. The film used for these studies is stoi-chiometric, LPCVD silicon nitride. The load-deflection measurement is performed by making a profil ing scan over a suspended membrane with a DEKTAK profil-ometer. Structure Fabrication and Loading Sil icon nitride was deposited on both sides of a (100) sili-con substrate using an LPCVD process employing dichlo-rosilane and ammonia. Rutherford backscattering per-formed on samples of this film indicate an approximate stoichiometry of Si 3 N 3. 8. The film on the substrate's back side is <b>photol</b> ithographical ly patterned and plasma etched away. The exposed sil icon is etched {{all the way through the}} substrate using an anisotropic etchant, in this case, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. Since the etch rate of stoichiometric silicon nitride in KOH is negligible, the pattern remains well defined and the top side film acts as its own etch stop. I f a square pattern is al igned along the substrate's direction, the shape will be conserved due to the anisotropic etch, resulting in a membrane bound on all sides in a very reproducible, square geome-try. Circular membranes are preferred since they are sim-pler to analyze; however, they are more difficult to micro-fabricate due to the low selectivity of sil icon over sil icon nitr ide in sil icon isotropic etchants. By scanning a prof i lometer stylus across the middle of the suspended membrane, it is possible to generate an x-y profile. From this, the center deflection, w 0, of the mem-brane under the load can be extracted. For these experi-ments, a DEKTAK II-A profi lometer Model no. 139974 wa...|$|E
