Regarding the lighting system, it achieves the perfect balance between beautiful city ambience and preserving the darkness that makes cities more livable.

In small cities and villages, the <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> systems are almost {{at the end of their}} life time and it is necessary to make the overall reconstruction. For a long time, relatively a little attention was paid to <b>public</b> <b>lighting.</b> The situation was changed in the last few years, where thanks to the pressure to lower the energy consumption, the attention was focused also on the <b>public</b> <b>lighting.</b> Solutions of problems with energy efficiency are usually accompanied by financial instruments in the form of subsidies, grants etc. which support the change of technical equipment with low efficiency for technical equipment with high efficiency. However, in above mention steps the considerations of the overall reconstruction of <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> is missing. With reference to situation in <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> systems it would be appropriate to combine their energy performance solutions with overall reconstruction. Older lighting systems and unfortunately, also some new lighting systems, are not only energy inefficient but in many cases they also visually disturb public spaces by their location, design or proportions. In addition, they are the sources of obtrusive <b>light</b> too. <b>Public</b> spaces are important part of human settlements and the scale of life quality. The light is an instrument for creating environment with regards to many aspects (cultural, historical, functional, etc.) of urban areas. It is necessary to perceive <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> comprehensively taking into account not only the traffic safety and energy consumption but also architectural-urban aspects and aspects connected with minimizing of obtrusive light...|$|R

Installing <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> on roads that were previously unlit generally results in fewer and less serious crashes. This effect seems to be stronger for roads in rural than in urban areas. Furthermore, the effect seems to be greater on the risk of vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, (light) moped riders) than on that of drivers of motor vehicles. Increasing the luminance on roads that are already lit, has a considerably smaller effect. Decreasing the existing luminance, however, appears to lead to {{an increase in the number}} of crashes.

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureLandscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningMary C. Kingery-PageThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} and design <b>public</b> <b>light</b> art installations. The investigation consisted of evaluating select examples of <b>public</b> <b>light</b> installations in order to develop a typology, and designing two site-specific light art installations: one in Wichita, Kansas, and the other, in Denver, Colorado. Though <b>public</b> <b>light</b> art is found in most cities, its potential is often lost or unrecognized. In certain cases, <b>public</b> <b>light</b> art can be ‘plop art,’ which is plopped senselessly without much regard to context or experiential qualities. This project seeks to explore the different types of <b>public</b> <b>light</b> art and to find what approach or qualities should be considered when designing <b>public</b> <b>light</b> art. My approach can be described as artistic research. The methods include an apprenticeship to an artist, a precedent study, development of a light typology, an analysis of site and context, establishing a design matrix for two design projects, and an iterative process of making. Each of these methods were undertaken in order to effectively address my research question: What type of <b>public</b> <b>light</b> art is most appropriate for a specific site and how does it relate to creative placemaking? This project overlaps with a collective project group entitled Creative Place-Making, which is comprised of other fifth-year master of landscape architecture students with an underlying interest in art and design as place-making tools. Each student in the group addressed the site in Wichita, Kansas in a unique way. I addressed this site as a temporary landscape, creating an interactive light installation intended to be in place up to five years. In contrast, I addressed the Denver, Colorado site as a long term landscape, and designed a sculptural illuminating gateway. Each of these light art installations were informed by a particular set of characteristics that make each design site-specific...|$|R

Current {{activities in the}} field of <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> research and standardization are focused on establishment of energy efficiency numerical indicator based on installed power, target photometric parameters and operation time. Up to now, indicative annual operation times for <b>public</b> <b>lighting</b> systems are used for calculations. <b>Public</b> <b>lighting</b> control itself is based on photosensing and/or various clock switching, both without any relevance to real needs.
