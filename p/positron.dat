5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a <b>positron</b> and a neutrino. The electron or <b>positron</b> emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than <b>positron</b> emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a <b>positron</b> emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

40|$|Topic: An INTEGRAL View of Compact ObjectsBeacom and Yüksel (2006) {{suggested}} an elegant method to estimate an initial energy of annihilating <b>positrons</b> from {{the ratio of}} 511 keV line and in-flight annihilation fluxes. The idea {{was that in the}} case of stationary injection of <b>positrons</b> at high energies the fluxes of 511 keV line emission (generated by thermalized <b>positrons)</b> and of in-flight annihilation (produced by fast <b>positrons)</b> were proportional to each other. For the delta-function injection spectrum they showed that the initial energy of annihilating <b>positrons</b> cannot exceed 3 MeV. Otherwise the expected in-flight annihilation flux of fast <b>positrons</b> in the range 1 to 10 MeV is higher than observed by COMPTEL. However, the conclusion may be changed significantly if one analyzes the spatial distribution of the 511 keV emission and 1 - 10 MeV emission. In addition if the magnetic field in Galactic center region is 1 mG or higher the injection energy of <b>positrons</b> produced by central compact source can be unrestricted. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

This study represents a new direction in developing accelerator-based high-intensity slow-positron sources. We investigate the use of RF fields to decelerate the <b>positrons</b> out of the target. Techniques, such as a Penning trap or moderation can then be used to get the needed thermal <b>positrons</b> with higher yield.

Our calculated ISM flux agrees very well with that calculated with the elaborate GALPROP code. It confirms that secondary production of <b>positrons</b> in the ISM by the primary cosmic rays cannot explain the observed sub-TeV flux of CR <b>positrons.</b> Moreover, we show that once energy loss of <b>positrons</b> in source and in the ISM are included, secondary production inside the CR sources plus the ISM does explain the measured near-Earth flux of cosmic ray <b>positrons.</b> Comment: Comment. 1 page, 1 figure, additional references and detail...|$|R
50|$|When <b>positrons</b> are {{injected}} into a solid body, they interact in some manner with the electrons in that species. For solids containing free electrons (such as metals or semiconductors), the implanted <b>positrons</b> annihilate rapidly unless voids such as vacancy defects are present. If voids are available, <b>positrons</b> will reside {{in them and}} annihilate less rapidly than in {{the bulk of the}} material, on time scales up to ~1 ns. For insulators such as polymers or zeolites, implanted <b>positrons</b> interact with electrons in the material to form positronium.|$|R

The phase space dynamics of a runaway position is investigated using a Lagrangian that incorporates the tokamak geometry, loop voltage, radiation and collisional effects.

40|$|The Galaxy hosts a {{widespread}} population of low-energy <b>positrons</b> revealed by successive generations of gamma-ray telescopes through a bright annihilation emission from the bulge region, with a fainter contribution {{from the inner}} disk. The exact origin of these particles remains currently unknown. We estimate the contribution to the annihilation signal of <b>positrons</b> generated in the decay of radioactive 26 Al, 56 Ni and 44 Ti. We adapted the GALPROP propagation code to simulate the transport and annihilation of radioactivity <b>positrons</b> in a model of our Galaxy. Using plausible source spatial distributions, we explored several possible propagation scenarios {{to account for the}} large uncertainties on the transport of ~ 1 MeV <b>positrons</b> in the interstellar medium. We then compared the predicted intensity distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI observations. We obtain similar intensity distributions with small bulge-to-disk ratios, even for extreme large-scale transport prescriptions. At least half of the <b>positrons</b> annihilate close to their sources, even when they are allowed to travel far away. In the high-diffusion, ballistic case, up to 40 % of them escape the Galaxy. In proportion, this affects bulge <b>positrons</b> more than disk <b>positrons</b> because they are injected further off the plane in a tenuous medium, while disk <b>positrons</b> are mostly injected in the dense molecular ring. The predicted intensity distributions are fully consistent with the observed longitudinally-extended disk-like emission, but the transport scenario cannot be strongly constrained by the current data. Nucleosynthesis <b>positrons</b> alone cannot account for the observed annihilation emission in the frame of our model. An additional component is needed to explain the strong bulge contribution, and the latter is very likely concentrated in the central regions if <b>positrons</b> have initial energies in the 100 keV- 1 MeV range.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the <b>positron,</b> after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued {{that they would have to}} have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the <b>positron,</b> for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ion {{desorption}} {{induced by}} <b>positrons</b> is observed {{for the first}} time from molecules adsorbed on a metal surface with identification of ion species. <b>Positrons</b> with an energy of 2 keV cause ion desorption from ethanethiol/Au and pentanethiol/Au. Absence of ion desorption by electrons with the same energy suggests that ion desorption is due to annihilation of bonding electrons with <b>positrons.</b> Only molecular ions are observed without fragmentation...|$|R

Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of cosmic rays, which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{propagation of}} electrostatic solitary waves is studied in a collisionless electron-positron pair plasma consisting of adiabatic cool electrons, mobile cool <b>positrons</b> (or electron holes), hot suprathermal electrons {{described by a}} κ distribution, and stationary ions. The linear dispersion relation derived for electrostatic waves demonstrates a weak dependence of the phase speed on physical conditions of <b>positrons</b> in appropriate ranges of parameters. The Sagdeev's pseudopotential approach is used to obtain the existence of electrostatic solitary wave structures, focusing on how their characteristics depend on the physical conditions of <b>positrons</b> and suprathermal electrons. Both negative and positive polarity electrostatic solitary waves are found to exist in different ranges of Mach numbers. As the <b>positrons</b> constitute {{a small fraction of}} the total number density, they slightly affect the existence domains. However, the <b>positrons</b> can significantly change the wave potential at a fixed soliton speed. The results indicate that the positive potential can greatly be grown by increasing the electron suprathermality (lower κ) at a fixed true Mach number. It is found that a fraction of <b>positrons</b> maintain the generation of positive polarity electrostatic solitary waves in the presence of suprathermal electrons in pair plasmas.
