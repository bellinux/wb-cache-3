25|$|Target.com {{owns and}} oversees the company's {{e-commerce}} initiatives, {{such as the}} Target.com domain. Founded in early 2000 as target.direct, it was formed by separating the company's existing e-commerce operations from its retailing division and combining it with its Rivertown Trading direct marketing unit into a stand-alone subsidiary. In 2002, target.direct and Amazon.com's subsidiary Amazon Enterprise Solutions created a partnership in which Amazon.com would provide order fulfillment and guest services for Target.com in exchange for fixed and variable fees. After the company sold Marshall Field's and Mervyn's in 2004, target.direct became Target.com. The domain target.com attracted at least 288 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com survey. In August 2009, Target announced that they would build and manage a new Target.com <b>platform,</b> <b>independent</b> of Amazon.com. This new platform was to launch in 2011, {{in advance of the}} holiday season. Prior to the announcement, Target and Amazon had extended their partnership until 2011. In January 2010, Target announced their vendor partners for the re-platforming project. These partners include Sapient, IBM, Oracle, Endeca, Autonomy, Sterling Commerce and Huge, among others. The re-platformed Target.com officially launched on August 23, 2011, effectively ending the partnership with Amazon.com.|$|E

[...] Initially published in 1987 at USENIX, the BRL-CAD ray-tracer is the first known {{implementation of}} a parallel network distributed ray-tracing system that achieved several frames per second in rendering performance. [...] This performance was attained {{by means of the}} highly optimized yet <b>platform</b> <b>independent</b> LIBRT ray-tracing engine in BRL-CAD and by using solid implicit CSG geometry on several shared memory parallel machines over a commodity network. [...] BRL-CAD's ray-tracer, including REMRT/RT tools, continue to be available and developed today as Open source software.|$|E
