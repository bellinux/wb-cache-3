40|$|Background and {{objective}} <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> is extensively used in anti-tumor treatment. The aims {{of this study}} were to investigate whether <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> enhances cisplatinum efficiency while reducing its side effects and to identify its effective mechanisms. Methods (1) Human macrophage U 937 cells were treated with <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> and/or cisplatinum. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) of each group were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); (2) Xenograft mouse models of human lung cancer were treated with <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> and/or cisplatinum once every five days for three times. Tumor volumes were measured during treatment; (3) The percentages of macrophages in the peripheral blood of the xenograft mouse models were measured by FACS. Results (1) Compared with other groups, the level of TNF-α was significantly higher in the human macrophage U 937 cells that were treated with <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> combined with cisplatinum. The levels of IFN-γ were significantly higher in human macrophage U 937 cells that were treated with <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> alone or <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> combined with cisplatinum; (2) In the xenograft mouse models, <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> combined with cisplatinum treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth without weight loss compared with the other groups; (3) The percentages of macrophages in the peripheral blood were significantly higher in the xenograft mouse models that were treated with <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> combined with cisplatinum compared with in the other groups. Conclusion <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> promotes macrophage proliferation and increases tumor cell killing factors (TNF-α, IFN-γ) in vitro.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} modification of high-density lipoprotein subclass 3 (HDL(3)) by HOCl transformed an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein into a high-uptake form for macrophages and caused a significant impairment of cholesterol efflux capacity [Panzenboeck, Raitmayer, Reicher, Lindner, Glatter, Malle and Sattler (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 29711 - 29720]. To elucidate the consequences of treatment with OCl(-) on distinct regions in apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), lipid-free and lipid-associated apo A-I were modified with increasing molar ratios of NaOCl or HOCl generated by the myeloperoxidase/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system. CD analysis revealed a pronounced decrease in alpha-helicity for lipid-free apo A-I modified by NaOCl, whereas lipid-associated apo A-I was less affected. The modification of apo A-I by NaOCl (molar oxidant-to-lipoprotein ratio 6 : 1) resulted {{in the formation of}} two distinct oxidized forms of apo A-I with molecular masses 32 or 48 atomic mass units (a. m. u.) higher than that of native apo A-I, indicating the addition of two or three oxygen atoms to the native protein. HPLC analysis of tryptic digests obtained from lipid-free and lipid-associated apo A-I modified with increasing oxidant-to-apolipoprotein molar ratios revealed a concentration-dependent modification of apo A-I: at a low molar oxidant-to-lipoprotein ratio (5 : 1) the peaks corresponding to the methionine-containing tryptic <b>peptides</b> <b>T</b> 11 (residues 84 - 88), T 16 (residues 108 - 116) and T 22 (residues 141 - 149), located in the central region of apo A-I, disappeared. Their loss was accompanied by the formation of three oxidation products with a molecular mass 16 a. m. u. higher than that of the native peptides. This indicates the addition of oxygen, most probably caused by the oxidation of Met(86), Met(112) and Met(148) to the corresponding methionine sulphoxides. At a molar NaOCl-to-apo A-I ratio of 10 : 1 the disappearance of <b>peptides</b> <b>T</b> 1 (residues 1 - 10), T 7 (residues 46 - 59) and T 9 (residues 62 - 77) was accompanied by the occurrence of new peaks 33. 5 and 33. 1 a. m. u. higher than those of the native peptides. Amino acid analyses of <b>peptides</b> <b>T</b> 7 and T 9 after modification with NaOCl confirmed that Phe(57) and Phe(71) were primary targets for oxidation by HOCl. GLC-MS analysis of hydrolysates obtained from OCl(-) -modified T 7, T 9, apo A-I and HDL(3) confirmed that Phe residues are an early target for OCl(-) modification. At molar NaOCl-to-apo A-I ratios of 25 : 1, the peak areas of <b>peptides</b> <b>T</b> 31 (residues 189 - 195) and T 32 (residues 196 - 206) decreased markedly.

5000|$|Pert was {{an internationally}} {{recognized}} pharmacologist who published over 250 scientific articles on peptides and their receptors {{and the role}} of these neuropeptides in the immune system. Her earliest work as a researcher involved the discovery of opiate receptors and the actions of receptors.

Pert also lectured worldwide on these and other subjects, including her theories on emotions and mind-body communication. Her popular book, Molecules of Emotion: Why You Feel the Way You Feel, (Scribner, 1997) expounded on her research and theories. She was featured in Washingtonian magazine (December 2001) as one of Washington's fifty [...] "Best and Brightest" [...] individuals.She held a number of patents for modified peptides in the treatment of psoriasis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, stroke and head trauma.

40|$|Improving T cell Ags by {{altering}} MHC anchor residues {{is a common}} strategy used to enhance peptide vaccines, {{but there has been}} little assessment of how such modifications affect TCR binding and T cell recognition. In this study, we use surface plasmon resonance and peptide–MHC tetramer binding at the cell surface to demonstrate that changes in primary peptide anchor residues can substantially and unpredictably alter TCR binding. We also demonstrate that the ability of TCRs to differentiate between natural and anchor-modified heteroclitic <b>peptides</b> distinguishes <b>T</b> cells that exhibit a strong preference for either type of Ag. Furthermore, we show that anchor-modified heteroclitic <b>peptides</b> prime <b>T</b> cells with different TCRs compared with those primed with natural Ag.

40|$|The C-terminal 40 -residue <b>t</b> <b>peptide</b> of {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) {{forms an}} amphiphilic alpha helix with {{a cluster of}} seven aromatic residues. It allows oligomerization and induces a partial degradation of AChE subunits through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. We show that the <b>t</b> <b>peptide</b> induces the misfolding of a fraction of AChE subunits, even when mutations disorganized the cluster of aromatic residues or when these residues were replaced by leucines, indicating that this effect is due to hydrophobic residues. Mutations in the aromatic-rich region affected the cellular fate of AChE in a similar manner, with or without mutations that prevented dimerization. Degradation was decreased and secretion was increased when aromatic residues were replaced by leucines, and the opposite occurred when the amphiphilic alpha helix was disorganized. The last two residues (Asp-Leu) somewhat resembled an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and caused a partial retention but only in mutants possessing aromatic residues in their <b>t</b> <b>peptide.</b> Our results suggested that several "signals" in the catalytic domain and in the <b>t</b> <b>peptide</b> act cooperatively for AChE quality control...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{domain of}} acetylcholinesterase AChET subunits {{is followed by}} a C-terminal <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> which mediates their association with the proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) of anchoring proteins.

The <b>T</b> <b>peptide</b> forms an amphiphilic α-helix, containing a series of conserved aromatic residues. Replacement of two, four or five aromatic residues gradually suppressed degradation and increased secretion. Co-expression with a PRAD- containing protein induced the assembly of PRAD-linked tetramers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and allowed partial secretion of a dimerization- defective mutant; by masking the aromatic side chains, hetero-oligomerization rescued this enzyme from degradation. Degradation was due to ERAD, since it was not blocked by brefeldin A but was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors.
