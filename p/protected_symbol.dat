25|$|For over 50 years, Israel {{requested}} {{the addition of}} a red Star of David, arguing that since Christian and Muslim emblems were recognized, the corresponding Jewish emblem should be as well.

One should notice that all the Poveiro belongings were marked with his personal mark, except for the boat.

50|$|In either case, persons {{protected}} by the Red Cross/Crescent/Star or white flag are expected to maintain neutrality, and may not engage in warlike acts.

One of the few exceptions is in North America, where despite the passing of the First Geneva convention in 1864, and its ratification in the United States in 1881, Johnson & Johnson has used the red cross as a mark on its products since 1887 and registered the symbol as a U.S. trademark for medicinal and surgical plasters in 1905.|$|E

5|$|Siglas Poveiras are {{a form of}} proto-writing system, with a {{restricted}} number of symbols that were combined to form more complex symbols; these were used as a rudimentary visual communication system, and as a signature to mark belongings. Merchants wrote them in their books of credit; fishermen used it in religious rituals by marking them {{in the door of}} Catholic chapels near hills or beaches; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone; and also had magical significance, such as the São Selimão sigla, that {{could be used as a}} <b>protecting</b> <b>symbol</b> and not as family mark. Children used the same family mark with piques as a form of cadency. The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father's symbol. The siglas are still used, though much less commonly, by some families; and are related with Viking traditions.|$|R

In Tetovo, Albanians who celebrated were fined 200 Euros for being too loud by the local authorities.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{physical}} effects that limit {{the reliability and}} performance of Multilevel Flash memories induce errors that have low magnitude and are dominantly asymmetric. This paper studies block codes for asymmetric limited-magnitude errors over q-ary channels. We propose code constructions for such channels {{when the number of}} errors is bounded by t. The construction uses known codes for symmetric errors over small alphabets to <b>protect</b> large-alphabet <b>symbols</b> from asymmetric limited-magnitude errors. The encoding and decoding of these codes are performed over the small alphabet whose size depends only on the maximum error magnitude and is independent of the alphabet size of the outer code. An extension of the construction is proposed to include systematic codes as a benefit to practical implementation. I...|$|R

2500|$|The Flag Desecration Amendment (often {{referred}} to as the Flag-burning Amendment) is an American proposed law, in the form of constitutional amendment to the Bill of Rights, that would allow the U.S. Congress to prohibit by statute and provide punishment for the physical [...] "desecration" [...] of the flag of the United States.

40|$|Since the 2011 uprising, Tunisia's Islamist {{movement}} Ennahdha {{has proposed}} a political project based on reclaiming the nation's Arab-Islamic identity. At {{the heart of this}} is the issue of ‘protection of the sacred’, which seeks to define limits to freedom of expression to <b>protect</b> religious <b>symbols</b> from criticism. This is part of Ennahdha's post-Islamist evolution. The movement has drawn away from its earlier ambitions to Islamise the state and now seeks to reconstruct the role of Islam by asserting a cultural Islamic identity, which recasts religious norms as conservative values and which has yet to determine the precise limits of new individual freedoms. The result was to propose a new set of rules for the community under which Tunisians would freely express their religious belief in a way denied them under the former regime, but would also live under a state that defended and guaranteed their religious values...|$|R
5000|$|Shchipkov {{looks at}} social {{conservatism}} {{as both a}} piece of Russian history and a challenge in contemporary history. The change of the political situation in 2014 and the massive information and economic pressure on Russia has been an influence on the themes of Shchipkov’s books. Shchipkov believes the challenge of protecting Russian Orthodoxy {{as a component of}} Russian identity should be a wider human rights project to combat Russophobia in Russia, which has led to the launch of World Russian People's Council, headed by Patriarch Kirill. Among other things, Shchipkov speaks of the need to strengthen national identity, <b>protect</b> national <b>symbols</b> and counteract against Russian genocide in Ukraine, which he believes is reminiscent of the ethnic war that was fought against the Russian people in 1941-45. Shchipkov has covered these themes in his book [...] "National History as a Social Contract from Economic Hegemony to the Consensus Tradition".|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1973, {{ambulances}} in the United States {{and elsewhere}} in the Western Hemisphere were typically marked with a safety orange cross, differing from the red cross only in its hue. Toys and paintings of ambulances commonly ignored even that nuance, instead using a red cross. After protests from the American Red Cross that the safety orange cross was insufficiently distinguishable from the <b>protected</b> Red Cross <b>symbol,</b> the U.S. Department of Transportation developed the Blue Star of Life as a replacement for the safety orange cross. The blue Star of Life has since been adopted throughout much of the world on ambulances and in other related applications.|$|R
