5|$|Cure {{rates in}} {{clinical}} trials have ranged from 20–45%; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies. The overall cure rate for all people with AML (including the elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy) is likely lower.

5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline.

APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} of RAS and p 53 mutations {{was investigated in}} 30 acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. Only two cases bore N-RAS codon 12 mutations and none had p 53 mutations responsible for aminoacid substitutions. It would, therefore, seem that neither RAS nor p 53 are involved in acute promyelocytic leukemogenesis...|$|R
50|$|Loss of {{function}} mutations of the PML protein, particularly {{resulting from the}} fusion of the PML gene with RARα gene in Acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> is implicated in several tumor suppressing apoptotic pathways, particularly those that rely on p53 as noted above. Thus, the loss of PML function confers a cellular survival and proliferation advantage, impedes cellular senescence through loss of SAHFs, and puts a block on cellular differentiation.|$|R
40|$|Although acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APLs) are {{consistently}} {{associated with a}} reciprocal chromosome 15; 17 translocation, the gene(s) directly affected by the breakpoints have never been isolated. The chromosome 17 breakpoint maps to near the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus. Investigation of 20 APLs and a large series of other neoplastic patients and normal controls revealed RAR alpha gene rearrangements and aberrant transcripts only in the APL cases. These {{findings suggest that the}} RAR alpha gene is involved in the APL chromosome 17 breakpoint, is implicated in leukemogenesis, and {{could be used as a}} marker for identifying leukemic promyelocytes...|$|R
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{myelogenous leukemia}} (AML) occurs more {{commonly}} in adults than in children, and more commonly in men than women. It is treated with chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate is 40%, except for APL (Acute <b>Promyelocytic</b> <b>Leukemia),</b> {{which has a}} survival rate greater than 90%. Subtypes of AML include acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> acute myeloblastic leukemia, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.|$|E

40|$|CD 79 alpha is a subunit of an intracytoplasmic protein {{reported}} to be specific for B lymphocytes, including immature B lineage cells. To evaluate expression of the CD 79 alpha antigen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we studied forty-eight cases of AML by paraffin section immunohistochemistry. The cases included four MO, nine M 1, nine M 2, ten M 3, ten M 4, and six M 5 AMLs using criteria of the French-American-British cooperative group. Eleven cases demonstrated cytoplasmic staining for the CD 79 alpha antigen, including one M 1, nine M 3, and one M 5 AML. These CD 79 alpha-positive cases represented 5 % of all non-promyelocytic AMLs and 90 % of all acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> studied. All acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> had the characteristic t(15; 17) (q 24;q 21), including two cases of the microgranular variant (M 3 v). No other B-lineage-associated antigens {{were found in the}} CD 79 alpha-positive cases, {{with the exception of a}} subpopulation of CD 19 -positive leukemic cells in one patient. The two non-promyelocytic leukemias that expressed CD 79 alpha had no evidence of t(15; 17) and did not express any additional B-lineage-associated antigens that might suggest a mixed lineage proliferation. This study demonstrates that CD 79 alpha expression in acute leukemia is not restricted to B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias and that CD 79 alpha expression is frequently associated with t(15; 17) acute myeloid leukemia...|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APLs) are {{characterized}} by a translocation that involves chromosomes 15 and 17. The translocation breakpoints have recently been identified and shown to involve the RAR-alpha gene on 17 and myl on 15. Here we report Southern blotting analysis of 26 APLs, including cases with normal karyotypes and atypical morphology, which showed RAR-alpha rearrangements in 92 % cases, myl rearrangements in 73 %, and either RAR-alpha or myl rearrangements in 100 %. Despite a negative clinical and morphologic picture, DNA rearrangement analysis showed that neoplastic promyelocytes persisted in the bone marrow of two patients sampled after induction chemotherapy. Therefore, the RAR-alpha and myl rearrangements provide molecular markers for accurately diagnosing APLs and monitoring {{the course of the}} disease during and after chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Mutations of p 53 {{are remarkably}} rare in acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APLs). Here, we {{demonstrate}} that the APL-associated fusion proteins PML–RAR and PLZF-RAR directly inhibit p 53, allowing leukemic blasts to evade p 53 -dependent cancer surveillance pathways. PML–RAR causes deacetylation and degradation of p 53, resulting in repression of p 53 transcriptional activity, and protection from p 53 -dependent responses to genotoxic stress. These phenomena are dependent on the expression of wild-type PML, acting as a bridge between p 53 and PML–RAR. Recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) to p 53 and inhibition of p 53 activity were abrogated by conditions that either inactivate HDACs or trigger HDAC release from the fusion protein, implicating recruitment of HDAC by PML–RAR as the mechanism underlying p 53 inhibition...|$|R

25|$|Tretinoin, {{under the}} {{alternative}} name of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), {{is used as}} chemotherapy for acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia. This is because cells of this subtype of leukemia are sensitive to agonists of the retinoic acid receptors (RARs).|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the STAT family of {{transcription}} factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein mediates the signal transduction triggered by various cell ligands, such as IL2, IL4, CSF1, and different growth hormones. It has been shown to be involved in diverse biological processes, such as TCR signaling, apoptosis, adult mammary gland development, and sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression. This gene was found to fuse to retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene in a small subset of acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APML). The dysregulation of the signaling pathways mediated by this protein may be the cause of the APML.|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APLs) are {{characterized}} by a reciprocal balanced translocation that involves chromosomes 15 and 17 [t(15; 17) ]. We report the isolation and characterization {{of one of the}} two reciprocal break sites and demonstrate that the chromosome 17 breakpoint lies within the retinoic acid receptor alpha locus. Nucleotide sequencing of the 15; 17 cross-over junction on 15 q+ showed that the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene is truncated within its first intron, 370 base pairs upstream from the splicing donor site of exon II. Such a recombination would be expected to generate abnormal RAR alpha mRNA and protein. Southern blot analysis of a number of APLs with chromosome 15 - and 17 -derived DNA probes revealed similar 15; 17 recombinations in the majority of other APLs. Our data are strong evidence that the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene plays {{a crucial role in the}} leukemogenesis of APL...|$|R
40|$|Organic arsenicals {{were the}} first {{antimicrobial}} agents specifically synthesized {{for the treatment of}} infectious diseases such as syphilis and sleeping sickness. For the treatment of diseases caused by trypanosomatid parasites, organic derivatives of arsenic and the related metalloid antimony are still the drugs of choice. Arsenic trioxide, As 203, has been used {{for a long time in}} traditional Chinese medicines for treatment of various diseases, and it has recently been shown to be clinically active in acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> Resistance to metalloid salts is found in bacteria, fungi, parasites and animals. In some organisms, resistance involves overproduction of intracellular thiols. In many cases, resistance to arsenic salts is the result of removal of the metalloid from the cytosol usually by extrusion from the cell. In eukaryotes resistance to arsenic and antimony is conferred by membrane transport proteins of the MRP family. The human MRP 1, a member of this family, is frequently amplified in cancer cells and it is well-documented that MRPl-overexpressing cells poorly accumulate arsenic and antimony because of enhanced cellular effiux which depends on the presence of GSH...|$|R
25|$|A {{second group}} of non-supplemented {{patients}} with high cobalamin levels have them due to enhanced production of the plasma B12 transporters haptocorrin and transcobalamin II. This happens in hematologic disorders like chronic myelogeneous leukemia, <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> polycythemia vera and also the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Increased cobalamin levels {{are one of the}} diagnostic criteria for the latter two diseases.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 1970s Chinese {{researcher}} Zhang TingDong {{and colleagues}} investigated the potential {{use of the}} traditionally used substance arsenic trioxide to treat acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (APL).

25|$|The {{release of}} {{endotoxin}} is the {{mechanism by which}} Gram-negative sepsis provokes DIC. In acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> treatment causes the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which prevents fibrinolysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide {{has brought about}} tremendous advancement {{in the treatment of}} acute <b>promyelocytic</b> myelogenous <b>leukemia</b> (APML).

Although acute pancreatitis is not commonly associated with arsenic toxicity, it should be considered as a possible side effect. We report a case of arsenic-induced pancreatitis in a patient with APML...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{receptor}} corepressor (CoR) -histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex recruitment {{is indispensable}} for the biological {{activities of the}} retinoic acid receptor fusion proteins of acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> We report here that ETO (eight-twenty-one or MTG 8), which is fused to the acute myelogenous leukemia 1 (AML 1) transcription factor in t(8; 21) AML, interacts via its zinc finger region with a conserved domain of the corepressors N-CoR and SMRT and recruits HDAC in vivo. The fusion protein AML 1 -ETO retains the ability of ETO to form stable complexes with N-CoR/SMRT and HDAC. Deletion of the ETO C terminus abolishes CoR binding and HDAC recruitment and severely impairs the ability of AML 1 -ETO to inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic precursors. These data indicate that formation of a stable complex with CoR–HDAC {{is crucial to the}} activation of the leukemogenic potential of AML 1 by ETO and suggest that aberrant recruitment of corepressor complexes is a general mechanism of leukemogenesis. Chromatin modifications by histone acetylases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs) represent a fundamental mech-anism of transcriptional regulation (reviewed in references 13, 16, 19, 26, 56, and 59). It has been proposed that histone acetylation weakens interactions of histones with DNA an...|$|R
40|$|PML-RAR is an oncogenic {{transcription}} factor forming in acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APL) {{because of a}} chromosomal translocation. Without its ligand, retinoic acid (RA), PML-RAR functions as a constitutive transcriptional repressor, abnormally associating with the corepressor-histone deacetylase complex and blocking hematopoietic differentiation. In the presence of pharmacological concentrations of RA, PML-RAR activates transcription and stimulates differentiation. Even though {{it has been suggested}} that chromatin alteration is important for APL onset, the PML-RAR effect on chromatin of target promoters has not been investigated. Taking advantage of the Xenopus oocyte system, we compared the wild-type {{transcription factor}} RARα with PML-RAR as both transcriptional regulators and chromatin structure modifiers. Without RA, we found that PML-RAR is a more potent transcriptional repressor that does not require the cofactor RXR and produces a closed chromatin configuration. Surprisingly, repression by PML-RAR occurs through a further pathway that is independent of nucleosome deposition and histone deacetylation. In the presence of RA, PML-RAR is a less efficient transcriptional activator that is unable to modify the DNA nucleoprotein structure. We propose that PML-RAR, aside from its ability to recruit aberrant quantities of histone deacetylase complexes, has acquired additional repressive mechanisms and lost important activating functions; the comprehension of these mechanisms might reveal novel targets for antileukemic intervention...|$|R
25|$|ICP0 is {{responsible}} for overcoming a variety of cellular antiviral responses. After translocating to the nucleus early in infection, ICP0 promotes degradation of many cellular antiviral genes, including those for nuclear body-associated proteins <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> protein (PML) and Sp100, causing disruption of PML nuclear bodies and reduced cellular antiviral capacity. ICP0 also inhibits the activity of IFN regulatory factors (IRF3) and IRF7, which are key transcription factors that induce production of antiviral cytokines called interferons.|$|E
500|$|Specific {{cytogenetic}} abnormalities can {{be found}} in many people with AML; the types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance. The chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins, usually transcription factors whose altered properties may cause the [...] "differentiation arrest". For example, in acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> the t(15;17) translocation produces a PML-RARα fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor element in the promoters of several myeloid-specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.|$|E
500|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} prognostic factor in AML is cytogenetics, or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes (for example, the (15;17) translocation in acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemia).</b> About half of people with AML have [...] "normal" [...] cytogenetics; they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and {{a high risk of}} relapse after treatment.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDEK is {{important}} in regulating cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and maintenance of stem cell phenotype. The translocation t(6; 9) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), which fuses DEK with NUP 214, confers a poor prognosis and {{a higher risk of}} relapse. The over-expression of DEK in AML has been reported, but different studies have shown diminished levels in pediatric and <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> This study has characterized DEK expression, in silico, using a large multi-center cohort of leukemic and normal control cases. Overall, DEK was under-expressed in AML compared to normal bone marrow (NBM). Studying specific subtypes of AML confirmed either no significant change or a significant reduction in DEK expression compared to NBM. Importantly, the similarity of DEK expression between AML and NBM was confirmed using immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue mircorarrays. In addition, stratification of AML patients based on median DEK expression levels indicated that DEK showed no effect on the overall survival of patients. DEK expression during normal hematopoiesis did reveal a relationship with specific cell types implicating a distinct function during myeloid differentiation. Whilst DEK may play a potential role in hematopoiesis, it remains to be established whether it {{is important}} for leukemagenesis, except when involved in the t(6; 9) translocation...|$|R
40|$|Fusion {{proteins}} {{involving the}} retinoic acid receptor � (RAR�) and the PML or PLZF nuclear protein are the genetic markers of acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APLs). APLs with the PML-RAR � or the PLZF-RAR� fusion protein are phenotypically indistinguishable {{except that they}} differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid (RA) -induced differentiation: PML-RAR � blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment, while patients with PLZF-RAR � do not. We here report that (i) like PML-RAR � expression, PLZF-RAR � expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines (U 937 and HL- 60) in response to different stimuli (vitamin D 3, transforming growth factor � 1, and dimethyl sulfoxide); (ii) PML-RAR�, but not PLZF-RAR�, increases RA sensitivity of hematopoietic precursor cells and restores RA sensitivity of RA-resistant hematopoietic cells; (iii) PML-RAR � and PLZF-RAR � have similar RA binding affinities; and (iv) PML-RAR � enhances the RA response of RA target genes (those for RAR�, RAR�, and transglutaminase type II [TGase]) in vivo, while PLZF-RAR � expression has either no effect (RAR�) oran inhibitory activity (RAR � and type II TGase).

40|$|Mammalian homologues of Drosophila Seven in Absentia (SIAHs) {{target for}} proteasome-mediated {{degradation}} several factors involved in cell growth and tumorigenesis. Here {{we show that}} SIAH- 1 / 2 binds and targets for proteasome-mediated degradation the putative tumor suppressor and tripartite motif (TRIM) family member PML, leading {{to the loss of}} its transcriptional co-activating properties and a {{reduction in the number of}} endogenous PML nuclear bodies. Association with PML requires the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of SIAH- 1 / 2 through an interacting surface apparently distinct from those predicted by the structural studies, or shown experimentally to mediate binding to SIAH-associated factors. Within PML, the coiled-coil domain is required for Siah- and proteasome-mediated degradation, and deletions of regions critical for the integrity of this region impair the ability of Siah to trigger PML-RAR degradation. Fusion of the coiled-coil domain to heterologous proteins resulted in the capacity of mSiah- 2 to target their degradation. All of the TRIM proteins tested were degraded upon mSiah- 2 overexpression. Finally, we show that the fusion protein PML-RAR (that retains the coiled-coil domain), which causes acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> is also a potential substrate of mSiah- 2. As a result of mSiah- 2 overexpression and subsequent degradation of the fusion protein, the arrest in hematopoietic differentiation because of expression of PML-RAR is partially rescued. These results identify PML and other TRIMs as new factors post-translationally regulated by SIAH and involve the coiled-coil region of PML and of other SIAH substrates as a novel structural determinant for targeted degradation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The PML gene is {{fused to}} the RAR gene {{in the vast}} {{majority}} of acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APL) and has been implicated in the control of key tumor-suppressive pathways. However, its role in the pathogenesis of human cancers other than APL is still unclear. We therefore as-sessed the status and expression of the PML gene in solid tumors of multiple histologic origins. Methods: We created tumor tissue microarrays (TTMs) with samples from pa-tients with colon adenocarcinoma (n 109), lung carcinoma (n 19), prostate adenocarcinoma (n 36), breast carci-noma (n 38), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (n 51), germ cell tumors (n 60), thyroid carcinoma (n 32), adrenal cortical carcinoma (n 12), and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n 251) and from normal tissue corresponding to each histotype and analyzed PML protein and mRNA expression by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridiza-tion, respectively. Tumor cell lines (n 64) of various his-tologic origins were analyzed for PML protein and mRNA expression by immunofluorescence and northern blotting, respectively. DNA from microdissected tumor samples and cell lines was analyzed for PML mutations and loss of het-erozygosity (LOH). For some tumor types, the association between PML expression and tumor stage and grade was analyzed. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: All nor-mal tissues expressed PML protein. PML protein expression was reduced or abolished in prostate adenocarcinomas (63 % [95 % confidence interval {CI} 48 % to 78 %] and 28 % [95 % CI 13 % to 43 %], respectively), colon adenocarci-nomas (31 % [95 % CI 22 % to 40 %] and 17 % [95 % CI 10 % to 24 %]), breast carcinomas (21 % [95 % CI 8 % to 34 %] and 31 % [95 % CI 16 % to 46 %]), lung carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the expression of the}} M-CSF receptor (c-fms) in 16 freshly isolated acute <b>promyelocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (APL) expressing the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein. In parallel, we evaluated the capacity of these cells to differentiate along the granulocytic and monocytic pathways. c-fms was constitutively and constantly expressed in all cases sensitive in vivo to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and its expression was further potentiated following in vitro induction with ATRA. Furthermore, gel-shift analysis of APL cells showed elevated levels of PU. 1 binding activity to the M-CSF receptor promoter, particularly after ATRA stimulation. Interestingly, the rise of PU. 1 binding activity as well as of PU. 1 levels after ATRA treatment was significantly higher in APL patients exhibiting monocytic maturation, as compared to those that did not undergo monocytic differentiation. A variable proportion of ATRA-induced APL cells exhibited monocyte-like morphology and immunophenotype: the proportion of monocytic cells was consistently increased by combined treatment with ATRA and diverse hematopoietic growth factors cocktails, which always comprised M-CSF. Monocytic cells originating from in vitro ATRA-induced maturation of APL cells derive from the leukemic clone as suggested by two lines of evidence: (1) monocytic cells harbor the 15; 17 translocation; (2) monocytic cells possess Auer bodies. The c-fms(bright) leukemic blasts preferentially showed the capacity for monocytic differentiation as compared to the c-fms(dim/-) subset: indeed, enforced expression of c-fms into NB 4, a PML/RAR alpha+ cell line, favored the onset of monocytic maturation. Finally, low c-fms expression was observed in an APL relapsing patient resistant to ATRA, as well as in an APL case with t(11; 17), PLZF/RAR alpha+. These observations indicate that PML/RAR alpha+ APL blasts are bipotent for differentiation through both neutrophilic and monocytic lineages, whereby monocytic differentiation is linked to c-fms expression and stimulation...|$|R

In the APL-st group, 37 patients had received radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for their primary malignancy (PM), while 14 had been treated by surgery alone. Compared with de novo APL patients, APL-st patients were characterized by a predominance of females (P <. 003), higher median age (P <. 05), and worse performance status (P <. 005). The median time elapsed between PM and APL-st was 36 months, with a longer latency for patients treated with surgery alone. No significant differences were found with regard to karyotypic lesions or type of promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion in the 2 cohorts. A high prevalence of PMs of the reproductive system was observed among the female APL-st population (24 [71 %] of 34 patients in this group had suffered from breast, uterine, or ovarian cancer). Thirty-one APL-st and 641 de novo APL patients received homogeneous APL therapy according to the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and idarubicin regimen (the AIDA regimen).
