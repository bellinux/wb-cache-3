Although Mother Jones organized for decades {{on behalf of the}} UMWA in West Virginia and even denounced the state as ‘medieval’, the chapter of the same name in her autobiography, she mostly praises Governor Morgan for defending the 1st amendment freedom of the labor weekly The Federationist to publish. His refusal to consent to the mine owners request he ban the paper demonstrated to Mother Jones that he ‘refused to comply with the requests of the dominant money interests. To a man of that type I wish to <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> respects’. Apparently Jones didn’t know or overlooked that Morgan had received about $1 million in campaign donations from industrialists in the 1920 election.|$|E

Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street".

Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liu Bei later sent Yi Ji as a {{messenger}} to Jiangdong (or Wu) {{to meet the}} warlord Sun Quan, Liu's ally in their war against Cao Cao. Sun Quan had heard of Yi Ji's debating skills before {{and he wanted to}} test Yi. When Yi Ji met Sun Quan, he knelt down to pay his respects. Sun Quan asked, [...] "Are you tired of serving an incompetent lord?" [...] Yi Ji replied, [...] "I just need to kneel down and <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> respects and then stand up. This isn't tiring to me." [...] Such was Yi Ji's wit and tactfulness. Sun Quan was very impressed with him.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{spent most}} of his playing career under the tough {{captaincy}} of Brian Sellers, who won six championships in eight seasons. [...] "I got a rollicking in my first match for putting my foot on the ball. In my first season, my spinning finger was so worn it was bleeding but Mr Sellers said I had to keep going and bowled me into the wind all day." [...] In that match, [...] at Bristol, Robinson took 2–168 as Hammond stroked 143. [...] "You were only paid if you played and I was never sure of my place. As an uncapped player I got pounds 7 or pounds 8 a match but had to <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> own travel and hotel expenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2004–05 season, Cahill was {{transferred}} to Everton for a fee of £1.5million, after Millwall's South East London rivals Crystal Palace ended negotiations of a potential transfer to themselves over a payment to his agents. In his first season, he was Everton's top goalscorer and was the fans' Player of the Season. Before the 2005–06 season Cahill's contract at Everton was extended with a salary increase reflecting the impact he had made at the club. The third round of that season's FA Cup drew Cahill's former club, Millwall against Everton at The Den. He scored the winner in the replay at Goodison Park, but chose not to celebrate his winning goal, stating, [...] "I decided not to go mad and just <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> respects to the club that gave me my start in the game. To celebrate would have been a kick in the teeth, it is all about respect." ...|$|E

2500|$|With accompaniment by {{experimental}} rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed [...] "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley {{wrote about}} an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother. Buckley {{returned to the}} stage to play [...] "Sefronia– The King's Chain", [...] "Phantasmagoria in Two", and concluded the concert with [...] "Once I Was" [...] performed acoustically with an impromptu a cappella ending, due to a snapped guitar string. Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression. Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: [...] "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But it bothered me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd {{never been able to}} tell him anything. I used that show to <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> last respects." [...] The concert proved to be his first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.|$|E
2500|$|He {{made his}} full {{international}} debut for England on 19 May 1951 against Portugal at Goodison Park, Liverpool, {{and made an}} immediate impression by scoring with his first touch of the ball after only 19 seconds. This proved to be his only international appearance due to injuries, the dominance of Billy Wright, and his habit of putting his club before his country. Nicholson {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> wages, don't they?". Of his only appearance he said [...] "Stan Pearson nodded it back and I ran on to let go a first time shot which, from the moment I hit it, I knew was going in. But for the next game they brought back Billy Wright and I accepted that because he was the better player". Nicholson is the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.|$|E
2500|$|Wealthy and {{socially}} ambitious women {{were drawn to}} Worth's showpiece creations. Over time this included American clients; Worth loved working with them because his French language skills never reached fluency and, as he put it, American women: [...] "have faith, figures, and francs – faith to believe in me, figures that I can put into shape, francs to <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> bills". Wealthy Americans travelled to Paris to have their entire wardrobe made by Worth – and that meant morning, afternoon and evening dresses {{as well as what}} were termed 'undress' items such as nightgowns and tea gowns. He would also design special occasion garments, such as wedding dresses. Alongside high society, the House of Worth also produced garments for popular stars such as Sarah Bernhardt, Lillie Langtry and Jenny Lind – who shopped there for both performance and private wear. Prices at Worth were dizzying for the time; the last bill it issued to Princess de Metternich – who had commented {{on the end of the}} 300 franc dress once Worth acquired royal patronage – was for the sum of 2,247 francs. Her purchase had been one lilac velvet dress.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{disclosed}} that Arnault planned {{to apply for}} Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium in 2013. In April 2013, Arnault {{said that he had}} been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: [...] "I repeatedly said that I would stay as a resident in France and that I would continue to <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> taxes.... Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Columnist Barbara Ellen of The Observer {{ridiculed}} the pomposity {{of some of}} the unfavourable {{reviews in}} her column on Sunday 28 March 2010, in a jokey [...] "Open letter to London's famous Adelphi theatre": [...] "Dear Mr Adelphi, Regarding the performance I viewed last week of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies, ridiculed as Paint Never Dries. With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough. My companions and I paid our money and went along in good faith, expecting a right old disaster. Imagine our disappointment when it was good. The phantom bore an eerie resemblance to Martin Amis sulking after his tiff with Anna Ford, but, sir, this was not enough. A catastrophe we were promised and a catastrophe we expected to see. One concedes that it is not all the production's fault. Negative reviews, the dark art of anti-hype, are a dangerous business. However, do fine feelings <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> babysitter? I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening. I'm sure I speak for many when I say I left your theatre wholly dissatisfied with how incredibly satisfied I felt".|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
