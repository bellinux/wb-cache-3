5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing <b>point</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
