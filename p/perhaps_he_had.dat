25|$|For his chord table Hipparchus {{must have}} used a better {{approximation}} for π than the one from Archimedes of between 3+1/7 and 3+10/71; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the one later used by Ptolemy: 3;8:30 (sexagesimal) (Almagest VI.7); {{but it is not}} known if he computed an improved value himself.|$|E
25|$|Also on November 26, Crow Neck, a {{returning}} warrior, told Bad Man (also {{known as}} Cranky Man) {{that he had}} left an exhausted horse along the trail to rest. When {{he went back to}} retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north who looked like soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. Bad Man doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs' wishes by joining the war party. Crow Neck told no one else what he had seen, fearing that he might be laughed at, or chastised by Black Kettle for having been part of the raid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, he was {{divorced}} {{from his first}} wife of 30 years, Ratna [...] "Elie". In 1968, he began {{to turn away from}} photography and return to his passion for drawing and painting. He admitted that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> said all he could through photography. He married Magnum photographer Martine Franck, thirty years younger than himself, in 1970. The couple had a daughter, Mélanie, in May 1972.|$|E

60|$|AMAH. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> knife. Why you no look {{see before}} you tie him.|$|R
50|$|The end of Blore-Smith’s saga is ambiguous: <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gained {{something}} valuable {{from his}} experiences; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not yet {{reached the point}} of intellectual development at which he can recognize his gains. The novel remains Burtonesque, clearly showing that the persistent belief that life does have something else to offer, no matter what one may currently have, {{is the essence of}} melancholy.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus' {{daughter}} Lucilla. Marcus moved up the date; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> already heard of Lucius' mistress, the low-born and beautiful Panthea. Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father. Civica was made comes Augusti, [...] "companion of the emperors"; perhaps Marcus wanted him to watch over Lucius, the job Libo had failed at.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{six months}} later at The Forum in Inglewood, California, on September 10, 1973, Ali avenged the Norton loss but only after he got the return by a split decision. Norton weighed in at 205lbs (5 pounds lighter than his first match with Ali) and boxing scribes {{discussed}} that his preparation was too intense and that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> overtrained. There were some furious exchanges in this hard-fought battle. From Ali's point of view, a loss here would have seriously dented his claim of ever being [...] "The Greatest." [...] During the ABC broadcast of the fight, broadcaster (and Ali confidant and friend) Howard Cosell repeatedly told viewers a dancing and jabbing Ali was dominating the action despite Norton's constant offense and Ali's inability to penetrate Norton's awkward defensive style. [...] The close and controversial scoring was {{in stark contrast to}} Cosell's fight-long insistence that Ali had matters well in hand.|$|E
2500|$|Once he {{repeated}} the whole finale of [...] Sonata in B minor, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not succeeded in the short crescendo at the end {{as he would have}} wished. [...] One listened entranced, and could have heard the passage over and over again, so unique was the beauty of tone.... I have never heard the virtuoso piece Islamey by Balakirev, as Rubinstein played it, and his interpretation of Schumann's little fantasy The Bird as Prophet was inimitable in poetic refinement: to describe the diminuendo of the pianissimo {{at the end of the}} [...] "fluttering away of the little bird" [...] would be hopelessly inadequate. [...] Inimitable, too, was the soul-stirring imagery in the Kreisleriana, the last (G minor) passage of which I have never heard anyone play in the same manner. [...] One of Rubinstein's greatest secrets was his use of the pedal. [...] He himself very happily expressed his ideas on the subject when he said, [...] "The pedal is the soul of the piano." [...] No pianist should ever forget this.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{positively}} indecent," [...] said Torpenhow, [...] "and {{the first time}} that Dick has ever broken up a light morning. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> found out that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a soul, or an artistic temperament, or something equally valuable. That comes of leaving him alone for a month. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been going out of evenings. I must look to this." [...] He rang for the bald-headed old housekeeper, whom nothing could astonish or annoy.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} another thing," [...] said Isa, laughing. [...] "But if so, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not taken me into his confidence. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her glance fell away. Her voice faltered {{a little}} in replying. [...] "If <b>he...</b> needs redeeming. <b>Perhaps...</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been judged too harshly." ...|$|R
60|$|Wetzel {{bowed his}} head, as <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never before {{in all his}} life.|$|E
60|$|The utterly {{unaltered}} {{voice and}} attitude added a strange violence to that shocking change of speech. But the guarder of the relic only seemed {{to turn his}} head by the smallest section of the compass. He seemed still to have a somewhat foolish face turned to the stars. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not understood. Or, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> understood and sat rigid with terror.|$|E
60|$|Uncle John beamed upon them. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{never been}} so happy before in all his life.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} bad as that, Nollie; but Mr. Fort is {{certainly}} subversive. I think <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{seen too many}} queer sides of life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{acted as}} if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> struck {{something}} else," [...] answered Randolph Rover. [...] "He didn't even want the money I offered. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> received a remittance from home." ...|$|R
60|$|The driver, holding {{high the}} reins twisted around the hook, took no notice. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not heard. Stevie’s breast heaved.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dalton did {{not look}} surprised, and he thought Miss Graham smiled. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been abrupt, {{but he did not}} care.|$|E
60|$|The negro grinned. It was {{the usual}} case of the extravagant spendthrift miner, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{expected}} a different question and order.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is," [...] {{answered}} Barwell Dawson. [...] "But just where, {{there is}} no telling. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been to the Pole, and is now coming back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay," [...] Maitland replied rather wearily. [...] "He {{seems to}} have {{travelled}} a good deal: <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> travelled in Coolies, whatever they may be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to dispel that notion. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a big sister at home who pounds him, and {{therefore}} he believes all girls are alike." ...|$|R
60|$|Davy was as yet {{far from}} repentance, {{but in his}} secret soul he felt that, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone a little too far.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy knitted his brows. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> thought {{too much}} for himself, but he owned {{he did not want}} Deering to leave him.|$|E
6000|$|... “What was that?” asked Bertie anxiously, {{fearful that}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> chosen a size of {{handkerchief}} {{that was not}} within the correct feminine limit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray, pray be composed," [...] cried Elinor, [...] "and do not betray {{what you}} feel to every body present. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not {{observed}} you yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed! He {{took his}} {{portmanteau}} with him, did <b>he?</b> <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone to Paris {{to buy you}} something nice {{and give you a}} pleasant surprise." ...|$|R

60|$|The nephew {{with the}} outline of a countenance, {{suggested}} that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ordered a new pair of boots, and they hadn't come home.|$|E

6000|$|... 'One of {{the most}} {{conceited}} dogs that I ever met with,' replied the King. 'He thinks {{he is a great}} genius, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> some little talent for the extravagant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know him. I don't {{want to know}} him. Do {{you think}} he means to send for you. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> sent for you. I won't allow it! You shan't go!" ...|$|R
