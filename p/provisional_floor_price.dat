40|$|In {{this paper}} I improve Gardner's surplus {{transformation}} curve framework by assuming {{that government is}} able to vary many policy instruments simultaneously instead of only one. I use my framework to find {{the combination of the}} currently used instruments which provides the most efficient income redistribution for the Austrian bread grains market. Contrasting the most efficient policy to the actual policy reveals that 464 million Austrian shillings were wasted. I theoretically compare for a small country the transfer efficiency of every possible pair of the four major agricultural policy instruments: <b>floor</b> <b>price,</b> production quota, coresponsibility levy, and deficiency payments. Without considering the marginal cost of public funds (MCF), deficiency payments cum quota (equal to a fully-decoupled direct income support) is the most efficient policy, succeeded by <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> cum quota, and <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> cum deficiency payments. If the MCF is taken into account, the ranking crucially depends on the market parameters, the transfer level, and the value of the MCF. For the Austrian bread grains market, I empirically demonstrate, that given the present support level, a fully-decoupled direct income support redistributes income most efficiently as long as the MCF is lower than 1. 17. Beyond this value a <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> cum quota policy becomes more efficient. A <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> cum deficiency payments policy is never superior to the <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> cum quota. 2 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{impact of}} border and {{domestic}} policy on price transmission between markets {{depends on the}} type of policy tool used. Intervention mechanisms such as <b>floor</b> <b>prices</b> could lead to domestic prices being completely unrelated to world prices or being related in a non linear way (Rapsomanikis, Hallam, and Conforti, 2003). Price transmission will only take place if the world price is above the domestic <b>floor</b> <b>price.</b> The <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> will act as a threshold therefore the existence of a <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> may cause price transmission to be asymmetric. Despite the use of minimum rice export prices in Thailand and Vietnam, which act as <b>floor</b> <b>prices,</b> the study’s results found these two markets to be related to each other as well as with other markets. This was {{despite the fact that the}} methods used in this study did not consider the presence of asymmetric price relationships. This can be explained by the fact that Thai and Vietnamese authorities regularly adjust their minimum export prices in order to keep their rice exports competitive in world markets when they want to release rice stocks. This is precisely what has happened in Thailand in 2013 as the government has continued to lower their minimum export prices in order to make their rice export prices more competitive. While previously, Thailand purposely kept its minimum export prices above world prices, as the cost of the pledging program has built up and surpassed the $ 16 billion allocated to it, the government has been trying to release the rice stocks it accrued from the rice farmers who participated in the pledging program during 2011 and 2012 in order to recoup part of the cost of the rice pledging program which has cost $ 8 billion excluding administrative costs (USDA, 2013).|$|R

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Bargaining {{power has}} in many {{fisheries}} shifted considerably from fish processors to fishermen with modern communications, higher fleet mobility and increased scarcity of the resources. In Norway, fishermen were {{to a large}} degree exploited by processors up until the early 20 th century. A strong collaborative effort from the fishermens' union culminated with the introduction of the "Act on Raw Fish" in 1933. Here, first hand sales of fish were to take place through fishermen-owned sales organizations and subject to a <b>floor</b> <b>price,</b> to a very large degree defined by the same organizations. Needless to say, this represented a major shift in bargaining power, and these major parts of the act are still in force today. This even though the processing firms show poor profitability and the fleet has far better economic results. A considerable, but varying, part of the total first hand sales are made at the <b>floor</b> <b>price,</b> indicating that it is effective. Aside from distributional aspects, the <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> can have unintended detrimental effects. With supply of fish being highly seasonal in Norwegian fisheries, a <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> could exacerbate the seasonality through not exposing fishermen to the true costs of high supply. It can also increase incentives for not reporting the correct quantities landed. The aim {{of this study is to}} employ econometric models to estimate the effect of the <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> regime and to obtain estimates of prices without such a regime in force...|$|R

30|$|All {{financial}} transactions related to electricity traded in the NEM is settled based on spot price. NEM spot market matches real time instantaneous demand with power supply through a centralized dispatch process. A specified amount of electricity at specified prices {{is offered by}} generators to be supplied to market for agreed time periods. Market operator scrutinizes all bids and decides the deployment of specific generators to produce electricity according to cost-efficient methodology with dispatching of the cheapest generator. Spare generating capacity is kept as reserve after matching electricity consumption with power generation. Every 5 -minute target is applied to determine a dispatch price based on highest or the marginal bid for electricity delivery. Spot price is determined for each NEM region by averaging dispatch prices over every half hour period. Market price cap denoting maximum spot <b>price</b> and market <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> denoting minimum spot price are set according to the NERs. Market price cap was set at 13800  $/MWh and market <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> was set −[*] 1000 $/MWh at January 2015 [4]. Market price cap highly rewards generation supply for meeting demand in need while negative market <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> strongly encourages power reduction by all generation, including wind in case supply exceeds demand. These two price settings are reviewed every four years by the reliability panel set up by AEMC to safeguard the NEM reliability standard.|$|R

Sugar processors {{must comply with}} a <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> for cane, but gur and khandsari producers are exempt from the <b>floor</b> <b>price.</b> Thus, any effect of the sugar processor’s choice of procurement method on the incentives facing farmers {{will depend on the}} expected cane price in these competing unregulated markets. In Andhra Pradesh (AP), India, private sugar processors use an unusual form of vertical coordination. Rather than conventional pre-planting contracts, they issue ‘permits’ to selected cane growers a few weeks before harvest. I explore the potential motivations behind this choice of sugar processors and hypothesize that the probabilistic permit system is the low-cost way of procuring high-quality cane. I develop a theoretical model of the AP cane procurement market that incorporates the <b>floor</b> <b>price</b> policy that applies only to the cane used for sugar processing, and compare processor profits under the probabilistic ex post permit system and ex ante production contracts. The model predicts that both the quality of cane procured and the profits from unit cane purchase are higher when the processor uses ex post permits. These gains {{come at the expense of}} increased cultivation costs incurred by the farmers.
