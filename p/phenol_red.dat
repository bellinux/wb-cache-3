40|$|The {{reaction}} between o-, m-, and p-methoxyphenols and 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone was {{studied in}} the presence of laccase from Pyricularia oryzae. The findings show that laccase (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 10. 3. 2) catalyzes the oxidative coupling reaction between MBTH and <b>phenols</b> producing <b>red</b> colored azo-dye compounds. On the basis of kinetic parameters and optimum pH values, the mechanisms of the oxidative coupling reactions with the different phenols are discussed. The results suggest that the reaction is initialized by the enzymatic 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone activation, which undergoes electrophilic substitution with m-methoxyphenol in solution, enzymatic activated guaiacol, and chelated p-methoxyphenol at the catalytic site of the laccase. The current study also demonstrates the possibility of using the azo-dye formed {{in the presence of}} guaiacol for measuring laccase activity following a similar assaying method as that used for measuring peroxidase activity.

Eleven wine isolates of B. bruxellensis were evaluated for volatile <b>phenol</b> production in <b>red</b> wine and their genetic diversity was determined by Restriction Endonuclease Analysis-Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (REA-PFGE). Fourier transform mid-infrared (FTMIR) spectroscopy was used to obtain spectral fingerprints of the spoiled wines.

The groupings from the genetic fingerprints obtained with REA-PFGE were used as reference firstly for comparison with the groupings observed with the FTMIR spectral fingerprint of the wines and secondly for the FTIR-ATR spectral fingerprints from the whole cells.

The solute polarization is included using electrostatic embedded calculations at the MP 2 /aug-cc-pVDZ level giving a dipole moment of 2. 25 D, corresponding to an increase of 76 % compared to the calculated gas-phase value. Using statistically uncorrelated configurations sampled from the MC simulation,first-principle size-extensive calculations are performed to obtain the solvatochromic shift. Analysis is then made {{of the origin of}} the blue shift. Results both at the optimized geometry and in room-temperature liquid water show that hydrogen bonds of water with <b>phenol</b> promote a <b>red</b> shift when <b>phenol</b> is the proton-donor and a blue shift when phenol is the proton-acceptor. In the case of the optimized clusters the calculated shifts are in very good agreement with results obtained from mass-selected free jet expansion experiments.

Thus, antioxidants are expected to decrease the vulnerability of the kidney to oxidative challenges. Polyphenols, particularly abundant in red wine, could act as ROS scavengers, iron chelators and enzyme modulators. In addition, chronic exposure to moderate amounts of ethanol results in increased activity of the renal antioxidant enzymes, further supporting a renoprotective effect of red wine based oil its antioxidant properties. An enhancement of plasma antioxidant capacity following red wine consumption has been reported both in man and rodents, thereby providing a contributory factor to its renoprotective effect because the kidney is a highly perfused organ.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} protein-bound <b>phenols</b> in <b>red</b> clover, induced by different degrees of damaging before wilting and varying wilting duration, and in silo lipid metabolism. The ultimate effect of these changes on rumen biohydrogenation is the second focus of this paper For this experiment, red clover, damaged to different degrees (not damaged (ND), crushing or frozen/thawing (FT)) before wilting (4 or 24 h) was ensiled. Different degrees of damaging and wilting duration lead to differences in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, measured as increase in protein-bound phenols. Treatment effects on fatty acid (FA) content and composition, lipid fractions (free FAs, membrane lipids (ML) and neutral fraction) and lipolysis were further studied in the silage. In FT, red clover lipolysis was markedly lower {{in the first days}} after ensiling, but this largely disappeared after 60 days of ensiling, regardless of wilting duration. This suggests an inhibition of plant lipases in FT silages. After 60 days of ensiling no differences in lipid fractions could be found between any of the treatments and differences in lipolysis were caused by reduced FA proportions in ML of wilted FT red clover Fresh, wilted (24 h) after damaging (ND or FT) and ensiled (4 or 60 days; wilted 24 h; ND or FT) red clover were also incubated in rumen fluid to study the biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and C 18 : 2 n- 6 in vitro. Silages (both 60 days and to a lower degree 4 days) showed a lower biohydrogenation compared with fresh and wilted forages, regardless of damaging. This suggests that lipids in ensiled red clover were more protected, but this protection was not enhanced by a higher amount of protein-bound phenols in wilted FT compared with ND red clover The reduction of rumen microbial biohydrogenation with duration of red clover ensiling seems in contrast to what is expected, namely a higher biohydrogenation when a higher amount of FFA is present. This merits further investigation in relation to strategies to activate PPO toward the embedding of lipids in phenol protein complexes...|$|R
