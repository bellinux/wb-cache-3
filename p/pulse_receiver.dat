An analysis of the effects of noise, pulse duration and sampling frequency on the uncertainty in fish location is presented. Signal to noise ratios less than 5 dB can cause significant errors in the calculation of received signal phase. A stationary fish with a signal to noise ratio of 15 dB has approximately plus-minus 0. 001 degrees of uncertainty in the angles of arrival. Reducing the SNR to 3 dB the uncertainty increases to plus-minus 3. 6 degrees in the angles of arrival...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the gap discharge transducer is investigated as both a sound pulse emitter and a sound <b>pulse</b> <b>receiver</b> in a gas flow measurement setup. The main objective is to use the gap discharge transducer as an integral part in a gas flow measurement system developed for harsh environments. The idea for the method considered in this study to determine the flow was taken from the time-of-flight technique used in ultrasonic flow measurements. The gap discharge transducer should then be used as both an emitter and a receiver in a setup that somewhat mimics those in ultrasonics. Earlier studies with the gap discharge transducer has shown that it is both very durable and a potent sound pulse emitter. This thesis continues these studies by incorporating the transducer into a measurement system as an emitter and also investigates its capabilities {{to be used as a}} sound <b>pulse</b> <b>receiver.</b> As an emitter in a flow measurement system the transducer was placed in a pipe with a variable flow in a laboratory environment. The transducer was set to generate sparks to create the sound pulse and standard piezoelectric receivers were used to capture the signal. To determine the possibilities to use the transducer as a receiver the transducer was placed in a vacuum chamber to test the dependence between breakdown voltage and pressure. Since a sound pulse is a change in pressure the pulse might cause breakdown in the gap between the electrodes of the transducer if an initial voltage between the electrodes is set close enough to breakdown. The investigation shows that the gap discharge transducer is a potential sound pulse emitter in a flow measurement system and, with some small calibration and more precise alignment, is capable to determine the flow quite accurately. On the other hand, to use the transducer as a receiver is concluded to be very difficult. The breakdown voltage is too unstable to allow an initial voltage close to breakdown to be set without risking spontaneous breakdown due to random events.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaIt is {{well known}} that the pulse {{telemetering}} system whose system equipment is simple is superior to the continuous one in ultilizing signal power. But in designing a pulse telemetering receiver the frequency shift problem is often encountered, the shift often greatly wider than the signal bandwidth is very unfavorable for improving receiver working sensitivity. Either to limit transmitter frequency stability strictly or to adapt AFC system in receiver for tracking carrier wave can solve the problem above, the AFC system method could improve the receiver’s performance, but the equipment is complicated. To what extent the receiver working sensitivity will be effected and how to judge the effection in case of adapting VF matched filter and RF being wideband in receiver are this paper’s emphasis. In this paper the power density spectrum distribution of the white noise which has passed through the non-linear system-the linear detector is analysed theoretically, and the improved working sensitivity of the receiver with video matched filter and its difference sensitivity value to that of the optimal receiver are derived. The tested working sensitivity data of two kind pulse receivers with different RF bands are given and the theoretical calculation results conform well with these data, thus it is proven that adapting video matched filter in <b>pulse</b> <b>receiver</b> is a effective approach for compensating the receiver working sensitivity dropping from RF bandwidth increase...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the gap discharge transducer is investigated as transducers in a time-of-flight gas flow measurement setup designed for harsh environments. In this thesis the gap discharge transducer is operated in two different modes, named spark discharge transducer and glow discharge transducer. The spark discharge transducer generates a spark over a gap while the glow discharge transducer generates a continuous glow discharge. Earlier studies show that the spark discharge transducer is very durable and a potent sound pulse emitter. This thesis continues these studies by incorporating the spark discharge transducer into a flow measurement system as a sound pulse emitter. Further more, the gap discharge transducer is investigated as a potential sound <b>pulse</b> <b>receiver.</b> As an emitter in a flow measurement system the spark discharge transducer was placed in a pipe with a variable flow in a laboratory environment. The transducer was set to generate sparks to create the sound pulse and standard piezoelectric receivers were used to capture the signal. As a receiver, the gap discharge transducer was tested in two experiments. In the first experiment the spark discharge transducer was placed in a vacuum chamber to test the dependence between breakdown voltage and pressure. The pressure change from a sound pulse might cause breakdown in the gap of the transducer if an initial voltage between the electrodes is set close enough to breakdown. The breakdown leads to a spark which can be used to determine when a sound pulse arrives. In the second experiment the transducer was set to generate a glow discharge. The glow discharge was then subjected to a sound source. The voltage and current of the glow discharge depends on the environmental conditions in the gap. Pressure changes from a sound pulse will then affect the air in the gap which in turn changes the voltage and current characteristics of the discharge. The change in voltage and/or current can then be used to determine when a sound pulse has arrived. The investigation shows that the spark discharge transducer is a potential sound pulse emitter in a flow measurement system and could be capable of determining a flow quite accurately. As a receiver, the spark discharge transducer show limited potential. The pressure change of a spark generated sound pulse requires the receiver to be set very close to the breakdown voltage. But that close to the determined breakdown voltage will very often cause the gap to breakdown spontaneously. The glow discharge transducer, on the other hand, show promising potential. The transducer is proven to be able to receive sound waves and has a sensitivity that is deemed compatible with the spark discharge transducer as a sound pulse emitter.
