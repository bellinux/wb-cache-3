5|$|Another {{common and}} <b>potentially</b> fatal {{complication}} of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening {{infection of the}} bowel.|$|E
5|$|For <b>potentially</b> curable SCLC cases, chest {{radiotherapy}} {{is often}} recommended {{in addition to}} chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Screening devices {{based on}} diamond type {{detection}} {{can be used}} to make a distinction between diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are <b>potentially</b> synthetic. Those <b>potentially</b> synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but <b>potentially</b> different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but <b>potentially</b> different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} loanwords of Mayan or <b>potentially</b> Mayan origins {{are found in}} other languages, principally Spanish, English, and some {{neighboring}} Mesoamerican languages. In addition, Mayan languages borrowed words, especially from Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Any firearm {{collected}} {{during the course of}} an investigation could yield viable evidence if examined. For forensic firearm examination specific evidence that can be recovered include weapon serial numbers and <b>potentially</b> fingerprints left on the weapon's surface.|$|E
5|$|Any size {{estimate}} of A. fragillimus must be regarded with caution {{because of the}} lack of specimens or even detailed, accurate documentation of its fossils. All size estimates are based on Cope's original description, which has somewhat vague measurements and <b>potentially</b> critical typographical errors.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{is in the}} South Volcanic Zone, which {{contains}} <b>potentially</b> deadly and active volcanoes such as Mount Hudson, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima together have more than 80reported episodes of volcanism since 1558, and at least 40South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could <b>potentially</b> host life.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{floor plans}} of the tower were posted on the New York City's Department of Finance website in May 2011. This {{resulted}} in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area, who warned that the plans could <b>potentially</b> {{be used for a}} future terrorist attack.|$|E
5|$|Due to its <b>potentially</b> {{harmful effects}} on ecosystems, various {{efforts have been}} made to control {{introduced}} populations of C.maenas around the world. In Edgartown, Massachusetts, a bounty was levied in 1995 for catching C.maenas, to protect local shellfish, and 10tons were caught.|$|E
5|$|E. annectens {{differed}} from E. regalis {{by having a}} longer, lower, less robust skull. Although Brett-Surman regarded E. regalis and E. annectens as <b>potentially</b> representing males and females of the same species, all E. regalis specimens come from older formations than E. annectens specimens.|$|E
5|$|For consistency, fees in {{the record}} {{transfer}} tables below are all sourced from BBC Sport's contemporary reports of each transfer. Where the report mentions an initial fee <b>potentially</b> rising to a higher figure depending on contractual clauses being satisfied in the future, only the initial fee is listed in the tables.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days prior}} to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) issued storm {{advisories}} for <b>potentially</b> affected areas. Subsequently, the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall, high winds, and rough seas. However, few citizens knew of {{the passage of the}} rare storm.|$|E
5|$|Further, scrutinizing {{legislation}} {{to determine if}} it contravenes fundamental liberties is traditionally {{the function of the}} judiciary. Even though the PCMR can <b>potentially</b> prevent an unconstitutional piece of legislation from coming into force, there is doubt as to whether the Council's members have sufficient legal training to undertake the burdensome task.|$|E
5|$|H2 {{reacts with}} every {{oxidizing}} element. Hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently {{at room temperature}} with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, which are also <b>potentially</b> dangerous acids.|$|E
5|$|Hematophagy is {{uncommon}} due to {{the number}} of challenges to overcome for success: a large volume of liquid <b>potentially</b> overwhelming the kidneys and bladder, the risk of iron poisoning, and coping with excess protein.|$|E
5|$|Hopkins and Haukur {{additionally}} {{propose a}} connection between FÃ³lkvangr {{and a variety of}} other Germanic words referring to the afterlife that contain extensions of Proto-Germanic *wangaz, including Old English Neorxnawang, <b>potentially</b> pointing to an early Germanic *wangaz of the dead'.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Favre was {{temporarily}} {{banned by the}} NFL from drinking alcohol after he admitted he was addicted to Vicodin and spent 46 days at a drug rehab clinic {{before the start of}} the season. His condition was serious enough that he suffered a <b>potentially</b> deadly seizure.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet {{withdrew from}} its base at Truk and was divided between Palau and Singapore. The {{appearance}} of a powerful Japanese squadron at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that this force could <b>potentially</b> conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, Lexus {{announced}} that it will be producing a new flagship vehicle: the two-door LC 500. The vehicle will be produced for late 2017 in a V8 version putting out 467 horsepower. The LC 500h, a V6 hybrid variant, could <b>potentially</b> become available in late 2017 or early 2018.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} acidic soils, {{there is less}} calcium available, <b>potentially</b> leading to thinner egg shells. In such locations, pipits {{are more likely to}} select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than is the case in {{limestone}} terrain.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore <b>potentially</b> less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams, {{known by}} some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat, is a <b>potentially</b> active {{stratovolcano}} in the Cascade Range. Although Adams has not erupted {{in more than}} 1,000years, it is not considered extinct. It is the second-highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington, after Mount Rainier.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are <b>potentially</b> habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two <b>potentially</b> habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October Banksy {{released}} another {{video for}} his tour of New York <b>potentially</b> {{to convey the}} movement in nature that we are blind to but it is truly just a vagina with ants crawling out of it.|$|E
5|$|One <b>potentially</b> {{distinguishing}} {{character is}} {{the shape of}} the ultimate segments in the middle part of the leaf blade, which are oblong in A.pedatum and long-triangular or reniform (kidney-shaped) in A.viridimontanum and some specimens of A.aleuticum. Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
5|$|Plan Tortue was a delaying {{operation}} {{aimed at the}} enemy forces that would <b>potentially</b> reinforce Axis forces at Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Polydor Records, {{the company}} in charge of Fiction Records, the label on which the album was released, was {{initially}} displeased with the album's title, which it saw as being <b>potentially</b> offensive. Following the album's release, Simon Gallup left the group.|$|E
5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a <b>potentially</b> lethal {{condition}} {{commonly associated}} with clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results {{in the production of}} a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies of}} flight feather barb {{geometry}} reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the feather, whereas Archaeopteryx lacks this large barb angle, indicating <b>potentially</b> weak flight abilities.|$|E
5|$|Research has {{indicated}} that MFGM, or components thereof, may <b>potentially</b> play roles in brain development and cognitive function, immunity and gut health, and cardiovascular health.|$|E
5|$|Rowling and her {{publishers}} {{have brought}} a series of legal injunctions to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from civil liberties campaigners over their <b>potentially</b> sweeping powers over individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Salts of {{germanium}} are <b>potentially</b> {{harmful to}} {{humans and animals}} if ingested on a prolonged basis. There is interest in the pharmacological actions of germanium compounds but no licensed medicine as yet.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a <b>potentially</b> valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to <b>potentially</b> damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400Âµm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E
5|$|Seven athletes {{qualified}} in {{the swimming}} events - six in individual events and one (Keren Siebner) in the relay events. The qualifying standards {{are up to}} a maximum of 2 swimmers in each event at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and <b>potentially</b> 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST).|$|E
