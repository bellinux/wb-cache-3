40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>parentage</b> <b>determination.</b> At present, {{this issue is}} {{becoming}} more and more topical due to current diversion from traditional values, the traditional model of family in particular. The thesis concerns not only with the determination of paternity, but also with maternity determination, which is mentioned with regard to assisted reproduction and surrogacy. Emphasis is placed on both, current legislation and the new Civil Code coming into effect on 1 January 2014. The thesis is divided into eight chapters. The introduction discusses possible views on the concept of parenthood. Furthermore, it introduces the issue of <b>parentage</b> <b>determination,</b> especially in connection with the increasing number of children born outside marriage. The following chapter is devoted to legislative regulation of <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> itself. Firstly, it elaborates the history of such regulations with focus on Roman law and the Austrian Civil Code. Subsequently, it describes the current legislation and briefly comments on the new Civil Code, which is further discussed in the corresponding chapters. The third chapter examines the determination of maternity. Included are the issues of assisted reproduction and surrogacy, as well as anonymous and concealed births, which have become an important topic rather recently [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|When {{microsatellites}} {{were introduced}} {{as a tool}} for <b>parentage</b> <b>determination,</b> they were considered to be the ideal markers for this purpose (Queller et al. 1993).

Analyses can thus be performed on tiny and even par-tially degraded DNA samples. Unfortunately microsa-tellites must be cloned separately for every studied spe-cies. Later studies using microsatellites for parentage de-termination have revealed new weaknesses.

40|$|Excerpt] “The {{family and}} parental {{relationship}} appears secure {{as long as}} the members of the family stay within the borders of the states that recognize their relationship. What happens, though, when the family ventures beyond the borders of Vermont, Massachusetts, California, and Connecticut, has yet to be determined. Legislation in almost every other state has addressed whether each state will recognize the couples’ relationship, 27 but no state has determined how it will treat the legal relationship between the children of these couples and their parents. 28 This article will focus on the fragile legal relationship between same-sex parents and their children and will suggest legislative adjustments that can address this relationship without forcing states to recognize the underlying relationship with the parents. […] Part II will explain the most common methods of addressing parentage issues in traditional family relationships. Part III will review the various methods courts have used to address <b>parentage</b> <b>determinations</b> in same-sex relationships in states where same-sex relationships are not sanctioned. Part IV will explain how courts have addressed <b>parentage</b> <b>determinations</b> in the states that recognize some form of same-sex relationship. Part V will identify potential and actual issues that arise when same-sex couples travel from states that recognize their relationship to those that do not. Finally, Part VI will suggest legislative action that can eliminate the need for varying tests and standards depending on the sexes of the parents. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{almost two}} centuries, American family law has {{asserted}} that it places {{children and their}} welfare {{at the heart of}} custody and <b>parentage</b> <b>determinations.</b> That statement, institutionalized in the United States as the 2 ̆ 2 best-interest 2 ̆ 2 standard (or principle),has become almost impossible to attack. However, the best-interest standard is widely criticized for providing little concrete guidance to courts asked to settle disputes involving children 2 ̆ 7 s custody. The standard, as applied, grants courts remarkable flexibility. As a result, reliance on the standard ensures widely discrepant, even contradictory, results in custody cases, depending on the presiding judge. The standard, presumed to determine and protect the interests of children, more often seems to encourage courts to focus on and to protect the interests of the disputing adults...|$|R
40|$|In Adar v. Smith, the Fifth Circuit {{held that}} Louisiana’s policy of refusing to issue {{accurate}} birth certificates {{to the children}} of out-of-state, same-sex adoptive parents does not deny those families equal protection of the law. This comment demonstrates that Louisiana’s policy does in fact violate the Equal Protection Clause. There are two ways Louisiana’s policy infringes on the rights of these families. First, the policy burdens fundamental rights stemming from the family autonomy of both parents and children. Second, the policy discriminates against out-of-state same-sex parents, treating them like second-class citizens. These concerns are strong enough that the policy should be subject to some form of heightened scrutiny. Louisiana’s failure to issue accurate birth certificates revisits valid <b>parentage</b> <b>determinations</b> made by other states and undermines the strength of those parent-child relationships. Louisiana lacks a legitimate interest in denying these out-of-state families fundamental rights and discriminating against them on the basis of sexual orientation.

40|$|Microsatellites are {{superior}} {{compared to other}} geneti-cal markers for <b>parentage</b> <b>determination,</b> {{because they can be}} analysed from tiny and partially degraded DNA-samples extracted from e. g. hairs or bird feath-ers (ELLEGREN 1992). However, bird genomes con-tain relatively few microsatellite loci (LONGMIRE et al. 1999; PRIMMER et al. 1997 b). It is therefore a tedious process to isolate a set of markers that is sufficient for conclusive parentage analyses. Here we report on nine microsatellite markers that are polymorphic in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus), a resident family dwelling species occurring throughout the Eurasian taiga (HELLE and LILLANDT 1997). The markers were found using two methods; (1) isolating new mi-crosatellite sequences from a size-selected Siberian ja...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With recent {{developments}} in DNA technologies, {{a large number of}} genetic polymorphisms at DNA sequence level has been introduced over the last decades as named DNA-based markers. The discovery of new class of DNA profiling markers has facilitated the development of marker-based gene tags, mapbased cloning of livestock important genes, variability studies, phylogenetic analysis, synteny mapping, marker-assisted selection of favourable genotypes, etc. The most commonly used DNA-based markers have advantages over the traditional phenotypic and biochemical markers since they provide data that can be analyzed objectively. In this article the main applications of molecular markers in present-day breeding strategies for livestock improvement- <b>parentage</b> <b>determination,</b> genetic distance estimation, genetic diversity, gene mapping and marker-assisted selection have been reviewed.

40|$|Legal {{parentage}} for childcare purposes under American {{state laws}} is significantly and rapidly expanding, {{with the new}} norms growing increasingly imprecise. No longer is childcare parentage, that is, parentage carrying the superior right to the “care, custody, and control” of a child, only defined at precise moments in time, as by giving birth; having biological ties; marriage to the birth mother; name placement on a birth certificate; or, formal adoption. In increasing numbers, {{both men and women}} are now becoming childcare parents where the time of the actions prompting legal parentage is imprecise. Here, parentage typically depends on assessing earlier parental-like acts, like providing financial support or the holding out of a child as one’s own. Here, an earlier intent to be a parent, and not simply be a child caretaker, also is often key. Both precise and imprecise forms of establishing childcare parentage are now also increasingly overridden under new imprecise disestablishment norms. Whether labeled as rebuttals or rescissions, parentage disestablishments today are frequently dependent on assessing earlier conduct occurring at no precise time, like the failure of a biological father to establish a bonded and dependent familial relationship with his child. Judicial inquiries into imprecise childcare parentage in both establishment and disestablishment settings would be greatly facilitated if American state lawmakers created new mechanisms for personal declarations of earlier assumed and/or now intended parental acts. As intent to parent often is quite relevant, these declarations would be quite helpful, though not controlling, when courts assess earlier actions while determining imprecise childcare parentage issues. Before suggesting new mechanisms for formal declarations of intended childcare parentage, the paper first reviews current American state imprecise childcare parentage laws and the importance of parental intentions in such laws. New legal mechanisms could aid courts in their inquiries into earlier parental-like acts in imprecise parental childcare cases if clear indications of childcare intentions were earlier expressed by existing legal parents and/or by those looking forward to (further) pursuing a parental role. Voluntary paternity acknowledgements do not now, and should not ever, cover such expressions. They were meant, and should remain, for alleged biological fathers of children born of consensual sex. States having imprecise parentage laws should facilitate later judicial inquiries into parental-like acts by establishing new mechanisms for formal declarations of assumed and/or intended parentage. Such declarations would not control courts making childcare <b>parentage</b> <b>determinations.</b> Rather, they would guide, helping courts apply their states’ imprecise childcare parentage laws that depend upon earlier actions and intentions of parents and of nonparents regarding the continuing or future care and support of children. New state mechanisms for formal declarations of assumed and/or intended childcare parentage should be developed after imprecise childcare parent laws are established, as through statutes or court decisions abiding by premarital or midmarriage childcare pacts (dealing, e. g., with assumed and/or intended stepparent childcare) or by cohabitation pacts between single parents and their significant others...|$|R

40|$|Parentage {{testing in}} the {{domestic}} dog is finding increasing application for dog breed registries {{as well as in}} research. The aim of parentage verification is the correct assignment of both parents to the offspring. For accurate parentage verification informative microsatellite markers have to be identified. More powerful models to study artificial insemination in bitches will be possible if the paternity and gender of early dog conceptuses can be determined. The amelogenin gene locus has been used in bovine day six to day seven embryos for early gender determination but no research has been done on early conceptuses of the domestic dog. The aim of the current study was to establish an accurate method for <b>parentage</b> and gender <b>determination</b> from domestic dog conceptuses during early pregnancy in a multi-sire insemination trial. Semen from 10 male dogs was used in each of 12 females for artificial insemination. Blood and uterine tissue for DNA extraction was collected from males and females, and embryonic material was collected after ovariohysterectomy between 16 and 30 days after the onset of cytological dioestrus. Twenty-three microsatellite markers were used for parentage verification, and the amelogenin gene locus for gender determination. Mean observed heterozygosity, mean expected heterozygosity (HExp), and mean PIC were high (0. 6753, 0. 6785, and 0. 628, respectively). There were 66 conceptuses. In two, neither parentage nor gender could be established because their tissue samples were contaminated. Parentage could be assigned by CERVUS 3. 0. 3 in 42 out of 64 of the cases (66 %) without difficulty. Another 33 % of the cases (21 out of 64) could be resolved using the number of exclusions, LOD scores or manual verification of genotyping errors. In one conceptus, paternity could not be established because its sire may have been either of two siblings. The gender of the female and male dogs was successfully confirmed using the amelogenin gene locus. The gender of the conceptuses was determined using the amelogenin gene locus (50 % male, 50 % female) but not confirmed by another method of gender determination such as karyotyping. As shown in the current study, the panel of 24 microsatellite markers used provides high information content suitable for parentage verification in multi-sire litters, as well as gender determination of early conceptuses.

40|$|DNA {{from three}} {{families}} of rice plants selected in Northern China (each comprising the male sterile, the restorer, the hybrid F 1 and the maintainer lines) has been extracted and amplified by PCR with different random DNA primers (RAPD analysis). Then, DNA has been analysed by {{agarose gel electrophoresis}} and DNA bands scored as present or absent. The generated matrices are reproducible and amenable for identification of each single plant line. Thus, RAPD fingerprinting of the inbred parental lines and of the resulting hybrid is proposed as a convenient tool for the identification, protection and <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> of plant hybrids.

40|$|Highly {{repeatable}} randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers {{were developed}} for parentage {{studies in the}} koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Of the 25 RAPD primers screened, 5 (20. 0 %) produced 32 repeatable polymorphic RAPD bands (average/primer = 6. 4 ± 4. 2). A high level of polymorphism was observed for each group of koalas (Featherdale, 71. 9 %; Lone Pine, 84. 4 %). All 25 koalas could be uniquely identified using either RAPD or microsatellite markers. Of the 32 RAPD markers generated in koalas, 25 were informative for parentage analyses. These RAPD markers successfully determined both parents to three offspring and a male parent to a fourth offspring. Paternity analysis (where the female parent is known) succeeded in assigning the correct male parent to seven offspring. Our RAPD-PCR method generates informative genetic markers that are useful for <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> and individual identification of captive koalas. This would provide genetic analysis to zoos and wildlife parks as a low-cost alternative to the more expensive microsatellite markers...|$|E

Therefore, this article aims to introduce some of the measured variables and the findings obtained to serve as relevant contributions to achieve a more appropriate legislation according with the medical and social reality. </span...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of microsatellite markers for <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> is gaining both acceptance and popularity in aquaculture. In {{this study we}} used simulations and controlled matings to examine the potential of microsatellite markers in assigning parentage to Kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus) progeny. Simulations based on allele frequency data from a captive population of P. japonicus demonstrated that at least five loci {{would be required to}} assign progeny to their correct maternal parent (with 95 % confidence) when drawn from a breeding population of 30 dams and 150 putative sires. Based on this information, nauplii from 22 matings where maternal parents were known were typed at six microsatellite loci and subjected to parentage analysis. Assignment success of progeny to their “true” mother was lower than predicted by the simulations, with only 47 % of progeny assigned correctly. Null alleles and allelic dropout resulting from poor quality DNA contributed to this disparity. The benefits of DNA parentage analysis as a tool to retain pedigree information in shrimp selective breeding programs are discussed...|$|E

In a panel of 344 individuals representing 11 pig breeds (European, Chinese, and North American), a total of 32 alleles were observed, and the overall breeds' calculated PIC (polymorphism information content), HE (heterozygosity), and NE (effective allele number) were 0. 94, 0. 94, and 16. 41. Breed-specific PIC and HE ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 87, whereas NE was as low as 2. 95 and as high as 7. 96.

40|$|The genetic {{components}} of trypanotolerance measurements must be determined in well controlled on going production systems where the necessary identification and/or quantification of environment and genetic effects are possible. A resource {{population has been}} established in the Mushie District Bandundu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, within a commercial ranch situated in one of the highest available tsetse/trypanosomosis challenge areas having cattle. Cattle are grade N'Dama selected from an original group imported into R. D. Congo 75 years ago. Breeding cows are maintained in multi-sire herds. Parentage (sire) determination in the experimental population is done through molecular genetic markers (micro-satellites). In order to evaluate the genetic diversity within the experimental population, 50 unrelated bulls were genotyped for 33 bovine microsatellites, mapping 19 chromosomes. It was concluded that the variability of and polymorphism of, the markers in the resource population is substantial and will allow accurate <b>parentage</b> <b>determination.</b> More importantly for the relevance of the research on the within-breed genetic variation of trypanotolerance measurements, it was concluded that the resource population was one of the purest N'Dama cattle population available for research, exposed to high level of natural trypanosomosis risk, as indicated by the likely absence of introgression of Zebu type genes...|$|E
40|$|In long–lived social mammals such as primates, {{individuals}} {{can benefit from}} social bonds with close kin, including their mothers. In the patrilocal chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes spp.) and bonobo (Pan paniscus), sexually mature males reside and reproduce in their natal groups and can retain post-dependency bonds with their mothers, while immatures of both sexes might also have their paternal grandmothers available. However, quantitative information on the proportion of males and immatures that co-reside with both types of these close female relatives is limited for both species. Combining genetic <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> and group composition data from five communities of wild chimpanzees and three communities of wild bonobos, we estimated the frequency of co-residence between (1) mature males and their mothers, and (2) immature males and females and their paternal grandmothers. We found that adult males resided twice as frequently with their mothers in bonobos than in chimpanzees, and that immature bonobos were {{three times more likely}} to possess a living paternal grandmother than were immature chimpanzees. Patterns of female and male survivorship from studbook records of captive individuals of both species suggest that mature bonobo females survive longer than their chimpanzee counterparts, possibly contributing to the differences observed in mother–son and grandmother–immature co-residency levels.

40|$|DNA-based <b>parentage</b> <b>determination</b> accelerates genetic {{improvement}} in sheep by increasing pedigree accuracy. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers {{can be used}} for determining parentage and to provide unique molecular identifiers for tracing sheep products to their source. However, the utility of a particular "parentage SNP" varies by breed depending on its minor allele frequency (MAF) and its sequence context. Our aims were to identify parentage SNPs with exceptional qualities for use in globally diverse breeds and to develop a subset for use in North American sheep. Starting with genotypes from 2, 915 sheep and 74 breed groups provided by the International Sheep Genomics Consortium (ISGC), we analyzed 47, 693 autosomal SNPs by multiple criteria and selected 163 with desirable properties for parentage testing. On average, each of the 163 SNPs was highly informative (MAF > 0. 3) in 4865 breed groups. Nearby polymorphisms that could otherwise confound genetic testing were identified by whole genome and Sanger sequencing of 166 sheep from 54 breed groups. A genetic test with 109 of the 163 parentage SNPs was developed for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- Time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The scoring rates and accuracies for these 109 SNPs were greater than 99 % in a panel of North American sheep. In a blinded set of 96 families (sire, dam, and non-identical twin lambs), each parent of every lamb was identified without using the other parent's genotype. In 74 ISGC breed groups, the median estimates for probability of a coincidental match between two animals (PI), and the fraction of potential adults excluded from parentage (PE) were 1. 1 10 (239) and 0. 999987, respectively, for the 109 SNPs combined.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} and characterization of genetic variability in grape germplasm {{is a key}} step for cvs. identification, <b>parentage</b> <b>determination,</b> and population structure evaluation for further genome wide association mapping studies. Robust genotyping requires {{a large number of}} polymorphic markers and the availability of databases allowing for comparisons with previously characterized genotypes. Up to now, simple sequence repeats (SSR) have been very useful not only for genetic identification but also for parentage analysis. However sequencing projects have generated such a quantity of sequence information to make possible the development of SNPs, bi-allelic markers, very frequent in the genomes, and with almost unlimited availability. Therefore, after the establishment of an international Consortium, a 20 K SNP Infinium array has been developed, starting from genomic sequences of 63 accessions of Vitis vinifera, 4 of V. sylvestris, 3 of V. labrusca, 3 of V. cinerea, 3 of V. berlandieri, 3 of V. aestivalis. A panel of SNP controls has been introduced in the array, going into details, 5488 SNPs segregating in V. vinifera, 1300 segregating in Vitis genus, 1200 species-specific, and 735 located in candidate genes have been selected. The results obtaneid from the joining of the genotyping data developed inside two Italian projects (Ager project and Vigneto project) are presented, with the final aim to build a new genetic tool based on a common panel of SNP markers, a large genotypes database of Italian accessions, and a bioinformatics pipeline for robust data analysis (Tumino et al. this conference). About 850 mainly Italian accessions were analyzed, representing more than 500 unique genotypes (including sativa and sylvestris genotypes, and also some no vinifera and no Vitis genotypes and clones {{of some of the most}} important varieties in Italy. The AGER group analyzed genotypes (415 accessions) cultivated in Piemonte, Emilia-Romagna, Toscana, Lazio, Basilicata, Puglia, Calabria and Sicilia regions, as well as non vinifera and non Vitis genotypes; the VIGNETO group analyzed vinifera genotypes (443) grown in the Grapevine National Collection in Conegliano (TV). DNA samples were extracted and prepared independently in 6 laboratories (some using a CTAB protocols and further column purification and some just column kits) and Infinium chip hybridization; genotype calling was performed by two providers using Illumina standard protocols.
