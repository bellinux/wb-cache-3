Whereas today’s devices store data according to applications, ideal <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> management <b>system</b> should treat all data as a set of meaningful objects and associations between the objects. To ensure extensibility, a <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> management <b>system</b> should automatically incorporate associations generated in multiple ways: mining specific personal data sources, or integrating with external data. As a first step in this direction, we describe the Semex system that provides a logical and integrated view of one’s <b>personal</b> <b>information.</b> ...|$|R

However, elderly people often have difficulties to use IT technology because they encounter restrictions caused by their age. Thus, they need specific and adaptable human computer interfaces to be able to interact with IT systems.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of information technology, data availability is improved greatly. Data may be accessed at anytime by people from any location. However,threats to data security and privacy arise {{as one of}} the major problems of the development of information systems, especially those information systems which contain personal information. An association database is a <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> which contains associations between persons. In this thesis, we identify the security and privacy problems of association databases. In order to solve these problems, we propose a new security and privacy model for association databases equipped with both direct access control and inference control mechanisms. In this model, there are multiple criteria including, not only confidentiality, but also privacy and other aspects of security to classify the association. The methods used in the system are: The direct access control method is based on the mandatory model; The inference control method is based on both logic reasoning and probabilistic reasoning (Belief Networks). My contributions to security and privacy model for association databases and to inference control in the model include: Identification of security and privacy problems in association databases; Formal definition of association database model; Representation association databases as directed multiple graphs; Development of axioms for direct access control; Specification of the unauthorized inference problem; A method for unauthorized inference detection and control that includes: Development of logic inference rules and probabilistic inference rule; Application of belief networks as a tool for unauthorized inference detection and control...|$|E
40|$|As {{today the}} amount of {{accessible}} information is overwhelming, the intelligent and personalized filtering of available information is a main challenge. Additionally, {{there is a growing}} need for the seamless mobile and multi-modal system usage throughout the whole day to meet the requirements of the modern society (“anytime, anywhere, anyhow”). A personal information agent that is delivering the right information at the right time by accessing, filtering and presenting information in a situationaware matter is needed. Applying Agent-technology is promising, because the inherent capabilities of agents like autonomy, proand reactiveness offer an adequate approach. We developed an agent-based <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> called PIA for collecting, filtering, and integrating information at a common point, offering access to the information by WWW, e-mail, SMS, MMS, and J 2 ME clients. Push and pull techniques are combined allowing the user to search explicitly for specific information {{on the one hand and}} to be informed automatically about relevant information divided in pre-, work and recreation slots on the other hand. In the core of the PIA system advanced filtering techniques are deployed through multiple filtering agent communities for content-based and collaborative filtering. Information-extracting agents are constantly gathering new relevant information from a variety of selected sources (internet, files, databases, web-services etc.). A personal agent for each user is managing the individual information provisioning, tailored to the needs of this specific user, knowing the profile, the current situation and learning from feedback...|$|E

The results show that these systems do {{have the potential to}} increase the use of public transportation by disabled travelers, as they allow for more trip flexibility that what is currently available.
