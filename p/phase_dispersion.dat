50|$|The AM radio {{problem of}} {{interference}} at night was {{addressed in a}} different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - {{by a factor of}} approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter; thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime. All FM broadcast transmissions are line-of-sight, and ionospheric bounce is not viable. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to <b>phase</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Propagation speeds (celerities) are fastest in the ionosphere at the lowest sideband frequency. The celerity difference between the highest and lowest sidebands is quite apparent to the listener. Such distortion occurs up to frequencies of approximately 50 MHz. Higher frequencies do not reflect from the ionosphere, nor from storm clouds. Moon reflections have been used in some experiments, but require impractical power levels.|$|E

When parameters from a diffusion pulse sequence without motion compensation were used, and ECG triggering with inappropriate delay times was assumed, the maximal signal loss caused by brain-motion-induced <b>phase</b> <b>dispersion</b> was predicted to be 21 %.
