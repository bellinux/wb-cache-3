25|$|Generally, {{a central}} bank or {{treasury}} is solely responsible within a state or currency union for the issue of banknotes. However, {{this is not always}} the case, and historically the paper currency of countries was often handled entirely by private banks. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given country. Commercial banks in the United States had legally issued banknotes before there was a national currency; however, these became subject to government authorization from 1863 to 1932. In the last of these series, the issuing bank would stamp its name and promise to pay, along with the signatures of its president and cashier on a <b>preprinted</b> note. By this time, the notes were standardized in appearance and not too different from Federal Reserve Notes.|$|E

2500|$|In the Netherlands, where {{autograph}} {{books are}} very popular among young schoolchildren, publishers have recently started bringing out an alternative {{in the so-called}} vriendenboek or vriendjesboek ("Friends book"), which much like the confession album come <b>preprinted</b> {{with a set of}} questions about the respondents' hobbies, idols and wishes. [...] Some children prefer the new format, which says more about the person answering, but most prefer the traditional autograph book, which leaves more room for their own creativity.

2500|$|In some jurisdictions, the <b>preprinted</b> {{prescription}} {{contains two}} signature lines: [...] one line has [...] "dispense as written" [...] printed underneath; the other line has [...] "substitution permitted" [...] underneath. [...] Some have a <b>preprinted</b> box [...] "dispense as written" [...] for the prescriber to check off (but this is easily checked off by anyone {{with access to}} the prescription). [...] Other jurisdictions the protocol is for the prescriber to handwrite one of the following phrases: [...] "dispense as written", [...] "DAW", [...] "brand necessary", [...] "do not substitute", [...] "no substitution", [...] "medically necessary", [...] "do not interchange". In other jurisdictions they may use completely different languages, never mind a different formula of words. [...] In some jurisdictions, it may be a legal requirement to include the age of child on the prescription.

2500|$|A diary [...] is {{a record}} (originally in {{handwritten}} format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened {{over the course of}} a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, and/or thoughts or feelings, including comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist.

2500|$|During the Civil War year of 1863, Aikens devised an idea {{improving}} upon {{an older}} English idea of preprinting multiple local editions of newspapers using common plates {{for most of}} the internal content. Aikens' idea was to print one side of a sheet with news and advertising and to provide these sheets at little or no cost to publishers of weekly newspapers, covering costs and generating profit from the advertising sold. Local publishers would be free to print {{on the other side of}} the page as they wished — thereby obtaining syndicated content without charge as well as free or very low cost newsprint. These <b>preprinted</b> sheets were commonly known as [...] "patent insides," [...] probably due to the preponderance of patent medicine advertising which they contained.|$|E

Early albums often had blank pages into which owners would paste the questionnaires; the questions on these could be <b>preprinted</b> or handwritten. One such album with handwritten questions, was that of Karl Marx's daughter Jenny, which contains entries dated from 1865 to 1870.

40|$|The time {{it takes}} for a {{completed}} manuscript to be published traditionally can be extremely lengthy. Article publication delay, which occurs in part due to constraints associated with peer review, can prevent the timely dissemination of critical and actionable data associated with new information on rare diseases or developing health concerns such as Zika virus. <b>Preprint</b> servers are open access online repositories housing <b>preprint</b> research articles that enable authors (1) to make their research immediately and freely available and (2) to receive commentary and peer review prior to journal submission.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{to which}} extent <b>preprints</b> in arXiv {{accelerate}} scholarly communication. The following subject fields were investigated {{up to the}} year 2012 : High Energy Physics (HEP), Mathematics, Astrophysics, Quantitative Biology, and Library and Information Science (LIS). Publication and citation data was downloaded from Scopus and matched with corresponding <b>preprints</b> in arXiv. Furthermore, the INSPIRE HEP database was used to retrieve citation data for papers related to HEP. The bibliometric analysis deals with the growth in numbers of articles published having a previous <b>preprint</b> in arXiv and the publication delay, which {{is defined as the}} chronological distance between the deposit of a <b>preprint</b> in arXiv and its formal journal publication. Likewise, the citation delay is analyzed, which describes the time it takes until the first citation of <b>preprints,</b> and articles, respectively. Total citation numbers are compared for sets of articles with a previous <b>preprint</b> and those without.

2500|$|Postal {{cards and}} postcards are small message cards which are sent by mail unenveloped; the {{distinction}} often, though not invariably and reliably, drawn {{between them is}} that [...] "postal cards" [...] are issued by the postal authority or entity with the [...] "postal indicia" [...] (or [...] "stamp") <b>preprinted</b> on them, while postcards are privately issued and require affixing an adhesive stamp (though {{there have been some}} cases of a postal authority's issuing non-stamped postcards). Postcards are often printed to promote tourism, with pictures of resorts, tourist attractions or humorous messages on the front and allowing for a short message from the sender to be written on the back. The postage required for postcards is generally less than postage required for standard letters; however, certain technicalities such as their being oversized or having cut-outs, may result in payment of the first-class rate being required.|$|E

Their {{association}} lasted until 1884, {{and the firm}} became the largest land speculator in California. When territories become states, the federal government turns over large amounts of federal land to the state.

The California State Land [...] Office was weak and understaffed, however, and Mullan & Hyde soon colluded with the clerks in the land office to steal land. Mullan and his staff were able to view and even remove copybooks, certificates of purchase, and other official documents to which the general public had no access. Mullan & Hyde did so much volume with the land office that the office purchaed <b>preprinted</b> envelopes with the firm's name on them.

Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on <b>preprinted</b> prescription forms that have been assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on plain paper according to the circumstance. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted from the physician to the pharmacist orally by telephone; this practice may {{increase the risk of}} medical error. The content of a prescription includes the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. DEA Number in the United States). [...] Unique for each prescription {{is the name of the}} patient. [...] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.|$|E
