25|$|F-15G Wild Weasel was a {{proposed}} two-seat version {{to replace the}} F-4G Wild Weasel in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role. The F-15G was studied in 1986. A <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> to F-15Cs for the SEAD role was studied in 1994–95, but F-16Cs were modified to perform this role instead. F-15Es are capable of carrying ARMs such as the AGM-88 HARM and performing the SEAD role.|$|E

Alternative powerplants for the OH-1 have also been suggested, such as the LHTEC T800 and the MTR MTR390. In late 2008, Kawasaki was considered implementing a series of improvements aimed at increasing the payload of OH-1; this <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> was dependent upon demand from the Japanese defense ministry.|$|E

25|$|Some {{modifications}} to STV {{have been proposed}} in order to pass monotonicity and other criteria. The most common method of <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> to STV is to alter {{the order in which}} candidates are eliminated: theoretically, a candidate who ranked second on every ballot could be the first candidate eliminated even if he is a Condorcet winner. Meek noted this problem in proposing his variation of transferring votes to nearly eliminate tactical voting in STV, however Meek himself did not propose a method for satisfying the Condorcet criterion. Other theorists have proposed further refinements of STV, such as using a Condorcet method to rank candidates for elimination order. Some of these modifications alter STV in a way such that it no longer reduces to instant-runoff voting when applied to a single seat but instead reduces to some other single winner system, such as a Condorcet method.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1946, the XB-35 {{made its}} first flight, a 45-minute trip from Hawthorne, California, to Muroc Dry Lake, without incident. The XB-35's engines and {{propellers}} were AAF property, and had not been tested for engine-propeller compatibility by either Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Standard, or by the AAF which bought them at Wright Field without testing them or assuring reliability, and then shipped them to Northrop. Microfilmed records of reports and correspondence of the XB-35 program relate that after three or four flights, power plant and propeller vibrations increased, and the very efficient contra-rotating propellers began failing with frustrating frequency. Meetings were called by Northrop, of the AAF, Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard where no one would take responsibility for correcting the AAF's engines and propellers. In addition, the AAF failed to supply the AC electrical alternator, insisting on Northrop using an onboard auxiliary power unit (APU) unit driven by an automotive engine which limited the high-altitude, high-speed XB-35 to test flights below [...] The AAF also refused to allow Northrop <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> of the bomb bays to carry the standard Mk. 3 atomic bomb, {{while at the same}} time declaring the AF would not buy the bomber unless it could carry the A-bomb. Northrop reluctantly agreed to try a single-rotation propeller, which slightly increased takeoff distance and a reduced rate-of-climb and maximum speed.|$|E
