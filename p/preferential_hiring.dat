This paper uses the highly unusual event as a natural experiment, and examines whether graduates from the elite Tokyo university receive a <b>preferential</b> treatment in <b>hiring</b> and promotion in the high civil service. As a result of the 1969 incident, the entering class in the high civil service four years later in 1973 included a significantly lower proportion of graduates from the University of Tokyo, the traditionally predominant provider of elite bureaucrats, than in usual years. Comparing the career paths of the entering class of 1973 with those of adjacent cohorts, we do find some evidence that where one went to school may matter in the hiring stage, but no significant evidence for a similar favoritism in promotion in later stages. human capital, credentialism, college education, natural experiment...|$|R

50|$|During market-oriented reforms, {{there was}} {{widespread}} evidence of employment {{discrimination in the}} hiring process. Gender discrimination during recruitment {{can be divided into}} two main categories: explicit and hidden gender discrimination. Explicit gender discrimination refers to directly stated restrictions on women in the recruitment process. Hidden gender discrimination occurs primarily through <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> of men. Generally, there are three kinds of gender discrimination in the process of hiring in contemporary China. First, gender restrictions on career and posts creates an environment where women are generally only welcomed into certain career roles that match traditional gender roles for women—mainly domestic, secretarial, or factory work. Second, gender discrimination in recruitment often affects women of reproductive age who are frequently discriminated against in hiring due to potential future loss of productivity resulting from pregnancy. Third, age discrimination affects many women, especially those working in the service industry where youth is a key component of success in the workplace. In this sector, women under the age of 30 are frequently denied jobs. Female job-seekers over the age of 40 in most industries particularly struggle with age discrimination, despite no longer being of child-bearing age. The age limit for men is more relaxed, usually under 40 or 45 years of age. While there are laws in place to prevent such practices, there are few enforcement mechanisms to ensure the laws are followed. As a result, recruitment in China's national civil units and national government departments as well as state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises frequently fail to comply with these national equality employment laws.|$|E

In letter written by Rogers to Vancouver Mayor David Oppenheimer and the city council, dated January 27, 1890, Rogers proposes to build a sugar refinery “constructed of brick in the most substantial manner” in just eight months. Rogers requested from the city council a grant of $40,000 and rights to water for 15 years, at no charge. The council agreed all of Rogers’ requests, including the payment of $15,525 for the site of the refinery, but they offered him a grant of only $30,000. Also stipulated in the agreement was the requirement by the city that Rogers not hire any Chinese workers. Since the Asian workers were paid less than the white workers, the city believed businesses would show <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> to the Chinese, thus defeating some of the purpose of bringing the business into the city. A hidden poster uncovered from within the walls of the building, dating to 1895 stated [...] "Chinese Industry, Coolie Labor or Home Industry, White Labour," [...] it read. [...] "Use only sugars refined in our own country." [...] The illustration on the poster was of a Chinese worker lifting sugar for 10 cents a day, and a white worker pushing a wheelbarrow hauling barrels of sugar labeled BC Sugar working for two dollars per day. Rogers agreed not to hire Chinese labor. Raw sugar was imported over sea from Australia, Asia and Central America.|$|E

40|$|Using a two-country {{macroeconomic}} {{model of}} labor migration, we investigate {{the effects of}} minimum wages on the inflow of unskilled foreign workers under the firm's <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> of unskilled native workers. We assume that both countries' workers are unskilled, and each country has a single labor market where unskilled labor is traded. We also assume that workers move from a country of lower expected real-consumption wages (nominal wages divided by {{the consumer price index}} and multiplied by the probability of employment) to a country of higher wages. We show that the home country faced with the inflow of unskilled foreign workers can reduce it by raising its minimum wages without making unskilled native worker employment smaller. Increases in minimum wages lead to the lower employment probability of immigrant foreign workers, making their expected real-consumption wages at the home country relatively lower to those in the foreign country. We also show that the sum of unskilled native worker real-consumption wages is likely to increase with increases in minimum wages. This results from the fact that unskilled native workers are fully employed as long as increases in minimum wages are limited. Our results suggest that under the realistic assumption of the firm's <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> of unskilled native workers, minimum wages not only reduce the inflow of unskilled foreign workers, but also improve the welfare of unskilled native workers...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. South Africa is {{experiencing}} a process of formidable and fundamental change. Public administrators as well as politicians are under tremendous pressure as heavy demands are being placed on them. These demands include coping with interventions such as Affirmative Action, Employment Equity, {{and the importance of}} managing diversity in the workplace. Despite improvements in race relations in the past twenty years, dysfunctional and ineffective behaviour still occur. This may be a reflection of the discomfort and anxiety experienced by employees in the work setting. In order to comply with legislation, organisations created opportunities for Black, Asian and Coloured males and females, White females and disabled people. This, in return, leads to perceptions of <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring.</b> The view that Affirmative Action involves <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> and treatment based on group membership creates resistance to its implementation and original purpose. The reason for this resistance might be linked to the fact that people still perceive discrimination and injustice in the workplace. These perceptions seem true in public organisations even though public organisations have taken a positive stance with regard to implementing Equal Employment and Affirmative Action plans. A qualitative design with an availability sample (N = 20) of employees working in a public organisation was used. The qualitative research makes it possible to determine the subjective experience of employees in a public organisation. Semi-structured interviews based on the phenomenological method were conducted with employees working in different sections and different positions in a public organisation. Non-directive questions were asked during the interview. The tape-recording of the interview was transcribed verbatim in order to analyse the information. Content analysis was used to analyse and interpret the research data in a systematic, objective and quantitative way. A literature-control has been done to investigate relevant research {{in order to determine the}} comparativeness and uniqueness of the current research. Results indicated that Affirmative Action has been used as a tool in achieving its goal by focusing on <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring.</b> From the responses it was clear that the majority of the participants are of opinion that <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> led to the appointment of incompetent candidates. It appears from the interviews that appointments are made without basing it on merit. This is against the basic principle of the public organisation of hiring and promoting employees by set standards. Due to the fact that previous disadvantaged groups are being placed in positions of which they have no experience or are not trained in, job related knowledge seems to present a problem. From the interviews it appeared that employees felt that poor customer service increased across the organisation due to the appointment of incompetent candidates. This also seems to have an effect on the workload being handled. It seems that predominantly white employees tend to be ambivalent towards Affirmative Action. Part of the reason for this ambivalence is the fear of change, especially when that change involves a radical re-thinking of past strategies. White employees, employed by the old apartheid system, feel alienated and/or marginalised in the new Affirmative Action process. White employees are also leaving organisations because they seem not to be part of the Affirmative Action process. This leads to loss of expertise occurring in organisations. Though organisations show a considerable amount of improvement on relationships between black and white, discrimination still seems to present itself through the implementation of Affirmative Action. Managing diversity is crucial for the effective management and development of people. It is important not to focus only on cultural differences but also concentrate on individual needs and perceptions. Unfortunately, it appears that South Africa is in the process of making the same mistakes as other countries in focusing on a power game and corruption. Black employees in particular, seem to be actively recruited, placed in senior positions and given the related finishing. In other words top management are using their 'power' to enforce Affirmative Action. There are also those who want to abuse the system or maybe understand the system incorrectly. Corruption coming from top management tends to make employees negative. In order to address these issues, a succession and career planning process needs to exist which is closely tied to the organisations' strategic plan. Employment Equity, as a strategic objective, is managed by the organisation, but needs the Human Resources function in a support and consultancy role. As such, it requires translation into practical objectives for departments, managers and employees. Recommendations were made for future research. Master...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} an ethical principle, informed by sub-Saharan values, and applies it to how a state should allocate resources to its citizens.

40|$|The {{practice}} {{of affirmative action}} has recently been at the vanguard of intense debate {{more than any other}} time in its forty-year history. A growing number of programs including quotas, <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring,</b> minority scholarships, diversity, and reverse discrimination have all been linked to affirmative action, which aims to break down the wall of segregation that excluded racial minorities and women from the workplace and in education. Two class-action lawsuits, Gratz v. Bollinger [02 - 516] and Gnttter v. Bollinger [02 - 241], filed in response to white students being denied admission to the University of Michigan 2 ̆ 7 s undergraduate and law school program, provided the United States Supreme Court with its best opportunity in recent years to focus on the constitutionality of adopting such admissions policies. Affirmative action policies are inconsistent with the principle of merit (the idea of attaining what you earn) and they penalize an innocent person for the alleged crimes of his or her ancestors, effectively known as reverse discrimination. Furthermore, affirmative action unfairly rewards minorities on the erroneous notion that a minority status automatically equates 2 ̆ 2 disadvantage. 2 ̆ 2 In conclusion, an additional perspective for the case against implementing affirmative action policy within the workplace and in higher education will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experimental}} studies {{were conducted to}} measure the effects of contextual and situational factors on employees’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward female managers in traditionally male-oriented jobs. Study 1 manipulated the contexts (gender rarity and diversity justification) of female through the mediating effect of social identity, while Study 2 manipulated the contexts (gender rarity and performance) of female and male targets. Results for Study 1 indicate that: (a) rare female perceivers {{are more likely to}} perceive female managers as being dominant (a stereotypically male trait) and adopt these traits, (b) rare female perceivers {{are also more likely to}} believe that they have to try harder to prove themselves in the organization, and (c) female perceivers in companies with legal compliance diversity justification are less likely to encourage prospective females to join the company. Results for Study 2 indicate that companies with female targets in positions of gender equality were assumed to have affirmative action hiring policies more often than companies with female targets in positions of gender rarity – this provides evidence for future research about the types of organizations in which rarity evokes assumptions of <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring.</b> Overall, these studies contribute to the debate over the use of affirmative action policies by providing insight into the unintended consequences of their implementation. Results indicate that increasing female representation in male-typical professions is not enough to counter negative perceptions and behaviors toward traditionally underrepresented minorities – equal gender representation must be coupled with a culture that believes that diversity is intrinsically advantageous, in order to mitigate some of the effects of implicit sex-based discrimination in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{exploits}} a new {{and exciting}} source of data on public employment recruitment in order to analyse the evolution of Tibetan representation and <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> practices in public employment in all Tibetan areas from 2007 to 2015. Despite the limitations of these data, they provide a far more substantiated understanding of recent conditions than currently exists in the literature, even in the Chinese literature. Several major insights {{can be made from}} scrutinizing these data. First, following the retrenchment in public employment in the early 2000 s and then the ending of the job placement system (Ch. fenpei), there was a strong increase in public employment recruitment from 2011 onwards. Second, Tibetan representation within the recruitment did not collapse, although it lagged significantly; within our sample of outcome documents, Tibetans were underrepresented in the recruitments across all Tibetan areas from 2007 to 2015, without any apparent regional or temporal patterns, at an average of 83 percent of what would be parity with their population share. More information is also needed on the ethnic composition of people exiting from public employment {{in order to have a}} more holistic evaluation of the evolution of Tibetan representation. Nonetheless, despite underrepresentation, new recruitment from 2011 onwards employed a much larger share of the university-aged population than during the late fenpei period, thereby reasserting the role of the state as predominant employment provider for educated Tibetan millennials. Practices of preferentiality appear to significantly bolster representation, although they exhibited distinct temporal and regional variations. Language or Tibetan medium degree type requirements were generally on the decline (especially in the TAR and Gannan, where their use became very marginal), with the exception of the Amdo region in Qinghai. Conversely, the use of residency requirements across all Tibetan regions has emerged as a significant form of practicing preferentiality in public employment, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), where all public sector recruitments specify local ‘origin’ (Ch. shengyuan) since at least 2007. The TAR also reintroduced employment guarantees for all local university graduates in 2011, in what we call the innovation of a neo-fenpei system. The decline in the use of linguistic requirements suggests the continuation and entrenchment of assimilationist trends in education and employment policies, and a lack of priority for Tibetan medium education more generally (with the exception of the Amdo region in Qinghai).

Renewed racial classifications to eliminate the legacy of past racism seem to contradict the official state ideology of colour-blind nonracialism. Resentment among some whites on whose skills and loyalty a growing economy also relies, makes affirmative action a most divisive issue. Unlike most other countries in which minorities are targeted, in South Africa a previously disenfranchised majority is the beneficiary of preferential labour policies. Quite distinct from North American quotas for minorities, South African unions aim at transforming the workplace of the undertrained majority, which contrasts with business visions characterised by black advancement in management and ethnic diversity on company boards. However, even this initial window-dressing exercise for political expediency encounters resistance among a colonial establishment that still equates promotion of the previously disadvantaged with lowering standards. The changing discourse about affirmative action is probed through written surveys among two hundred business executives, focus groups, more in-depth personal interviews, and participant observation at selected companies in South Africa between 1992 - 97. An increased readiness to broaden the recruitment pool emerged among white male executives and would seem to have been triggered by the changed political power relations. This "anticipatory compliance" to potential legislation is justified with different motivations but is still driven by economic considerations rather than moral concerns about past neglect. Keeping up with the "black image" of competitors in securing government contracts or penetrating a township market with higher purchasing power spurs even traditionally conservative firms to vie for black managers. They are poached and head-hunted with generous inducements, at the expense of training the broader spectrum of black workers at a lower level. The unique current South African debate about redress is compared with its historical precedents of Afrikaner job reservation and "civilized labour policies", as well as the international experience with <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> in the US, Canada, India and Malaysia. The recent backlash against affirmative action in the US, together with the assertion of counter-productive effects on beneficiaries, is evaluated against the South African case. The literature is divided as to what extent recipients of affirmative action experience self-doubt and low self-esteem. The label "affirmative action beneficiary" is said to stigmatize minorities not considered as having achieved status on merit. However, the vast majority of recipients of affirmative action probed in this research did not consider themselves passive recipients of company largesse, but instead perceived themselves as having rightly earned their place in the accelerated business training program. Far from victimising themselves by claiming compensatory preferential treatment, the respondents in this sample of black management students proudly insist on their past individual achievements as entitlement to their career. This finding contradicts the conventional wisdom among critics, that appointees on merit differ from affirmative action appointees in their approach to work. While a new rapidly growing black elite who least needs affirmative action, nonetheless benefits most from racial preference policies in senior management, the majority of impoverished and unemployed are not affected by these policies at all. To avoid the danger of racialised competition, a policy of non-racial, class-based affirmative action is suggested as the most feasible way to facilitate reconciliation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{low number}} of women in the hard {{sciences}} has been a long standing concern in universities. Concerns regarding women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in particular have recently come into the limelight in lieu of the fact that women are catching up to (or have exceeded!) men in many other fields, yet the {{number of women in}} these fields remains significantly lower than the number of men. Previous research has shown that it is women who want to balance family and research in particular who struggle to deal with the clash between the biological and tenure clocks, and end up choosing one or the other. Our work in this paper is built on the premise that structural changes at the university level will provide these women with policies that enable them to balance both family and work. Many other researchers in this field have suggested policies that could be implemented to help women. The aim of our research was to get university administrators to evaluate these policies to see which ones are actually good policies that can be implemented to help women succeed at both work and family life. To do this, we surveyed university administrators on their attitudes towards policies that could help women succeed in STEM fields. Using previous research, we compiled a list of policies that have been suggested to help women succeed in the sciences. This list was sent out by email to a total of 1529 provosts, deans, associate deans and department chairs of STEM fields in 96 research-oriented universities. These university administrators were asked for 2 responses to each policy - a rating of its quality and a rating of its feasibility. Our survey received 474 replies, of which 334 contained data which was used in the analysis. For the analysis done in this paper, publicly available information was gathered on each respondent's gender, title, and university type (public or private). After de-identifying the data to protect the confidentiality of the respondents, the data was analyzed to look for differences in the responses based on gender, title and university type. The analysis found that the evaluation of quality and feasibility of some policies depended heavily on the gender of the respondents, while the title of the respondent did not significantly affect most quality or feasibility ratings. University type was significant for policies that involved funding and the <b>preferential</b> <b>hiring</b> of women. However, {{when it came to the}} best overall policies, none of these factors were particularly significant. Thus we conclude that the best policies are considered to have high quality and feasibility regardless of gender, title or university type of the respondent. These best policies include providing equal opportunities for women and men to lead committees and research groups, developing mentoring programs to reduce isolation of female faculty, and providing on-campus childcare centers. This conclusion makes it easy for administrators who read this report to consider implementing these best policies without being overly concerned about how the gender, title or university type of the respondents influenced the results. The hope is that administrators across all research-oriented universities will use this report as a basis for implementing or altering policies to help women in STEM-fields better balance their work and family lives. Having the assurance that these best policies are backed up by the opinions of other administrators in similar positions will hopefully give administrators the reassurance necessary to implement new policies and bridge the STEM fields' gender gap. ii 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|E
