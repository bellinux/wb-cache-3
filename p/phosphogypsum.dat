50|$|Sinkholes can be {{classified}} {{on the basis of}} the processes by which they are formed: dissolution, cover-subsidence, and cover-collapse. Formation of sinkholes can be accelerated by intense withdrawals of groundwater over short periods of time, such as those caused by pumping for frost-protection of winter crops in west-central Florida. Sinkholes that developed beneath gypsum stacks in 1994 and 2016 caused a loss of millions of gallons mineralized water containing <b>phosphogypsum</b> and phosphoric acid, by-products of the production of fertilizer from phosphate rock. These sinkholes were likely formed from the collapse of preexisting dissolution cavities in the limestone beneath the stacks. Lake Jackson near Tallahassee, FL occasionally drains into a sinkhole in the bottom of the lake bed when water levels in the aquifer drop.

40|$|Abstract: Particle coating is {{becoming}} increasingly important in fertilizer, pharmaceutical and food industries. The demand for coating granular fertilizers with minerals is increasing. Urea is coated with <b>PhosphoGypsum,</b> neem oil, polymeric suspensions and micronutrients like sulfer, zinc etc. Coating of <b>PhosphoGypsum</b> on urea fertilizer is a important application of coating process. Coating of urea particles is done to increase nitrogen use efficiency of urea. Nitrogen losses due to leaching, surface volatilization, and denitrification can be minimized by controlling the dissolution rate. Coating also helps to impart strength, increase in bulk density and lowering of caking tendency, thus improving the handling properties. The objective of present paper is to present the improvement in properties of urea obtained by fluidized bed coating of urea with <b>Phosphogypsum</b> using wet and dry methods. Emulsion of <b>PhosphoGypsum,</b> Neem (Azadirachta indica L.) oil, LAB (Linear Alkyl Benzene) and water was prepared in concentrations of 5 %, 10 % and 15 %.

Most of these byproducts may present little if any hazard in agriculture. Parr et al. (1983) and U. S.
