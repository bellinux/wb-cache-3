To raise efficiency, the principal might solicit information; to retain all surplus, however, she must prevent <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> gathering. The following class of stochastic contracts may solve this trade-off optimally: before signing, information acquisition is not solicited, and afterwards randomly. The key insight is that randomization makes <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> costlier for the agent. Information acquisition, Principal-agent, Mechanism design, Randomization...|$|E

40|$|Licensing {{contracts}} for newly patented innovations are observed to vary along several dimensions, including {{the form and}} size of the payment to the inventor (fixed fee versus some output-based royalty), the degree of exclusivity, and the division of rents. In this article, we show that the form of the contract can be explained by two problems in technology exchange: the superiority of a licensor's <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> about the economic value of the innovation and the fact that sharing this information with the licensee may facilitate imitation. We show that a licensor signals her technology type with an output-based payment (or royalty) and may leave some of the rents with the licensee. Conditions under which exclusive license contracts (linear and nonlinear) and nonexclusive linear contracts are used to transfer technology are identified. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of information gathering in insurance and credit markets. In our set-up, information may have either operational or strategic value, e. g. it may improve allocative decisions or allow agents to appropriate {{a larger share of}} gains from trade at the contracting stage. The timing of information gathering is endogenous and agents can gather information either before or after contracting. Access to <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> generates a negative contracting externality, which was first identified in Hirshleifer. s (1971) seminal contribution. In contrast with a well established conventional wisdom and a substantial literature, we prove that, if the operational value of information is positive and not "too small", private returns of information fall short of its social returns, and pre-contractual access to information leads to under-investment. On the contrary, agents over-invest in information gathering activities, when the operational value of the available signals is sufficiently low. Consistently with contractual arrangements observed in the real world, we also show that equilibrium contracts have also a very simple shape when private information can be voluntarily disclosed. private information, information gathering, value of information...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. Efforts by the European Commission to {{harmonise}} mortgage credit {{date back to}} the 1980 s. In the past, they invariably produced the same result: exclusion from or special treatment of mortgages within central financial sector directives, on the grounds that these were traditional business processes and funding instruments hinging upon national legal setups. The internal European market was deemed irrelevant. The White Paper on the Integration of EU Mortgage Credit Markets of December 2007 rejects this protectionist line of argument for good reasons, but it pays its dues to the entrenched opposition by pursuing legal and regulatory reforms only in selective areas of early repayment, responsible lending, APRC and <b>precontractual</b> <b>information.</b> Other issues are left to recommendations and a new round of research and stakeholder discussions. Since the paper’s formulation last fall, the proliferation of unsound practices in the mortgage sector has culminated in a crisis directly affecting Europe, with the consequence that the legal-regulatory discussion has already moved beyond integration to questions of stability and sustainable sector development. A limited approach like the one adopted in the White Paper cannot begin to address those challenges, nor is it likely to have any greater chance at political success than a more comprehensive one. The current financial crisis offers an important opportunity to introduce reform. The odds are considerable, however, that that opportunity will be lost in the search for consensus down to the very last stakeholder...|$|E
40|$|The 2008 {{proposal}} for a Directive on Consumer Rights (hereinafter: the Draft) aims at reorganizing the acquis of four specific European directives on consumer protection into a more coherent codification of consumer rights. Specifically, it contains rules on <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> duties, on withdrawal rights for distance and off-premises contracts, on consumer sales and on general contract terms in consumer contracts. In replacing the four directives with a minimum harmonization character, the Draft marks a further step towards full harmonization of consumer contract law in Europe. This is an unsettling step because the level of protection offered to consumers in the Draft hardly exceeds the level of protection offered by the four directives mentioned earlier. Instead, it diminishes this protection in some regards. In light of all this, the question arises whether the policy choices underlying the Draft are, in fact, convincingly underpinned by solid argumentation. This article addresses this issue by first analyzing the Draft's use of the generic concept of “contracts between consumers and traders”. It is argued that full harmonization of a badly delineated territory is ill-advised. Subsequently, the argumentative power of the policy considerations forwarded by the European Commission in its Regulatory Assessment Study is tested. The article concludes that the Commission’s assessment of expected {{costs and benefits of}} the Draft is waver-thin and geared towards persuading the reader of the aptness of choices already made. In some respects, the evidence presented by the Commission is outright unconvincing. At certain points, the Draft even fuels the reader’s suspicion of foregone conclusions. Overall, the need for reduction of the level of protection offered by the current minimum harmonization directives is poorly argued by the Commission and appears, in a number of important ways, not to reflect the socio-economic relationships that exist in {{at least some of the}} Member States...|$|E
40|$|Transparency in {{insurance}} law {{attaches to the}} rights and duties of the parties, the relationships between insurers, insurance intermediaries such as agents and brokers, insurance supervisory law and insurance dispute resolution procedures. Regarding the rights and duties of the insurer and the prospective policyholder, it requires insurers to disclose <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> {{in a timely manner}} that is clear, understandable, legible and unambiguous. Transparency as a value is incredibly important {{in insurance}} contracts. This contribution focuses exclusively on the insurer's duty of disclosure during precontractual negotiations. Although the insured's duty of disclosure has enjoyed more attention in the past, the duty clearly applies to the insurance proposer as well as the insurer. The purpose of this contribution is to evaluate {{the nature and extent of}} the insurer's transparency duties as informed by both common and statutory laws. The insurer's duty is derived primarily from the statutory rights of access to information in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the Promotion of Access to Information Act. It is furthermore supported by specific insurance consumer protection law found in the detailed provisions on mandatory disclosures in the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, the Long-term Insurance Act, the Short-term Insurance Act and, finally, the Policyholder Protection Rules issued in accordance with these acts. Strict rules on advertising can be found in the General Code of Conduct issued under the FAIS Act. The Act furthermore specifically targets the activities of insurance intermediaries in precontractual disclosures. The fact that insurance products and services have been exempted from the scope of the Consumer Protection Act from 28 February 2014 should not diminish the insured's right to rely on universal consumer protection principles as envisaged by South African insurance legislation. The insurer's duty to disclose is in the last instance also derived from the common law duty not to make misrepresentations by commission or omission. When negotiating an insurance contract, the insurer's duty to speak is not based on a general requirement of bona fides, but is recognised as an ex lege duty due to the involuntary reliance of the prospective insured on information supplied by insurers in the market. A lack of transparency should lead to the insurer's accountability. A failure to disclose material information or a disclosure of false information that goes to the root of the matter and that induces the prospective policyholder to buy the insurance product is recognised as an actionable misrepresentation. Statutory provisions do not diminish the common-law duty not to make misrepresentations, but provide details of the nature and extent of the information duty to provide clarity and legal certainty in the determination of the standards of transparency required in law. In addition, statutes provide for enforcement actions by regulators, orders that could affect the licence of the insurer and provide for punishable offences and penalties. In terms of common law, a misrepresentation by omission or commission renders the insurance contract wholly or in part voidable. The policyholder may decide to rescind the contract and claim restitution. He may also, in conjunction with rescission, or as an alternative when deciding to maintain the contract, claim delictual damages or even constitutional damages when judged by a court of law as appropriate relief. Statutory remedies include a monetary award by the Insurance Ombud. Even though such an award is capped at R 800 000, it is submitted that it is preferred to a civil law damages claim. ...|$|E
40|$|Less ambitious {{than the}} {{original}} proposals, the Consumer Rights Directive 2011 / 83 focuses on the area of information duties {{and the right of}} withdrawal in B 2 C contracts. This article analyses the new rules providing information obligations, and highlights some of the unresolved questions particularly concerning the level of consumer protection, and the remedies for the breach of those obligations. An extensive catalogue of information is now to be given in distance and off-premises contracts; and – according to the existing rules within the Directives on Timeshare Contracts and Package Travel - this catalogue forms {{an integral part of the}} contract. According to the Author’s opinion, the option for a detailed provision of the elements that must be disclosed to the consumers, on the one hand, combined with the imposition of formal requirements to be fulfilled in providing informations, demonstrate how the Directive keeps on enhancing the “standardization” of the B 2 C contractual relationship instead of trying to introduce a more personalized information. Information duties are now to be fulfilled by the trader also in a contract other than a distance or an off-premises one, even if, due to many exceptions, the spectrum of “other” contracts to which this obligation applies is much narrower than at first glance. However, in contrast to the information requirements in distance and off-premises contracts, the Directive does not stipulate that there is a reversal of the burden of proof in “other” contracts; the catalogue of information to be given doesn’t form, in this case, an integral part of the contract. The Author stresses how the Directive, while going on in implementing the range of information duties, has not chosen – unlike the Proposal - to opt for a more systematic approach. No single rule tells the consumer what remedies can be used to enforce the failing of the information duties by the professional, so that the Directive fails the attempt to bring coherency to existing rules and particularly misses its chance to harmonize the remedies in European contract law for breaches of duties of disclosure. Once again, it’s to the Member States to provide “effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties”, but, due to the principle of full harmonization, the level of consumer protection could hardly be increased by domestic rules: The main limit of the Directive – under Author’s opinion – is that the European legislator seems to consider in the same way <b>precontractual</b> <b>information</b> duties and those informations that, according to the foreseen provisions, has become content of the contract, and can’t therefore be assumed as “precontractual”, better concerning the formation of a valid contract. The current review of the acquis should have included the strengthening of the available remedies and, as some scholars suggest, should have explored, in the case, the proximity between failure of disclosure and the defect of consent itself. The Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis, on the other hand, suggested that “”there would be different remedies for breaching different groups of information obligations” On the contrary, the Directive replicates the acquis approach and the option now adopted in the DFCR as well as in the Proposal for a Common European Sales Law : the breach of information obligations seems to be considered only in the framework of pre-contractual liability, as demonstrate both the insertion on the general good faith principle and the provision of a right of damages for the consumers. The conclusion of the paper is that the Directive fits very well into a scenario which could lead to reduce the role played by consumer law as lex specialis which should derogate to general contract law...|$|E
