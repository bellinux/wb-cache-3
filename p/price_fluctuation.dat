25|$|The {{two forms}} of colonial-era produce {{marketing}} boards had different aims. Some, as in the Rhodesias, supported white commercial farmers; others as in Nyasaland and Tanganyika controlled African smallholders and restricted competition {{between them and the}} settlers. The declared objectives of Nyasaland’s colonial legislation on the production, control and marketing of economic crops were to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the crops, and to stabilise the income of farmers through periods of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> Restrictions were imposed on the number of growers and their output to improve produce quality and to match production to demand. This was done by registering growers, fixing producer prices, licensing buyers and exporters and establishing commodity boards, which often had exclusive responsibility for crop production and marketing. For most of the colonial period, statutory interference in the production and marketing of the crops grown on European-owned estate was kept to a minimum. Controls for their tea and tobacco were introduced at the request, or with the consent, of the settler associations responsible for these crops. The use of marketing controls allowed the Nyasaland government to increase its revenues. By offering smallholders prices that were lower than the world market prices, the colonial state indirectly taxed the smallholders, extracting a significant part of their profits. Market regulations were extended to food crops after the Second World War and, by the mid-1950s, marketing boards controlled the trade of most African smallholder produce.|$|E

We find that the <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> for commodities have a significantly broader multifractal spectrum than for stocks. We also propose that multifractal properties of both stocks and commodities can be attributed mainly to the broad probability distribution of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and secondarily to their temporal organization. Furthermore, we propose that, for commodities, stronger higher order correlations in <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> result in broader multifractal spectra. ...|$|R

500|$|In 1930, Columbus Marion Joiner, a self-educated prospector, {{discovered}} the East Texas Oil Field, the largest oil discovery {{that had ever}} been made. Because East Texas had not been significantly explored for oil before then, numerous independent prospectors, known as [...] "wildcatters", were able to purchase tracts of land to exploit the new field. This new oil field helped to revive Dallas's economy during the Great Depression, but sharply decreased interest in West Texas as the new supply led to another major drop in oil prices. The uncontrolled production in the eastern field destabilized the state's oil industry, which {{had been trying to}} control production levels to stabilize prices. Overproduction in East Texas was so great that then-governor Ross Sterling attempted to shut down many of the wells. During one of the forced closures, he ordered the Texas National Guard to enforce the shutdown. These efforts at controlling production, intended to protect both the independent operators and the major producers, were largely unsuccessful at first and led to widespread oil smuggling. In the later 1930s, the federal government intervened and brought production to sustainable levels, leading to a stabilization of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> The income provided by the stabilization allowed less populated West Texas and the Panhandle to be more fully explored and exploited.|$|E

2500|$|Bond markets, unlike {{stock or}} share markets, {{sometimes}} {{do not have}} a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, market liquidity is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the counterparty to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond [...] "in inventory", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on livelihood strategies in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) communities compared with other non-financial shocks and makes recommendations for minimising the vulnerability of ASM communities to <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> It is argued {{that the impact of}} <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on the livelihood strategies of small-scale miners depends on a number of factors including the nature and scale of engagement in ASM, the livelihood context and existence of alternative income generating opportunities, the nature of the market and influence of intermediaries on price, and the existence of support mechanisms. In the majority of cases, ASM is a poverty-driven livelihood strategy and is the most promising income opportunity available. For those already engaged in ASM activities, <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are unlikely to affect the decision to mine but will impact on the time spent on the activity and the number of family members involved (including children and the elderly). <b>Price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> will affect the amount that households are able to spend on essentials such as food, clothes, schooling and medical care and thereby the demand for locally produce...|$|R

The word "Econophysics" is sometimes {{used to refer to}} this work. Much recent work is focused on understanding the statistical properties of financial time series. One reason for this interest is that financial markets are examples of complex interacting systems for which a huge amount of data exist and it is possible that #nancial time series viewed from a different perspective might yield new results. This article reviews the results of three recent phenomenological studies [...] - (i) The probability distribution of stock price fluctuations: Stock <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> occur in all magnitudes, in analogy to earthquakes [...] - from tiny fluctuations to drastic events, such as market crashes. The distribution of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> decays with a power-law tail well outside the Levy stable regime and describes fluctuations that differ by as much as eight orders of magnitude. In addition, this distribution preserves its functional form for fluctuations on time scales that differ by three orders of magnitude, from 1 min up to approximately 10 d. (ii) Correlations in financial time series: While <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> themselves have rapidly decaying correlations, the magnitude of fluctuations measured by either the absolute value or the square of the <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> has correlations that decay as a power-law and persist for several months. (iii) Correlations among different companies: The third result bears on the application of random matrix theory to understand the correlations among <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of any two different stocks.
