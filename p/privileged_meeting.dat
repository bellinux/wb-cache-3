François Brousse goes about like Greek philosophers from many centuries ago. Always surrounded by a loyal entourage, he preaches, makes statements and answers questions.

His mother (Nelly Stutz-Anagnostopoulos 1921-1987) taught him, through stories about the doings of his family during the Greek War of Independence and the Second Hellenic Republic, that it is possible to influence history. His father (Joseph Hers, 1884-1965), who spent over thirty-three years in China before founding a family, inspired him to search for the genuine motors of history behind those commonly accepted. Their house, by the architect Henry van de Velde, in which he lived until age 21, was a <b>privileged</b> <b>meeting</b> place for personalities who came to inform his father on political, religious, diplomatic, economic issues in Asia, the Soviet Union and Africa, in the framework of his activities to promote and favour exchanges with these regions of the globe, founded on first-hand information.|$|E

His next move was to Madrid, where he began the most fruitful period of his literary output. His early works were [...] "Las Paredes Oyen" [...] (Walls Have Ears) and [...] "Los Pechos Privilegiados" [...] (The <b>Privileged),</b> both <b>meeting</b> with some success. He soon came to be recognised in literary circles in Madrid, but never established close relations with any of their members. Indeed, he earned the hostility of others. We know of many satirical quatrains and disguised allusions to Alarcón, who was always ridiculed for his physique - he was a hunchback - and his American origins. He, in turn, responded to the vast majority of personal attacks and never stopped writing.|$|R

From the description of the conclusion, the researchers suggested that the State High School 2 Bengkulu city can be more creative and innovative in managing the intelligent privileged class, so the impact to the advancement of education in the city of Bengkulu and in Indonesia in general...|$|R
40|$|Buildings with {{particular}} historical-architectural peculiarities are considered as documents-monuments carrying historical, artistic and cultural values, representing {{the evolution of}} the global urban community. Such buildings have to be protected in their integrity, particularly if they are affected by a recovery or restoration project, ensuring the transmission of all informations they contain to the future generations. In Italy, they often arise in dense building blocks that complicate the delicate operations of building site. Historic-monumental building needs to be taken care {{with particular}} attention through the cooperation of highly specialized professionals and the coexistence of roles and different disciplines. The building site is, therefore, a <b>privileged</b> place for <b>meeting</b> and implementing all the studies as well as the rational organization of times and resources and security becomes not only a tool {{for the protection of the}} workmen but also a guarantee for the use of the monumental good even during the execution of the works. Through study cases - Santa Maria del Suffragio in L'Aquila, Trevi Fountain in Rome, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan and others - it’s proved that the process of building site can be a real stage of the project, in which the security and coordination of operations ensure that the good continues to be admired throughout its monumentality during and after the entire life of the yard...|$|R
40|$|Spiritual solicitude, or a {{few words}} on Conscience. The concept of {{conscience}} is not an unambiguous term and is not infrequently exposed to the danger of reducing its characteristic depth. This danger appears especially where it is understood above all, or, in extreme cases, merely as man’s ability or his specific power involving pronouncing judgements on particular deeds or attitudes, in terms of moral good or evil, passing over, and sometimes even forgetting about what makes it capable, {{as well as the}} space in which this distinctive process takes place, thus constitutively belonging to the nature of this specific human reality. An opposed view of understanding of conscience as a judgement, the existentially experienced conscience perceived as distinctive spiritual space marked with the sense of humanness appears – with a <b>privileged</b> place for <b>meetings</b> and growth. Meetings with oneself, with another man and with God, as well as growing in freedom and love, towards complete humanness. What best characterises it is the experience and understanding that authentic self-fulfilment as a person – open with the Absolute, {{as well as with the}} whole reality – means our welfare and obligates. The emerging responsibility for oneself calls on to search for forms and ways, not just any, but harmonious with the discovered sense of one’s own existence, in order to accomplish this moral good. Whereas, the gradually emerging horizon of sense, constitutively contributing to man’s moral awareness, not only lightens self-understanding, but also makes us capable of appropriate grasping of the deepest essence of good or evil of our particular decisions. In this way, conscience becomes „the light”, „the guide” and „the judge” of our being, our self-fulfilment in freedom. Many a thing indicate that moral awareness and ability to pronounce specific judgements, though diverse in terms of proprium typical of each of them, indeed constitute one, dynamic and indivisible entity. Breaking it inevitably leads to limiting, and sometimes even distortion of one’s own humanness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} finite automata and regular {{languages}} is a <b>privileged</b> <b>meeting</b> point of algebra and logic. Since {{the work of}} Büchi, regular languages have been classified according to their descriptive complexity, i. e. the type of logical formalism required to define them. The algebraic {{point of view on}} automata is an essential complement of this classification: by providing alternative, algebraic characterizations for the classes, it often yields the only opportunity for the design of algorithms that decide expressibility in some logical fragment. We survey the existing results relating the expressibility of regular languages in logical fragments of MSO[S] with algebraic properties of their minimal automata. In particular, we show that many of the best known results in this area share the same underlying mechanics and rely on a very strong relation between logical substitutions and blockproducts of pseudovarieties of monoid. We also explain the impact of these connections to circuit complexity theory. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Privileged</b> <b>meeting</b> {{point between}} Slavic, Latin and Germanic cultures, Trieste {{has always been}} a {{breeding}} ground of literal experiments, a place where the old meets the new, tradition modernity. Its natural creativity and receptivity {{is to be found in}} its flowing, open identity, in the absence of that weight that national institutions ascribe to monoethnic and national culture. Ernest, the uncompleted novel of Umberto Saba, an Italian poet native of Trieste, was written in 1953 just before dying and published in 1975. Its open and indefinite form still fascinates critics and readers. It is the late confession of Saba's conquer of his sexual and artistic identity, with the city of Trieste between nineteenth and twentieth century as background. In this Künstlerroman Nietzsche and Freud's lesson has been elevated by Saba's lyric strength and by a prose, which expressive style comes from the combination of literal Italian and the Triestine dialect. This article offers the analyses of the text through the definition of the concepts of undefinedness, intimacy and lightness in Umberto Saba's poetic...|$|E
