5|$|After the Puerto Rican league season {{came to an}} end in 1932, Coimbre went to work as a {{security}} guard in a penal institution and only <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> semi-professional team. Shortly after, he was offered a contract to play in La Guaira, with a team called Santa Marta. The season concluded with Buchipluma, a second team owned by Santa Marta's proprietor winning the league's championship. Following his participation with Santa Marta, he continued playing, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. While playing with Licey, the team developed a rivalry with El Escogido, which gave Coimbre an opportunity to establish relationships with several players, from both countries. During this period the team continued to be coached by Dore, and included several known Dominican players. The team would win the league's championship once, but Coimbre decided not to assist the ceremony where the trophy was awarded choosing to stay in his hotel room instead. Dore took the cup to Coimbre so that he could have it in his possession some days, but he rejected this and suggested that it be filled with money for a donation.|$|E

5|$|Doug Flutie {{made his}} NFL {{debut in the}} fourth quarter for the Chicago Bears. The Bears took an early 14–0 lead after Mike Tomczak's 37-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Willie Gault. The play occurred after Ervin Randle's recovery of a Calvin Thomas fumble was nullified due to an offsides penalty on Craig Swoope. While the Buccaneers' defense improved later in the game, it was not enough to overcome the problems of the injury-battered offense. Nathan Wonsley suffered a broken neck while making a tackle on the opening kickoff. This was followed by injuries to Jerry Bell, Phil Freeman, Craig Swoope, and Willie Gillespie. Calvin Magee <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prior injury, as did James Wilder and Leonard Harris, though both were forced to leave the game. With Gerald Carter left as the only experienced receiver, the Bears keyed on him, and with Bell, Wonsley and Wilder out, the Buccaneers could not run.|$|E
5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a classified ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted by a huge crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 Byard was {{the subject}} of a short {{documentary}} film, Anything for Jazz, which featured him playing, teaching and with his family. By the 1980s his main instrument remained the piano, and he still played both alto and tenor saxophones, but he had stopped playing the other instruments that he used to use professionally – bass, drums, guitar, trombone, and trumpet, although he still taught all of them. In the same period, he was often heard in New York playing solo, in duos, or in trios. In 1988 he <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> band founded by Mingus' widow to perform the bassist's compositions – the Mingus Big Band. Byard played and recorded with a former student of his, Ricky Ford, from 1989 to 1991, and continued to play and teach during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{completed}} the 2009–10 campaign {{with a new}} personal best in points {{for the third consecutive}} season with 75 points (25 goals and 50 assists). With the Sundin's retirement and Demitra being held out of the lineup with injuries, he was moved to his natural center position and joined by wingers Mikael Samuelsson and Mason Raymond. His 26 power play points ranked second on the team to Henrik Sedin. Playing on the second power play unit, he earned many of his points controlling the puck along the half-boards. He also averaged a career-high 19:37 minutes of ice time per game, which ranked second among team forwards to Henrik Sedin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Kesler notched a goal and nine assists in 12 games. After helping the Canucks eliminate the Los Angeles Kings in the first round, he <b>played</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sore shoulder in the second round, as Vancouver were eliminated by the Blackhawks for the second consecutive year. An MRI did not reveal any serious injury. He admitted following the defeat to not having played his best during the playoffs.|$|E

In the next two games Tranmere was defeated by Shrewsbury Town 1–2 after two late goals and earned their first win and clean sheet at Wycombe Wanderers by scoring a goal either side of half-time. On 18 August, Edwards added to the squad with the first loan signing of the season, bringing young Saint Lucian defender Janoi Donacien over from Aston Villa until January 2015. Tranmere were defeated at home by Cheltenham Town 2–3 despite leading 2–0 at half-time. The first month of the season was concluded with a victory against 10-man Morecambe. Both goals were scored by Cole Stockton who extended his contract with Tranmere earlier that week till the summer of 2017.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{provide the}} first test of the {{consequences}} of delegation in a mixed duopoly. Such delegation allows a profit maximizing private owner and a welfare maximizing public owner to give a separate weight to sales in managerial contracts. Theory predicts that such contracts improve welfare. Our experimental evidence indicates that both public and private owners do provide a weight on sales consistent with the subgame perfect equilibrium. Critically, however, this is only true when <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> robot manager and when <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> human subject manger after the experience of <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> robot manager...|$|R
