40|$|Two {{species of}} Clinostomum {{previously}} described from Australia, C. hornum from Botaurus poiciloptilus (Australian bittern) and Nycticorax caledonicus (Nankeen night heros) and C. australiense from Pelecanus conspicillatus (Australian pelican), which have previously been synonymised with C. complanatum, are redescribed and recognised as valid species. In addition, C. complanatum is recorded from Egretta alba (large egret), E. garzetta (little egret), E. intermedia (<b>plumed</b> <b>egret),</b> N. caledonicus and Ardea novaehollandiae (white-faced heron). C. wilsoni n. sp. is described from E. intermedia from Queensland. C. wilsoni {{differs from the}} other three species in {{size and shape of}} the body and in the oral collar, oral sucker, intestinal caeca, caecal diverticula and position of testes. Taxonomic problems within the genus Clinostomum are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} plumes came from various species of egret, known as [...] "little snowies" [...] for their snowy-white feathers; even more prized were the [...] "nuptial plumes", grown during the mating season and {{displayed}} by birds during courtship. So-called [...] "osprey" [...] <b>plumes,</b> actually <b>egret</b> <b>plumes,</b> {{were used as}} part of British army uniforms until they were discontinued in 1889. Poachers often entered the densely populated rookeries, where they would shoot and then pluck the roosting birds clean, leaving their carcasses to rot. Unprotected eggs became easy prey for predators, as were newly hatched birds, who also starved or died from exposure. One ex-poacher would later write of the practice, [...] "The heads and necks of the young birds were hanging out of the nests by the hundreds. I am done with bird hunting forever!" ...|$|R
50|$|The nuptial <b>plumes</b> Chinese <b>egret,</b> {{like other}} egrets were {{in demand for}} decorating hats. They had been {{used for this purpose}} since at least the 17th century but in the 19th century it became a major craze and the number of egret skins passing through dealers reached into the millions. This is thought to have contributed to the decline of all of the white Egretta species. The {{greatest}} modern threat is habitat loss and reclamation of tidal flats and estuarine habitats, and through pollution.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} part of the 20th century, some of the world's egret species were {{endangered}} by relentless plume hunting, since hat makers in Europe and the United States demanded large numbers of <b>egret</b> <b>plumes,</b> leading to breeding birds being killed in many places around the world.|$|R
5000|$|The herons are the long-legged {{freshwater}} {{and coastal}} {{birds in the}} family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, {{some of which are}} referred to as [...] "egrets" [...] or [...] "bitterns" [...] rather than herons. Members of the genera Botaurus and Ixobrychus are referred to as [...] "bitterns", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus Zebrilus, form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative <b>plumes.</b> Although <b>egrets</b> have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks.|$|R
5000|$|After serving at the Jupiter Lighthouse {{station for}} a year, Hannibal Pierce {{homestead}}ed {{a large portion}} of Hypoluxo Island, located in the Lake Worth Lagoon. At the time of their homestead claim, the island had no name. In conversations with the Seminole Indians, Hannibal Pierce learned that the name was Hypoluxo, which meant [...] "Water all around, no get out." [...] Here the family built a house from driftwood and palmetto thatch. Hannibal Pierce became the keeper of the Orange Grove House of Refuge, in what would become Delray Beach. The United States federal government built five Houses of Refuge in Florida to care for shipwrecked sailors. It was at the House of Refuge that the first child of European descent was born, Lillie Pierce, (Lillie Pierce Voss) in 1876. The Pierce family returned to their Hypoluxo Island homestead. Pierce led many expeditions through the Everglades on hunting and fishing trips, being {{one of the first to}} explore what would become Everglades National Park. [...] Pierce accompanied his boyhood friend Guy Bradley, Bradley's brother Louis and famed <b>egret</b> <b>plume</b> hunter Jean Chevalier aboard Pierce's boat the Bonton in 1885. The hunting party killed thousands of birds for their plumes, which were used to decorate women's hats. The <b>egret</b> <b>plumes</b> were worth more than their weight in gold.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} whether black-crowned night herons (BCNH), white heron (<b>Plumed</b> <b>Egrets</b> (PE)) and domestic fowls are infected by JE virus and they serve as infection source ofJE, hemoagglutination inhibiting antibody and its 2 Â·ME sensitive antibody in the sera of these birds were determined. Physico-chemical nature of fowl's antibody of JE produced by natural infection and their maternal antibody in the sera of chicks were examined. The results are briefly summarized as follows. 1) As to the herons captured in Tsudaka Town, two out of six adult night herons and three out of the four chicks showed positive HI reaction. On the other hand, HI reaction in the sera of two adult white herons and three chicks were negative. 2) As to the herons captured in Okayama City, twenty out of thirtytwo adult night herons and seven out of seventy white herons showed positive HI reaction in 1966 around the time when JE was prevalent in Okayama Prefecture. And six out of eleven night herons and one out of seven white herons showing positive HI reaction, responded positively to 2 -ME sensitivity test. 3) The results indicate that white herons can be also infection source ofJE though less than {{in the case of}} night herons. 4) In the domestic fowls (white leghorn) kept at Takahashi District, eight out of twenty-seven fowls showed positive HI reaction. And six out of seven domestic fowls showing positive HI reaction responded positively to 2 -ME sensitive reaction. 5) Transformation of JE antibody in the serum of hen from IgM to IgG was recognized. 6) Domestic chicken's sera having 1 : 640 of HI titer in the original serum and 1 : 320 of HI titer after 2 -ME treatment were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200 and the antibody activities present in the various fractions were determined. HI antibody activities occurred in both IgM and IgG classes of immunoglobulins. 7) Maternal HI antibodies reacting with JE virus were found in newly hatched domestic chickens from the eggs laid by hens with natural infection ofJE. And half life of HI antibodies in chicks was four days. 8) HI antibodies of JE in the serum of maternal immune-hens and chicken having maternal antibody were located in r-globulin fraction by starch block electrophoresis. 9) The results from 4) to 8) indicate the presence of natural infection ofJE in the domestic fowls. And domestic fowls can be infection source ofJE. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. The floodplain supports over 1% of the world populations magpie geese and pied herons. The mudflats of Fog Bay, extending from Point Jenny to Stingray Head, support over 1% of the world populations of great knots and grey-tailed tattlers, among the maximum of 35,000 waders, or shorebirds, recorded. [...] Other waders for which the site is at least sometimes important include black-tailed godwits, greaters and lesser sand plovers, grey plovers, Terek sandpipers, and Far Eastern curlews. Other waterbirds that have been recorded in relatively large numbers include little pied and little black cormorants, darters, royal spoonbills, glossy, straw-necked and Australian white ibises, great and intermediate <b>egrets,</b> <b>plumed</b> and wandering whistling ducks, grey teals, Pacific black ducks, and brolgas.|$|R
60|$|As we went I {{saw that}} the {{regiment}} of the Amawombe, picked men every one of them, all fifty {{years of age or}} over, nearly four thousand strong, was marshalled on the dancing-ground, where they stood company by company. A magnificent sight they were, with their white fighting-shields, their gleaming spears, their otter-skin caps, their kilts and armlets of white bulls' tails, and the snowy <b>egret</b> <b>plumes</b> which they wore upon their brows. We rode to the head of them, where I saw Maputa, and as I came they greeted me with a cheer of welcome, for in those days a white man was a power in the land. Moreover, as I have said, the Zulus knew and liked me well. Also the fact that I was to watch, or perchance to fight with them, put a good heart into the Amawombe.|$|R
