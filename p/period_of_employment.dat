During their employment, their temporary names were treated as their legal names. For example, a maid who was involved in legal dealings in Kyoto in 1819-1831 signed legal documents as Sayo during one <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and as Mitsu during a later <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> but she signed as Iwa, presumably her birth name, when she was between jobs.|$|E

25|$|Attempted {{reform of}} labor {{relations}} in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once they passed a brief trial <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented {{in a way that}} made discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis up to the point at which they would have to be kept and then letting them go before the restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile to this type of regulation, primarily on the grounds that it took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 is {{well known}} for {{spawning}} the Commander Keen series of side-scrolling platform games, which launched Id Software. During their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at Softdisk in the early 1990s, video game developers John Carmack and Tom Hall secretly developed the adaptive tile refresh technology that would perform smooth, side-scrolling graphics on EGA cards for IBM clone personal computers. They used their spare time late at night to develop a clone of the first level of Super Mario Bros. 3, using the hero in Softdisk's Dangerous Dave, calling the prototype Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement. When John Romero saw their work in action, he and the project chief at Softdisk Jay Wilbur suggested that they finish the PC clone of Super Mario Bros. 3. This demo was later presented to Nintendo, who denied to allow their games on PCs because they [...] "were only made exclusively for their Nintendo consoles". As a result, the first Mario-style, side-scrolling episode of Commander Keen was made on Softdisk's computers at odd hours. Shortly afterward, Softdisk suggested that the team form its own company, which became Id Software on February 1, 1991.|$|E
