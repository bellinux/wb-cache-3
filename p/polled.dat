5|$|EU {{legislation}} on dehorning practices {{is expected to}} place greater pressure to breed <b>polled</b> cattle, which is being pursued in France by the GIE <b>Polled</b> Excellence group. Because no French Limousins had been identified with the <b>polled</b> gene, a breeding programme commenced in 2005 with <b>polled</b> Canadian bulls of phenotype closest to the French breed standard.|$|E
5|$|French breeders of <b>polled</b> Limousins {{claimed that}} the breed {{standard}} that prevented their animals being recorded in the French Herd Book provided an unfair export advantage to foreign countries {{that do not have}} similar restrictions. The French recording ban was removed in July 2007 with the introduction of the Purebred class, but so far no <b>polled</b> Limousin have yet been accepted and registered as Full French.|$|E

5|$|<b>Polled</b> Dorsets are an all-white, {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free from dark fibers. Since its development, the number of <b>Polled</b> Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The <b>Polled</b> Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not start as a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E
5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and <b>Polled.</b> In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the <b>polled</b> variety have no horns at all. <b>Polled</b> Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa's {{contention}} for the 2000 {{presidential election}} {{ended with a}} crushing defeat when he <b>polled</b> 1.01 percent of the vote.

40|$|International audienceIEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} suite defines {{two main}} <b>polling</b> mode: unicast <b>polling</b> and contention-base <b>polling</b> including multicast and broadcast <b>polling.</b> Unicast <b>polling</b> completely overcomes the request collision and {{is suitable for}} real-time application. Contention-based <b>polling</b> suffers from collisions and is suitable for non-real-time applications. Though the standard defined different service classes for implementing the <b>polling</b> mechanisms, it does not define exactly an adaptation <b>polling</b> mechanism to efficiently allocate bandwidth. In this paper we evaluate the performance of different <b>polling</b> mechanisms defined in IEEE 802. 16 by simulation.

5|$|Most Limousin cattle have a {{coloration}} that {{varies from}} light wheat to darker golden-red. Other coloration, mainly black, {{has been developed}} through cross-breeding and grading up from other breeds of cattle. In addition to altering natural coloration, other traits, such as <b>polled</b> (a genetic lack of horns), have been introduced through cross breeding. Angus cattle have been the dominant source of black and <b>polled</b> genes now present in graded-up high content Limousins found throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|An {{entrance}} <b>poll</b> is a <b>poll</b> that {{is taken}} before voters have cast their votes at the <b>polling</b> stations. It {{is akin to}} an opinion <b>poll</b> {{in the sense that}} it asks who the voter plans to vote for or some similar set of questions. The possibility that the prospective voter might change his mind after the <b>poll</b> is very small compared to that of an opinion <b>poll,</b> therefore the margin of error of an entrance <b>poll</b> is expected to be lower than that of an opinion <b>poll.</b> However, the methodology of conducting an entrance <b>poll</b> is closer to that of an exit <b>poll,</b> where actual voters are being queried as opposed to potential voters in an opinion <b>poll.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally <b>polled</b> (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally <b>polled</b> goats are rare (though many are <b>polled</b> artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Polled</b> Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name refers {{to the fact that}} it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The <b>Polled</b> Dorset is the result of a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E
