5|$|Pneumonia {{frequently}} {{starts as}} an {{upper respiratory tract}} infection that moves into the lower respiratory tract. It is <b>pneumonitis</b> (lung inflammation) combined with consolidation (liquid in spaces normally inflated with air).|$|E
5|$|The term {{pneumonia}} {{is sometimes}} more broadly applied to any condition resulting in {{inflammation of the}} lungs (caused for example by autoimmune diseases, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately referred to as <b>pneumonitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical <b>pneumonitis</b> was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical <b>pneumonitis,</b> pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the lung tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called <b>pneumonitis.</b> One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma forming in the lung.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration <b>pneumonitis,</b> or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity <b>pneumonitis.</b> Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial <b>pneumonitis.</b> Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E
25|$|Lung {{toxicity}} is {{a serious}} complication associated with sirolimus therapy, {{especially in the case}} of lung transplants. The mechanism of the interstitial <b>pneumonitis</b> caused by sirolimus and other macrolide MTOR inhibitors is unclear, and may have nothing to do with the mTOR pathway. The interstitial <b>pneumonitis</b> is not dose-dependent, but is more common in patients with underlying lung disease.|$|E
25|$|Hookworm infections insinuate a skin {{reaction}} (dermatitis), increased {{white blood}} cells (eosinophils), a pulmonary reaction (<b>pneumonitis),</b> and skin rash (urticarial).|$|E
25|$|Chest X-ray {{findings}} tend to show bilateral patchy infiltrates {{consistent with}} viral <b>pneumonitis</b> and ARDS. Lower lobes {{tend to be}} more involved. CT scans show interstitial infiltrates.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, {{interstitial}} <b>pneumonitis,</b> {{which is}} characterized by cough and increased dyspnea. This may be severe and must be considered among those patients whose breathing acutely worsens.|$|E
25|$|Some of the diagnoses {{that can}} result from the {{mechanisms}} explained above include irritant contact dermatitis; allergic contact dermatitis; occupational acne; tracheitis; esophagitis; bronchitis; asthma; allergy; hypersensitivity <b>pneumonitis</b> (HP); and worsening of pre-existing respiratory problems.|$|E
25|$|Fistulas of, but {{not limited}} to, the penis, urethra, vagina, uterus, or rectum. Also, {{surrounding}} edema often occurs. Rectal or other strictures and scarring. Systemic spread may occur, possible results are arthritis, <b>pneumonitis,</b> hepatitis, or perihepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the pleurae {{known as}} {{pleurisy}} can rarely {{give rise to}} shrinking lung syndrome. SLE can cause pleuritic pain and also give rise to shrinking lung syndrome, involving a reduced lung volume. Other associated lung conditions include <b>pneumonitis,</b> chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary emboli, and pulmonary hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects include: {{hepatotoxicity}} (liver damage), ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness, acute <b>pneumonitis,</b> rarely pulmonary fibrosis, and kidney failure. Methotrexate is teratogenic and hence is not advised {{for either the}} prospective father to take it before or for the mother to take it before or during pregnancy (pregnancy category X) and for a period after birth.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} a 24-year-old woman brought {{the number of cases}} in Malaysia to 71. The patient, having fever, cough and {{headache}} was admitted to a private hospital in Kuantan on 10 August and received viral <b>pneumonitis</b> treatment. She was then referred to a government hospital after her condition worsened and placed in ICU. Her condition still deteriorate, albeit Tamiflu was administered. On 19 August, she was confirmed dead due to H1N1 secondary to ARDS.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{pulmonary}} reactions {{caused by}} nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial <b>pneumonitis,</b> pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting {{the drug and}} is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It {{is important to recognize}} nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As {{amiodarone}} can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial <b>pneumonitis,</b> liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding {{it can cause}} problems in the baby. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF), hypersensitivity <b>pneumonitis,</b> sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
25|$|General health {{maintenance}} {{should be the}} therapeutic emphasis in Freeman–Sheldon syndrome. The focus is on limiting exposure to infectious diseases because the musculoskeletal abnormalities make recovery from routine infections much more difficult in FSS. <b>Pneumonitis</b> and bronchitis often follow seemingly mild upper respiratory tract infections. Though respiratory challenges and complications faced by a patient with FSS can be numerous, the syndrome’s primary involvement {{is limited to the}} musculoskeletal systems, and satisfactory quality and length of life can be expected with proper care.|$|E
25|$|Tungsten hexafluoride is an {{extremely}} corrosive compound that attacks any tissue. Exposure of humans to the gas first affects the eyes and respiratory tracts causing irritation, loss of vision, cough, and excessive formation of saliva and sputum. Upon mixing with the body fluids, the gas transforms into hydrofluoric acid which burns the skin and mucous tissues of the respiratory tract. Upon prolonged exposure, this results in <b>pneumonitis</b> and pulmonary edema, and could be fatal. Because {{of the formation of}} hydrofluoric acid upon reaction of WF6 with humidity, WF6 storage vessels have Teflon gaskets.|$|E
25|$|Nickel {{carbonyl}} poisoning {{is characterized}} by a two-stage illness. The first consists of headaches and chest pain lasting a few hours, usually followed by a short remission. The second phase is a chemical <b>pneumonitis</b> which starts after typically 16 hours with symptoms of cough, breathlessness and extreme fatigue. These reach greatest severity after four days, possibly resulting in death from cardiorespiratory or renal failure. Convalescence is often extremely protracted, often complicated by exhaustion, depression and dyspnea on exertion. Permanent respiratory damage is unusual. The carcinogenicity of Ni(CO)4 is a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|The first {{appearance}} of eggs in stools is 60–70 days. In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4–16 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. There are generally {{few or no}} symptoms. A bolus of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause <b>pneumonitis</b> and eosinophilia. Adult worms have a lifespan of 1–2 years which means that individuals may be infected all their lives as worms die and new worms are acquired.|$|E
25|$|Potassium bromide {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (<b>pneumonitis)</b> in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able {{as a matter of}} routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms usually {{began to}} appear six to 11 days after initial infection, {{beginning}} with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to expectoration and sometimes hemoptysis. Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by the worms. These symptoms, along with a low-grade fever, can last several months if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if the worms are attached in the larynx. Weight loss and <b>pneumonitis</b> have been reported as possible long-term consequences, but not anemia.|$|E
25|$|NSAAs {{may be an}} {{appealing}} option for {{those who wish to}} preserve sex drive and function and/or fertility, as well as for those who desire more selective action with fewer side effects than spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (which increase the risk of depressive symptoms, among other adverse effects). Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial <b>pneumonitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic {{hydantoin}} analog of flutamide, as seen {{in figure}} 5. Nilutamide is eliminated exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the aromatic nitro group. Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage. Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as <b>pneumonitis</b> and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 11 months Genie {{was still}} in overall good health, and had no noted mental abnormalities, but had fallen to the 11th {{percentile}} for weight. The people who later studied her believed this {{was a sign that}} she was starting to suffer some degree of malnutrition. When Genie was 14 months old, she came down with a fever and <b>pneumonitis</b> and her parents took her to a pediatrician who had not previously seen her. The pediatrician said that, although her illness prevented a definitive diagnosis, there was a possibility that she was mentally retarded and that the brain dysfunction kernicterus might be present, further amplifying her father's conclusion that she was severely retarded.|$|E
25|$|Oxalic acid in {{concentrated}} form {{can have}} harmful effects through contact and if ingested; manufacturers provide details in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). It is not identified as mutagenic or carcinogenic; {{there is a}} possible risk of congenital malformation in the fetus; may be harmful if inhaled, and is extremely destructive to tissue of mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract; harmful if swallowed; harmful to and destructive of tissue and causes burns if absorbed through the skin or is {{in contact with the}} eyes. Symptoms and effects include a burning sensation, cough, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, spasm, inflammation and edema of the larynx, inflammation and edema of the bronchi, <b>pneumonitis,</b> pulmonary edema.|$|E
25|$|Hookworm {{infection}} {{is generally considered}} to be asymptomatic, but as Norman Stoll described in 1962, hookworm {{infection is}} an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is “silent and insidious.” There are general symptoms that an individual may experience soon after infection. Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with N. americanus. Additionally, cough and <b>pneumonitis</b> may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the “silent and insidious” symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. Additionally, recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes when the mother is infected with hookworm during pregnancy.|$|E
