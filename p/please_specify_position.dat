50|$|In astronomy, a {{celestial}} coordinate {{system is a}} system for <b>specifying</b> <b>positions</b> of celestial objects: satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and so on.

50|$|From these bases, {{directions}} toward {{objects in}} the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to terrestrial longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system <b>specifies</b> <b>positions</b> relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The ecliptic coordinate system <b>specifies</b> <b>positions</b> relative to the Earth's orbit, using celestial longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other celestial coordinate systems, such as the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program provides semiautomatic {{control of a}} moveable robot used to perform optical calibration of video-camera-based optoelectronic sensor systems {{that will be used}} to guide automated rendezvous maneuvers of spacecraft. The function of the robot is to move a target and hold it at <b>specified</b> <b>positions.</b> With the help of limit switches, the software first centers or finds the target. Then the target is moved to a starting position. Thereafter, {{with the help of an}} intuitive graphical user interface, an operator types in coordinates of <b>specified</b> <b>positions,</b> and the software responds by commanding the robot to move the target to the positions. The software has capabilities for correcting errors and for recording data from the guidance-sensor system being calibrated. The software can also command that the target be moved in a predetermined sequence of motions between <b>specified</b> <b>positions</b> and can be run in an advanced control mode in which, among other things, the target can be moved beyond the limits set by the limit switches...|$|R
