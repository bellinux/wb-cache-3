5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to be friendly, docile and easy to handle, although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E

Using network analysis tools, we explore how different social structures might affect a country’s rate of technological progress. The network model also explains why societies with a high <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> contagious <b>disease</b> might evolve toward growth-inhibiting social institutions and how small initial differences can produce large divergence in incomes. Empirical work uses differences in the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> spread by human contact and the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> other <b>diseases</b> as an instrument to identify an effect of social structure on technology diffusion. How people organize themselves as a society undoubtedly affects economic activity and a country’s income. But how does this effect operate and how much does it matter for development? Macroeconomists typically overlook findings of sociologists and anthropologists because social characteristics are difficult to observe, to describe formally and to quantify. 1 This paper uses tools from network analysis to explore how different social structures might affect a country’s rate of technological progress. The network model also explains why societies might adopt growth-inhibiting structures and shows how these structures can produce large differences in incomes. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we use differences in the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> spread by human contact and the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> other <b>diseases</b> as an instrument to identify an effect of social structure on technology diffusion. There is a long history of measuring the speed of information or technology diffusion within various kinds of networks (Jackson (2008), Granovetter (2005)). Given these findings, a simpl...|$|R

This study aimed to determine whether there is {{a significant difference in the}} <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> systemic <b>diseases</b> (a) in patients referred for periodontal care compared to the general practice population, (b) in patients attending a public hospital and private practices, (c) in patients attending public and private periodontal practices, and (d) among patients with periodontitis of varying severity. Methods: Charts of 1000 adult patients were selected from four clinics (University of Queensland (UQ) School of Dentistry Admissions Clinic, UQ School of Dentistry Periodontics Clinic, Private Periodontal Practice, and Private General Dental Practice). The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> medical conditions was evaluated using validated self-reported health questionnaires. The periodontal condition was assessed from the most recent relevant radiographs in the files. Results: Periodontal patients had a higher <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> systemic <b>diseases</b> compared to the general practice population. Public patients had a greater <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> systemic <b>diseases</b> compared to patients in private practice for both general practice and periodontal patients.

Methods: To study the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Dupuytren <b>disease,</b> the authors drew a random sample of 1360 individuals, stratified by age, from the northern part of The Netherlands. Of this sample, 763 individuals aged 50 to 89 years participated in this cross-sectional study.

Additional analyses were performed to develop a logistic prediction model for the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Dupuytren <b>disease.</b> Results: The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Dupuytren <b>disease</b> was 22. 1 percent.
