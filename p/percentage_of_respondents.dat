2500|$|Prior to the Spanish {{financial}} crisis from 2008, the monarchy traditionally enjoyed wide support and popularity by Spanish citizens since its constitutional restoration in 1978, according to Fernando Villespin, {{president of the}} Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS, English: Sociological Research Center) [...] in 2008. According to Villespin, the king's traditional approval rating of over 70% through the years consistently out-performed those of elected political leaders, with a similar <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> considering that the king {{played an important role}} in maintaining Spanish democracy. Public trust in Juan Carlos’ kingship [...] "comes only behind that of the National Ombudsman", Villespin continued. Members of the royal family were routinely voted among the most respected public figures in Spain, and in 2010 as many as 75% of Spanish citizens ranked the monarchy as [...] "above any other public institution in the country", according to Dr Juan Díez-Nicolás, a former president of the CIS and founder of the private consulting firm ASEP (Análisis Sociológicos Económicos y Políticos). The CIS, a non-partisan government funded independent research institution, has been researching public opinion of the monarchy since 1984 and tracks three basic lines of inquiry; what is public confidence in the monarchy, what is the role of the monarchy in a democratic system, and to what degree has the king contributed to the democratic process.|$|E

The questionnaire was validated using a multitrait multi-item method (Ware et al. 1997). This method is used to determine whether each item in a scale is substantially related (r ≥ 0.40) to the total score computed from the other items in that scale (item convergent validity criterion). Internal-consistency reliability was estimated by the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, with a minimum value of 0.70 considered as acceptable. Furthermore, the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> achieving either the highest score (ceiling) and lowest score (floor) were calculated.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{increase}} {{the precision of}} estimated item parameters of item response theory models for patient-reported outcomes, general population samples are often enriched with samples <b>of</b> clinical <b>respondents.</b> Calibration studies provide little information on how this sampling scheme is incorporated into model estimation. In a small simulation study the impact of ignoring the oversampling <b>of</b> clinical <b>respondents</b> on item and person parameters is illustrated. Method Simulations were performed using two scenarios. Under the first {{it was assumed that}} regular and clinical respondents form two distinct distributions; under the second it was assumed that they form a single distribution. A synthetic item bank with quasi-trait characteristics was created, and item scores were generated from this bank for samples with varying <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>respondents.</b> Proper (using a multi-group model, and sample weights, respectively, for Scenarios 1 and 2) and improper (ignoring oversampling) approaches for dealing with the clinical sample were contrasted using correlations and differences between true and estimated parameters. Results Under the first scenario, ignoring the sampling scheme resulted in overestimation of both item and person parameters with bias decreasing with higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>respondents.</b> Under the second, location and person parameters were underestimated with bias increasing in size with increasing <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>respondents.</b> Under both scenarios, the standard error of the latent trait estimate was generally underestimated. Conclusion Ignoring the addition <b>of</b> extra clinical <b>respondents</b> leads to bias in item and person parameters, which may lead to biased norms and unreliable CAT scores.
