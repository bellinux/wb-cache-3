40|$|A forty-hour flight {{program was}} {{completed}} to study {{signal to noise}} ratio, lane counting and position accuracy using a low cost Omega navigation system in a general aviation aircraft. Specific test objectives were developed to investigate signals both {{on the bench and}} in the air. Signal to noise ratio and lane counting characteristics were investigated in a single frequency, uncorrected mode and in a pseudo-differential mode. It was learned that the received signal to noise ratio is highly correlated with lane counting characteristics and receiver navigability. The relationship between system accuracy and reliability was also examined. The Omega navigation system's bias and position accuracy were investigated with the aid of the Discrete Address Beacon System (DABS). A <b>circular</b> <b>probable</b> <b>error</b> of 3500 feet was observed. It was also determined that certain necessary hardware and system improvements must be implemented before a completely usable Omega navigation system can be offered to the general aviation user.

5000|$|When the deadbeat was invented, clockmakers {{initially}} {{believed it}} had inferior isochronism to the anchor, {{because of the}} greater effect of changes in force on the pendulum's amplitude.

That is, an increase in amplitude of swing causes a slight increase in period of a pendulum due to <b>circular</b> <b>error,</b> and that this can compensate for the decreased period due to isochronism.
