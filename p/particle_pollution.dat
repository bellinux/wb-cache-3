40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the cause of high oil temperature of the bearings in a kiln, oil samples extracted from the recovery of lubricant oil and were tested by comprehensive oil analytical techniques (including conventional physical and chemical Analysis, pollution degree detection and ferrography wear particle analysis). Results show that root cause of high oil temperature is improper selection of lubricating oil and serious solid <b>particles</b> <b>pollution</b> of using lubricating oil. Therefore, the application of oil analytical techniques to monitor the oil working condition, to prevent mechanical failure and to extend machine life is very effective. Preface The lubricating oil, which used in the riding wheel bearing box of cement rotary kiln in a medium-sized cement factory, was domestic famous brand of 220 # gear oil. External temperature of the lubricating oil tank had been up to 80 - 90 ℃. In order to keep up the normal temperature, a fan must be used to blow the oil tank. As the oil temperature was too high, the factory can had only reduced the load of the kiln. This situation brought heavy economic loss to the factory. In order to analyze the causes of high oil temperature, propose the solutions, and {{determine the}} lubricating oil recovered would continue to be used or not, engineers arrived on site to surve...|$|R
5000|$|The six common air {{pollutants}} of primary {{concern to the}} United States are <b>particle</b> <b>pollution,</b> ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead.

The worst two of the six pollutants are <b>particle</b> <b>pollution</b> and ground-level ozone, which have to be regulated by the EPA. <b>Particle</b> <b>pollution,</b> or particle matter, consists of soot, smoke, and chemically formed [...] "droplets". These particles are very small and can bury themselves deep inside the lungs. Ground-level ozone is found in smog and can also negatively affect the lungs. Smog contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). VOCs come from cars burning gasoline, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, etc., while NOx results from burning gasoline, coal, or oil.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{observations}} of mass concentration and elemental composition of aerosol particles (PM 2. 5) were conducted at Tongyu, a semi-arid site in Northeast China {{in the spring}} of 2006. The average mass concentration of PM 2. 5 at Tongyu station was 260. 9 ± 274. 4 µg m− 3 during the observation period. Nine dust events were monitored with a mean concentration of 528. 0 ± 302. 7 µg m− 3. The PM 2. 5 level during non-dust storm (NDS) period was 111. 65 ± 63. 37 µg m− 3. High mass concentration shows that fine-size <b>particles</b> <b>pollution</b> was very serious in the semi-arid area in Northeast China. The enrichment factor values for crust elements during the dust storm (DS) period are close to those in the NDS period, while the enrichment factor values for pollution elements during the NDS period are much higher than those in the DS period, showing these elements were from anthropogenic sources. The ratios of dust elements to Fe were relative constant during the DS period. The Ca/Fe ratio in dust aerosols at Tongyu is remarkably different from that observed in other source regions and downwind regions. Meteorological analysis shows that dust events at Tongyu are usually associated with dry, low pressure and high wind speed weather conditions.
