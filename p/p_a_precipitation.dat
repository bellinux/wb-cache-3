40|$|The {{enantioselective}} hydrogenation of 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -propanedione at 298 K {{and pressure}} of 40 bar of H 2 over zirconia supported Pt catalysts has been studied. Three different zirconia were prepared : i) ZrO 2 - <b>P</b> obtained by <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> procedure from ZrOCl 2 ii) MSZrO 2 obtained by a sol-gel procedure using cetryltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMABR) as surfactant {{to get a}} mesostructured solid iii) CNTsZrO 2 obtained after impregnation of carbon nanotubes with ZrO(NO) 3 followed by pyrolisis and calcination. Pt (1 wt%) was introduced on the support by impregnation of an aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K, hydrogen chemisorption, XRD and TEM techniques. The reactions were carried out in a stainless steel batch reactor using cyclohexane as solvent and cinchonidine as chiral modifier. The presence of CD in the reaction medium is necessary to induce an enantiomeric excess (ee) of the desired product R- 1 phenyl- 1 hydroxi- 2 -propanone. In all the studied systems, {{the relation between the}} enantioselectivity and the CD concentration added in situ exhibits a bell type curve; indicative of the importance of competitive adsorption between the modifier and the substrate on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, confinement effect led to an important enhancement in the activity in those catalysts supported on mesostructured supports, mainly in the Pt/CNTsZrO 2 catalyst...|$|R

These soil differences were {{also reflected in}} canopy averaged leaf traits with savanna trees typically having higher leaf mass per unit area but lower mass-based nitrogen (N m) and potassium (K m). Both N m and K m also increased with declining mean annual <b>precipitation</b> (<b>P</b> <b>A),</b> but most area-based leaf traits such as leaf photosynthetic capacity showed no systematic variation with <b>P</b> <b>A</b> or vegetation type. Despite this invariance, when taken in conjunction with other measures such mean canopy height, area-based soil exchangeable potassium content, [K] sa, proved to be an excellent predictor of several photosynthetic properties (including 13 C isotope discrimination). Moreover, when considered in a multivariate context with <b>P</b> <b>A</b> and soil plant available water storage capacity (θ P) as covariates, [K] sa also proved to be an excellent predictor of stand-level canopy area, providing drastically improved fits as compared to models considering just <b>P</b> <b>A</b> and/or θ <b>P.</b> Neither calcium, magnesium nor soil pH could substitute for potassium when tested as alternative model predictors (ΔAIC > 10).

40|$|The Holocene {{climate is}} known to be rather stable {{although}} with few abrupt changes that lasted few decades. The present study is related the climate changes and their environmental impacts during the last 6000 years from a fossil record collected in the Middle Atlas, Morocco. Reconstruction of three climate variables (January temperature (Tjan), annual <b>precipitation</b> (<b>P</b> ann) and <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> seasonal index (SI)) was based on pollen data and analyzed various bio and geo-chemical elements. Then we evaluated the relationships between all the environmental variables. Climate over the last 6000 years was rather stable with a smooth trend of aridity towards the present. Tjan has varied within about 2 °C range and P ann within less than 100 mm yr − 1. Despite such overall climate stability, after ca. 3750 cal BP some important changes were observe in the ecosystem composition, the carbon isotopic contents of organic matter in lake sediments (δ 13 C), the total organic carbon and nitrogen amount and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C / N). These environmental changes are related to the transition in the conifer forest between the Atlas cedar, which expanded after 3750 cal BP, and the pine forest. These vegetation changes have impacted the sedimentation type and composition into the lake. Between 5500 and 5000 cal BP an abrupt change is recorded in all bio and geo-chemical indicators {{as well as in the}} pollen data. The multi-proxy analysis, taking into account the climate variables, tends to indicate that it was mainly a decrease in temperature without a significant change in the overall amount of precipitation. In summary, the present study confirms the overall climate stability over the last 6000 years and highlights the presence of short and abrupt climate events...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Acute {{diarrhoea}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} health challenges globally, causing millions of child deaths every year. A continued effort is made by the WHO, in collaboration with other institutions, to successfully combat diarrhoea. A new formulation for ORS (with a reduced osmolarity), in combination with zinc supplementation, was proposed to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea (WHO, 2006 : 1). Appropriate zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhoea includes: zinc sulfate, zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate. With no monographs available in The Ph. Int. for zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs, the development thereof has become a priority to the WHO. During this study, suitable methods according to The Ph. Int. for the quality control testing of zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs were investigated and proposed. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc acetate dihydrate API: * Identification of zinc by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction of zinc hydroxide and zinc sulfide, * Identification of acetate by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction of ferric acetate, * Clarity and colour of a 0. 05 g/ml solution, * pH value of a 0. 05 g/ml solution, * Assay by means of a complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing substances by means of a reduction reaction with potassium permanganate, o chlorides by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction of barium sulfate, o arsenic by means of reaction between arsine and bromide, o aluminium, cadmium, copper, iron and lead by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc gluconate API: * Identification of zinc by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction of zinc ferrocyanide, * Identification of gluconate by means of a thin layer chromatographic separation method, * Clarity and colour of a 0. 01 g/ml solution, * pH value of a 0. 01 g/ml solution, * Water by means of the Karl Fischer method, * Assay by means of a complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing sugars by means of a reduction reaction with cupri–tartaric test solution, o chlorides by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction of barium sulfate, o heavy metals by means of <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> reaction of sulfides in acidic solutions, o cadmium by means of atomic absorption spectrometry, and o microbial testing if required by The Ph. Int. The proposed methods were then validated or verified according to international standards. Once the methods were proven to be fit for purpose, they were assembled into the respective monographs for inclusion in The Ph. Int. The newly developed monographs were then evaluated by determining the compliance of commercially available zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate to the proposed specifications. The study contributes to the WHO, pharmaceutical industry and medicines regulatory authorities by making these two monographs globally available, thus providing a quality gauge to ensure the availability of zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs of pharmaceutical acceptable quality.

40|$|ABSTRACT Physical {{dormancy}} enables {{plants that}} occur in temporally stochastic and harsh environments to survive; thus, within the distribution area of a species, the percentage of seeds with physical dormancy {{is expected to increase}} towards more arid and unpredictable areas. There have been no previous studies evaluating both inter and intra-population variability in physical dormancy along <b>a</b> <b>precipitation</b> gradient.
