5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E

500|$|Designed in the Renaissance revival style, the {{building}} was finally completed in 1929 {{at the cost of}} $1,000,000 (today $). It typified the new [...] "synagogue-centers" [...] being built at that time, combining the functions of both a synagogue and community center, and included [...] "a synagogue, auditorium, kitchens, restaurant, classrooms, gymnasium, and swimming pool". That year Kaufman left the Center to become the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in Paterson, New Jersey, and Harry Halpern became East Midwood's rabbi.

500|$|Bundy {{underwent}} multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of <b>Psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New York University School of Medicine and {{an authority}} on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy [...] "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person... suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality... that was the day I was afraid of him.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Munchausen by Internet" [...] {{was first}} used in an article {{published}} in the Southern Medical Journal written by Marc Feldman in 2000. Feldman, a clinical professor of <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Alabama at Birmingham, gave a name to the phenomenon in 2000, but he co-authored an article on the topic two years earlier in the Western Journal of Medicine, using the description [...] "virtual factitious disorder". Factitious disorders are described in the [...] (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of factitious disorder is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called factitious disorder by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E
