The tapping stations are to be of small power ratings so that it will not interfere with the main control and stability of the HVDC network. Several research works have assumed tap-off of different percentages of the main HVDC terminal rating without justification. This paper therefore proposes a simple analytical technique used to determine <b>power</b> <b>tapping</b> limit on DC-link of a VSC HVDC network. Effect of <b>power</b> <b>tapping</b> below and above the analytical tap limit is illustrated by results from simulation carried out in Matlab/Simulink, hence validating the proposed technique...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Long extra {{high voltage}} (EHV) ac lines cannot be loaded to their thermal limits {{in order to}} keep {{sufficient}} margin against transient instability. With the scheme proposed in this paper, it is possible to load these lines very close to their thermal limits. The conductors are allowed to carry usual ac along with dc superimposed on it. The added dc power flow does not cause any transient instability. This paper gives the feasibility of converting a double circuit ac line into composite ac–dc power transmission line to get the advantages of parallel ac–dc transmission to improve stability and damping out oscillations. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out for the coordinated control as well as independent control of ac and dc power transmissions. No alterations of conductors, insulator strings, and towers of the original line are needed. Substantial gain in the load ability of the line is obtained. Master current controller senses ac current and regulates the dc current orders for converters online such that conductor current never exceeds its thermal limit Key words:- SIMULINK simulation, simultaneous ac–dc power transmission, small <b>power</b> <b>tapping.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{environmental}} right-of-way {{and cost}} concerns have delayed {{the construction of}} a new transmission line, while demand of electric power has shown steady but geographically uneven growth. The wheeling of the available energy through existing long ac lines to load centers has a certain upper limit due to stability considerations. Thus, these lines cannot be loaded to their thermal limit to keep sufficient margin against transient instability. This paper presents the concept of composite ac-dc power transmission. The conductors are allowed to carry usual ac along with dc superimposed on it. This paper also presents the feasibility of small <b>power</b> <b>tapping</b> from composite ac-dc power transmission lines which would pass over relatively small communities/rural areas having no access to a major power transmission network. It is economical compared to complicated methods of tapping from the HVDC line. The proposed scheme is digitally simulated with the help of MATLAB software package. Simulation results clearly indicate that the tapping of a small amount of ac power from the composite ac-dc transmission line has a negligible impact on the normal functioning of the composite ac-dc power transmission system...|$|E

40|$|Background: Doxorubicin (DOX), an {{anthracycline}} antibiotic, is {{a widely}} used anticancer agent. In spite of its high antitumor efficacy, the use of DOX in clinical chemotherapy is limited due to diverse toxicities, including gonadotoxicity. Objective: We investigated the protective effect of nano-zinc oxide (nZnO) as an established antioxidant on DOX-induced testicular disorders. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 24 adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including one control and three experimentals (6 rats per group). They received saline (as control), DOX alone (6 mg/kg body weight, i. p.), nZnO alone (5 mg/kg body weight, i. p.), and nZnO followed by DOX. Animals were sacrificed 28 days after treatment and evaluations were made by sperm count and measuring sex hormone levels in plasma. Also total antioxidant <b>power</b> (<b>TAP)</b> and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in plasma were tested. Data was analyzed with SPSS- 14 and one way ANOVA test.

Results: In the DOX-exposed rats significant differences were found compared with the control group (p= 0. 001) in plasma total antioxidant <b>power</b> (<b>TAP)</b> (425. 50 ± 32. 33 vs. 493. 33 ± 18. 54 mmol/mL), Lipid peroxidation (LPO) (3. 70 ± 0. 44 vs. 2. 78 ± 0. 68 μmol/mL), plasma testosterone (3. 38 ± 0. 69 vs. 5. 40 ± 0. 89 ng/dl), LH (0. 26 ± 0. 05 vs. 0. 49 ± 0. 18 mlU/mL), sperm count (157. 98 ± 6. 29 vs. 171. 71 ± 4. 42 × 106 /mL) and DNA damage (11. 51 ± 3. 45 vs. 6. 04 ± 2. 83 %).

Materials and Methods: Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 12 groups composing sham, control, and treated groups. Aging was induced by administration of D-galactose (500 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks). A positive control group was assigned that received vitamin E (200 mg/kg/day). The extract of herbs was prepared, lyophilized, and used in this study. The herbs were administered by gavage for 4 weeks to D-galactose-aged animals at the selected doses (mg/kg/day) as follows: Zingiber officinale (250), Glycyrrhiza glabra (150), Rosmarinus officinalis (300), Peganum harmala (50), Aloe vera (150), Satureja hortensis (200), Teucrium scordium (200), Hypericum perforatum (135) and Silybum marianum (150).

Furthermore, various anthropometric indices and blood pressure were measured using standard methods.

Results: Control respondents exhibited higher (P 0. 05) mean levels of the various biomarkers, except TAP level which was higher (P 0. 05) levels of the other biomarkers between diabetes patients and their control counterpart. Irrespective of diabetes, obesity, or hypertensive status, leptin associated positively with various measures of adiposity. Adiponectin correlated positively with leptin (R > 0. 38; P< 0. 05) only in the control respondents, suggesting a possible functional paradox of the adipocytokines in this group of respondents.
