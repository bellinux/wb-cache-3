Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of conventional concentrated stator <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> FRM and proposed full pitch winding FRM are carried out to validate the concept. Generator performance of full pitch winding FRM is compared with conventional concentrated stator <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> FRM. Full pitch winding arrangement increases the inductance of the machine which results in poor voltage regulation. Series capacitive compensation is provided to the machine for better voltage regulation. Output power of compensated full pitch winding FRM is approximately twice {{as that of the}} conventional concentrated stator <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> FRM.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} {{the measurement of}} static magnetic characteristics of a new winding configuration for Variable Reluctance (VR) machine. The concept of employing a double ring winding in a VR machine is investigated. This differed from the typically used single, half-pitched, salient <b>pole</b> <b>winding.</b> As a result of combining two ring windings to produce flux linkage in one-stator tooth the flux linkage is significantly increased. The magnetomotive force of the phase coil is increased {{as the number of}} turn increased. The {{increase in the number of}} turn is accommodated in the space around the stator ring. In this way, impressive forces can be expected from modestly sized VR machine. A variable inductor device was built to simulate the electromagnetic parameters of a VR machine in both single salient <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> and double ring winding configurations. The method employed for static magnetic characteristics measurement is based on the inductance measurement in terms of flux linkage per amps. Key-Words:- VR motor, magnetic characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The bulk-boundary correspondence, a {{topic of}} {{intensive}} research interest over the past decades, {{is one of the}} quintessential ideas in the physics of topological quantum matter. Nevertheless, it has not been proven in all generality and has in certain scenarios even been shown to fail, depending on the boundary profiles of the terminated system. Here, we introduce bulk numbers that capture the exact number of in-gap modes, without any such subtleties in one spatial dimension. Similarly, based on these 1 D bulk numbers, we define a new 2 D winding number, which we call the <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> number, that specifies the number of robust metallic surface bands in the gap as well as their topological character. The underlying general methodology relies on a simple continuous extrapolation from the bulk to the boundary, while tracking the evolution of Green's function's poles {{in the vicinity of the}} bulk band edges. As a main result we find that all the obtained numbers can be applied to the known insulating phases in a unified manner regardless of the specific symmetries. Additionally, from a computational point of view, these numbers can be effectively evaluated without any gauge fixing problems. In particular, we directly apply our bulk-boundary correspondence construction to various systems, including 1 D examples without a traditional bulk-boundary correspondence, and predict the existence of boundary modes on various experimentally studied graphene edges, such as open boundaries and grain boundaries. Finally, we sketch the 3 D generalization of the <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> number by in the context of topological insulators. Comment: 19 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{three phase}} flux {{reversal}} machine (FRM) is a doubly salient permanent magnet machine with concentrated windings. This study proposes the distributed winding for this machine. This winding (i. e. full pitch winding) offers high-power density and improves the efficiency. The permanent magnet (PM) flux linking the stator winding has effectively two or four pole flux pattern, which {{depends on the}} number of stator poles and independent of number of rotor poles. Finite element method (FEM) analysis is performed on the concentrated stator <b>pole</b> <b>winding</b> FRM (CSPFRM) and proposed full pitch winding FRM (FPFRM) to obtain induced EMF, flux linkages and inductance of the winding. The inductance of both machines is also obtained using winding function approach and compared with FEM results. The effect of armature reaction is compensated by capacitive series compensation to improve the voltage regulation. FEM analysis is also carried out on both the compensated generators to evaluate the power density. Speed of the flux pattern and that of the rotor is different in FRM. The ratio of these two speeds is termed as fictitious 'electrical gear'. FRM and permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) have sinusoidal terminal voltage and surface mounted PMs. The power density of both machines is compared using the concept of fictitious 'electrical gear'. To verify the above analysis, a 6 / 14 pole FRM with distributed and concentrated winding is designed and fabricated. The experimental results are in close agreement with simulated results...|$|E

However, the 12 / 10 - and 12 / 14 -pole alternate poles wound PS-DSPM machines suffer from higher phase back-EMF even harmonics, resulting larger torque ripple.
