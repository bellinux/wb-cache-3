40|$|Abstract [...] -Pashto {{is one of}} the {{national}} languages of "Afghanistan", and the home language of <b>Pushtuns</b> living in the "Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province " of "Pakistan " and many <b>Pushtuns</b> living in Baluchistan. Pashto language allows pronominal clitics to be inserted into morphological words. The clitics with this property are called endoclitics. This paper describes an account of Pashto Endoclitics generation which is an early stage of generation, Cliticization rules and the unique challenge posed by these clitics to the traditional syntactic theory. Pashto endoclitics are interesting, because they cannot be completely accounted for by syntax or prosody alone, but transcend different levels of grammar framework. In a natural generation task, the problem of clitic generation has to deal with syntax, prosody, and discourse constraints...|$|R

After his defeat, Mir Hussain Hotaki agreed to send <b>Pushtun</b> {{forces with the}} army of Nadir Shah. There were 12,000 Abdali (Durrani) and 4,000 <b>Pushtun</b> Khilji soldiers in this army. A hamlet of the Dalazak tribe was on the south bank of the Kabul River near present-day Pir Piai. The area along the river was forested at that time. When the Shah's forces reached this area they asked the Dalazak tribe to join their army, but they refused. Nadir Shah then ordered his army to destroy and burn the village, causing the Dalazaks to flee from the area. Nadir Shah awarded the area to Daulat Khan, his confidant.
