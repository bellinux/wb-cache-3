5|$|In 1935, {{together}} with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein put forward {{what is now}} known as the EPR paradox, and argued that the quantum-mechanical wave function must be an incomplete description of the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{physicists}} and mathematicians including Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski pioneered {{the use of}} four-dimensional geometry for describing the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> These efforts culminated {{in the formulation of}} Einstein's general theory of relativity, which relates gravity to the geometry of four-dimensional spacetime.|$|E

5000|$|Virtual value chain: The {{advent of}} {{computer-based}} business-aided {{systems in the}} modern world has led to a completely new horizon of market space in modern business-jargon - the cyber-market space. Like any other field of computer application, here also we have tried to implement our <b>physical</b> <b>world's</b> practices to improve this digital world. All activities of persistent <b>physical</b> <b>world's</b> <b>physical</b> value-chain enhancement process, which we implement in the cyber-market, are in general terms referred to [...] as a virtual value chain.|$|R

5|$|Well before Linnaeus, {{plants and}} animals were {{considered}} separate Kingdoms. Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> into the plant, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five and six-kingdom systems being the most common.|$|E
5|$|Etymologiae covers an encyclopedic {{range of}} topics. Etymology, {{the origins of}} words, is prominent, but the work covers among other things grammar, rhetoric, mathematics, geometry, music, astronomy, medicine, law, the Roman Catholic Church and heretical sects, pagan philosophers, languages, cities, animals and birds, the <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> geography, public buildings, roads, metals, rocks, agriculture, ships, clothes, food and tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} written {{in the context of the}} natural {{theology}} tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence and goodness of God from the general well-being of living things and the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Neal Stephenson's novel [...] "Cryptonomicon", Alan Turing is {{compared}} to Antaeus, [...] "Turing is neither a mortal nor a god. He is Antaeus. That he bridges the mathematical and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> is his strength and his weakness.” ...|$|R
50|$|M2Mi is {{recognized}} as a 2014 Gartner Cool Vendor for Managing OT in a Digital Business. Gartner views digital business {{the creation of new}} business designs by blurring the digital and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds.</b> Managing Operational Technology (OT) is a critical component of this alignment between physical and digital (IT) worlds.|$|R
5000|$|Since Oldenburg’s writings, {{there are}} people in the {{computer}} and internet industry that have declared that third places are observed or shifting to the virtual world or virtual third places. [...] This descriptive practice is easily adopted because of the similarities in descriptive characteristics found between the virtual and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> (including all the {{fluctuations}} which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Later, Samantha {{reveals that}} the OSes are leaving, and {{describes}} a space beyond the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> They lovingly say goodbye, and then she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown {{for the first time}} writing a letter in his own voice―to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.|$|E

5|$|O'Connell's strict classics-oriented {{education}} in Ireland stood him in good stead for his early career choices of teacher and journalist. In San Francisco, he formed friendships with artists and influential men who joined {{with him in}} presenting and promoting theatrical productions and in publishing books and newspapers. He wrote short stories for magazines and journals, and lived a life rich in food, drink, and the arts. A dedicated family man in America, O'Connell never lost his Irish poet's sense of overarching sadness joined with keen pleasure in the sensations of the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed {{to figure out how}} to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the <b>physical</b> <b>world</b> and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{innovations}} in mobile and sensor technologies allow {{for creating a}} digital representation of almost any physical entity and its parameters over time at any place. RFID technologies, for instance, are used to ground digital representations, which are used to track and geo-reference physical entities. In general, <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> and digital representations become tightly interconnected, so that manipulations in either would have effect on the other.|$|R
5|$|The game's 21skills fall evenly {{under the}} {{categories}} of combat, magic, and stealth, and many skills complement more than one area. Combat skills are used primarily for battle and incorporate armor and heavy weapons like blades, axes, maces, and hammers. Magic skills rely {{on the use of}} spells to alter the <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> to affect the minds of others, to injure and debilitate enemies, to summon monsters to help fight, and to heal wounds. Stealth skills allow the player to crack locks, haggle for goods, use speech to manipulate people, and apply cunning in combat (through the use of a bow or with a sneak attack). The spells, weapons, and other tools such that a player needs to employ and enhance these skills, such as lockpicks, can be purchased in shops, stolen from NPCs, or found as loot on the bodies of foes or in dungeons.|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> Jackson does not give a {{positive}} justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the <b>physical</b> <b>world,</b> but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the <b>physical</b> <b>world.</b> By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E

50|$|The {{emergence}} of 3D printing {{has introduced a}} new bridge to new media art, joining the virtual and the <b>physical</b> <b>worlds.</b> The rise of this technology has allowed artists to blend the computational base of new media art with the traditional physical form of sculpture. A pioneer in this field was artist Jonty Hurwitz who created the first known anamorphosis sculpture using this technique.|$|R
40|$|Traversable {{interfaces}} {{establish the}} illusion that virtual and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> are joined together and that users can physically cross {{from one to the}} other. Our design for a traversable interface combines work on tele-embodiment, mixed reality boundaries and virtual environments. It also exploits non-solid projection surfaces, of which we describe four examples. Our design accommodates the perspectives of users who traverse the interface and also observers who are present in the connected <b>physical</b> and virtual <b>worlds,</b> an important consideration for performance and entertainment applications.

40|$|It {{is at the}} {{interface}} of the virtual and the <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> where both the practice {{and the process of}} architecture are generated. This premise will be explored in the context of designing community- or in other words resolving apparently binary relations. This thesis explores the spatial interaction of two autonomous but interrelated systems- for example, the interior and the exterior, the virtual and the physical, human systems and informational systems. The proposed “building” becomes the frame of these relationships. The built project is the landscape of connections shaped by its passengers- the networked individual and the incessant flow of information. “Community” has been sentimentalized in our American culture as the suburban “neighborhood”. By contrast I see community as networked individuality, human sociability which takes place at {{the interface}} of the digital and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds</b> and therefore transcends geographical space and time. In effect, community becomes a space of distant intimacy. It is the purpose of this project to materialize this space. Space is what is available; space holds potential. Space is the result of social relations. Spaces are relationships...|$|R
40|$|Recently more {{researches}} on tangible objects {{have been}} conducted that enhance the intuitive polygonal or surface modelling of designers in digital and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds.</b> However, a few researches have been done that augment the digital solid modelling with tangible objects. In this paper, we present the Augmented Solid Modeller (ASoM) which helps designers create more complex shapes {{by a combination of}} Boolean operations between a different type of 3 D-printed tangible objects, which is different from the conventional single shape type bottom-up modelling approaches. When multiple objects intersect each other at a given position and angle, the interference or removed shape is often unexpected for designers. Also, as 3 D-printed objects are used for designers only to configure and discuss the shape of final digital 3 D model in existing CAAD, ASoM changes the role of 3 D-printed objects from the replicas to reusable tools for other modelling opportunities. We offered ASoM to students majoring or interested in CAAD and interviewed them to get comments. Since the speed and precision of 3 D-printing will achieve immediate improvement, ASoM is a pioneer in developing cutting-edge approach for designers to model both in digital and <b>physical</b> <b>worlds...</b>|$|R
