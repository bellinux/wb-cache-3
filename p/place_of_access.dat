6000|$|Before Christmas she had {{a natural}} {{opportunity}} to go to London; there was her periodical call upon her father to pay as well as a promise to Maggie to redeem. She spent her first night in West Kensington, with the idea of carrying out on the morrow the purpose that had most of a motive. Her father's affection was not inquisitive, but when she mentioned to him that she had business in the country that would oblige her to catch an early train, he deprecated her excursion in view of the menace of the weather. It was spoiling for a storm; all the signs of a winter gale were in the air. She replied that she would see what the morning might bring; and it brought, in fact, what seemed in London an amendment. She was to go to Maggie the next day, and now that she had started her eagerness had become suddenly a pain. She pictured her return that evening with her trophy under her cloak; so that after looking, from the doorstep, up and down the dark street, she decided, with a new nervousness, and sallied forth to the nearest <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the [...] "Underground." [...] The December dawn was dolorous, but there was neither rain nor snow; it was not even cold, and the atmosphere of West Kensington, purified by the wind, was like a dirty old coat that had been bettered by a dirty brush. At the end of almost an hour, in the larger station, she had taken her place in a third-class compartment; the prospect before her was the run of eighty minutes to Poynton. The train was a fast one, and she was familiar with the moderate measure of the walk to the park from the spot at which it would drop her.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the branch}} {{was the only}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to a {{financial}} institution's services. Services provided by a branch include cash withdrawals and deposits from a demand account with a bank teller, financial advice through a specialist, safe deposit box rentals, bureau de change, insurance sales (where it is allowed by law), etc. In the early 21st century, features such as automated teller machines (ATM), telephone and online banking, allow customers to bank from remote locations and after business hours. This has caused financial institutions to reduce their branch business hours and to merge smaller branches into larger ones. Conversely, they converted some into mini-branches with only ATMs for cash withdrawal and depositing; computer terminals for online banking and cheque depositing machines. Some mini-branches may have one or no human staff with only telephone support.|$|E

5000|$|U. S. Patent No. 1,470,728 {{for modern}} dropped {{ceilings}} {{was applied for}} by E. E. Hall on May 28, 1919 and granted on October 16, 1923. Initially modern dropped ceilings were built using interlocking tiles {{and the only way}} to provide access for repair or inspection of the area above the tiles was by starting at the edge of the ceiling, or at a designated [...] "key tile", and then removing contiguous tiles one at a time until the desired <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> was reached. Once the repair or inspection was completed, the tiles had to be reinstalled. This process could be very time-consuming and expensive. On September 8, 1958 Donald A. Brown of Westlake, Ohio filed for a patent for Accessible Suspended Ceiling Construction. This invention provided suspended ceiling construction in which access may readily be obtained at any desired location. Patent Number US 2,984,946 A was granted on May 23, 1961. Brown has sometimes been credited as being the inventor of the dropped ceiling [...] even though other patents preceded his as shown in the table below.|$|E

There is a shrine on Tsikumu with a few well-placed stones which define an area scattered with cornmeal and a deeply worn path in the bedrock. No special structure celebrates the sacredness of this place. Architecturally, it is understated, almost inconspicuous. Tsikumu is typical of Pueblo shrines in that it is visually disappointing. It is, nevertheless, a special place because it is a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the underworld from which the Pueblo People emerged. It is the doorway of communication between the many simultaneous levels of Pueblo existence. Tsikumu allows for a flow of energy between this plane of reality and other concurrent realities. Understanding the visual understatement of the Tsikumu shrine, and other Pueblo shrines, is important to understanding Pueblo sacred space.

The site held a {{particular}} significance for Fellowship members {{as it was}} the last remaining London home of the author and the location was valued for its personal association with Dickens, establishing a sense of ‘familial intimacy’ with the author. The museum was conceived both as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to Dickens and as a receptacle for the display of objects associated with him. Promotional material utilized a language of feeling, in which the museum’s founders stated their intention that the Museum would become ‘a veritable Dickens shrine, inspiring sentiment and inculcating a spirit of veneration for the great writer’. The items displayed were designed to produce an emotional response in the museum’s visitors and to serve as an act of commemoration to Dickens. This paper will explore both the extraordinary devotion which Dickens inspired and the forms by which he was memorialised and commemorated. It will evaluate the items chosen for display, from a replica of the Dingley Dell kitchen from 'The Pickwick Papers' (1836 – 37), to the various ‘Dickens relics’ which were collected, and the responses which they produced in early visitors. It will demonstrate that through their activities, writings, and establishment of the Dickens Museum, the Dickens Fellowship presented a particular version of Dickens’s legacy to the public: a nuanced and sentimental portrait of the author which remains in the popular imagination today...|$|E
