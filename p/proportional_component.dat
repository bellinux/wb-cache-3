2500|$|A mixed {{compensatory}} {{system is}} an electoral {{system that is}} mixed, meaning that it combines a plurality/majority formula with a proportional formula, and that uses the <b>proportional</b> <b>component</b> to compensate for disproportionality caused by the plurality/majority component. For example, suppose that a party wins 10 seats based on plurality, but requires 15 seats in total to obtain its proportional share of an elected body. A fully proportional mixed compensatory system would award this party 5 compensatory (PR) seats, raising the party's seat count from 10 to 15. The most prominent mixed compensatory system is mixed member proportional representation (MMP), used in Germany since 1949. In MMP, the seats won by plurality are associated with single-member districts.|$|E

MMP was originally used to elect representatives to the German Bundestag, which {{has also been}} adopted by Bolivia, Lesotho and New Zealand. It was used in Romania during its 2008 and 2012 legislative elections. MMP is a hybrid method that uses party list {{proportional representation}} (PR) as its <b>proportional</b> <b>component,</b> and most commonly (but not necessarily) first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) as its district component. It is considered a mixed system (also known as a hybrid system or a semi-proportional representation system), which is a distinct voting system. [...] "An electoral system is 'mixed' if more than one formula is employed to distribute legislative seats." [...] Biproportional apportionment, first used in Zürich in 2006, is a hybrid method for adjusting an election's result to achieve overall proportionality.|$|E

40|$|Although it may {{at first}} seem unimportant, the {{structure}} of excise taxes on cigarettes greatly affects the price of cigarettes, {{the structure of}} the consumption, but also the amount of the tax revenue. EU Directive 2011 / 64 /EU prescribes the combination of the specific and the proportional (ad valorem) excise tax on cigarettes. However, Member States independently determine the shares of one or another component in the overall excise tax structure, whereby the EU directive only prescribes the upper and the lower limit. The {{purpose of this article is}} to challenge several myths related to the cigarette taxation in the EU. The first one is that an increase of the specific component of the cigarette excise negatively affects the consumption of cigarettes, whereas this does not hold for the <b>proportional</b> <b>component.</b> The second assumption empirically tested in the paper is that an increase of the specific excise increases the government revenue from cigarette excises, whereby this can not be confirmed for the <b>proportional</b> <b>component.</b> Lastly, since both previous hypotheses have been confirmed, we tried to delve into reasons why certain countries 2 ̆ 013 despite obvious advantages of the specific in relation to proportional excise 2 ̆ 013 still predominantly rely on the latter. To this end, we tested the assumption that countries with domestic production of tobacco increasingly use proportional excises to increase the price gap between domestic (usually cheaper) and more expensive (imported/international) brands. The results of the empirical analysis were consistent with this hypothesis and confirmed that domestic tobacco production is a significant determinant of the structure of cigarette excises...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays {{two main}} {{approaches}} are being pursued to reduce energy consumption of network devices: {{the use of}} sleep modes in which devices can be put in low-power state, and the adoption of energy proportional approaches where the device architecture is designed to make energy consumption proportional to the actual load. In this paper, we formulate a theoretical model based on random graph theory to estimate the potential gains {{that can be achieved}} by adopting sleep modes in networks where energy proportional devices are deployed. Is sleep mode still a winning approach in these scenarios? We consider a simple model of the energy consumption of network devices: a fixed cost represents the static consumption and a variable cost describes the linear proportionality to the traffic load. Our results show that sleep modes are effective also in presence of load proportional solutions, even if traffic has to be routed on longer paths, unless the static power consumption component is of the same order of magnitude of the load <b>proportional</b> <b>component.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{vertical}} position {{system on the}} COMPASS–D tokamak is studied in this thesis. An analogue P+D controller is used to regulate the plasma {{vertical position}} which is open loop unstable. Measurements from inside the vessel are used for the derivative component of the control signal and external measurements for the <b>proportional</b> <b>component.</b> Two main sources of disturbances are observed on COMPASS–D. One source is 600 Hz noise from thyristor power supplies which cause large oscillations at the control amplifier output. Another source is impulse–like disturbances due to ELMs (Edge Localized Modes) and this can occasionally lead to loss of control when the control amplifier saturates. Models of the plasma open loop dynamics were obtained using the process of system identification. Experimental data is used to fit the coefficients of a mathematical model. The frequency response of the model {{is strongly dependent on}} the shape of the plasma. The effect of shielding by the vessel wall on external measurements when compared with internal measurements is also observed. The models were used to predict values of gain margins and phase crossover frequencies which were found to be in good agreement with measured values. The harsh reactor conditions on the proposed ITER tokamak preclude the use of internal measurements. On COMPASS–D the stability margins of the loop decrease when using only external flux loops. High order controllers were designed to stabilize the system using only external measurements and to reduce the effect of 600 Hz noise on the control amplifier voltage. The controllers were tested on COMPASS–D and demonstrated the improved performance of high order controllers over the simple P+D controller. ELMs cause impulse–like disturbances on the plasma position. The optimal controller minimizing the peak of the impulse response can be calculated analytically for COMPASS–D. A multiobjective controller which combines a small peak impulse response with robust stability and noise attenuation can be obtained using a numerical search.

In particular, {{we focus on the}} portfolio problem of a fund manager who wants to maximize the expected utility of his terminal wealth in a complete financial market. The fund manager must cope with a set of stochastic investment opportunities and with the uncertainty involved by the labor market. After introducing a stochastic interest rate, we assume a market structure characterized by three assets : a riskless asset, a bond and a stock. Moreover, we introduce a stochastic process for salaries, and develop the model according to the stochastic dynamic progamming methodology. We show that the optimal portfolio is formed by three components : a speculative <b>component</b> <b>proportional</b> to the market price of risk of the two risky assets through the relative risk aversion index, an hedging <b>component</b> <b>proportional</b> to the diffusion term of the interest rate, and a preference-free hedging <b>component</b> <b>proportional</b> to the volatilities of the salary process.

The 2000 election is an example of this phenomenon. Can the EC be reformed so that a referendum paradox never arises? We consider varying three natural parameters. First, we consider changing the method of apportioning seats in the House of Representatives to states. Second, we consider changing the total number of seats in the House. Intuition suggests that as the number of seats approaches the number of voters, the referendum paradox should disappear. Finally, we consider varying the fixed and <b>proportional</b> <b>components</b> of each state 2 ̆ 7 s EC vote. Using data from U. S. presidential elections we show that none of these reforms can prevent a referendum paradox from occurring.

40|$|A key {{property}} of CANDECOMP/PARAFAC {{is the essential}} uniqueness it displays under certain conditions. It {{has been known for}} a long time that, when these conditions are not met, partial uniqueness may remain. Whereas considerable progress has been made in the study of conditions for uniqueness, the study of partial uniqueness has lagged behind. The only well known cases are those of overfactoring, when more components are extracted than are required for perfect fit, and those cases where the data do not have enough system variation, resulting in <b>proportional</b> <b>components</b> for one or more modes. The present paper deals with partial uniqueness in cases where the smallest number of components is extracted that yield perfect fit. For the case of K x K x 2 arrays of rank K, randomly sampled from a continuous distribution, it is shown that partial uniqueness, with some components unique and others differing between solutions, arises with probability zero. Also a closed-form CANDECOMP/PARAFAC solution is derived for 5 x 3 x 3 arrays when these happen to have rank 5. In such cases, any two different solutions share four of the five components. This phenomenon will be traced back to a sixth degree polynomial having six real roots, any five of which can be picked to construct a solution. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

In this study, we focused on the spatial skill of map reading and the mathematical skill of proportional reasoning and investigated whether scaling, {{or the ability to}} relate information in different-sized representations, is a shared process. Scaling was experimentally manipulated in both tasks. In the map task, 4 - and 5 -year-olds (N= 50) were asked to point to the same position shown on a map in a larger referent space on a touch screen. The sizes of the maps were varied systematically, such that some trials required scaling and some did not (i. e., the map had {{the same size as the}} referent space). In the proportional reasoning task, children were presented with different relative amounts of juice and water and were asked to estimate each mixture on a rating scale. Again, some trials required scaling, but others could be solved by directly mapping the <b>proportional</b> <b>components</b> onto the rating scale. Children's absolute errors in locating targets in the map task were closely related to their performance in the proportional reasoning task even after controlling for age and verbal intelligence.

We used stable isotope ratios of δ 13 C and δ 15 N for turtle carapace scutes, where successive layers contain a chronological record of diet assimilated {{over a period}} of years. Turtles were sampled at 2 geographically separate foraging grounds in Japan: the temperate Main Islands (n = 32) and the sub-tropical Nansei Islands (n = 42). Site fidelity was inferred for the majority of turtles at each site (81 and 64 % resident turtles) because isotope data indicated diets consistent with food taxa at the respective sites. Immigrant turtles (previous diet outside their current site) were few (n = 4) at the Main Islands site but numerous (n = 14) at the Nansei Islands site, where they were significantly smaller than residents. An ontogenetic shift (Main Islands to Nansei Islands) was inferred for many of the immigrants on the basis of isotope evidence and body size. These immigrants corresponded to a size cohort that was relatively scarce in Main Islands foraging grounds according to previous studies. Bayesian mixing models, used to estimate <b>proportional</b> <b>components</b> of diet, showed varying degrees of imbalance between seagrass and algae and indicated that hypothetical consumption of non-trivial amounts of animal matter was plausible.

Characteristics of {{atmospheric turbulence}} are analyzed in relation to the stability or the wind speed at the height of 20 m in surface air layer.

W_ /U_ (ratio of the vertical mean wind speed to U_ at the height of 20 m) is independent of Ri. The standard deviation of the longitudinal wind speed (σ_U) is in direct proportion to the standard deviation of the lateral wind speed (σ_v). The relations between σ_U and σ_w (standard deviation of vertical wind speed) and between σ_v and σ_w are expressed with the two different equations, which have each transition point. Gustiness decreases with the increase of U_ below 8. 5 m/s (U_) and has a constant value above 8. 5 m/s. Gust factor for five minutes decreases with the increase of U_.
