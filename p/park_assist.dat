2500|$|Intelligent Parking Assist System (IPAS), {{also known}} as the Advanced Parking Guidance System (APGS) for Lexus models in the United States, is the first {{production}} automatic parking system developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in 1999 initially for the Japanese market hybrid Prius models and Lexus models.

On vehicles equipped with the IPAS, via an in-dash screen and button controls, the car can steer itself into a parking space with little input from the user. [...] The first version of the system was deployed on the Prius Hybrid sold in Japan in 2003. [...] In 2006, an upgraded version debuted for the first time outside Japan on the Lexus LS luxury sedan, which featured the automatic parking technology among other brand new inventions from Toyota. In 2009, the system appeared on the third generation Prius sold in the U.S. In Asia and Europe, the parking technology is marketed as the Intelligent <b>Park</b> <b>Assist</b> System for both Lexus and Toyota models, while in the U.S. the Advanced Parking Guidance System name is only used for the Lexus system.|$|E
