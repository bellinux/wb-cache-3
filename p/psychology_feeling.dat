He spoke, for instance, of family life as a battleground: [...] "I have always looked upon my parents as persecutors," [...] {{he wrote in a}} letter, and that [...] "All parents want to do is drag one down to them, back to the old days from which one longs to free oneself and escape."

40|$|Karl Popper {{described}} the human habitat {{in terms of}} three worlds, the physical world of rocks and trees, the second world of human <b>psychology,</b> <b>feelings,</b> hopes and subjective experiences and the third world of works of art, morality and social institutions. This third world is just as real as {{the first and second}} worlds. If we accept Popper‟s notion of the three worlds, and that there are overlaps between these three worlds, our moral actions and values will also be subject to the same kinds of consideration of a repertoire of behaviours exhibited in particular environments. Thus, if we accept that human relationships form one of the elements of the third world and given naturalistic connections between the three spheres then just as habits are developed in relation to the second world, it can be concluded that we will develop a set of behaviours which we employ in our relationships with others. That is to say that we will develop moral habits. Moreover, it is also apparent that our behaviours will also be dependent on the kind of moral habitat in which we find ourselves. There are three main problems to which this analysis leads and on which we will focus in this paper. Firstly, there is the problem of the kind of moral environment - habitat – that we need to provide for human beings if they are to develop the kinds of moral values that we hold to be important. Secondly, {{there is the question of}} how we are to develop the kinds of moral habits themselves and thirdly, there is the question of how these moral habits and habitat are to be maintained. If we take Popper seriously then human beings have a crucial responsibility in the creation of a moral third world – that is, a habitat in which human beings can flourish. I conclude that though there is no consensus about the kind of moral habitat human beings flourish best in, it is nevertheless vital to continue dialogue...|$|R

40|$|According to Alfred Adler, {{founder of}} Individual <b>Psychology,</b> a <b>feeling</b> of inferiority {{is in some}} degree common to all people. People {{who are unable to}} {{overcome}} these inferiority feelings by striving for cooperation may become discouraged. Although there are three scales to measure social interest, no scales measuring discouragement for adults was found. Additionally, Adler held basic assumptions regarding homosexuality, and the findings suggest that the assumptions should be reexamined. The {{purpose of this study was}} twofold. First, three University of North Texas candidates developed a discouragement scale for adults 18 years of age and older, known as the Discouragement Scale for Adults (DSA). Discouragement was examined relative to the five life tasks. Second, this candidate normed the instrument for the scores of gay male subjects and compared it to the scores of the other subject groups. Since the emphasis was on developing the instrument and norming it for various subject groups, no hypothesis was developed. Data was collected on three subject groups, known as the general norm subjects, the discouraged subjects, and the gay male subjects. Analyses were performed on the scores. Among the analyses, it was found that gay male subjects were slightly more discouraged than the general norm subjects, and the discouraged subjects were far greater discouraged than the other two subject groups. Initial reliability and validity was found to be high, offering support that the DSA is a reliable and valid instrument. The recommendations for further research include cultural and gender studies, predicting behavior, counseling intervention, and exploring the relationship between discouragement and stressors, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{dream and}} life-history data and {{research}} on American families in the US Northwest, this article argues that a contemporary US middle-class model that I call the Close Family prescribes child-rearing practices that alternate between adulation and audit. Adulation and auditing are forms of social mirroring that make what Lacan calls “the mirror phase” an enduring feature of American cultural <b>psychology</b> and produce <b>feelings</b> of porosity and dependence that compel defensive assertions of independence. Because these assertions are therefore common, they too {{take the form of}} a cultural model—the bounded person intrinsically separate from social context that Geertz and others associate with the West—yet this individualistic model is secondary, helping people deny and dissociate a more primary reaction. Models and defenses together, I argue, constitute cultural psychodynamics.

In order to scrutinize more precisely genre specific narratives of shame, the study furthermore considers how these emotion metaphors contribute to genre typical paradigm scenarios (de Sousa) of shame. These imply redundantly performed types of complex emotion situation in these genres, including a characteristic set of strategies to cope with shameful situations. Consequently the article will also touch normative effects of audiovisual emotion metaphors in standard narrative situations of shame...|$|R
40|$|Twentieth-century psychologists lauded Sigmund Freud (1856 - 1939) as the {{discoverer}} and "conquistador of the unconscious. " However, as Ludger Lükehaus {{argues in}} "Dieses wahre innere Afrika": Texte zur Entdeckung des Unbewussten vor Freud ("This True Inner Africa": Texts on the Discovery of the Unconscious before Freud, 1989), {{there were other}} explorers of such territories. Lütkehaus examines pre-Freudian psychologists, philosophers, and moralists, all of whom creatively approached {{the problem of the}} psyche. They also tended to embrace the racist and sexist commonsense of their times, as was the case when novelist Jean Paul called the unconscious a "true inner Africa," comparing the unruly regions of the mind to the so-called dark continent and its inhabitants. Lütkehaus positions Freud {{at the end of this}} history, characterizing him as a scientist who imposed techniques useful in the disciplining of the psyches of the inhabitants living within the metropole. As an alternative endpoint, my dissertation examines the work of Freud's contemporary, Robert Musil (1880 - 1942), and his "essayistic novel," Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (The Man without Qualities 1930, 33). I argue that Musil's novel satirizes the prejudices creating modern psychology in an effort to challenge epistemological forms of colonization occurring within Europe during his lifetime. My dissertation analyzes "this true inner Africa" in the context of German attempts to achieve self consciousness and Friedrich Nietzsche's critique of the ressentiment. These chapters establish the pre-Freudian history informing approaches to knowledge of the human in 1913 - 1914 Vienna, the setting of The Man without Qualities. The chapters that follow analyze psychological practices in the novel. I explicate three themes in The Man without Qualities: (1) Musil's re- presentation of the vivisecting of the psyche into moral and primitive territories; (2) his opposition to discourse privileging "superior" bourgeois Europeans as those able to master themselves and others; and (3) his experiment with a "psychology of <b>feeling.</b> " The <b>psychology</b> of <b>feeling</b> exposed a complex picture of the world which binaries created by scientists, moralists, and doctors had typically simplified.

40|$|Objectives: Psychological {{consultation}} {{is becoming}} increasingly common within older adult mental health and dementia services. However, {{there is very little}} research that examines the impact or effectiveness of this method of working. This study explored how psychological consultation impacted on the daily practice of staff working on mental health and dementia inpatient units. It also examined the mechanisms that enabled this process. Method: Given the lack of current literature in this area, an exploratory qualitative design was employed. Ten staff who had received psychological consultation were individually interviewed. Staff comprised qualified and unqualified staff from a range of professions, and worked on older adult mental health or dementia units. Interviews were subject to thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified from the analysis: (1) ‘It makes you understand the reasons why people are like they are’; (2) ‘It depends on the patient or service user’; (3) the importance of visibility and accessibility; (4) impact of psychology consultation on the effectiveness of the team; and (5) impact of <b>psychology</b> consultation on <b>feelings</b> invoked in the workplace. Conclusions: The findings suggest that psychological consultation impacted on staffs’ daily practice in a variety of ways. Psychological consultation also appeared to increase team efficiency. Less positive findings were identified within the dementia setting. Specific recommendations are drawn from the conclusions to further guide clinical psychologists working within teams.

50|$|Historian Kenneth Scott Latourette {{argues that}} the outlook for Protestantism {{at the start of}} the 19th century was discouraging. It was a {{regional}} religion based in northwestern Europe, with an outpost in the sparsely settled United States. It was closely allied with government, as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Prussia, and especially Great Britain. The alliance came at the expense of independence, as the government made the basic policy decisions, down to such details as the salaries of ministers and location of new churches. The dominant intellectual currents of the Enlightenment promoted rationalism, and most Protestant leaders preached a sort of deism. Intellectually, the new methods of historical and anthropological study undermine automatic acceptance of biblical stories, as did the sciences of geology and biology. Industrialization was a strongly negative factor, as workers who moved to the city seldom joined churches. The gap between the church and the unchurched grew rapidly, and secular forces, based both in socialism and liberalism undermine the prestige of religion. Despite the negative forces, Protestantism demonstrated a striking vitality by 1900. Shrugging off Enlightenment rationalism, Protestants embraced romanticism, with the stress on the personal and the invisible. Entirely fresh ideas as expressed by Friedrich Schleiermacher, Soren Kierkegaard, Albrecht Ritschl and Adolf von Harnack restored the intellectual power of theology. There was more attention to historic creeds such as the Augsburg, the Heidelberg, and the Westminster confessions. The stirrings of pietism on the Continent, and evangelicalism in Britain expanded enormously, leading the devout away from an emphasis on formality and ritual and toward an inner sensibility toward personal relationship to Christ. From the religious point of view of the typical Protestant, major changes were underway in terms of a much more personalized religiosity that focused on the individual more than the church or the ceremony. The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the <b>psychology</b> and <b>feeling</b> of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfuness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. Pietistic revivals were common among Protestants. Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service. Above all, worldwide missionary activity became a highly prized goal, proving quite successful in close cooperation with the imperialism of the British, German, and Dutch empires.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to convey a psycho-social and experiential {{understanding}} of the lived experience of trans-racial adoption. As a woman that was adopted as a baby from Malaysia by Caucasian parents during the 1970 s, the personal experience of the phenomenon of trans-racial adoption has been integral to the theoretical foundations and overall research approach of this study. The primary {{aim of this}} study has been one that has sought to deepen understanding of the affective dimensions involved in being a trans-racially adoptive family member from both the perspective of the adoptive mother and the adoptee. The concept of trans-racial adoptive subjectivity is informed by phenomenological and psychoanalytic thinking and assumes an embodied subject that is embedded in a relational and material world. The analytical focus therefore prioritises understanding the historical, social and political processes that engage the body in particular ways that we can understand as being trans-racially adopted. The research framework assumes a psycho-social methodological framework that has prioritised depth of understanding experience. Six sets of trans-racially adopted adults and their adoptive mothers were engaged where each family members was interviewed over a period of six months, four times each. Influenced by the relational psychoanalytic tradition, the notion of inter-subjectivity was central to the methodological process. The research interview encounters therefore assumed a two person <b>psychology</b> where the <b>feelings</b> I experienced as the researcher were considered as important forms of research data. An inter-subjective dialogue enabled the method to go beyond purely the discursive and recognise the complex layers of unconscious forms of defence that are understood as being the multi-dimensions of experience. The empirical chapters have been presented in three separate analytical chapters entitled: Race, Class and Loss. In theorising an embodied subject, I have emphasised in this interpretation of trans-racial adoptive experience the inter-connection between these three analytical categories. That whilst presented as separate categories, the presentation of the experience in each empirical chapter has aimed to demonstrate the fluidity involved {{in the process of being}} trans-racially adopted...|$|R
40|$|We are {{presenting}} in {{this paper}} a study about general practitioners' behaviours and attitudes towards the cancer patients they take care of. To begin with, the approaching methods are presented in a critical way. The choice of these methods finds an explanation {{in the fact that}} we were looking for an information as near as possible to the real physicians' behaviours and supplying, at the same time, an important material, giving us the opportunity to undertake an interpretative analysis of the different medical cases about cancer patients (64) written by some (12) of the general practitioners (31) who had been interviewed before about cancer in their medical practice. We have tried, particularly, to point out and to illustrate with some examples the specific contribution of a chosen method compared with another one; for instance, the interviews compared to the written questionnaire, and the medical cancer cases written by the physicians compared to the interviews realized with the same general practitioners. In this paper we are also trying to report the preoccupations, the difficulties and the theoretical and methodological problems which appeared during the process of this research. Concerning the findings of this study, it is possible to assert that the main hypothesis seems coherent with the collected information: it really seems that cancer, with its social image in which fear for suffering and for dying prevail, is for the general practitioner a borderline situation in which his personal <b>psychology</b> and his <b>feelings</b> seem to play a more important part than his medical knowledge. In this 'drama', his previous relationship to his patient, the type of cancer involved, the patient's social and family background, the way in which he represents his profession, his medical experience, as well as his specialists network, also play an important part. If cancer is a challenge for the general practitioner, it seems that it is especially a challenge for the image he has of himself as a physician, but also as a human being, precisely because the part he can play concerning the therapeutics is very small. So, unlike the thesis of some authors, we think that the general practitioners (as a result also of a widely spread adhesion to values of a non-technical idea of his practice) can assume a determinant function, by advising the patient, by doing in the same time a good following up of the disease he suffers from, and by keeping with him a good relationship, which he often qualifies as 'interesting'. ...|$|R
