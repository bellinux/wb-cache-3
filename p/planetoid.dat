5|$|The {{commercial}} {{space tug}} Nostromo is on a return trip to Earth with a seven-member crew in stasis: Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt), Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm) and two Engineers, Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton). Detecting a transmission {{from the nearby}} <b>planetoid</b> LV-426, the ship's computer, Mother, awakens the crew. Company policy requires crews to investigate such transmissions, so they land on the <b>planetoid,</b> sustaining damage from its atmosphere and rocky landscape. Parker and Brett repair the ship while Dallas, Kane and Lambert head out to investigate. They discover the signal comes from a derelict alien spacecraft and head inside it, losing communication with Ash. Inside, they find {{the remains of a}} large alien creature.|$|E

The restricted three-body problem solution predicted the Trojan <b>planetoids</b> before they were first seen. The -circles and closed loops echo the electromagnetic fluxes issued from the Sun and Jupiter. It is conjectured, contrary to Richard H. Batin's conjecture (see References), the two [...] are gravity sinks, in and where gravitational forces are zero, and the reason the Trojan <b>planetoids</b> are trapped there. The total amount of mass of the <b>planetoids</b> is unknown.|$|R

The data taken between January and May of that year did not show any vulcanoids brighter than magnitude 7. This corresponds to a diameter of about , assuming the asteroids have an albedo similar to that of Mercury. In particular, a large <b>planetoid</b> at a distance of 0.18 AU, predicted by the theory of scale relativity, was ruled out.|$|E
5|$|O'Bannon {{had written}} 29 {{pages of a}} script titled Memory, {{containing}} {{what would become the}} opening scenes of Alien: a crew of astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been interrupted because they are receiving a signal from a mysterious <b>planetoid.</b> They investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface. He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of the story would be.|$|E

5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a <b>planetoid</b> where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy <b>planetoid</b> with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Alien led 20th Century Fox to finance three direct sequels {{over the next}} {{eighteen}} years, each by different writers and directors. Sigourney Weaver remained the only recurring actor through all four films: {{the story of her}} character Ripley's encounters with the Aliens became the thematic and narrative core of the series. James Cameron's Aliens (1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the <b>planetoid</b> accompanied by marines to confront hordes of Aliens. David Fincher's Alien 3 (1992) had nihilistic tones and found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately sacrificing herself to prevent her employers from acquiring the creatures. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection (1997) saw Ripley resurrected through cloning to battle more Aliens even further in the future.|$|E

5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien <b>planetoid,</b> and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started being seen as the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and <b>planetoid,</b> started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels through {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains <b>planetoids</b> and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the <b>planetoids,</b> walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|R
25|$|Worlds {{represent}} {{a wide spectrum}} of conditions, from barren <b>planetoid</b> moons to large gas giant worlds, from uncolonized territory to planets with tens of billions of people. Most worlds tend to be only modestly colonized, though some worlds may be dangerously overcrowded.|$|E
25|$|The leading {{theory of}} the Moon's origin is the giant impact theory, which postulates that Earth was once hit by a <b>planetoid</b> the size of Mars; such a theory is able to explain the size and {{composition}} of the Moon, something not done by other theories of lunar formation.|$|E
25|$|Earth was {{initially}} molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer {{layer of the}} planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere.

40|$|Hypotheses for {{the origin}} of chondrules fall into two broad groups: nebular and planetary. Arguments against the latter have prevailed in recent years such that, by default, the less {{testable}} nebular setting for chondrule formation is now generally favored. However, the recognition in ordinary chondrites of igneous clasts that probably formed on, or in, small <b>planetoids</b> hints that some parent bodies were still accreting after others had evolved magmatically and lost material to space, presumably by impact. If melting of <b>planetoids</b> can predate accretion, could the same early melting even be related to chondrule production? My affirmative response to this interesting question is expanded here in a chondrule-forming scenario, which incorporates both planetary and nebular features...|$|R

25|$|Triton, {{the largest}} moon of Neptune, can be {{explained}} if it was captured in a three-body interaction involving the disruption of a binary <b>planetoid.</b> Such binary disruption {{would be more likely}} if Triton was the smaller member of the binary. However, Triton's capture would be more likely in the early Solar System when the gas disk would damp relative velocities, and binary exchange reactions would not in general have supplied the large number of small irregulars.|$|E
25|$|As the {{smallest}} known celestial body {{with its own}} ring system, Chariklo and its rings {{are the first to}} have been fully simulated by numerically solving the N-body problem. The assumptions made included the <b>planetoid</b> and ring particles being spherical, and all particles having equal radii between 2.5 and 10m. Depending on parameters, the simulations involved between 21 million and 345 million particles interacting with each other through gravity and collisions. The goal of the simulations was to assess under what conditions the rings remain stable, that is do not cluster into few bigger bodies.|$|E
25|$|Earth was {{initially}} molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer {{layer of the}} planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly {{as a result of}} the impact of a large <b>planetoid</b> with the Earth. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. More recent potassium isotopic studies suggest that the Moon was formed by a smaller, high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact cleaving off a significant portion of the Earth. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans.|$|E
