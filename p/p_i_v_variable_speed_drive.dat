Two strategies will be developed jointly: on one hand the development of ‘‘platform’’ molecules entering the traditional circuits of chemistry, on the current markets with the renewable character, in addition, the development of new molecules having new properties, thus giving access to new markets. Thanks to the research and development realized by researchers dedicated to <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>V.</b> E. R.

40|$|Cardiac {{sodium channel}} {{is a complex}} which {{includes}} the poreforming alpha subunit and regulatory proteins that allow sodium influx during the depolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. The alpha subunit, Nav 1. 5, is encoded by SCN 5 A. Mutations in this gene are responsible for {{a wide spectrum of}} hereditary arrhythmias such as cardiac conduction disease and atrial fibrillation. A mutation in SCN 5 A, leading to a <b>p.</b> <b>I</b> 141 <b>V</b> substitution, was identified in a large multigenerational family with an arrhythmia syndrome resembling catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia through whole-exome sequencing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the molecular mechanisms linking the <b>p.</b> <b>I</b> 141 <b>V</b> mutation to this arrhythmia. To evaluate the incidence of this substitution on Nav 1. 5 function, whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed on HEK 293 cells transfected with the human alpha and beta subunits. The presence of the <b>p.</b> <b>I</b> 141 <b>V</b> mutation shifted the voltage-dependence of steady state activation towards more negative potentials. Thus, we studied the effect of this mutation on the sodium window current. Compared to the WT, the <b>p.</b> <b>I</b> 141 <b>V</b> window current exhibited a larger peak and this peak was shifted towards more negative potentials. To investigate the functional consequences of the cardiac hyperexcitability due to the <b>p.</b> <b>I</b> 141 <b>V</b> mutation, we incorporated biophysical properties of the mutant into atrial, Purkinje and ventricular cell models. The computational analyses imply that the biophysical changes caused by the <b>p.</b> <b>I</b> 141 <b>V</b> mutation accelerates the spontaneous rate in the Purkinje cell model, and reduce the excitation threshold leading to an increase of the excitability of the cardiac cells.

In this study, complex shear flows are observed by <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>V.</b> measurements (Particle Image Velocimetry) of a large diameter ratio annular jet. These jets present a lot of strong instabilities which become a real handicap on industrial processes (burners, glass fibers process, cooling system…). The fundamental interest of the P. O.

40|$|The {{front part}} of many bluff bodies {{contains}} rounded edges, which lead {{to the formation of}} separation bubbles. The separated flow inside these bubbles is highly unstable causing unsteadiness and turbulence. The ability to predict and control the dynamical behaviour of these separations is of great practical importance. The existence of separation bubbles on rounded front edges of bluff bodies contributes to the overall drag of the body. Its reduction is closely related to the control of the eddying wake flow caused by flow separation. While the influence of adverse pressure gradients on separation bubbles has been studied extensively, studies on the influence of flow geometry remain scarce. The aim {{of this study is to}} get a better understanding of the physical mechanisms which control this phenomenon on curved bodies Complementary measurements based on flow visualizations, <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>V.</b> technique and hot-film data acquisition are presented to analyse the dynamic behaviour of separation bubbles.

The suppression was significantly marked at antigen doses ranging from 1 X 10 (6) [...] 1 X 10 (9) SRBC but not at 5 X 10 (9) SRBC. As little as 56 microgram C. parvum caused a marked suppression of the response to 1 X 10 (8) SRBC. In secondary responses C. parvum given either one day before priming with 1 X 10 (8) SRBC or one day before secondary challenge caused a dramatic suppression of both IgM and IgG PFC responses. In contrast with <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> injected C. parvum, <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> injection of the vaccine enhanced immune responses to <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> or <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> injected SRBC. Similarly C. parvum injected <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> prior to <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> immunization resulted in an augmented anti-SRBC response. An enhancement of anti-SRBC response was also noted when C. parvum was injected <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> {{on the day of}} <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> immunization. The suppressed responses in C. parvum injected animals could be explained partly by the reduced splenic localization of the antigen...|$|R

We will denote {{the set of}} vertices by V (G) respectively by V and the set of edges by E(G), respectively by E if no confusion is possible. Furthermore we will denote the vertices of a graph G by numbers (V (G) = f 1; 2; : : :; ng), the adjacency matrix of G by AG.

40|$|Two new {{isolates}} of bovine lentivirus, {{also known}} as bovine immunodeficiency-like virus (BIV), were obtained from a seropositive cattle herd in Florida. This is the first report of new isolates of BIV since the original BIV strain, R 29, was isolated in 1 % 9. The two new BIV isolates were derived from blood butFy coat cells cocultivated in vitro with fetal bovine lung cell cultures. The new isolates differed in vitro from the original R 29 isolate in replication and syncytium formation in fetal bovine lung cells. Both new isolates were confirmed as BIV by immunofluorescence assay, Western blotting (immunoblotting), and polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analyses of the polymerase chain reaction pol gene product showed 92. 6 and 93. 670 homology to the published nucleotide sequence of BIV R 29 - 127, a molecular clone derived from BIV R 29. Each of the new BIV isolates was inoculated into two calves, and virus was recovered between 5 and 10 days postinoculation (<b>p.</b> <b>i.),</b> with BIV seroconversion between 10 and 21 days <b>p.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>V</b> <b>i</b> s was recoverable and antibody was detectable for at least 4 months <b>p.</b> <b>i.</b> Two calves developed a transiently elevated mononuclear cell count, similar to what was reported for BIV R 29 in the original experimental calf inoculations.

40|$|Abstract:- Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (P. O. D.) is a {{technique}} used for analysis of vortex structures in a turbulent flow. In this study, complex shear flows are observed by <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>V.</b> measurements (Particle Image Velocimetry) of a large diameter ratio annular jet. The annular jet {{is an example of}} complex shear flow situations. Two axisymmetric shear layers, originating at the jet exit, one at the nozzle lip and the other at the centre body, eventually meet downstream or interact with each other. The main aim {{of this study is to}} observe and analyze the effects of active control using acoustic waves on an annular jet with a great diameter ratio (r = 0. 91), in order to find a new way to reduce jet instabilities. This contribution discusses the application of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to the <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>V.</b> (Particle Image Velocimetry) velocity fields of an annular jet and on a statistic of time resolved tomographic images of the initial zone of the annular jet. Acoustic waves are then applied on the annular jet with different frequencies (fundamental, first harmonic…). Measurements are conducted with a Reynolds number ReDo= 107800. The fluctuation frequency of the stagnation point is known for this Reynolds number. The Strouhal number corresponding to this frequency is StDo = 0. 27. The P. O. D. analysis applied on a natural annular jet and an excited annular jet enables us to see the importance of the triggering of the acoustic wave with the stagnation point motion. An active control is therefore necessary to use acoustic excitation to reduce instabilities in the initial zone of these turbulent jets. Active control has already been used with round jets and has given promising results, but only a few studies have bee...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{suspensions}} of heat-killed Mycobacterium leprae in {{a dose of}} 10 (7) organisms {{were highly}} immunogenic when injected intradermally (i. d.). The same dose of bacteria did not sensitize when given intraperitoneally (<b>i.</b> <b>p.)</b> or intravenously (<b>i.</b> <b>v.),</b> and did so only minimally at best when given subcutaneously. The i. d. route was the most immunogenic for sheep erythrocytes also. M. leprae injected <b>i.</b> <b>p.</b> or <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> stimulated immune tolerance to M. leprae challenge i. d. In older mice (greater {{than or equal to}} 8 weeks), the <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> injections gave more complete tolerance. Mice that had been rendered tolerant by <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> injections maintained their tolerance for at least 168 days. Prior UV irradiation of intact mice prevented sensitization by the i. d. route. In normal mice, living M. bovis BCG given i. d. produced good sensitization to M. leprae. Mice that had been made tolerant by <b>i.</b> <b>v.</b> injection of M. leprae could be partially sensitized to M. leprae by i. d. immunization with BCG; mixtures of living BCG and heat-killed M. leprae were no more effective than BCG alone. These findings appear to have relevance to the pathogenesis of lepromatous leprosy and its immunoprophylaxis...|$|R
