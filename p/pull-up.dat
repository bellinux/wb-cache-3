5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, <b>pull-up</b> broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. <b>Pull-up</b> machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|The idle line {{state is}} when the device is {{connected}} to the host with a <b>pull-up</b> on either D+ and D−, with transmitter output on both host and device is set to high impedance (hi-Z) (disconnected output).|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic <b>pull-up</b> dive brakes under both wings {{to ensure that the}} aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time that Wetness Liner was renamed Cool Alert, <b>Pull-Ups</b> {{introduced}} Night Time <b>Pull-Ups.</b> The Night Time <b>Pull-Ups</b> were very much like a regular <b>Pull-Ups</b> pant, except it has more absorbency, and they have bedtime designs featuring Disney's Princess Rapunzel and Doc McStuffins characters for girls and Cars and Jake and the Never Land Pirates characters for boys. The Night Time <b>Pull-Ups</b> are not available in the 4T-5T size.|$|R

25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors can {{be printed}} directly onto {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) substrates {{as part of the}} PCB manufacturing process. Although this technique is more common on hybrid PCB modules, it can also be used on standard fibreglass PCBs. Tolerances are typically quite large, and can be in the order of 30%. A typical application would be non-critical <b>pull-up</b> resistors.|$|E
25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent chip select line for each slave. A <b>pull-up</b> resistor between power source and chip select line is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (high, low or high-impedance).|$|E
25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a <b>pull-up</b> resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own chip select line to sense that the host device had selected it.|$|E

50|$|Chin-ups, {{like most}} <b>pull-ups,</b> target the latissimus dorsi muscle {{of the back}} as a {{shoulder}} extensor, scapular downward rotator and scapular depressor, in bringing the spine to the humerus. This is assisted by elbow flexors (brachialis, brachioradialis, biceps brachii) which bring the humerus to the forearm. Chin-ups, unlike <b>pull-ups,</b> also highly target the biceps. That {{is one of the}} main differences between <b>pull-ups</b> and chin-ups.|$|R
25|$|In Game 7 of the 1981 Eastern Conference finals {{against the}} rival Philadelphia 76ers, the Sixers led all game. Inside the final minute, Boston and Philadelphia were tied 89–89 when Bird sank a fast-break {{mid-range}} <b>pull-up</b> bank shot {{with his left}} hand, a very difficult shot to execute under intense pressure. That basket put the Celtics up 91–89. The Sixers {{had a chance to}} win the game, but threw away the lob inbounds pass intended for Julius Erving. The Celtics' 91–90 win put them into the NBA Finals {{for the first time since}} 1976 and they would go on to win the NBA championship in the Finals, beating the Houston Rockets in 6 games. In the late stages of the game, Bird also had two key steals, two free throws made, a rebound, and a blocked shot.|$|E
25|$|Forty-one {{games into}} the season, Westbrook was {{averaging}} 30.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 10.5 assists per game, marking the latest anyone had averaged a triple-double since Robertson in 1966–67, {{when he became}} the first player to average a triple-double for an entire season (30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists). On January 15, 2017, Westbrook had 36 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his 20th triple-double of the season, as he helped the Thunder defeat the Sacramento Kings 122–118. He joined Robertson (five times) and Wilt Chamberlain (twice) as the only players in NBA history to record 20 triple-doubles in a season. His 21st triple-double of the season came on January 18 in a loss to former teammate Durant and the Golden State Warriors. On January 23, Westbrook hit a <b>pull-up</b> jumper with 1.4 seconds left to lift the Thunder to a 97–95 win over the Utah Jazz. He finished with 38 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his 22nd triple-double of the season and No. 59 for his career, tying Larry Bird for fifth on the career list. Two days later, he had 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 114–105 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, thus passing Bird with his 60th career triple-double. Heading into All-Star Weekend, Westbrook was averaging 31.1 points, 10.5 rebounds and 10.1 assists in 57 games. Westbrook went on to record three straight triple-doubles coming out of the All-Star break, giving him 67 for his career and 30 on the season. On March 7, Westbrook's career-high 58 points wasn't enough to lift the Thunder over the Portland Trail Blazers, losing 126–121. His 31st triple-double of the season, which came on March 9 against the San Antonio Spurs, matched Wilt Chamberlain's 1967–68 campaign for the second-most in a season. He surpassed Chamberlain's record with his 32nd triple-double on March 11 against the Jazz. Westbrook went on to tie Robertson's single-season record of 41 triple-doubles on April 4 against the Milwaukee Bucks. Westbrook also moved into a tie with Chamberlain for fourth on the career list with his 78th triple-double. Three days later, he joined Robertson (in 1961–62) as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season, needing just six assists against the Phoenix Suns to clinch the triple-double average. His historic 42nd triple-double, to break Robertson's record of most triple-doubles in a season, came in a 106–105 away victory against the Denver Nuggets on April 9. Westbrook scored 18 of his 50 points in the last five minutes, including a 36-foot game-winning buzzer-beater, to overcome a 14-point deficit. As a result, Westbrook moved into fourth place for most triple-doubles in NBA history with 79, surpassing Chamberlain's 78. It was his third career 50-point triple-double, all of which came in 2016–17, the most by any player in NBA history. The Thunder finished the regular season with a 47–35 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 6 seed.|$|E

500|$|End of Packet (EOP): EOP is {{indicated}} by the transmitter driving 2 bit times of SE0 (D+ and D− both below max.) and 1bit time of Jstate. After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D− lines and the aforementioned <b>pull-up</b> resistors hold it in the J (idle) state. Sometimes skew due to hubs can add {{as much as one}} bit time before the SE0 of the end of packet. This extra bit can also result in a [...] "bit stuff violation" [...] if the six bits before it in the CRC are 1s. This bit should be ignored by receiver.|$|E
500|$|The {{second half}} began with another jump ball {{between the two}} {{competing}} teams. Chamberlain won the tip as Carolina sent out Quigg to contest the jump rather than Kearns like in the first tipoff. Both teams failed to score on their first possession, but after Carolina missed their opening shot, Kansas scored on a fast-break <b>pull-up</b> shot. Kansas scored once more [...] from a lob to Chamberlain [...] before the Tar Heels were able to score with a baseline jump shot from Quigg to bring the score 3126. Kansas closed the lead to 31–30 with a basket {{and a pair of}} free throws from Chamberlain. Carolina's Kearns returned with an acrobatic layup to extend the lead to three points.|$|E

[...] Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including one in particular in which he does a <b>pull-up</b> onto the roof to kiss his partner. All previous scenes are intercut before culminating with Usher seducing his partner in bed, in racy moments with Usher in nothing but briefs as he pulls off her stockings. The final scene sees the singer driving off in a convertible.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, the night of September 4, North Korean troops established a bridgehead across the Naktong River and were using it to advance across the river and attack Taegu, where the UN's Eighth United States Army was headquartered in defense of the perimeter. On September 5, a T-6 Mosquito forward air controller spotted a North Korea column advancing through the village of Hamchang. Sebille was ordered to lead a flight of three F-51's on an airstrike against the North Korean troops advancing there. Sebille flew a P-51 (tail number 44-74394) loaded with two [...] bombs, six rockets, and six M2 Browning [...]50 caliber machine guns. He and his wingmen, Captain Martin Johnson and Lieutenant Charles Morehouse, approached the village at an altitude of [...] and spotted a North Korean armored column crossing the river in a shallow area. Sebille positioned himself for a medium-angle dive bomb run, planning to drop both of his bombs on his first attack. Diving, he held steady until about [...] When he spotted a target column of trucks, artillery guns and armored cars, led by a North Korean Armored Personnel Carrier, he hit the bomb release button on his control stick, and then made a sharp <b>pull-up</b> to the left to stay away from his bomb blast. However, only one of his bombs had released, and the [...] of unbalanced weight under his left wing may have contributed to his near miss on the first run.|$|E
