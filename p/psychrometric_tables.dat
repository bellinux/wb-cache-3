40|$|We {{discuss the}} physics of the pot-in-pot cooler. By {{balancing}} temperature decrease due to evaporation and temperature increase due to heat exchange, we find the equilibrium temperature of the pot. In this simplified model, the cooling jug acts as a psychrometer, and the theoretical prediction of our model is in a good agreement with <b>psychrometric</b> <b>tables.</b> Next, we study dynamics of the jug cooling. The cooling rate is limited by water vapour diffusion through air, heat conduction through air, and heat conduction through {{the body of the}} jug. The derived rate of temperature decrease is in general agreement with the result of our experiment. In the end, we discuss some additional factors, such as capillary effects in the raw clay, water viscosity in the capillaries, and impact of complex shape of the jug. Comment: 10 page...|$|E
