2500|$|British {{test pilot}} Eric [...] "Winkle" [...] Brown flew Fw 190A-4/U8 jabo version. Brown commented {{the view from}} the cockpit was better than in the Spitfire, P-51 Mustang and the Bf 109 owing to the nose down {{position}} of the aircraft in flight. The sloping frontal windscreen provided 50mm of protection. [...] A further 8mm armoured seat and 13mm head and shoulder armour afforded the Fw 190 pilot great protection. Take off was easy; 10° of flap and power to 2,700rpm and 23.5lb in. boost made the run very similar to the Spitfire IX. Un-stick was found to be 112mph and the fighter had a habit of swinging to <b>port.</b> <b>Speed</b> in the climb was set at 161mph, a rate of 3,000 feet per minute. Brown praised the lack of trimming requirements in flight. However, Brown criticised the lack of trim controls. If a member of the ground crew had moved the tab, or it had been adjusted from another source, it could result in an out-of-trim flight performance at high speeds. Brown praised the high rate of roll. Aileron response was excellent from stall up until 400mph (644km/h), when they became heavy. The elevators were heavy at all speeds, particularly above 350mph (563km/h) when they became heavy enough to impose tactical restrictions on the fighter as regards to pullout from low-level dives. The heaviness was accentuated because of nose down pitch which occurred at high speeds when trimmed for low-speeds. Brown praised the fighter overall; its control harmony [...] was superb. The solid gun platform also made it a potent dogfighter. Brown listed some limitations; it was difficult to read and fly on instruments (why is not explained) and it had harsh stall characteristics. Stall speed was a high 127mph (204km/h). Stall came without warning. The port wing drops violently that the 190 almost inverts itself. If it was pulled into a G-turn it would spin into the opposite banking turn and an incipient spin was the result. Landing stall on the Fw 190 was much more easily dealt with; the intense buffeting resulted in the wing dropping to starboard gently, at roughly 102mph (164km/h).|$|E

50|$|Serial ports use {{two-level}} (binary) signaling, so {{the data}} rate in {{bits per second}} {{is equal to the}} symbol rate in baud. A standard series of rates is based on multiples of the rates for electromechanical teleprinters; some serial ports allow many arbitrary rates to be selected. The <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> and device speed must match. The capability to set a bit rate does not imply that a working connection will result. Not all bit rates are possible with all serial ports. Some special-purpose protocols such as MIDI for musical instrument control, use serial data rates other than the teleprinter series. Some serial port systems can automatically detect the bit rate.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we experimented CCITT V. 42 bis MODEM by {{utilizing}} the voice line of the INMARSAT and the ordinate telephone line to send image data files as it costs more expensive to send by MODEM <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> 2400 bps. In this experiment we could only sent the experimental data by 4800 bps speed as INMARSAT did not work with 9600 bps. The throughput of MODEM <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> 4800 bps was 3. 5 ～ 4. 4 times faster for none compression files and 3. 7 ～ 6. 5 times faster for compression files than none protocol 2400 bps. The experiments on land voice line with 9600 bps were also 6. 8 ～ 7. 3 times faster for the former type of files and 7. 5 ～ 12. 7 times faster for the latter type of files. The cost of communication is inversely proportional to MODEM throughput. So, it is prefer to select 4800 bps with MODEM <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> for INMARSAT line and 9600 bps for land to land line to decrease the cost of communication. ﻿現在の陸上公衆回線で使用されているモデムの最高通信速度は 9600 bpsである。一般に 2 線式モデムでは,海事衛星においては 2400 bpsが使用されている。通信時間の短縮は,海事衛星では回線数が少なくラッシュ時,即時のアクセスが不能な時間帯を生じつつある。これらのことから限られた電波資源を有効に活用するためには短時間で大量のデータを処理する手法が必要である。今回のデータの伝送実験は,陸上局にパソコンホスト局を設置し実施した。海事衛星電話回線の質から見て当初予測した通り, 4800 bpsの速度が通信可能な上限で, 9600 bpsは使用できないことが確認できた。この 4800 bpsを用いた場合,通信コストは陸上回線間で約 1 / 4,陸船の海事衛星回線間で 1 / 2 以上節約されることになる。文字データについては,単純に計算しても 480 字/秒のデータをエラーフリーで陸船間で処理出来る。また,実際にはこの 3 倍程度の実効速度で伝送されるからTSS活用の際も焦燥感はないと思う。その他,陸上のホスト局と海上移動局の各種のデータ伝送が確実に実行できたことも今回の成果の一つであった...|$|E

In this work, we propose a practical two-stage approach for traffic engineering that takes advantages of SDN. The approach not only assures every newly injected flow gets a suitable route that does not have too much payload on it, but also schedules the overall flows so that they are distributed more equally in the network. Furthermore, we demonstrate its efficiency in terms of <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> and compared it with <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> under the default routing decision.

Using a new multi-dimensional photonic multiplexing scheme that includes space, time, wavelength, and sub-carrier domains, we propose a photonic switch fabric based on a 3 -stage Clos network to provide scalable large-dimension photonic interconnections with nanosecond reconfiguration speed. Packet buffering is implemented electronically at the input and output port controllers, allowing the central photonic switch fabric to transport high-speed optical signals without electrical-to-optical conversion. Optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) technology further scales <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> beyond electronic speed up to 160 Gbits/s to minimize the fiber connections.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} pipeline-based {{concurrent}} round-robin dispatching scheme, called PCRRD, for Clos-network switches. Our previously proposed concurrent round-robin dispatching (CRRD) scheme provides 100 % throughput under uniform traffic by using simple round-robin arbiters, {{but it has}} the strict timing constraint that the dispatching scheduling has to be completed within one cell time slot. This is a bottleneck in building high-performance switching systems. To relax the strict timing constraint of CRRD, we propose to use more than one scheduler engine, up to, so called subschedulers. Each subscheduler is allowed to take more than one time slot for dispatching. Every time slot, one out of subschedulers provides the dispatching result. The subschedulers adopt our original CRRD algorithm. We show that PCRRD preserves 100 % throughput under uniform traffic of our original CRRD algorithm, while ensuring the cell-sequence order. Since the constraint of the scheduling timing is dramatically relaxed, it is suitable for high-performance switching systems even when the switch size increases and a <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> is high (e. g., 40 Gbit/s) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to {{describe}} a scalable and reusable architecture useful {{for the construction of}} Ethernet switches, named MOTIM. The main requirement of MOTIM is to allow achieving low latency and high throughput with a generic structure that can be easily scaled. In order to make the architecture scalable, its design is based on the use of a network on chip (NoC), a concept recently proposed for enhancing SoC interconnect design [1][2]. NoCs stand as a good compromise between silicon cost and performance scalability, easing to attain design requirements. Minkenberg et al. recently identified a set of trends arising in packet switch design and discussed their consequences [3]. The most important of these trends indicates that the aggregate throughput will grow by increasing the amount of ports in switches, rather than by increasing <b>port</b> <b>speed.</b> This imposes a demand for larger crossbars, a structure that do not scale well. Scalable NoCs are a feasible alternative to implement switches with fully interconnected ports. The concept of the MOTIM switch architecture derived initially from an industry-academy cooperation targeting the implementation of the Ethernet-SDH multiplexer. In this multiplexer, the switch works with 24 bidirectional Ethernet ports working at 100 Mb/s and 1 to 4 high-speed (1 or 10 Gb/s) ports. Figure 1 details the internal structure of the MOTIM instance used in the multiplexer. The current version contains only the Fast Ethernet ports. Gigabit ports are future work.

40|$|In {{this paper}} several methods to use eDRAM (embedded DRAM, on-chip DRAM) in packet {{switches}} are analyzed. A practical method using eDRAM as an output queue is proposed {{especially in a}} shared bus packet switch. In the newly proposed output buffer architecture, hierarchical output buffer (HOB), SRAM plays a role of the small FIFO buffer between a high-speed shared bus and a large eDRAM output buffer. The high density of eDRAM can provide larger capacity than static memories, which results in lower packet loss probability. This paper shows the performance analysis on the proposed HOB switch of 8 ports with the <b>port</b> <b>speed</b> of 10 Gbps for 10 Gigabit Ethernet or OC- 192 c standards. We determine two optimal configurations of hierarchical output buffer by simulation. One is focused on area reduction issue {{and the other on}} reduction of cell loss probability.

About 2 times area reduction is obtained by using hierarchical and hybrid output buffer rather than SRAM buffer. A prototype chip has been designed and implemented by using 0. 16 um DRAM-based SoC technology. During the chip implementation, Both-Side I/O scheme is proposed to double the I/O data bits of eDRAM.
