40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} (WPT) {{has been an}} active topic of research, {{with a number of}} WPT schemes implemented in the near-field (coupling) and far-field (radiation) regimes. Here, we consider a beamed WPT scheme based on a dynamically reconfigurable source aperture transferring <b>power</b> to <b>receiving</b> <b>devices</b> within the Fresnel (near-zone) region. In this context, the dynamic aperture resembles a reconfigurable lens capable of focusing power to a well-defined spot, whose dimension can be related to a point spread function (PSF). Near-zone focusing can be achieved by generating different amplitude or phase profiles over the aperture, which can be realized using traditional architectures, such as phased arrays. Alternatively, metasurface guided-wave apertures can achieve dynamic focusing, with potentially lower cost implementations. We present an initial tradeoff analysis of the near-zone WPT concept, relating key parameters such as spot size, aperture size, wavelength, focal distance, and availability of sources. We find that approximate design formulas derived from the Gaussian optics approximation provide useful estimates of system performance, including transfer efficiency and coverage volume. The accuracy of these formulas is confirmed using numerical calculations. Comment: Original manuscript as submitted to Journal of Applied Physics (2016). 27 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this paper}} is to prove that a safe and {{efficient}} energy transfer is possible between an external transducer located on the patient’s skin and a device deeply implanted in the abdomen. An ultrasound propagation model based on the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral is coupled with the data from the Visible Human Project to account for the geometry of the organs in the body. The model is able to predict the amount of acoustic <b>power</b> <b>received</b> by the <b>device</b> for different acoustic paths. The acoustic model is validated by comparison with measurements in water and in heterogeneous liquid phantoms. Care is taken to minimize adverse bioeffects—mainly temperature rise and cavitation in tissues. Simulations based on the bio-heat transfer equation are performed to check that thermal effects are indeed small...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel method for sensing the volume of {{wireless}} throughput of other users by measuring the passive interference <b>power</b> <b>received</b> on mobile <b>devices.</b> The benefit of this mobile crowd-sensing approach is that it offers a non-intrusive way of inferring the level of wireless traffic, without requiring to extract data from commercial or private devices. The availability of cross-network wireless traffic data can allow individual operators to deploy femto-cells effectively. The proposed technique requires only approximate location data and is independent of the traffic pattern. The {{results show that the}} sensing accuracy for cell-level activity is high (<; 5 % error). The paper further demonstrates how this novel method can allow researchers to rapidly build up a map of the wireless activity level in a large region using crowd-sensing...|$|R

50|$|One {{drawback}} {{of using}} source-synchronous clocking {{is the creation}} of a separate clock-domain at the <b>receiving</b> <b>device,</b> namely the clock-domain of the strobe generated by the transmitting device. This strobe clock-domain is often not synchronous to the core clock domain of the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> For proper operation of the received data with other data already present in the device, an additional stage of synchronization logic is required to transfer the received data into the core clock-domain of the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> This stage can often be found alongside source synchronous logic.
