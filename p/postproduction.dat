5|$|Loev is a 2015 Indian romantic drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Sudhanshu Saria. Produced by Saria and the Bombay Berlin Film Productions, it stars Dhruv Ganesh and Shiv Pandit. The film focuses on the homosexual relationship between two friends (played by Ganesh and Pandit) that takes center stage during a weekend getaway to Western Ghats, India. It was the former's final film role, as he died during the <b>postproduction</b> after suffering from tuberculosis. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh Chaddha play supporting roles in the film.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Life {{magazine}} hired a New Jersey film lab, Manhattan Effects, {{to make a}} 16 mm film copy of {{the original}} Zapruder film. Pleased with the results, they asked for a 35 mm internegative to be made. Mo Weitzman made several internegatives in 1968, giving the best to Life and retaining the test copies. Weitzman set up his own optical house and motion picture <b>postproduction</b> facility later that year. Employee and assassination buff Robert Groden, hired in 1969, used one of Weitzman's copies and an optical printer to make versions of the Zapruder film using close-ups and minimizing the camera's shakiness.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{animation}} {{industry and}} access to the latest technology, such as 3D computer-generated imagery technology, is actively supported by the Chinese government and included in the latest national planning. In part this may be because of a desire to increase Chinese soft power. The same technology as in Hollywood is available and much <b>postproduction</b> is outsourced to China. Successful indigenous artistic creativity is seen as a problem and may be restricted by factors such as production being aimed at getting government patronage rather than public approval, censorship, and some story lines based on Chinese culture not appealing to foreign audiences. DreamWorks Animation, in a joint venture with Chinese companies, will set up a studio in Shanghai that may eventually get bigger than DreamWorks HQ, in part to avoid to quota restrictions on foreign films with China within a decade having been predicted to become the world's biggest cinema and entertainment market. Disney has also entered into a partnership in order to help develop the Chinese animation industry.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass gave a {{positive}} review for the clip, opining that [...] " [...] stunning curves steal {{the show and}} she clearly relishes {{her role as a}} steamy seductress." [...] Carolyn Menyes from Mstarz commented that it [...] "lives up to the dramatic nature of the song and the telenovela for which it was performed", adding that [...] "the wistful looks seem straight out of Telemundo." [...] Entropy Studio made the music video <b>postproduction</b> between Los Ángeles and Zaragoza. The music video was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2014 Lo Nuestro Awards ceremony but lost to [...] "Propuesta Indecente" [...] by Romeo Santos.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is notable}} for its {{innovative}} use {{of classical music}} taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written specially for them by professional composers. In {{the early stages of}} production, Kubrick had actually commissioned a [...] from Hollywood composer Alex North, who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove. However, during <b>postproduction,</b> Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favor of the now-familiar classical pieces he had earlier chosen as [...] "guide pieces" [...] for the soundtrack. North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film's premiere screening.|$|E
500|$|Few optical {{effects were}} used in Conan the Barbarian. Milius professed ambivalence to fantasy elements, preferring a story that showcases accomplishments {{realized}} through one's own efforts without reliance on the supernatural. He {{also said that he}} followed the advice of Cobb and other production members on the matters of special effects. [...] Peter Kuran's Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE) effects company was engaged in October 1981 to handle <b>postproduction</b> optical effects for Conan. VCE had previously worked on films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Dragonslayer. Among their tasks for Conan were adding glint and sparkle to the Eye of the Serpent and Valeria's Valkyrie armor. [...] Not all of VCE's work made it to the final print; the flames of Valeria's funeral pyre were originally enhanced by the company, but were later restored to the original version.|$|E
500|$|As David Bordwell describes, {{technological}} improvements {{continued at}} a swift pace: [...] "Between 1932 and 1935, [...] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of film recording, reduced ground noise... and extended the volume range." [...] These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: [...] "Increasing the fidelity of recording... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness." [...] Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain—was that some silent-era actors {{simply did not}} have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in <b>postproduction,</b> {{a process known as}} [...] "looping", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.|$|E
500|$|As the Variety report suggests, recent {{technological}} advances greatly facilitate {{the production of}} truly low-budget motion pictures. Although {{there have always been}} economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 and 16mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these mediums could not rival the image quality of 35mm film. The development of digital cameras and <b>postproduction</b> methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent, and not necessarily [...] "grittier", image quality and editing effects. As Marone observes, [...] "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the same time, , the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically." [...] Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels, though digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. In a similar way, Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures.|$|E
500|$|It {{was clear}} that Lasseter and Jobs {{believed}} that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing <b>postproduction</b> work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked {{what they were doing}} next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. [...] "If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars" [...] for computer animation companies, he told various friends. [...] "I should have been wary," [...] Lasseter later recalled. [...] "Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} of the concert was released five months later, on February 16, 1982. [...] The audio tracks were put through album <b>postproduction,</b> but it was noted by Rolling Stone magazine {{that they were not}} completely polished, and preserved the roar and the fuzziness of live rock music heard through a loudspeaker. Two songs were removed from the album version: the interrupted [...] "Late Great Johnny Ace", and the encore reprise of [...] "Late in the Evening". The album was an international success. It peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified 2×Multi-Platinum with sales of over 2 million copies in USA. The album sold more than 1,270,000 copies in France, where it was certified Diamond. It was also successful in seven other countries, including France and New Zealand. Originally the album was released as a double LP and as a single Compact Cassette. In 1988 it was issued as a single CD. Various reissues in different formats have been released, including, alongside the DVD, a 2-CD-release also containing the two missing songs from the original album.|$|E
2500|$|The film uses non {{professional}} {{actors and}} it was partially produced with a Crowdfunding project. The filming process took place in October 2016 and the <b>postproduction</b> {{is expected to be}} completed in Spring/Summer 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Mark Knopfler {{was not at}} all {{enthusiastic}} about the concept of the music video. MTV, however, was insistent on it. Director Steve Barron, of Rushes <b>Postproduction</b> in London, was contacted by Warner Bros. to persuade Knopfler to relent. Describing the contrasting attitudes of Knopfler and MTV, he said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wall's work {{advances}} {{an argument}} for the need for pictorial art. Some of Wall's photographs are complicated productions involving cast, sets, crews and digital <b>postproduction.</b> They have been characterized as one-frame cinematic productions. Susan Sontag ended her last book, Regarding the Pain of Others (2003), with a long, laudatory discussion of one of them, Dead Troops Talk (A Vision After an Ambush of a Red Army Patrol near Moqor, Afghanistan, Winter 1986) (1992), calling Wall's Goya-influenced depiction of a made-up event [...] "exemplary in its thoughtfulness and power." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee Wallace, the film's art director, spoke admirably about Carpenter during post. [...] " [...] {{asked if}} I could cut sound effects. The answer, {{of course was}} 'Sure!' Once again, here I was, a {{perfectly}} green recruit, yet John made {{a leap of faith}} … he further insisted we get the best processing money could, which at that time was the legendary MGM color labs. Finally, he insisted we get the best <b>postproduction</b> sound money could buy, which was Samuel Goldwin Sound, another legend. The expense for this unorthodox approach ate up a huge amount of the budget. The production manager fumed that we were exploiting people to pay for processing— and it was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{development}} hinted at by the Variety quotation above, technological advances are greatly facilitating {{the production of}} truly low-budget motion pictures. Although {{there have always been}} economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 and 16 mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these mediums could hardly rival the image quality of 35 mm film. The development and widespread usage of digital cameras and <b>postproduction</b> methods allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent (and not necessarily [...] "grittier") image quality and precise editing effects—though technical excellence is no guarantee of aesthetic value or even cinematographic competence. As Marone observes, [...] "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features." [...] Comparing circumstances in 2006 to those {{just a couple of years}} earlier, he argues that the [...] "quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, Brando {{made his}} directorial {{debut in the}} western One-Eyed Jacks. The picture was {{originally}} directed by Stanley Kubrick, but he was fired early in the production. Paramount then made Brando the director. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner [...] "Dad" [...] Longworth. The supporting cast features Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens. Brando's penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing, however, and the film soon went over budget; Paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars. Brando's inexperience as an editor also delayed <b>postproduction</b> and Paramount eventually {{took control of the}} film. Brando later wrote, [...] "Paramount said it didn't like my version of the story; I'd had everyone lie except Karl Malden. The studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar, too. By then, I was bored with the whole project and walked away from it." [...] One-Eyed Jacks was poorly reviewed by critics. While the film did solid business, it ran so over budget that it lost money.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled <b>postproduction</b> supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E
