5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be <b>plotted</b> for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then <b>plotted</b> on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and <b>plotted</b> on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E

5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he <b>plotted</b> the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E

There was no significantly difference in the yield among the four <b>plots.</b> Yield of 0 N <b>plot</b> was 69 % of C <b>plot</b> and was significantly low compared with that of the C <b>plot.</b> Distinctive differences in panicle number per hill and 1000 grains weight was not found among the five <b>plots.</b> The spikelet number per panicle was greatest in the C <b>plot,</b> followed by the L <b>plot,</b> LT <b>plot,</b> T <b>plot</b> and 0 N <b>plot,</b> while the differences between the L <b>plot,</b> LT <b>plot</b> and T <b>plot</b> were not significant. The difference in spikelet nurnber per panicle was attributed to the differences in the tillering pattern and nitrogen content per stem. The first tiller emerged from the 6 th node in the 0 N <b>plot</b> and from the 5 th node in the other <b>plots.</b> Rice plants in the 0 N <b>plot</b> had panicles having a smaller number of spikelets compared with those in the other <b>plots.</b> The top dressing for the C <b>plot</b> attained a higher nitrogen content per stem. Filled grain percentage was lower in the C <b>plot</b> than in the othor <b>plots.</b> From these results, it was considered that securement of a sufficient yield with labor-savings compared to standard cultivation and the decrease of the amount of fertilizer application by the high N treatment, and coating urea application would be possible. 本田への施肥作業の省略と少肥栽培による低コスト稲作技術の開発を指向し，移植直前の一時的な高窒素処理と被覆尿素の併用が移植後の生育と収量に及ぼす影響について調査した。高窒素処理・被覆尿素併用区（LT区 : 3. 15 kgN/ 10 a）では対照区（C区 : 6 kgN/ 10 a）の 83 %，被覆尿素区（L区 : 3 kgN/ 10 a）で 82 %，高窒素処理区（T区 : 0. 15 kgN/ 10 a）で 76 %の収量が得られ，C区とこれら 4 区では有意差はみられなかったが，無施肥区（ON区 : 0 kgN/ 10 a）は 69 %と低収であった。 1 株穂数と千粒重に試験区間差はみられなかった。１穂籾数はC区>LT区≒L区≒T区>ON区であった。この差異は，ON区に比べて他の 4 区では初発分げつ節位が低く， 1 株穂数は同じであっても稲体はより籾数の多い低節位の穂によって構成されていたこと，また，C区では幼穂形成期における 1 茎当たり窒素含有量が高かったことによるものと考えられた。登熟歩合はC区よりも他の 4 区で有意に高かった。本実験により，移植直前の高窒素処理と被覆尿素の併用により，本田施肥を省略し，施肥量を削減しつつも，標準的な栽培と比較して十分な収量を確保し得る可能性が示された...|$|R
