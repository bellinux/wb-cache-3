40|$|Antibiotics {{represent}} a <b>pharmacotherapeutic</b> <b>group</b> {{widely used in}} both human and veterinary medicine for which ecosurveillance has been continually recommended. It is urgent to rank the antibiotics and highlight those that may pose potential risk to the environment, a key step for the risk management. The absence {{of this type of}} contributions applied to the Portuguese reality supported the idea of compiling the data presented herein. With such purpose the most recent and representative data is used to draw a comparative contribution of each antimicrobial classes according to their intended use, i. e., in human versus veterinary medicine. The aim was to assess: (1) the amount and patterns of antimicrobials usage between human and animals; (2) the qualitative comparison between the antimicrobial classes used in each practice (human and veterinary) or specific use; (3) the potential to enter the environment, metabolism, mode of action and environmental occurrences. This manuscript will, thus, identify priorities for the environmental risk assessment, considering the ranking of the antimicrobials by their usage and potential environmental exposure. Ultimately, this study will serve as a basis for future monitoring programs, guiding the policy of regulatory agencies...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Monitoring of {{antibiotic}} prescribing promotes rational {{use of these}} drugs, reduces costs and slows down the progress of resistance. The objective of {{present study was to}} analyze the effects of drug utilization reform strategy realized by the Republic Health Insurance Fund of Montenegro, during the period 2000 - 2004. Material and methods. This before-after comparative pharmacoepidemiological study comprised a sample of 100 % prescription only antibiotics available in public pharmacies during the period 2000 - 2004. The drug use was calculated using A TC/DDD methodology and Wilcoxon's test for matched pairs was used in order to calculate the statistical significance of difference. Results. Antibiotic prescribing was aproximately lower by 12 % in 2004 in regard to 2000 (12. 80 vs. 14. 57 DDDs, p> 0. 05). The participation of this <b>pharmacotherapeutic</b> <b>group</b> in the total drug dispensing has remained almost equal (aproximately 8 %). The highest increase in prescribing was established for macrolides (1. 05 vs. 1. 64 DDDs, 59 %); penicillins were also prescribed more frequently (6. 41 vs. 6. 56 DDDs, 2 %). but other subgroups were prescribed less frequently: cephalosporins - (23 %) (3. 11 vs. 2. 43 DDDs) and quinolones - (63 %) f 1. 10 vs. 0. 47 DDDs). Conclusion The drug utilization reform strategy showed mostly positive effects on antibiotic prescribing during the period 2000 - 2004. Further educational activities are necessary in order to establish more rational approach to prescribing and utilization {{of antibiotic}}s. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{observational study}} investigated the prevalence of obesity in persons with type 2 diabetes, trends in obesity resulting from the duration and treatment of diabetes, and treatment-related changes in HbA 1 c and body mass index (BMI). Data on 1773 type 2 diabetics (802 men and 971 women) {{were obtained from the}} CroDiabNET registry. Follow- up included the analysis of patients’ age, disease duration, diabetes treatment, BMI and HbA 1 c values. A significantly higher rate of overweight and obesity was found in persons with type 2 diabetes as compared to the general population. A significant decrease in BMI was observed in the groups treated by diet, and in those treated by oral hypoglycaemic agents (p< 0. 05), regardless of their <b>pharmacotherapeutic</b> <b>group,</b> in contrast to a significant increase in BMI observed in the groups treated with insulin (alone or in combination with oral hypoglycaemic agents) (p< 0. 05). Persons with type 2 diabetes lost weight only during {{the first years of the}} disease, while with diabetes duration and insulin treatment they regained weight. A significant increase in HbA 1 c was observed in the groups treated with sulfonylureas (p< 0. 05), whereas all other groups revealed either a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) or no change in HbA 1 c. Our findings suggest the necessity of an integrated approach to managing type 2 diabetic patients that would simultaneously address both diabetes and obesity. Good glycaemic control is imperative and diabetes treatment should not be postponed. Because of a possible concomitant weight gain, aggressive weight control measures should be applied concurrently in order to achieve maximum treatment benefit...|$|E

It focuses in detail on individual <b>pharmacotherapeutic</b> <b>groups</b> {{and their ability}} to influence the progression of the disease and patient's quality of life. It also refers to treatment during pregnancy and lactation. Further, the thesis describes essential non-pharmacological interventions and means of surgical treatment. Biological treatment has been a breakthrough in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and we may anticipate its growing importance in the future. The key to successful treatment are early diagnosis and correct assessment of the disease activity as the prognosis of the disease depends mainly on early start of the therapy...|$|R

Objective: To analyze and assess the drug prescription patterns and errors in elderly outpatients attending public health care centers in Mexico City, Mexico. Materials and methods: A descriptive and retrospective {{study was conducted in}} 2007. Fourteen hundred prescriptions were analyzed. Prescriptions of ambulatory adults aged &gt; 70 years who were residents of Mexico City {{for at least two years}} were included. Prescription errors were divided into two groups: (1) administrative and legal, and (2) <b>pharmacotherapeutic.</b> In <b>group</b> 2, we analyzed drug dose strength, administration route, frequency of drug administration, treatment length, potential drug&ndash;drug interactions, and contraindications. Variables were classified as correct or incorrect based on clinical literature. Variables for each drug were dichotomized as correct (0) or incorrect (1). A Prescription Index (PI) was calculated by considering each drug on the prescription. SPSS statistical software was used to process the collected data (95 % confidence interval; p &lt; 0. 05). Results: The drug prescription pattern in elderly outpatients shows that 12 drugs account for 70. 72 % (2880) of prescribed drugs. The most prescribed drugs presented potential pharmacotherapeutic errors (as defined in the present study). Acetylsalicylic acid&ndash;captopril was the most common potential interaction (not clinically assessed). Potential prescription error was high (53 % of total prescriptions). Most of the prescription errors were due to omissions of dosage, administration route, and length of treatment and may potentially cause harm to the elderly outpatients. Conclusions: A high number of potential prescription errors were found, mainly due to omissions. The drug prescription pattern of the study population is mainly constituted by 12 drugs. The results indicate that prescription quality depends on the number of prescribed drugs per prescription (p &lt; 0. 000). Keywords: elderly, prescription, pattern, error, outpatients, Mexic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{guidelines}} in general practice is not optimal. Although evidence-based methods to improve guideline adherence are available, variation in physician adherence to general practice guidelines remains relatively high. The objective {{for this study}} is to transfer a quality improvement strategy based on audit, feedback, educational materials, and peer group discussion moderated by local opinion leaders to the field. The research questions are: is the multifaceted strategy implemented on a large scale as planned?; what is the effect on general practitioners' (GPs) test ordering and prescribing behaviour?; and what are the costs of implementing the strategy? Methods In order to evaluate the effects, costs and feasibility of this new strategy we plan a multi-centre cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a balanced incomplete block design. Local GP groups in the south of the Netherlands already taking part in <b>pharmacotherapeutic</b> audit meeting <b>groups,</b> will be recruited by regional health officers. Approximately 50 groups of GPs will be randomly allocated to two arms. These GPs will be offered two different balanced sets of clinical topics. Each GP within a group will receive comparative feedback on test ordering and prescribing performance. The feedback will be discussed in the group and working agreements will be created after discussion of the guidelines and barriers to change. The data for the feedback will be collected from existing and newly formed databases, both at baseline and after one year. Discussion We are not aware of published studies on successes and failures of attempts to transfer to the stakeholders in the field a multifaceted strategy aimed at GPs' test ordering and prescribing behaviour. This pragmatic study will focus on compatibility with existing infrastructure, while permitting a certain degree of adaptation to local needs and routines.
