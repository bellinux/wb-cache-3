50|$|Australian bluebells are {{generally}} easily propagated by division or root cutting. The seed {{is a very}} fine, black powder. It germinates readily {{in a few weeks}} and is best directly sown into tubes or cells as the seed and plant are very small and hard to separate and <b>prick</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{a pattern}} {{which would require}} fresh <b>pricking</b> <b>out,</b> and much skill; but Grisell thought she could {{accomplish}} it, and took her leave, kissing the Duchess's hand--a great favour to be granted to her--curtseying three times, and walking backwards, after the old training that seemed {{to come back to}} her with the atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|It {{is better}} to sow the ripe seed, after {{collection}} from the plant. Seed should be sown in trays within a cold frame, then the seedlings, can be <b>pricked</b> <b>out,</b> when they are {{large enough to be}} handled. They are then grown on within a greenhouse or cold frame, for another year. The new plants can then be planted out, in late spring or early summer.|$|R
60|$|The pattern needed much care, and Lambert induced Hans Memling himself, {{who drew}} {{it so that}} it could be <b>pricked</b> <b>out</b> for the cushion. In after times it might have been held a greater honour to work from his pattern than for the Duchess, who sent to inquire after it more than once, and finally desired that Mistress Grisell should bring her cushion and show her progress.|$|R

60|$|The night, {{now that}} they were close to the shore, was loud with the noise of running tide-water, and the air was heavy with the smell of mud and marsh, and over all the {{whiteness}} of the moonlight, with a few stars <b>pricking</b> <b>out</b> here and there in the sky; and all so strange and silent and mysterious that Barnaby could not divest himself of the feeling that it was all a dream.|$|R
50|$|Seed - sow {{spring in}} a cold frame. Germination is usually quick and good. <b>Prick</b> <b>out</b> the {{seedlings}} into individual pots {{as soon as they}} are large enough to handle and plant them out when in early summer. It is also possible to sow in situ, though this requires a lot more seed to produce the same amount of plants from a protected sowing. Division in late summer as the plant dies down.|$|R

This lasted two days, when Charles made his peace with his wife by solemnly promising to give up Lady Castlemaine, and to have from that time forward nothing more to do with her.|$|R

60|$|In {{a sort of}} dream, {{his heart}} sunk to the bottom, leaving the surface of him still, quite still, he rose with the panful of food, {{carefully}} balancing the child on one arm, the pan in the other hand. The silky fringe of the shawl swayed softly, grains and hay trickled to the floor; he went along a dimly-lit passage behind the mangers, where the horns of the cows <b>pricked</b> <b>out</b> of the obscurity. The child shrank, he balanced stiffly, rested the pan on the manger wall, and tipped out the food, half to this cow, half to the next. There was a noise of chains running, as the cows lifted or dropped their heads sharply; then a contented, soothing sound, a long snuffing as the beasts ate in silence.|$|R

As for the town and the Ordinary he had quitted such a short time before, so different were they from this present experience, it was as though they might have concerned another life than that which he was then enjoying.|$|R
