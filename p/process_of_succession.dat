25|$|The term 'transition mire' {{relates to}} {{vegetation}} that in floristic composition and general ecological characteristics is transitional between acid bog and 7230 Alkaline fens, {{in which the}} surface conditions range from markedly acidic to slightly base-rich. The vegetation normally has intimate mixtures of species considered to be acidophile and others thought of as calciphile or basophile. In some cases the mire occupies a physically transitional location between bog and fen vegetation, as for example on the marginal lagg of raised bog or associated with certain valley and basin mires. In other cases these intermediate properties may reflect the actual <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> as peat accumulates in groundwater-fed fen or open water to produce rainwater-fed bog isolated from groundwater influence. Many of these systems are very unstable underfoot and can therefore also be described as 'quaking bogs'.|$|E

50|$|Limited {{intervention}} is an action taken whereby the management only addresses {{the problem to}} a certain extent, usually in areas of low economic significance. Limited intervention often includes the succession of haloseres, including salt marshes and sand dunes.

Although the halosere is not strictly man-made, as many natural processes contribute to the succession, anthropogenic factors are partially responsible for the formation, since an initial factor was needed to help start the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|E

50|$|Large {{areas of}} tallgrass prairie are being {{restored}} in the Arboretum. It {{is much more}} difficult to restore prairie than to restore forest, both because most of the prairie plants are locally extinct and because the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> to prairie is extremely slow. Intense planting and care are necessary to grow a prairie that even begins to approach the diversity of the original community. The first step is to introduce the appropriate plant species one by one, either as seed or seedlings. Introduced plants are from local sources whenever possible, to ensure that genotypes are adapted to regional conditions. Once the restored prairies have begun to mature, they can be a valuable source of seeds of local plant genotypes for other nearby prairie restoration projects.|$|E

The dominant forest type is sal. Khair and sissoo grow alongside rivers. Grassland encroachment by tree and shrub saplings are major threats to the long-term existence of the main phantas. Trees outcompete any grasses growing under them, especially those that need plenty of sunlight. Tree seeds are dispersed all over the grasslands and generally germinate near existing trees. Additionally, trees encourage the growth of shade-loving grasses and inhibit growth of sun-loving species. This <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> usually converts grassland into woodland over time.|$|E

Habitat was lost when it was converted to agricultural uses, such as cranberry bogs, but direct habitat loss {{is not a major}} threat now. Most of the populations are now protected in the Pine Barrens. However, habitat degradation does occur via alteration of the local hydrology and the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> Any lowering of the water table in the Pine Barrens is likely to impact the ecosystem, which requires a water table near the surface. Fire suppression is a likely cause of succession, characterized by the overgrowth of large and woody vegetation. This increases shade in the habitat, which negatively affects this and many other species in the herb layer. Other threats include off-road vehicles and picking and collecting of plants. Beaver dams may cause flooding of patches of habitat, which kills the plant.|$|E
