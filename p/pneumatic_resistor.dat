Previous research has shown the comparison of methods for the investigation on the energetic behaviour of pneumatic drives and its practical application. Concerning the {{analysis of the}} methods for determination the energy efficiency, the presented model is based on exergy analysis. Exergy analysis is able to consider all energy losses as well as the influence of the temperature behaviour on the available useful pneumatic energy. Factors concerning the energy efficiency are discussed and described upon the thermodynamical processes at pneumatic drive. The paper represents the exergy model of each type of pneumatic components, e. g., pipe, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>resistor</b> and actuator. Each component differs through the determination of energy losses. The preliminary simulation analysis provides the information of the efficiency of certain component and offers the optimization of the system through the validation of system parameters...|$|E
5000|$|The props {{representing}} proton packs {{were originally}} {{thought to have}} been made by the prop department of Columbia Pictures. Recent information coming from the auction of a hero proton pack in July 2012 revealed that the hero proton packs could have been made by Boss Film Studios, a prop studio started by ILM veteran Richard Edlund. They are made of molded fiberglass shells on aluminium backplates (or [...] "motherboards") bolted to military surplus A.L.I.C.E. frames. The basic shape was sculpted from foam; later, a rubber mold was made of it, from which fiberglass shells were pulled. The [...] "wand" [...] had an extending barrel mechanism and the electronics were quite advanced for the time. They were then finished with various surplus 1960s <b>resistors,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> fittings, hoses and ribbon cable, and surplus warning labels and custom-made metal fittings. The overall weight of these props is said to be around 35 lb. These [...] "hero" [...] props were substituted in stunt scenes by flimsy foam rubber pulls from the same mould. The proton packs have a lightbar with 15 blue scrolling lights in a box on the left-hand side and 4 red lights in the circular [...] "cyclotron" [...] portion of the bottom of the prop that light up in rotation. The [...] "wand" [...] also featured numerous light features; the most elaborate versions had fluorescent bargraphs, incandescent bulbs, and strobing flashes in the tip for the visual effects crew to synchronize the 'streams' to.|$|R
