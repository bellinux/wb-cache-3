500|$|On the Viscount's ship, the Viscount {{tells the}} group {{the story of}} an {{explorer}} who found the Final Key, but was unable to find the Power Crystal. That explorer was the Viscount's grandfather. As the explorer sailed back to his homeland to recollect his thoughts, his ship crashed into an iceberg and sank, taking the Viscount's grandfather to a watery grave. [...] "Sounds like a movie", remarks one of the attendees. The Viscount tells them to dive to the sunken ship and retrieve the Final Key, much to their shock, considering the near-freezing temperatures. Despite this, the group is able to find the Final Key before freezing to death. With all the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> at hand, the Viscount victoriously enters the Tower, where the Super Big Power Crystal awaits its owner. Just as the Viscount is about to make his wish, Crash steps forward and makes his wish of a large pile of Wumpa Fruit, much to the Viscount's grief. [...] "May peace prevail on Earth", says Coco.|$|E
500|$|... "Piper Maru" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{an overview of}} the third season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated an A. The review described [...] "Piper Maru" [...] as featuring [...] "a tough and sentimental Scully", noting that [...] "action-packed detective work by Mulder enhance an already crackling scenario." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and wrote positively of the unfolding mythology, noting that the [...] "great thing about [...] "Piper Maru" [...] is that it still belongs to the period of time when the mythology episodes were exposing us to more <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> fitting in various things that we were meant to incorporate into the whole. This {{is the first time we}} meet the black oil, but it's obvious that others know all about it". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode eight out of ten, and complimented the introduction of the black oil, writing [...] "this episode is a good introduction to the black oil virus, providing a bridge from the mythology elements earlier in the season to the larger scope of the conspiracy to be revealed." [...] Nick De Semlyen and James White of Empire named it the sixth [...] "greatest" [...] episode of the series, describing it as [...] "thrilling", [...] "pacey" [...] and [...] "balanced".|$|E
500|$|The Constant" [...] {{from the}} fourth season. In [...] "The Constant", Desmond and Sayid (Naveen Andrews) {{are on their way}} off the island when their {{helicopter}} hits turbulence, causing Desmond's 1996 consciousness to take over his 2004 body and switch uncontrollably between 1996 and 2004. Lost show runner Damon Lindelof said the fifth season of the show has [...] "flung major characters across decades, leaving them — and the audience — feverishly attempting to keep events straight and the end game in sight." [...] In [...] "The Variable", the viewers would get a few more <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> Lindelof said, and added: [...] "We're not promising any big whiz-bang flash pyrotechnics, but it does serve as a companion piece to another memorable episode, last season's 'The Constant', in which Desmond endured vicious, turbulence-caused side effects from traveling in time." [...] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is about the rules of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, [...] "We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode." [...] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "The Constant", they thought the [...] "sister episode" [...] should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it. The two show runners were pleased with the outcome of the episode. Cuse thought {{it was one of the}} best episodes of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique {{found the}} {{production}} {{design and the}} cinematography overwhelming, but he considered the narrative engagement of Sewell's amnesiac character to be ultimately successful. Biodrowski writes, [...] "As the story progresses, the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> fall into place, and we gradually realize that the film is not a murky muddle of visuals propping up a weak story. All the questions lead to answers, and the answers make sense within the fantasy framework." [...] The reviewer compared Dark City to the director's preceding film The Crow in style but found Dark City to introduce new themes {{and to be a}} [...] "more thoroughly consistent" [...] film. Biodrowski concluded, [...] "Dark City may not provide profound answers, but it deals seriously with a profound idea, and does {{it in a way that}} is cathartic and even uplifting, without being contrived or condescending. As a technical achievement, it is superb, and that technique is put in the service of telling a story that would be difficult to realize any other way." ...|$|E

[...] Excess civilian deaths in the Nazi occupied USSR were 13.7 million persons including 2 million Jews. There were an additional 2.6 million deaths in the interior regions of the Soviet Union. The authors maintain [...] "scope for error in this number is very wide". [...] At least 1 million perished in the wartime GULAG camps or in deportations. [...] Other deaths occurred in the wartime evacuations and due to war related malnutrition and disease in the interior. [...] The authors maintain that both Stalin and Hitler [...] "were both responsible but in different ways" [...] for these deaths.The {{authors of the}} Cambridge History of Russia believe that [...] "In short the [...] general picture of Soviet wartime losses suggests a jigsaw puzzle. The general outline is clear: people died in colossal numbers but in many different miserable and terrible circumstances. [...] But individual <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> do not fit well; some overlap and others are yet to be found" ...|$|E

2500|$|Ultima [...] – An elderly curandera, {{known in}} the Márez {{household}} as [...] "La Grande" [...] is {{the embodiment of the}} wisdom of her ancestors and carries within her the powers to heal, to confront evil, to use the power of nature and to understand the relationship between the seen and unseen. Her role in the community is as mediator. [...] "She preserves the indispensable contact with the world of nature and the supernatural forces inhabiting this universe (255)." [...] She is the spiritual guide for Antonio as he journeys through childhood. Ultima knows the ways of the Catholic Church and also the ways of the indigenous spiritual practices over which she is master. Ultima understands the philosophy and the morality of the ancient peoples of New Mexico and teaches Tony through example, experience and critical reflection, the universal principles that explain and sustain life. Although she is generally respected in the community, people sometimes misunderstand her power. At times she is referred to as a bruja, or witch, but no one—not even Antonio—knows whether or not she is truly a witch. Finally Antonio puts <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> together and the revelation of who she is comes to him.

2500|$|Selma {{is caught}} and {{eventually}} put on trial. It {{is here that}} she is pegged as a Communist sympathizer and murderess. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. Additionally, when her claim that the reason she didn't have any money was {{because she had been}} sending it to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted and given the death penalty. Cvalda and Jeff eventually put the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> together and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma becomes furious and refuses the lawyer, opting to face the death penalty rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. Although a sympathetic female prison guard named Brenda tries to comfort her, the other state officials show no feelings and are eager to see her executed. Brenda encourages Selma to walk. On her way to the gallows, Selma goes to hug the other men on death row while singing to them. However, on the gallows, she becomes terrified, so that she must be strapped to a collapse board. Her hysteria when the hood is placed over her face delays the execution. Selma begins crying hysterically and Brenda cries with her, but Cvalda rushes to inform her that the operation was successful and that Gene will see. Relieved, Selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, although she is hanged before she finishes. A curtain is then drawn in front of her body, while the missing part of the song shows on the screen: [...] "They say it's the last song/They don't know us, you see/It's only the last song/If we let it be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians: According to Nazi ideology, Slavs were useless sub-humans. As such, their leaders, the Soviet elite, were to {{be killed}} and the {{remainder}} of the population enslaved or expelled further eastward. As a result, millions of civilians in the Soviet Union were deliberately killed, starved, or worked to death. Contemporary Russian sources use the terms [...] "genocide" [...] and [...] "premeditated extermination" [...] when referring to civilian losses in the occupied USSR. Civilians killed in reprisals during the Soviet partisan war and wartime-related famine account for {{a major part of the}} huge toll. The Cambridge History of Russia puts overall civilian deaths in the Nazi-occupied USSR at 13.7 million persons including 2 million Jews. There were an additional 2.6 million deaths in the interior regions of the Soviet Union. The authors maintain [...] "scope for error in this number is very wide". At least 1 million perished in the wartime GULAG camps or in deportations. Other deaths occurred in the wartime evacuations and due to war related malnutrition and disease in the interior. The authors maintain that both Stalin and Hitler [...] "were both responsible but in different ways for these deaths", and [...] "In short the general picture of Soviet wartime losses suggests a jigsaw puzzle. The general outline is clear: people died in colossal numbers but in many different miserable and terrible circumstances. But individual <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> do not fit well; some overlap and others are yet to be found". Bohdan Wytwycky maintained that civilian losses of 3.0 million Ukrainians and 1.4 million Belarusians [...] "were racially motivated". According to Paul Robert Magocsi, between 1941 and 1945, approximately 3,000,000 Ukrainian and other non-Jewish victims were killed as part of Nazi extermination policies in the territory of modern Ukraine. [...] puts the total number of victims of the Nazi policies in the USSR at 500,000 civilians killed in the repression of partisans, 1.0 million victims of the Nazi Hunger Plan, c. 3.0 million Soviet POW and 1.0 million Jews (in pre-war borders). Soviet author Georgiy A. Kumanev put the civilian death toll in the Nazi-occupied USSR at 8.2 million (4.0 million Ukrainians, 2.5 million Belarusians, and 1.7 million Russians). [...] A report published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 put the death toll due to the German occupation at 13.7 million civilians (including Jews): 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million persons deported to Germany for forced labor; and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. Sources published in the Soviet Union were cited to support these figures.|$|E

Exactly! Scrivens--young Pillin had said! But Crow & Donkin, not Scriven & Coles, were old Heythorp's solicitors. What could that mean, save that the old man wanted to cover the tracks of a secret commission, and had handled the matter through solicitors who did not know the state of his affairs! But why Pillin's solicitors? With this sale just going through, it must look deuced fishy to them too. Was it all a mare's nest, after all? In such circumstances he himself would have taken the matter to a London firm who knew nothing of anybody. Puzzled, therefore, and rather disheartened, feeling too that touch of liver which was wont to follow his old Madeira, he went up to bed and woke his wife to ask her why the dickens they couldn't always have soup like that! ...|$|E
