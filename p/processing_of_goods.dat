40|$|Recently, {{automotive}} industry recorded decrease of their profits. In these days, however, {{the situation has}} improved since the neighbouring countries have approved car-scrapping bonuses. Thanks to it, cheaper branches increased their sales more rapidly. The automotive companies' suppliers are thus to enlarge their stocks so as to satisfy the companies' demand. Having sufficient reserves <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> became nowadays an indispensable part of their property. The aim of this thesis, which I called ``Purchase, <b>processing</b> and sales <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in an automotive company``, is to analyze the complications connected with purchase, <b>processing</b> and sales <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in the Edscha Bohemia s. r. o. automotive company. The goods are accounted according to the A-method. The purchased goods are priced with their purchase prices. When the goods are delivered from stock, weighted average method is then used. Smaller assets up to 3000 CZK is included in consumption costs. When purchasing goods, account no. 111 is not used as usually; stock account no. 112 is used instead. In my opinion, the company uses a well-designed stock-accounting system: the analytical accounts system, which {{is used by the}} company, makes the accounting process more effective. In Germany, sub-accounts are being used for the stocks, which makes their accounts more effective than the accounts in the Czech Republic are; they are using special sub-accounts for empties, compensations for defective goods, and also secondary purchase costs. The rest of the assets from those sub-accounts are transferred to root accounts {{at the end of the}} accounting period. If I had the chance to influence the stock-accounting system in the Czech Republic, I would definitely open sub-accounts for stock accounts. From this place, I could only recommend the accounting entities using as many analytical accounts as possible. In my opinion, in general, when analyses are being utilised, accounting with them becomes more effective, and is <b>of</b> a <b>good</b> service then...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAircraft {{structural}} {{fatigue life}} prediction has important military significance and the conspicuous economic value. In development phase fatigue life of flight vehicles is generally predicted {{based on some}} historic / assumed data which may differ significantly from the actual operational usage of the vehicle. Consequently, the fatigue life of an aircraft may reduce / increase. The service fatigue life of a structure depends on both the irregular amplitude load conditions and the assumptions during fatigue test. To find the actual fatigue life of a structure we need to subject the structure in laboratory with constant / variable amplitude loadings that should be representative of actual flight loads {{and at the same}} time in a form that can be applied conveniently in the laboratory. In case of uniform loading it is easy to find the number of cycles but the real service loads are normally irregular, so defining spectrum from flight data is quite difficult which corresponds to the actual random loads applying on the aircraft. In this research study, a simple methodology is proposed to extract fatigue loads spectrum from a typical flight tests data. It involves statistical analysis of flight data, data filtering, power spectral density (PSD), averaging and data reduction for generating a representative fatigue spectrum from experimental as well as actual flight data. The derived spectrum following this approach contains information of not only the number of occurrences of each load factors but also the fluctuating loads and corresponding exposure time for each occurrence. This methodology is validated by developing a spectrum from known raw data and then same procedure is applied on original flight data to generate the flight fatigue spectrum. Statistical <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> sample size (number of flights) provides a reasonably good representative fatigue spectrum of that particular flight vehicle type. Every flight fatigue spectrum can also be used for structural health monitoring / residual life estimation on flight to flight basis...|$|R
