40|$|In many {{practical}} {{situations where}} experiments with mixtures are carried out, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to consider running the experiment at different levels, or combinations of levels, {{of one or more}} <b>process</b> <b>variables.</b> It is common practice to use a polynomial model for the responses produced from a mixtures simplex centroid or simplex lattice design with quadratic or cubic terms to describe the effects of the mixture ingredients. It is also usual to investigate the <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> using a factorial design, or a suitable response surface design such as a central composite design, with a model including main effects and interaction terms. There are various ways of combining these models to investigate the joint behaviour of the mixture ingredients and the <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> simultaneously. In this paper, we consider several such models and propose a particular model involving polynomial terms for the mixture and <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> and first and second order interaction terms involving both mixture and <b>process</b> <b>variables.</b> The model building strategy is illustrated using an example involving three mixture ingredients and two <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> in a bread making experiment...|$|R

The effects of these <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> on the properties of the cylinder during and after manufacture are illustrated by a numerical example...|$|R
25|$|Two basic {{requirements}} are regulation (disturbance rejection – {{staying at a}} given setpoint) and command tracking (implementing setpoint changes) – these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and settling time. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.|$|E
25|$|In this example, two {{variables}} {{that will be}} maintained within the loop are initialized to zero, then the loop begins. The current error is calculated by subtracting the measured_value (the <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> or PV) from the current setpoint (SP). Then, integral and derivative values are calculated and these and the error are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an output value. In the real world, this is D-to-A converted and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (or MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, reading in new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.|$|E

40|$|A multivariate {{statistical}} analysis of paper strength and production process data from the SCA Munksund paper mill is presented. The analysis is divided into five parts: (i) paper quality <b>variables,</b> (ii) <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> from the paper machine, (iii) <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> from digester and refiner, (iv) {{a combination of all}} <b>process</b> <b>variables,</b> and (v) a further analysis of the z-strength. Analysing the correlations between the paper strength variables, two groups of variables could be discerned: one group comprising the variables tensile strength in MD, tensile stiffness in MD, elongation in CD, and bursting strength, and another group containing the variables SCT in CD, tensile strength in CD, and tensile stiffness in CD. The strongest correlations between paper machine <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> and paper strength variables were found for the strength variables in the first of the above mentioned groups. The same strength variables were negatively correlated with the wet end <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> conductivity, base line paper machine flow, and the amount of return fibre, while they were positively correlated with the concentration at the base line refiner. Combining wet end and paper machine <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> in a regression analysis for the paper strength variables yields a limited increase in the amount of variance explained, compared with the case where only wet end <b>process</b> <b>variables</b> are used as predictors, due to the correlations between the <b>process</b> <b>variables.</b> A more detailed study of the time series of z-strength measurements showed that this was non-stationary, which makes it hard to fit a single over-all linear regression model which will give good predictions over the whole year -or even from one production run to another...|$|R

2500|$|In {{closed loop}} control, the control {{action from the}} {{controller}} is dependent on feed back from the process {{in the form of}} the value of the <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> to be the same as the [...] "Reference input" [...] or [...] "set point". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.|$|E

2500|$|A proportional–integral–derivative {{controller}} [...] (PID controller {{or three}} term controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism {{widely used in}} industrial control systems {{and a variety of}} other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value [...] as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured <b>process</b> <b>variable</b> (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively) which give the controller its name.|$|E
2500|$|In {{open loop}} control, the control {{action from the}} {{controller}} is independent of the [...] "process output" [...] (or [...] "controlled process variable" [...] - PV).

2500|$|In many cases, the {{manipulated}} variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) {{is outside the}} PID controller.
