He remained {{employed by the}} Nelson <b>Provincial</b> <b>Council</b> as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department. His administration skills were {{not up to the}} latter role and many of the surveys produced under his supervision were of poor quality. He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the suitability of the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson <b>Provincial</b> <b>Council.</b> This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, {{as it had}} just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury <b>Provincial</b> <b>Council</b> Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Council</b> gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E

The provisions relating to powers of the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> over State lands are ambiguous in nature. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has given different interpretation at different time to the words and phrases relating to powers of <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> over State lands. The different interpretations given by the Supreme Court has created judicial inconsistency relating to {{the powers of the}} <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils.</b> Solaimuthu Rasu Case is the latest case relating to powers of the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> over State lands. In this case, the Supreme Court has held that the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> have legislative power with regard to administration, control and utilization of State lands that have been given to the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> by the Government. It means that the ownership of the State lands is not vested with the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils.</b> The Supreme Court has also held that the President has powers to alienate State lands including the lands given to the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> to any citizen or organization. Therefore, the <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> have very limited powers over State lands. These limited powers over State lands restraint the Northern and Eastern <b>Provincial</b> <b>Councils</b> and the people in the Provinces to promote sustainable development in the Provinces...|$|R

After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government {{had no intention of}} restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply ran out, and their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed.

Only when sessions had to be called at short notice did clashes occur. The first such clash occurred in mid-August 1855, when parliament was still in session and the Superintendent of Auckland Province, William Brown, called the fourth session of the Auckland <b>Provincial</b> <b>Council,</b> which was held at the Mechanics' Institute instead. The second clash occurred in April 1856, when the fifth session of the Auckland <b>Provincial</b> <b>Council</b> had not finished when the first session of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament began; the provincial councillors once again moved to the Mechanics' Institute.
