40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the possibility of application of <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> as a valuable source of dietary fibre and of biologically active compounds for the production of cereal extrudates. The research was performed using a single-screw extrusion-cooker with a compression ratio of 3 : 1 and L:D= 12 : 1, using the following cereal materials: commercially available corn grits, <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> of cv. Opal, and oats bran. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the effect of the leguminous material and of the process parameters (profile of barrel temperature distribution and raw material moisture) on the possibility of stabilization of extrusion conditions, physical properties of the extrudates, and on the sensory features of the product. The study showed that the technology of single-screw extrusion-cooking can be applied to process mixtures containing maximum 15 % of pea hulls; higher levels of the <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> content caused a disturbance of the stability of the process and so-called 'material slippage'. Increase of the <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> content in the mixture above 10 % caused a decrease in radial expansion and an increase in specific density even up to 140 kgm- 3. Moderate introduction of <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> did not result in any deterioration in the texture of the extrudates. The physical properties of the extrudates were significantly affected by the temperature of extrusion and by the raw material moisture content. Increased process temperature resulted in a decrease in radial expansion with simultaneous decrease in specific density of products, increase in crispness and decrease in the WAI of the extrudates. Increase in the moisture of the processed material, on the other hand, resulted in lower radial expansion, increased specific density, and increased water absorption index (WAI) of grinded extrudates. Admixture of <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> in amounts up to 7. 5 % did not cause any deterioration in the sensory features of the extrudate...|$|R
40|$|Beach pea {{is mostly}} grown on seashores and it {{contains}} higher amount of protein than other legumes. However, the pea has several undesirable attributes, such as long cooking time {{and hard to}} germinate (imbibitions) that limited its use as food. The present investigation aimed to study the physico-chemical properties, cooking characteristics and hull crude fibre structure of beach pea as compare to other similar legumes. Standard methods of processing pulses were used for present study. Beach pea seeds contained very low grain weight, density, hydration capacity, hydration index, swelling capacity and swelling index than the green pea and field pea. Beach pea had higher amount of crude protein, ash, crude fibre and polyphenols, but lower in starch content than the green pea and field pea. Without any treatment to beach pea seeds the water uptake capacity was very low. Mechanical treatment to beach pea seeds increasedthe water uptake percentage. The recovery of hull was 3 to 6 times higher in beach pea than that of green pea and field pea. The crude protein content in beach <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> was 2 - 5 % higher than others. The beach <b>pea</b> <b>hull,</b> dhal and whole seeds were good source of macro- and micro- minerals {{than that of the}} other two peas. The electron microscopic structure of beach <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> crude fibre showed a very close and compact structure than green pea and field <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> crude fibre structure. Lowering the hardness of beach pea seeds with mechanical or chemical treatments will give more scope for their utilization in the human nutrition...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of the proportion of <b>pea</b> <b>hulls,</b> moisture, the barrel temperature and the diameter of the die, in the course of the process along with the possibilities for stabilising the extrusion-cooking conditions and the physical extrudate properties. <b>Pea</b> <b>hulls</b> ranging from 20 to 80 % give the correct stabilisation in extrusion-cooking conditions and obtain a range of varied products with different physical and functional properties. An increase of <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> in extruded mixtures leads to a lowering of the radial expansion ratio and an increase in specific density, a worsening of the extrudate's texture, a decrease in the water solubility index of dry mass (WSI) and a lowering of the water absorption index of the extruded products (WAI). An increase in processing temperatures in the range of 120 - 220 Ã‚Â°C contributes to a slight increase in the radial expansion ratio, a lowering of the extrudate's specific density, an improvement in product crispness and an increase of the WSI. The moisture (20 - 26 %) generates the product's structure with only a slight expansion and causes changes in the extrudateÃ¢Â€Â™s WSI and WAI...|$|R
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) expressing K 88 (F 4) adhesins are {{associated}} with post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. Different grain fractions from pea (Pisum sativum) and faba bean (Vicia faba) were tested in vitro for their capacity to counteract aetiological factors, which {{contribute to the development}} of diarrhoea. In detail, adhesion of E. coli O 149 :K 91 :K 88 ac (ETEC K 88 ac) to grain legume products, intended to impair the colonization of the host, was studied as well as interference with receptor binding of the pathogen’s heat-labile enterotoxin LT, intended to reduce toxin-inflicted gut cell damage. When comparing different pea and faba bean products tested for their binding capacity of ETEC K 88 ac, especially <b>pea</b> <b>hulls,</b> but also whole pea meal, starch-enriched and protein-enriched pea meal, and digestion-resistant <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> and meal fractions showed a higher binding of ETEC K 88 ac than faba bean products. In contrast to the ETEC K 88 ac adhesion results, bean hulls proved more effective than <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> in preventing GM 1 receptor binding of LT. Previous small intestinal segment perfusion experiments we performed with ETEC K 88 ac-challenged piglets indicated that both <b>pea</b> and bean <b>hulls</b> have the potential for successful application in diarrhoea prophylaxis and treatment, which is in agreement with and refined by our detection of their different modes of functioning...|$|R
30|$|The {{different}} extracts showed significant difference and stronger reducing power than BHT. These {{results showed that}} BHT can be exchanged by extracts of JoH and JaH when utilized as reducing agent and showed good antioxidant potential, and this {{is in line with}} the results of pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> extracts studied by Kanatt et al. (2011), who noticed that pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> extracts had a high antioxidant activity. Also, it has an antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus. Meir et al. (1995) reported that the reducing power was increased by increasing the phenolic content of extract, and the reducing capacity of a compound may serve as a significant indicator of its antioxidant activity. Sfhalan et al. (2009) showed that different genotypes of almond shells extract phenolic compounds less than that of hulls and could be partially responsible for their advantage. Mung bean hull extract showed low reducing power, but pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> extract showed the highest reducing power capacity (Kanatt et al. 2011; Jadhav, et al., 1995). Water and ethanol extracts of fennel seed noticed great antioxidant activity by various methods when judged against BHA and BHT. Oktay et al. (2003) studied ruit hull and shell phenolic extract and concluded that they possess antioxidant activity. The extract can be useful in hindering or reducing the progress of various oxidative stress-related diseases (Sfahlan et al. 2009). The higher activity of the hydroxycinnamic acid might be because of the –CHCH–COOH group, which ensures higher H-donating capability and radical stabilization than the –COOH group in the hydroxybenzoic acids (Balasundram et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Constipation is {{a serious}} problem in the {{pediatric}} population and often requires medical management with laxatives and enemas. Participants (2 - 10 years of age, n= 13) with a history of mild constipation were assigned randomly to a fibre treatment or placebo group. After three weeks, subjects were crossed over to the other treatment. <b>Pea</b> <b>hull</b> fibre (4. 0 - 7. 6 g/day = 3. 6 - 6. 8 g/day of dietary fibre) was added to snack foods and an inulin supplement (5. 0 g/day = 4. 5 g/day of dietary fibre) was given, whereas the placebos were non-fortified snacks and maltodextrin (5. 0 g/day). Subjects or their parents documented stool frequency, stool consistency, occurrence of abdominal pain and intake of snack foods and the supplement. Over the final two weeks, there was a trend towards an increase in the mean number of daily bowel movements in the fibre treatment group compared to the placebo group (n= 11, 0. 68 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 59 ± 0. 26, p= 0. 064). Exclusion of one subject with diarrhea-type stools led to a significant difference between groups (n= 10, 0. 54 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 67 ± 0. 22, p= 0. 002). Stool consistency, using the Bristol Stool Form Rating Scale, showed no significant differences in stool consistency between groups (p= 0. 379) nor was there a difference in the incidences of abdominal pain (p= 0. 129). Not all subjects experienced abdominal pain. The inulin supplement (91 % compliance rate; 1 serving per day) was consumed more consistently than were the snack foods fortified with <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> fibre (77 % compliance rate; 2 servings per day).

Diets consisted of hay alone (control); hay supplemented with tela atella (traditional brewery residue); katikala atella (liquor residue); lentil hull; rough <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> and field <b>pea</b> <b>hull.</b> Thirty indigenous rams weighing 22. 6 Â± 0. 97 kg, were stratified into weight groups and {{randomly assigned to}} dietary treatments independently. Supplementation reduced (P 0. 05) rumen fermentation and microbial nitrogen supply, but showed difference (P< 0. 001) for propionate and butyrate concentrations. Type of atella supplements showed variation, whereby rumen pH was low (P< 0. 05), but rumen ammonia, VFA, molar proportions of acetate, propionate and butyrate were high (P< 0. 001) for katikala atella compared to tela atella. Lentil hull had higher (P< 0. 01) rumen ammonia concentration, microbial nitrogen supply and microbial efficiency than other pulse hull supplements.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inclusion}} of <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> (PH) {{in the diet}} on growth performance, development of the gastrointestinal tract and nutrient retention were studied in broilers from 1 to 18 d of age. There were a control diet based on low fibre ingredients (69. 3 total dietary fibre (16. 1 g crude fibre/kg)) and three additional diets that resulted from the dilution of the basal diet with 25, 50 and 75 g PH/kg (81. 2, 93. 2, and 105. 1 g total dietary fibre/kg diet, respectively). Each treatment was replicated six times and the experimental unit was a cage with 12 chicks. Growth performance, development of the gastrointestinal tract and the coefficients of total tract apparent retention (CTTAR) of nutrients were recorded at 6, 12 and 18 d of age. In addition, jejunal morphology was measured at 12 and 18 d and the coefficients of apparent ileal digestibility (CAID) of nutrients at 18 d of age. <b>Pea</b> <b>hulls</b> inclusion affected all the parameters studied. The inclusion of 25 and 50 g PH/kg diet improved growth performance {{as compared to the}} control diet. The relative weight (g/kg body weight) of proventriculus (P≤ 0. 01), gizzard (P≤ 0. 001) and ceca (P≤ 0. 05) increased linearly as the level of PH in the diet increased. The inclusion of PH affected quadratically (P≤ 0. 01) villus height:crypt depth ratio with the highest value shown at 25 g PH/kg. In general, the CTTAR and CAID of nutrients increased linearly and quadratically (P≤ 0. 05) with increasing levels of PH, showing maximum values with PH level between 25 and 50 g/kg diet. We conclude that the size of the digestive organs increases with increasing levels of PH in the diet. In general, the best performance and nutrient digestibility values were observed with levels of PH within the range of 25 and 50 g/kg. Therefore, young broilers have a requirement for a minimum amount of dietary fibre. When <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> are used as a source of fibre, the level of total dietary fibre required for optimal performance is within the range of 81. 2 – 93. 2 g/kg diet (25. 6 – 35. 0 g crude fibre/kg diet). An excess of total dietary fibre (above 93. 2 g/kg diet) might reduce nutrient digestibility and growth performance to values similar to those observed with the control diet...|$|R

Alternative plant protein sources such as peas, faba beans and lupins may contribute in preventing gastrointestinal problems. In the small intestinal segment perfusion model, the anti-diarrhoea effect of pea and faba bean fractions on net absorption of fluid was investigated. Segments with a cranial inflow tube and a caudal outflow tube were fitted in the small intestine of 5 -week old anaesthetized piglets. The odd numbered segments were infused with ETEC and the even segments with PBS, whereupon the segments were perfused over 8 h. <b>Pea</b> meal, <b>pea</b> <b>hulls,</b> protein-enriched <b>pea</b> meal and starch-enriched pea meal were perfused in 4 piglets in 4 pairs of segments (an uninfected and an adjacent ETEC-infected) with saline as a control in another pair of segments.

Maize starch and wood cellulose were selected as references. The inner fibre-containing diet was also supplemented with enzymatically hydrolysed casein (EHC) {{in order to test}} the peptide alimentation method on a diet containing a fibre source with a high water-holding capacity (WHC = 10. 9 g water g- 1 DM). The fibres were also analyzed by different methods (crude fibre, NDF, ADF, enzymatic gravimetric method, Englyst method). The fibre content of the inner fibre fraction varied widely from one method to another and ranged from 109 g crude fibre to 480 g AOAC fibre kg- 1 DM. Compared to the 'maize starch + wood cellulose' diet (11. 0 g AA excreted kg- 1 DM intake), pea starch had no effect on ileal AA losses (9. 6 g), whereas <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> slightly increased them (14. 2 g). The AA excretion dramatically increased with the incorporation of inner fibres (28. 0 g), because of their very high WHC. The addition of EHC increased the output (48. 0 g) further, at a level that can hardly be explained only by an increase of the endogenous secretions. The results suggest that the NDF content of grain legume products is not indicative of their effect on the ileal endogenous AA losses in pigs and that the physiological effects of fibres along the gastrointestinal tract are due to both their chemical and physical properties...|$|R

Among the pulse hulls considered, lentil hull had the highest CP (16 %), and lowest NDF (49. 4 %) and ADF (48. 6 %). Poultry litter and orange peel had the highest CP (30 %) and GE (28 MJ/kg DM), respectively. Results of the in vivo study indicated that both T. atella and K. atella and pulse hulls improved total dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen, energy, and NDF intakes. The improvement was higher for T. atella and K. atella compared to pulse hull groups. Basal diet intake was reduced when pulse hulls were fed. T. atella, K. atella, and lentil hull had higher nitrogen and energy digestibility compared to pulse hulls and the control.

40|$|Publisher Summary Studies using a mixed fiber diet have {{emphasized}} the strong impact of dietary fibers (DF) on gut microbiota. As an example, a high-fiber diet containing 40 % soya cake, 20 % crude potato starch, 19 % wheat bran, and 5 % each of apple pectin and carob gum, given for 4 weeks to rats, led to a daily fecal output of anaerobes 71 times higher than a fiber-free diet. Similarly, daily excretion of total fermentation products was 20 times higher, with an increase of propionate and butyrate proportions. It is estimated that apples could provide 10 %– 30 % of the daily intake of fiber. Using a diet containing 100 g of apple fiber/kg, {{it has been shown}} that soluble dietary fiber (SDF) excreted in feces of rats was 10. 9 % of the SDF ingested, which suggests a low resistance to fermentation of this fraction, while only 43 % of the ingested insoluble fiber was fermented. The effects of five DF from different sources (carrot, wheat bran, cocoa seed, <b>pea</b> <b>hull,</b> and oat husks) have been assessed in human microbiota-associated (HMA) rats. HMA rats are initially germ-free rats colonized after weaning with the fecal microbiota of a healthy human volunteer. Use of this animal model is justified by the phylogenetic and metabolic differences between rats and human microbiota and the knowledge that HMA rodents globally retain the characteristics of the human donor microbiota. All of the diets contained 100 g fiber/kg and were given for 8 weeks. Both carrot and cocoa led to a higher proportion of acetate and a lower proportion of propionate in the cecum, and to a large production of methane.

The ingredients used were wheat bran (WB), wood cellulose (Solka-floc®, SF), <b>peas,</b> <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> (PH), <b>pea</b> inner fibre (PIF), sugar beet pulp (SBP), flax seed meal (FSM) and corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). The samples were pre-treated with pepsin and pancreatin and the hydrolyzed substrates were then incubated with pig faeces in a buffered mineral solution. The nitrogen source in the buffer solution (NH 4 HCO 3) was replaced by an equimolar quantity of 15 N-labeled NH 4 Cl, used for {{the determination of the}} rate of bacterial protein synthesis. Gas production, proportional to the amount of fermented carbohydrate, was recorded for 48 h and modelled. The fermented product was subjected to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) analysis. The source of fibre affected the in vitro dry matter degradability (IVDMD), the fermentation kinetics and the gas production profile (P 0. 05) in SCFA production after the fermentation of SF, P, PH, PIF and SBP (ranging from 3. 8 to 4. 5 mmol/g DM incubated) while WB and FSM yielded lowest (P< 0. 05) SCFA. The bacterial nitrogen incorporation (BNI), both at T/ 2 and after 48 h of fermentation was the highest (P< 0. 001) for PIF (18. 5 and 15. 6 mg/g DM incubated, respectively) and the lowest for DDGS and WB. In conclusion, peas and pea fibres had higher rates of fermentability, produced more SCFA and had high bacterial protein synthesis capacity. They thus have the potential to be included in pig diets as a source of fermentable fibre to modulate the gut environment and reduce nitrogen excretion. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Grain legumes {{produced}} in Europe such as pea, faba beans and lupins are alternative vegetable protein sources for imported soy protein in animal feeds. These legume seeds contain constituents {{that are not}} digested and may act as a substrate for microbial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby modulating the microbial population and affecting the microbial diversity. In this study the effect was evaluated of inclusion of pea and faba beans and their hull fractions in diets for piglets on the intestinal microbial population at the ileal level. A total of 72 piglets weaned at 28 days of age were fed a control diet based on soybean meal or diets with pea (250 g/kg), <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> (100 g/kg), faba beans (250 g/kg) or faba bean hulls (100 g/kg). All piglets were challenged orally with an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) 7 days after weaning, except for half of the piglets fed the soybean meal diet that were inoculated with phosphate buffered saline. The piglets were sacrificed 21 days after weaning and ileal digesta samples were collected and analysed with a terminal restriction fraction length polymorphism based method of Microbial Community Profiling and Characterization. From 10 days after the challenge, there was no faecal excretion of ETEC {{in any of the}} piglets. There was a distinct different microbial profile in the piglets fed the diet with faba beans or faba bean hulls, showing a lower number of terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) compared to the other treatments. Such an alteration in the ileal microflora composition by the use of different legume seeds or their hull fractions suggests a potential for the manipulation of intestinal microbial activity and thus in preventing or provoking intestinal disorders in piglet...|$|R

Poultry meat is low in fat in relation to other meats. The aim of study was to use some plant wastes such as <b>pea</b> <b>hulls,</b> tomato peels, and wheat germ as well as carrot and rusk in processing of chicken burger to minimize cost of production and to produce burger with high nutritive value which could be exported to poorer regions especially in Africa. This study included fatty acid pattern (either saturated or unsaturated), antioxidant activity, vitamin content and sensory evaluation. T. B, G. B and CA. B treatments had high contents of total saturated fatty acids, and it was ranged between 30. 4 % and 32. 6 %. The oleic acid (C 18 : 1) is the predominant fatty acid in all treatments except G. B treatment that contained linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) as a predominant fatty acid, Antioxidant activity (mg/ 100 g) of different chicken burger treatments showed some differentiations between all types of burger, and it was recorded 3. 9, 12. 3, 10. 87, 6. 96, 7. 391, 6. 441 and 11. 4 in C.

40|$|The {{proportions}} of testa, endosperm, cotyledon and soluble solids (principally mucilage) in solin seed {{were determined to}} be 10, 21, 57 and 11 %, respectively, by manual dissection of soaked seed. Endosperm/cotyledon contained 17. 4 and 81. 6 %, respectively, of the total seed oil, and 16. 3 and 75. 6 %, respectively, of the total seed protein. The testa and soluble solids fraction contained 24. 6 and 26. 3 %, respectively, of the total seed dietary fibre. The yield, composition and physicochemical characteristics of mucilage were influenced by both extraction temperature and alcohol precipitation. Ethanol and isopropanol were equally suitable for mucilage precipitation. A prototype, wet dehulling system was developed. The system consisted of a blender, with its blades covered with latex tubing, in which degummed solin seed was slurried in water. Optimum dehulling conditions resulted in the recovery of 75 % of the testa, {{and a loss of}} 8 % of endosperm/cotyledon in the hull fraction. Extraction of oil from dehulled solin presscake with azeotropic isopropanol was slower than with hexane. Isopropanol-extractedmeal was lower in total lipid and lighter in colour than hexane extracted meal. Optimum azeotropic isopropanol oil extraction conditions resulted in an oil recovery of 96 %, with less than 2 % oil in the alcohol phase after chilling of miscella. Isopropanol recovered by chilling was suitable for precipitation of mucilage. Studies on aqueous extraction of oil from dehulled seed were discontinued due to the high residual oil content in meal and the formation of a stable oil-water emulsion. Concentrated protein products were prepared from azeotropic-isopropanol-extracted and hexane extracted solin meal by alkali extraction and acid and aqueous alcohol washing. The aqueous alcohol effluent from mucilage precipitation was suitable for use in the production of protein products. None of the protein products contained 65 % or more of protein on a moisture-free basis. Protein products prepared by acid or aqueous alcohol washing were similar in functionality, but generally inferior to soy flour controls. Functionalities of solin hull and the hull fraction were similar to those of <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> and wheat bran. Hydrocyanic acid, trypsin inhibitor and phytic acid were associated with endosperm/cotyledon and, therefore, present in higher concentration in dehulled seed than in the hull fraction. The opposite was true for phenolics. Concentrated protein products were lower in HCN, trypsin inhibitor and phenolics compared to oil-free meals, but were enriched in phytic acid...|$|R
40|$|Fine tuning a {{nutritional}} strategy by incorporating dietary fibre (DF) in pig diets {{can help to}} improve gut health. Fermentation of DF, especially the soluble fraction, in pig intestines yields short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid, which {{have been found to}} improve gut health by favouring the growth of health-promoting bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, at the expense of pathogenic ones like Clostridium or Salmonella, which may enhance the health of host species. The presence of fermentable fibre in the pig diet can also contribute to reducing nitrogen (N) excretion, which can {{have a positive impact on}} the environmental footprint, one of the main concerns of a modern commercial pork production. The overall objective of this thesis project was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics of a selection of feedstuffs in the pig intestines and their potential impact on the gut environment and nitrogen excretion. The evaluation was performed by executing two projects using both in vitro and in vivo studies. The first project focused on the fermentation characteristics of hulless barley in comparison to hulled barley and oats and their effects on the gut environment, especially the production of fermentation metabolites. The rate of fibre fermentation in the intestines was first studied by means of an in vitro gas production technique. The results demonstrated that hulless barleys have higher fermentability and produce higher amounts of SCFA than hulled barley and oats. An experiment carried out on pigs confirmed that the fermentation of the soluble fibre fraction of hulless barley in the gut leads to increased production of SCFA and lactic acid, which in turn contribute to the growth of potentially beneficial microbiota and decrease potentially harmful bacteria, an indicator of improved gut health. This finding shows that gut health parameters may be modulated. Thus gut health could potentially be improved through feed formulation by a judicious selection of feed ingredients with specific fibre fractions, not only by the addition of isolated fibres, which is commonly recommended at present. The second project was executed to study the effect of some feedstuffs differing in their DF and protein content on fermentation characteristics and N excretion in pigs. The feedstuffs included wheat bran, wood cellulose, <b>peas,</b> <b>pea</b> <b>hulls,</b> <b>pea</b> inner fibre, sugar beet pulp, flax seed meal and corn distiller's dried grains with solubles. The results showed that peas and pea fibre-based diets produced higher amounts of SCFA and reduced N excreted, compared to others. In a parallel in vitro study, fermentation characteristics and bacterial protein synthesis was also studied using the same feed ingredients. The findings of the in vitro study corraborated the results of the in vivo experiment. These studies showed that peas and pea fibres have the potential to be used in pig diets in order to gain gut health-benefits and reduce N excretion. From this thesis, it can be concluded that sources and type of dietary fibre have a significant effect on the production of fermentation metabolites in the pig intestine and on N excretion. Among the feed ingredients studied, hulless barley and pea fibres seem to have the greatest potential to be included in pig diets as a source of fermentable fibre to modulate the gut environment, which in turn, extend possibly health-promoting properties and reduce N excretion from pigs. However, further research is needed to understand the specific health benefits of these fibre sources and to quantify the specific fibre components required to achieve these benefits...|$|R
30|$|Smallholder dairy {{production}} is increasingly becoming popular in Jimma town. However, feed shortage {{is a major}} constraint to dairy production. The objectives {{of this study was}} to assess feed resources, feeding practices and farmers’ perceived causes of feed shortage and coping strategies to feed scarcity in smallholder dairy producers in Jimma town, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. A total of 54 randomly selected dairy farmers were interviewed using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and through direct observations. Twenty major feed types used by dairy farmers were identified and categorized into five classes: natural pasture grazing, green feeds, hay, concentrate (commercial mix and agro-industrial by-products) and non-conventional feed resources. Green feeds-fresh or succulent grasses and legumes (mean rank =  0.361), concentrate (0.256), hay (0.198), non-conventional feeds (0.115) and natural pasture grazing (0.070) were ranked as the main feed resources in that order of importance. Green feed (94.4  % of the respondents) was found to be the main basal diet of dairy cattle. Overall, wheat bran (85.2  % of the respondents), commercial concentrate (55.6  %), noug (Guizotia abyssinica) cake (20.4  %), cotton seed cake (7.4  %) and molasses (7.4  %) were the main concentrate supplements used (P >  0.05). Local brew waste (attela) (77.8  % of the respondents), bean and <b>pea</b> <b>hulls</b> (42.6  %) enset (Ensete ventricosum) leaf and pseudo-stem (37  %), sugarcane tops (33.3  %), banana leaf and stem/stover (16.7  %) and papaya stem (16.7  %) were the dominant non-conventional feed resources in the surveyed area (P >  0.05). About 79.6, 7.4, 1.9 and 11.1  % of the farmers used zero-, semi-zero-, and the combination of zero- and semi-zero- and free-grazing systems, respectively. Most farmers (90.7  %) offered concentrate supplements to milking cows. However, supplementation did not consider milk yield, physiological status and condition of cows. All the farmers (100  %) offered common salt to their cattle as mineral supplement. The majority (98.1  %) of the farmers experience feed shortage in the dry season. Land scarcity (55.6  % of the respondents) was reported as the most important cause of feed scarcity followed by a combination of land scarcity and poor feed availability (42.2  %). Increasing use of agro-industrial by-products and commercial concentrate mix (87  % of the respondents), increasing use of hay (74.1  %), increasing use of non-conventional feeds (50  %), purchasing green feeds (19.8  %) and reducing herd size (2.7  %) were the strategies adopted for coping with feed scarcity. From results of this study, it could be concluded that to ensure sustainable availability of dairy cattle feed in the surveyed area, technological, technical and institutional innovations would be vital.|$|R

The present results of Table  3 in agreement with those found by Asar et al. (2010) who noted that digestion coefficients of (DM, OM, CP, EE, and NFE), TDN and DCP were improved by replacing barley with alfalfa hay, Berseem hay, or dried Faba bean straw each at 25 % as a fiber source for rabbits fed rations contained 30 % corn-cob meal. On the other hand, Ghazalah and El-Shahat (1994) showed that inclusion of olive meal instead of barley increased OM digestibility. Also, Salwa et al. (2000), Falcão-e-Cunha et al. (2004), and Sarhan (2005) noticed that inclusion of agriculture by-products in rabbit rations improved EE digestibility. Also, Omer and Badr (2013) found that OM, CF, EE, and NFE digestibilities were significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) improved with replacement Berseem hay by pea straw in rations at different levels of replacement (0, 25, 75, and 100 %). Also, feeding 30 % <b>pea</b> pods <b>hulls</b> diet had better nutritive value compared to control (Sarhan 2005). Meanwhile, Myrie et al. (2008) showed that most feedstuffs contain anti-nutritional factors such as insoluble fibers, ligins, tannins and lectins, intake of these anti-nutritional factors reduced nutrient digestibility and increased endogenous protein losses, through increasing of intestinal mucus secretion.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2013. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Joanne Slavin. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 132 pages. Enteral nutrition (EN) or enteral tube feeding {{is an effective}} means of nutritional support for individuals who do not or cannot eat adequately. Patients restricted to EN frequently suffer from abnormal bowel function which affects their intestinal bacteria and impacts quality of life. Dietary fibers have a variety of physiological benefits; fibers that provide fecal bulk promote regular bowel movements while fermentable fibers are utilized by gut bacteria to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and gas in the process. SCFAs positively influence gut health, gut transit time, and fecal moisture while gas may reduce the tolerance of fibers. Fortification of EN with a blend of fibers with various physicochemical properties more closely represents a normal diet, and may maximize physiological benefits. Moreover, using a blend of fibers with different rates of fermentation may minimize gas and bloating commonly associated with highly fermentable fibers. Batch in vitro systems allow fiber fermentation modeling without absorption and may help to estimate potential health benefits and gastrointestinal tolerance of fiber in vivo. Well controlled, blinded and randomized intervention human studies are the "gold standard" for human nutrition research. The primary aim of this project was to conduct a human clinical trial utilizing a fiber blend fortified EN product. The secondary aim was to relate the human study findings to the in vitro fermentation profiles of the fiber blend and its individual components. The objective of the human study was to compare the effects of a fiber blend fortified enteral formula (FB, 15 g/L), a fiber-free formula (FF) and habitual diet on bowel function, fecal bacteria and quality of life. The fiber blend consisted of a 50 : 50 insoluble:soluble ratio of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, gum acacia and outer <b>pea</b> <b>hull</b> fiber. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 20 healthy subjects consumed both FF and FB for 14 days with a 4 week washout. Fecal samples were collected the last 5 days of each period and assessed for fecal output, whole gut transit time (WGTT), and major bacterial groups. Subject gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) and tolerance were also measured. On formula diets, 5 -day fecal output decreased by more than 55 % from habitual diet, but was 38 % higher on FB than FF (p= 0. 0321). WGTT was approximately 1. 5 times longer on formula diets than habitual diet (p< 0. 0004). Total bacteria declined from habitual diet on FF (p< 0. 004), but not on FB. Numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli declined from habitual diet on both formula diets, but bifidobacteria was higher on FB compared to FF (p< 0. 0001). Bacteroides and clostridia numbers did not change between diets. GIQLI and incidence of gas symptoms did not differ between formulas. The objectives of the second project were to compare the in vitro fermentation profiles of FOS, inulin, gum acacia, and pea fiber alone or blended using a 24 h batch model and relate these finding to the human study results. For the in vivo measurements, stool samples were collected to measure pH and SCFA. Tolerance was also measured. The in vitro fermentation of the fiber blend resulted in a delayed pH decrease and gas and SCFA production compared to the FOS and inulin. Human samples had higher total SCFA on the fiber formula compared to the fiber free formula (p= 0. 029), and both formulas yielded lower SCFA than habitual diet (both p< 0. 0001). Mean fecal pH for both formulas was 7. 5; higher than habitual diet pH 6. 5 (p< 0. 0001). No differences in gas/bloating were found between any diet. By blending fibers, a slower fermentation was observed in vitro and was well tolerated in human subjects. Fiber addition to enteral formula increases fecal short chain fatty acids which may reflect increased fermentation...|$|R

40|$|Probiotic {{supplements}} {{are single}} or mixed strain cultures of live microorganisms that benefit the host by improving {{the properties of}} the indigenous microflora (Seo et al 2010). In a pilot study at the University of Queensland, Norton et al (2008) found that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Strain H 57 (H 57), primarily investigated as an inoculum to make high-quality hay, improved feed intake and nitrogen utilisation over several weeks in pregnant ewes. The purpose of the following study was to further challenge the potential of H 57 -to show it survives the steam-pelleting process, and that it improves the performance of ewes fed pellets based on an agro-industrial by-product with a reputation for poor palatability, palm kernel meal (PKM), (McNeill 2013). Thirty-two first-parity White Dorper ewes (day 37 of pregnancy, mean liveweight = 47. 3 kg, mean age = 15 months) were inducted into individual pens in the animal house at the University of Queensland, Gatton. They were adjusted onto PKM-based pellets (g/kg drymatter (DM) : PKM, 408; sorghum, 430; chick <b>pea</b> <b>hulls,</b> 103; minerals and vitamins; Crude protein, 128; ME: 11. 1 MJ/kg DM) until day 89 of pregnancy and thereafter fed a predominately pelleted diet incorporating with or without H 57 spores (10 9 colony forming units (cfu) /kg pellet, as fed), plus 100 g/ewe/day oaten chaff, until day 7 of lactation. From day 7 to 20 of lactation the pelleted component of the diet was steadily reduced {{to be replaced by a}} 50 : 50 mix of lucerne: oaten chaff, fed ad libitum, plus 100 g/ewe/day of ground sorghum grain with or without H 57 (10 9 cfu/ewe/day). The period of adjustment in pregnancy (day 37 - 89) extended beyond expectations due to some evidence of mild ruminal acidosis after some initially high intakes that were followed by low intakes. During that time the diet was modified, in an attempt to improve palatability, by the addition of oaten chaff and the removal of an acidifying agent (NH 4 Cl) that was added initially to reduce the risk of urinary calculi. Eight ewes were removed due to inappetence, leaving 24 ewes to start the trial at day 90 of pregnancy. From day 90 of pregnancy until day 63 of lactation, liveweights of the ewes and their lambs were determined weekly and at parturition. Feed intakes of the ewes were determined weekly. Once lambing began, 1 ewe was removed as it gave birth to twin lambs (whereas the rest gave birth to a single lamb), 4 due to the loss of their lambs (2 to dystocia), and 1 due to copper toxicity. The PKM pellets were suspected to be the cause of the copper toxicity and so were removed in early lactation. Hence, the final statistical analysis using STATISTICA 8 (Repeated measures ANOVA for feed intake, One-way ANOVA for liveweight change and birth weight) was completed on 23 ewes for the pregnancy period (n = 11 fed H 57; n = 12 control), and 18 ewes or lambs for the lactation period (n = 8 fed H 57; n = 10 control). From day 90 of pregnancy until parturition the H 57 supplemented ewes ate 17 more DM (g/day: 1041 vs 889, sed = 42. 4, P = 0. 04) and gained more liveweight (g/day: 193 vs 24. 0, sed = 25. 4, P = 0. 0002), but produced lambs with a similar birthweight (kg: 4. 18 vs 3. 99, sed = 0. 19, P = 0. 54). Over the 63 days of lactation the H 57 ewes ate similar amounts of DM but grew slower than the control ewes (g/day: 1. 5 vs 97. 0, sed = 21. 7, P = 0. 012). The lambs of the H 57 ewes grew faster than those of the control ewes for the first 21 days of lactation (g/day: 356 vs 265, sed = 16. 5, P = 0. 006). These data support the findings of Norton et al (2008) and Kritas et al (2006) that certain Bacillus spp. supplements can improve the performance of pregnant and lactating ewes. In the current study we particularly highlighted the capacity of H 57 to stimulate immature ewes to continue to grow maternal tissue through pregnancy, possibly through an enhanced appetite, which appeared then to stimulate a greater capacity to partition nutrients to their lambs through milk, at least for the first few weeks of lactation, a critical time for optimising lamb survival. To conclude, H 57 can survive the steam pelleting process to improve feed intake and maternal liveweight gain in late pregnancy, and performance in early lactation, of first-parity ewes fed a diet based on PKM...|$|R
