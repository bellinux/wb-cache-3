50|$|Potassium {{carbonate}} is {{the primary}} component of potash and the more refined <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> or salts of tartar. Historically, <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> was created by baking potash in a kiln to remove impurities.

5000|$|As {{noted by}} Ronald E. Shaw, [...] "These {{improvements}} {{made it possible}} in times of sufficient water for new Durham boats as long as sixty feet and carrying sixteen tons to supplant those carrying only a ton and a half used heretofore on the river. The cost of transportation from Albany to Seneca Lake was reduced from $100 to $32 a ton, and that from Albany to Niagara by half. Down the canals came furs, lumber, pot and <b>pearl</b> <b>ashes,</b> wheat, and salt, and up them moved boats 'principally laded with European or Indian productions or manufactures'."In 1812 about 1500 tons of cargo was moved through Rome by this route.|$|R
60|$|This Jack Wallingford, of whom I {{have not}} yet spoken, {{was a man of}} five-and-forty, and a bachelor. He was a cousin-german of my father's, being the son of a younger brother of my grandfather's, and {{somewhat}} of a favourite. He had gone into what was called the new countries, in that day, or a few miles west of Cayuga Bridge, which put him into Western New York. I had never seen him but once and that was on a visit he paid us on his return from selling quantities of pot and <b>pearl</b> <b>ashes</b> in town; articles made oh his new lands. He was said to be a prosperous man, and to stand little in need of the old paternal property.|$|R
60|$|The {{day after}} we parted company with our prize, {{we made a}} sail to the westward, and hauled up {{to take a look}} at her, the wind having shifted. She was soon {{pronounced}} to be an American; but, though we showed our colours, the stranger, a brig, manifested no disposition to speak us. This induced Captain Williams to make sail in chase, more especially as the brig endeavoured to elude us by passing ahead, and the run was pretty nearly on our course. At 4, P. M. we got near enough to throw a nine-pound shot between the fellow's masts, when the chase hove-to, and permitted us to come up. The brig proved to be the prize of la Dame de Nantes, and we took possession of her forthwith. As this vessel was loaded with flour, pot and <b>pearl</b> <b>ashes,</b> &c., and was bound to London, I was put in charge of her, with a young man of my own age, of the name of Roger Talcott, for my assistant, having six men for my crew. Of course the Frenchmen, all but one who acted as cook and steward excepted, were received on board the Crisis. Neb went with me, through his own and my earnest entreaties, though spared by Marble with great reluctance.|$|R
5000|$|Swan {{continued}} his mercantile career {{and was also}} successful as a banker, including serving {{on the board of}} directors of the Vermont State Bank. [...] He was also an owner or partner in several ventures, including a <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> factory.|$|E

5000|$|Tajiri {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that between Japanese and American reactions to the series, Japanese consumers focused on the character Pikachu, while Americans purchased more items featuring Ash and Pikachu, his Pok√©mon, together. He stated that he felt the character represented the concept of the franchise, the human aspect, and was a necessity. The character was given a rival named Gary (Shigeru in the Japanese version, after Tajiri's idol/mentor, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto), loosely based on Red's rival Blue. In an interview Tajiri noted the contrast between the characters' relationship in the games and anime; while in the games they were rivals, in the anime, Shigeru represented Satoshi's master. When asked if either Satoshi would equal or surpass Shigeru, Tajiri replied [...] "No! Never!"Ash's character design was initially overseen by Sayuri Ichishi, replaced by Toshiya Yamada during the Diamond and <b>Pearl</b> storyline arc. <b>Ash</b> received a redesign in the Best Wishes! series, which included larger brown irises. In the XY series, he received minor changes, such as a decrease {{in the size of the}} 'birthmarks' on his cheeks. Ash received a major design overhaul for the Sun and Moon anime series, which started airing in Japan on November 17, 2016.|$|R
50|$|Early {{settlers}} harvested {{the abundant}} and large trees (some exceeding 5 ft in diameter) {{as a primary}} source of income. They shipped them downstream to markets via log rafts and flatboats on the creek as timber, charcoal and <b>pearl</b> <b>ash,</b> the latter two products in demand in the early Industrial Age.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, and {{probably}} most importantly, {{it is the}} first known printed American call for the use of a chemical leavening agent that was the precursor to modern baking powder, used to cause dough to rise in baking. At that time, it was known as potash, <b>pearl</b> <b>ash,</b> pearlash, or alkali. Contrast this method with others, such as using yeast.|$|E
5000|$|... 1790 - First US Patent Act {{drafted in}} the US Constitution. The first US Patent, {{numbered}} X000001 (pictured right), was granted on July 31, 1790. The patent was granted by Thomas Jefferson. The patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins, in Pittsford, Vermont, for the [...] "making of pot ash and <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> by a new apparatus and process".|$|E
5000|$|Potash (especially {{potassium}} carbonate) {{has been}} used in bleaching textiles, making glass, and making soap, since about AD 500. Potash was principally obtained by leaching the ashes of land and sea plants. Beginning in the 14th century potash was mined in Ethiopia. One of the world's largest deposits, 140 to 150 million tons, is located in the Tigray's Dallol area. Potash {{was one of the most}} important industrial chemicals in Canada. It was refined from the ashes of broadleaved trees and produced primarily in the forested areas of Europe, Russia, and North America. The first U.S. patent of any kind was issued in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for an improvement [...] "in the making of Pot ash and <b>Pearl</b> <b>ash</b> by a new Apparatus and Process". <b>Pearl</b> <b>ash</b> was a purer quality made by calcination of potash in a reverberatory furnace or kiln. Potash pits were once used in England to produce potash that was used in making soap for the preparation of wool for yarn production.|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Hopkins (December 9, 1743 - 1818) was an American {{inventor}} from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, [...] On July 31, 1790, he {{was granted}} the first U.S. patent, {{under the new}} U.S. patent statute just {{signed into law by}} President Washington on April 10, 1790. Hopkins had petitioned for a patent on an improvement [...] "in the making of Pot ash and <b>Pearl</b> <b>ash</b> by a new Apparatus and Process." ...|$|E
50|$|Wood ash {{became a}} {{significant}} export during this period. Potash {{made from the}} ashes of burnt wood was used as a bleaching and dying agent in textile production in Britain. Wood ash and <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> (potash mixed with lime) were shipped overseas as early as 1767 and export reached a peak in the mid-19th century. In 1871, there were 519 asheries in operation in Canada. Wood ash was also used in the home by colonials to make soap.|$|E
5000|$|By 1866, Kenmore was a post {{village with}} a {{population}} of about 80 of the township of Osgoode, on the Castor creek; the postmaster was Moses E. Tabid. It contained three stores, one flouring and saw mill, <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> factory and tannery. There was one church, Baptist, erected in 1851, of frame. The citizens included Mr Cowan, general merohant; Donald I McArthur, blacksmith; Michael Gillesia, general merchant & potash manufacturer; and John McDiarmid, flour andsaw mill proprietor.|$|E
50|$|Lye was {{produced}} by soaking ashes in hot water, filtering out the ashes, and repeating with fresh ashes as necessary to obtain the desired alkalinity in the resulting liquid. This liquid, commonly called lye could then be mixed with fats to produce soft soap, {{or it could be}} evaporated (often by boiling) to produce pot ash or black salts which still contained dark carbon impurities. The potash could then be baked in a kiln to further refine the substance into a pearly white material called <b>pearl</b> <b>ash,</b> pearl-ash or pearlash.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} years of European {{settlement}} of the Americas, settlers and some groups of Indigenous peoples of the Americas used soda or <b>pearl</b> <b>ash,</b> more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. In the US, soda breads were first publicised by Amelia Simmons as a quick and cheap method of bread making in her book American Cookery, published in 1796. By 1824, The Virginia Housewife by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.|$|E
50|$|Appleton {{was born}} in New Ipswich, New Hampshire. From 1790 to 1792, he cleared fields in Maine for farming. He also taught school. For a time he kept a store in Ipswich. In 1794, he moved to Boston where he became an {{importer}} in partnership with his brother Nathan as S. & N. Appleton, buying European dry goods at auction and for resale to country traders in exchange for homespun cloth as well as pot and <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> for export to Britain. He also later established cotton mills at Waltham and Lowell, Massachusetts. After 1799 he passed {{much of his time}} in Britain, and at age 53 married a widow, Mrs. Mary Gore, with whom he had no children. He retired from business in 1823.|$|E
5000|$|Clabber Girl is a {{brand of}} baking powder, baking soda, and corn starch popular in the United States. It is {{manufactured}} by Hulman & Company, which also owns and operates the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and INDYCAR, the sanctioning body for American open-wheel racing. The brand also owns the Rumford baking powder label. The Clabber Girl name brand comes from the word [...] "clabber", a synonym of sour milk. In the early 1800s, people mixed clabber with <b>pearl</b> <b>ash,</b> soda, cream of tartar, {{and a few other}} ingredients to make what we know today as baking powder. The first baking powder brand by Hulman and company was the [...] "Milk Brand". In 1899, it was changed to the [...] "Clabber Brand".

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Fearn, Ross & Cromarty, Scotland, son of Alexander Ross and Christian Ross (maiden surname also Ross) and emigrated to Quebec City in {{approximately}} 1829. In the 1830s, he worked in a mercantile house in Quebec and was captain of a ship trading to the West Indies. On 10 May 1838, he married Marianna Browne (1820 [...] - [...] 1890) of Quebec City, {{with whom he had}} fourteen children (ten surviving). He and his family subsequently relocated to the Eastern Townships and in 1845 he founded the village of Gould, Quebec, where he manufactured <b>pearl</b> <b>ash,</b> ran a general store and served as the village's mayor. He spoke four languages [...] - [...] English, Gaelic, French and Spanish [...] - [...] and contributed poetry to newspapers such as the Sherbrooke Gazette.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1767, potash from wood ashes was {{exported}} from Canada, and exports of potash and <b>pearl</b> <b>ash</b> (potash and lime) reached 43,958 barrels in 1865. There were 519 asheries in operation in 1871. The industry {{declined in the}} late 19th century when large-scale production of potash from mineral salts was established in Germany. In 1943, potash was discovered in Saskatchewan, Canada, {{in the process of}} drilling for oil. Active exploration began in 1951. In 1958, the Potash Company of America became the first potash producer in Canada with the commissioning of an underground potash mine at Patience Lake; however, due to water seepage in its shaft, production stopped late in 1959 but following extensive grouting and repairs, resumed in 1965. The underground mine was flooded in 1987 and was reactivated for commercial production as a solution mine in 1989.|$|E
50|$|Daniel Carpenter, {{father of}} W. B. Carpenter, of Mansfield, {{was one of}} the {{principal}} promoters of the business and industrial interests of Newville. He had a store of general merchandise and founded and operated a tannery and an ashery. Baltimore was the market place for {{this part of the country}} at that time and the journey to and from - a round-trip distance of a thousand miles - had to be made with wagon teams, part of the journey was over mountain roads. Grain was too bulky, heavy and low-priced to haul so far to market. Ginseng, maple sugar and beeswax were the principal marketable articles and they were not all-year-round products. To further the business interests of the town, Daniel Carpenter founded an ‚Äúashery,‚Äù and manufactured another exportable commodity - <b>pearl</b> <b>ash.</b> His teams traversed the country for miles around, buying ashes of the farmers, thus adding to their meager income.|$|E
