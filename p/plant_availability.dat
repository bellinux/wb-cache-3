To solve the new possibilistic formulation that results, the main resolution approaches in the literature have been applied, leading always to equivalent but larger crisp systems that can be solved with commercial resolution softwares.

50|$|The Iberian ibex is {{generally}} a mixed feeder between a browser and a grazer, {{depending on the}} <b>plant</b> <b>availability</b> in their home range. Thus, the percentage of each type of resource that is consumed will vary altitudinally, geographically, and seasonally. The ibex also has a special mechanism in the kidney that stores fat {{in order to be}} used as energy during the cold winter times. The highest body storage of kidney fat can be found during the productive warm seasons and the lowest during the cold period. The body storage is characterized by limited the food resources. Foraging in ibexes is also different depending on the season. When food resources are low during the winter, ibexes would reduce their rates of movement when foraging. However, during the spring season, when food is more available, they would increase their rate of movement and become more mobile in finding food. This would be the ideal trend of movement since the spring season is more abundant in food resources meaning that there is more competition for food resources forcing some to trek farther in order to obtain food.|$|E
40|$|Problems with Mn {{deficiency}} {{are significant}} in global crop production. Attempts {{to assess the}} <b>plant</b> <b>availability</b> of Mn have been impeded as it is highly redox sensitive and can be present in soil {{in a variety of}} chemical species having very different <b>plant</b> <b>availability</b> depending on the soil conditions. The Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films (DGT) technique {{is one of the most}} promising techniques for assessing plant nutrient and contaminant availability in soils. We tested the possibility of using DGT to assess Mn availability in soils under different conditions relevant to agricultural crops. It was found that it worked perfectly at pH 4 to 6 in model solutions with Mn concentrations relevant to agricultural soils. When different concentrations of competing cations (Ca, Mg, and Fe) were added at pH 6. 5 the DGT still worked satisfactorily, but there were some indications that the highest concentrations influenced the DGT adsorbtion of Mn. Synchrotron analysis showed that Mn(II), which is the most prevalent oxidation state of Mn, was depleted in the soil when exposed to the DGT. Different soil deployment time showed that the DGT was able to register differences in <b>plant</b> <b>availability</b> caused by redox changes. Thus, our results suggest that the DGT technique may represent an efficient and reliable way of getting information on the <b>plant</b> <b>availability</b> of Mn in agricultural soils.
