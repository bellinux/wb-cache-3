50|$|Friction bullet traps {{slow and}} capture the bullet more gently than steel plates. This allows more {{effective}} capture of contaminants {{and reduces the}} production of dust as well as allowing for the capture of higher energy projectiles which would wear an impact trap too quickly and necessitate uneconomical levels of maintenance. The {{most common form of}} friction trap is a berm of granular material such as sand; earth or granulated rubber. In some circumstances a wall of railway ties, intact vehicle tires, or blocks of shock attenuating concrete (SACON) or other <b>proprietary</b> <b>materials</b> may be used. SACON is a fiber-reinforced concrete substituting expanded polystyrene beads for gravel aggregate. For ISSF 50Metre rifle events, individual bullet traps comprising a metal box filled with plastic beads are often used behind the electronic scoring systems used for such events. Such systems require less space than earthen berms whilst being quieter than steel impact or deceleration traps, which can be a significant consideration for urban outdoor range complexes. Individual bullet traps of this nature would typically be backed by a concrete wall to protect from negligent discharges or mechanical failures causing a bullet to miss the target entirely but which is not expected to be struck during the course of normal firing. Intact vehicle tyres are generally only suitable for higher energy projectiles which will easily penetrate their surface. Handgun bullets and shotgun pellets may ricochet back. Granulated rubber (often from shredded tires) is a convenient capture material from which bullets may be separated by gravity during agitation by subsequent bullet impact.|$|E

40|$|The <b>proprietary</b> <b>materials</b> used {{to repair}} {{concrete}} structures are often polymer-modified hydraulic binders. The {{influence of the}} presence of polymer on the properties of these composites has been studied, but few works have focused on the evolution of these properties when the material is applied on a structure exposed to an environment that can be aggressive to concrete. In this paper, the properties of polymer-modified mortars made in the laboratory are reported and compared to those obtained on similar commercial products but whose precise composition is unknown. Thus, the influence of the type and quantity of polymer on the consistency, the setting time, the microstructure, the porosity and the mechanical properties of the mortars are analyzed. Special attention is given {{to the study of the}} influence of the curing conditions on the final properties of the hardened material...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{conservation}} {{treatment of}} Arthur Boyd’s paintings from the Heide Museum of Modern Art collection has {{raised questions about}} his studio practice and material preferences. Four paintings on muslin board from Boyd’s 1943 – 44 ‘South Melbourne’ series appear to use unconventional materials, which may highlight the practical realities of wartime shortages of artist paints and the alternative use of <b>proprietary</b> <b>materials.</b> The conservation treatments of Boyd’s paintings initiated scientific investigations using Fourier Transform Infrared and Scanning Electron Microscopy, which is assessed {{in the context of}} Boyd’s archival documents and personal correspondence. This paper presents new findings on Boyd’s material choices and his intentions early in his career. Evidence suggests that Boyd used an oleoresinous varnish and experimented with new organic colourants. The use of non-traditional materials has consequently resulted in the Heide paintings exhibiting unusual ageing characteristics and by necessity, their conservation treatment. This highlights future preservation problems for 20 th century Australian works of art. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Electron beam curing {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} composites was explored {{over thirty years}} ago. Since then there have been developments in accelerator technology, in processes for handling materials presented to an accelerator, and in materials {{that can be used}} as matrix binders. In recent years in North America, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) have been formed involving collaboration amongst materials suppliers, accelerator manufacturers and service providers, national laboratories, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and interested potential users. The scope and status of these CRADAs are reviewed along with other recent developments in the electron beam curing of composites in North America. Innovative and <b>proprietary</b> <b>materials</b> technology has been developed and progress made toward implementing commercial practice.
