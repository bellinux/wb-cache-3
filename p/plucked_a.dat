5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated {{about a man who}} <b>plucked</b> <b>a</b> gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it {{does not appear to have}} been extant in 1902.|$|E

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I <b>plucked</b> <b>a</b> leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fretting}} hand {{can also be}} used to sound notes, either by <b>plucking</b> <b>an</b> open string with the {{fretting hand}}, or, in the case of a string that has already been plucked or picked, by [...] "hammering on" [...] a higher pitch or [...] "pulling off" [...] <b>a</b> finger to <b>pluck</b> <b>a</b> lower fretted or open stringed note. Jazz bassists use a subtle form of fretting hand pizzicato by <b>plucking</b> <b>a</b> very brief open string grace note with the fretting hand right before playing the string with the <b>plucking</b> hand. When <b>a</b> string is rapidly hammered on, the note can be prolonged into a trill.|$|R

500|$|On 1 August 1971, Harrison {{performed}} [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as {{the opening}} {{song for the}} rock-music portion of the two Concert for Bangladesh shows, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. It was therefore the first song he ever played live as a solo artist and, given the humanitarian cause behind the event, Alan Clayson writes, the New York audience [...] "loved him... before he'd even <b>plucked</b> <b>a</b> string". The running order of the Concert for Bangladesh live album follows the setlist for the second show that day, about which Joshua Greene remarks on the [...] "logical chronology" [...] in Harrison's three-song opening segment: [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] "declared his independence from the Beatles, followed by 'My Sweet Lord,' which declared his internal discovery of God and spirit, and then 'Awaiting on You All,' which projected his message to the world." [...] Re-creating the Wall of Sound from All Things Must Pass, Harrison was backed by a large band that again included Clapton, Starr, Preston, Voormann and Badfinger, together with musicians such as Leon Russell, saxophonist Jim Horn and drummer Jim Keltner, {{and a group of}} seven backing singers.|$|E

2500|$|Like Ares {{who was the}} son of Zeus and Hera, Mars {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the son of Jupiter and Juno. However, in a version of his birth given by Ovid, he {{was the son of}} Juno alone. Jupiter had usurped the mother's function when he gave birth to Minerva directly from his forehead (or mind); to restore the balance, Juno sought the advice of the goddess Flora on how to do the same. Flora obtained a magic flower (Latin flos, plural flores, a masculine word) and tested it on a [...] who became fecund at once. She then <b>plucked</b> <b>a</b> flower ritually using her thumb, touched Juno's belly, and impregnated her. Juno withdrew to Thrace and the shore of Marmara for the birth.|$|E

2500|$|When he was 22 years old, Muir {{enrolled}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, paying his own way for several years. There, under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall, Muir took his first botany lesson. A fellow student <b>plucked</b> <b>a</b> flower from the tree {{and used it to}} explain how the grand locust {{is a member of the}} pea family, related to the straggling pea plant. Fifty years later, the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography. [...] "This fine lesson charmed me and sent me flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm." [...] As a freshman, Muir studied chemistry with Professor Ezra Carr and his wife Jeanne; they became lifelong friends and Muir developed a lasting interest in chemistry and the sciences. Muir took an eclectic approach to his studies, attending classes for two years but never being listed higher than a first-year student due to his unusual selection of courses. Records showed his class status as [...] "irregular gent" [...] and, even though he never graduated, he learned enough geology and botany to inform his later wanderings.|$|E
