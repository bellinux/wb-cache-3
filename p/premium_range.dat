Certain restrictions about combinations {{have been put in}} place to prevent people from designing plates which appear too-much like numeral-only plates which are auctioned off separately (e.g. 9I2 would not be allowed as it is too similar to 912). There are also restrictions preventing people from picking combinations that are too similar to special plates issued by the Authority (for instance, HC-nnn and HC-nnnn combinations are reserved only for accredited hire-car operators).|$|E

South Australian [...] "Premium" [...] registration plates feature black characters on a white base, and the letters [...] "SA" [...] down the side, in the same format as NSW [...] "Premium" [...] registration plates.

From this {{it can be seen}} that Tesco has experienced success with this area of the market and according to Kantar Worldpanel, Tesco Finest range [...] "is now the fastest growing premium brand in the market". It can be viewed that Tesco is attempting to break into the premium products market through the use of venture brands marketed as high quality brands that do not carry the retailer name. By creating venture brands, {{it can be seen that}} Tesco is attempting to appeal to customers who are deterred by unbranded products. Tesco stated in its 2012 annual report [...] "to be a creator of highly valued brands".|$|E

Our results imply annual <b>premiums</b> <b>ranging</b> from under $ 100 per year to over $ 2, 062 per year. An interesting result is that those areas with the highest levels of expected loss are also those areas with the greatest concentration of waste lagoons.

30|$|The {{recently}} passed 2014 Farm Bill {{created a new}} Margin Protection Program that has similarities to the margin protection offered in the survey and some comparison is enlightening. While some refer to the new margin protection program as “insurance” it actually is not a true insurance program. The premiums are fixed rather than based on market assessments of risk. The fixed <b>premiums</b> <b>range</b> in price from free for a $ 4 /cwt margin to $ 1.36 /cwt for coverage of production over 4 million pounds at an $ 8 /cwt margin. The existence of this margin protection program will likely diminish the demand for private risk management tools and margin insurance.|$|R

Following in one father’s footsteps leads to a pay <b>premium</b> <b>ranging</b> from 5 % to 8 % for men but none for women. As this pay premium increases with labour market experience, we conclude that it stems from intergenerational transmission of human capital rather than pure nepotism...|$|R
