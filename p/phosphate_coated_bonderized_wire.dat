40|$|AbstractDue to {{containing}} some alloy {{elements such}} as chromium, 30 CrMnMoTi steel is usually difficult to be phosphated. In present paper, the growth process of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> on 30 CrMnMoTi alloy steel fabricated by a high temperature manganese phosphating was investigated. The microstructure, surface morphology, composition and corrosion resistance of the phosphate coatings were analyzed by XRD, SEM, EDS and electrochemical polarization method, respectively. The time dependence of open circuit potential (OCP) {{and the weight of}} the coating were also measured. It is found that the <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> is mainly composed of (Mn,Fe) 5 H 2 (PO 4) 4 · 4 H 2 O and consists of a lot of close packed lump crystallites. Based on the time dependence of morphology and the weight of phosphate films, it shows that the phosphating process mainly includes three stages: corrosion of the substrate, creation and growth of phosphate crystal nucleus and thickening of <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating.</b> For 30 CrMnMoTi steel, it takes at least 30 seconds and 3 minutes for the first and second step, respectively: at the beginning stage of phospahting process, a lot of bubbles emit, then a complete film will form at the end of bubbling, and the nucleation of phosphate film is inhomogeneous, phosphate crystal nucleus usually forms preferentially at grain boundary.
