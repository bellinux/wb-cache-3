She went on to say there are certain nationalities that will listen to mariachi and not banda. Those were the people that she was going after. She also stated, [...] "Commercializing a ranchera album is much harder. There had not been a successful female mariachi artist in a long time.

But as with all of The Billy Nayer Show’s musical enterprises, McAbee worked to create a unique sound for the musical elements of The American Astronaut - elements to not only advance the film’s narrative, but to fit the characters’ motivations and moods. Says McAbee, [...] "One of the things about the film that makes it unlike other musicals is that the music is organic - the people in the film aren’t just <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> for no reason.

You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|R
