5|$|On 29 June Army Norway {{launched}} {{its effort to}} capture Murmansk in a <b>pincer</b> attack. The northern <b>pincer,</b> conducted by Mountain Corps Norway, approached Murmansk directly by crossing the border at Petsamo. However, in mid-July after securing {{the neck of the}} Rybachy Peninsula and advancing to the Litsa River the German advance was stopped by heavy resistance from the Soviet 14th Army. Renewed attacks led to nothing, and this front became a stalemate for the remainder of Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal's double envelopment at Cannae {{is often}} viewed {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} battlefield maneuvers in history, and is cited as the first successful use of the <b>pincer</b> movement within the Western world to be recorded in detail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pincers</b> are a {{hand tool}} {{used in many}} {{situations}} where a mechanical advantage is required to pinch, cut or pull an object. <b>Pincers</b> are first-class levers, but differ from pliers in that the concentration of force is either to a point, or to an edge perpendicular {{to the length of}} the tool. This allows <b>pincers</b> to be brought close to a surface, as is often required when working with nails. If the <b>pincers</b> have perpendicular cutting edges, the <b>pincers</b> are often called end-nippers or end-cutters. Carpenter's <b>pincers</b> are particularly suited to these tasks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pincers</b> are {{primarily}} used for removing objects {{out of a}} material {{that they have been}} previously applied to. <b>Pincers,</b> often red-hot, have been used as an instrument of torture since ancient Roman times or earlier.|$|R
50|$|A {{pseudoscorpion}} {{has eight}} legs with {{five to seven}} segments; the number of fused segments is used to distinguish families and genera. They have two very long pedipalps with palpal chelae (<b>pincers)</b> which strongly resemble the <b>pincers</b> found on a scorpion.|$|R
5|$|Earwigs {{have five}} molts {{in the year}} before they become adults. Many earwig species display {{maternal}} care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in <b>pincer</b> shapes begins to show.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a <b>pincer,</b> with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged <b>pincer</b> movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E

6000|$|Bremner {{introduced}} the <b>pincers</b> slowly, being {{anxious to get}} a good hold of the tooth. Forsyth uttered a groan in anticipation! Alarmed lest he should struggle too soon, Bremner made a sudden grasp and caught the tooth. A wrench followed; a yell was the result, and the <b>pincers</b> slipped! ...|$|R
50|$|The Germans still {{maintained}} an advantage and the outnumbered Americans withdrew closer to Bastogne. The Germans sent <b>pincers</b> {{to the north}} and south. The night of 21 December, the <b>pincers</b> met and closed west of the city. In the surrounded city, the 10th assembled a mobile reserve force to strike in any direction.|$|R
5|$|For the 357 {{campaign}} season, a {{plan was}} laid down at Constantius' headquarters in Mediolanum (Milan) to trap the Alamanni in eastern Gaul in a <b>pincer</b> movement. Julian would advance eastward from Reims, while the {{major part of}} Constantius' comitatus in Italy (25,000 strong) was despatched under magister peditum (field marshal) Barbatio to Augusta Rauracorum (Augst) in Raetia, from which he was to advance northward to meet Julian. The Alamanni bands would be cornered and destroyed {{in the southern part}} of Germania I province (Alsace).|$|E
5|$|Habré started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of {{northern}} Chad with a successful {{attack on the}} well-defended Libyan communications base of Fada. Against the Libyan army the Chadian commander Hassan Djamous {{conducted a series of}} swift <b>pincer</b> movements, enveloping the Libyan positions and crushing them with sudden attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the battles of B'ir Kora and Ouadi Doum, inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|Late Roman {{emperors}} continued {{major and}} frequent offensive operations beyond the imperial borders throughout the 4th century. These were strikingly {{similar to the}} <b>pincer</b> movements described by Luttwak as being characteristic of forward defence in the early Principate. For example, Valentinian I's campaign against the Quadi in 375. Julian in 356–60 and Valentinian I in 368–74 carried out several operations across the Rhine and Danube designed to force the submission of local tribes and their acceptance of tributarii status.|$|E
500|$|Most earwigs are {{flattened}} (which {{allows them}} to fit inside tight crevices, such as under bark) with an elongated body generally [...] long. The largest certainly extant species is the Australian giant earwig (Titanolabis colossea) which is approximately [...] long, while the possibly extinct Saint Helena earwig (Labidura herculeana) reached [...] Earwigs are characterized by the cerci, or the pair of forceps-like <b>pincers</b> on their abdomen; male earwigs generally have more curved <b>pincers</b> than females. These <b>pincers</b> are used to capture prey, defend themselves and fold their wings under the short tegmina. The antennae are thread-like with at least 10 segments.|$|R

Appears as a {{humanoid}} {{with a face}} on its {{chest with}} drills for eyes {{as well as a}} mouth with large triangular teeth, two <b>pincers</b> for hands, a fan for its head, two electrodes on the scalp used to create an electric barrier, and skate-like wheels on each foot. Armed with extensible arms to give <b>pincers</b> greater distance, a flamethrower from the mouth on its chest as well as comb-like missiles, can emit electricity from its <b>pincers,</b> and the fan on its head can fire a volley of energy arrows.|$|R

5|$|The Regiment {{followed}} the navy from a distance, avoiding detection. They {{hid in the}} San Carlos Convent, in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe. San Martín watched the enemy ships {{from the top of}} the convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to pillage and the regiment charged into battle. San Martín employed a <b>pincer</b> movement to trap the royalists. He led one column and Justo Bermúdez the other.|$|E
5|$|The Voronezh Front, {{commanded}} by Nikolai Vatutin, was tasked with defending the southern {{face of the}} salient. The Central Front, {{commanded by}} Konstantin Rokossovsky, defended the northern face. Waiting in reserve was the Steppe Front, commanded by Ivan Konev. In February 1943, the Central Front had been reconstructed from the Don Front, which {{had been part of}} the northern <b>pincer</b> of Operation Uranus and had been responsible for the destruction of the 6th Army at Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 12 February. San Martín {{organized}} a <b>pincer</b> movement, with Soler leading the west column and O'Higgins the east one. O'Higgins, eager to avenge the defeat at Rancagua, {{rushed to the}} attack, instead of coordinating with Soler. This gave the royalists a brief advantage. San Martín instructed Soler to rush the attack as well. The combined attack was successful and San Martín's column secured the final victory. The battle ended with 600 royalists dead and 500 prisoners, with only 12 deaths and 120 injuries in the Army of the Andes.|$|E

5000|$|Some other {{intriguing}} {{attributes and}} behaviour of the C.lavauxi {{is the ability}} to live successfully under large amounts of sediment. Bacon [...] found that Cyclograpsus insularum was only able to tolerate 18% of sediment underneath boulders. When comparing this to C.lavauxi there is a stark discrepancy as C.lavauxi can withstand up to 63% of sediment which is sand and silt. There {{are a number of other}} unique behavioural traits associated with C.lavauxi including its aggressiveness when cornered which is rather unusual for a crab, with its <b>pincers</b> raised to accentuate their size along with showing the paleness of their <b>pincers.</b> Their major body postures include being flat with their <b>pincers</b> folded and laying on the ground with their walking legs close and side-by-side. When in a raised position they place their body at a 45 degree angle with their back part still laying on the ground with their <b>pincers</b> resting still either flat or poised at the midway mark. Their final position is the tiptoe position with their body angled and lifted off the ground and in the air, <b>pincers</b> still folded but held off the ground with their walking legs fully extended.|$|R

5|$|The bridgehead, {{captured}} by the 6th Airborne Division, was the subquent launching point {{for a number of}} following operations. I Corps conducted the eastern <b>pincer</b> of Operation Perch out of the bridgehead, but were halted by the 21st Panzer Division. A later operation, Dreadnought, was planned but cancelled; it intended for VIII Corps to use the bridgehead as a basis for an outflanking attack on Caen. Finally, Operations Atlantic and Goodwood attacked out of the bridgehead liberating the remaining sectors of Caen and ending the Battle for Caen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as Ferdinand, Tac HQ ran Otterington. This {{deception}} built a threat against Rimini in the east of Italy, in support of Alexander's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line. It developed a <b>pincer</b> movement, in tandem with Ferdinand's threat to the west. However, once Otterington had gotten underway, with a major buildup of dummy armour, Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini. Clarke hastily implemented Ulster, a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the hope it would distract attention from that sector.|$|E
5|$|Citadel was {{the last}} German {{strategic}} offensive on the Eastern Front, {{and one of the}} largest battles in history, involving more than four million men. By the time the Wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 July 1943, the Soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one. Walther Model was in command of the northern <b>pincer,</b> with the Ninth Army, while Manstein's Army Group South formed the southern <b>pincer.</b> Both armies were slowed as the tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared Soviet defensive lines. After five days of fighting Model's advance was stopped, with the Ninth Panzers suffering 25,000 casualties. By 13 July Model's forces were being drawn away towards Orel, where the Soviet army had launched Operation Kutuzov. Manstein's forces were able to penetrate the Soviet lines, causing heavy casualties. He reached, but did not enter or capture, Prokhorovka, his first major objective, on 11 July, inflicting serious Soviet losses in the resulting Battle of Prokhorovka. However, on 13 July Hitler called off the failed Kursk offensive; the Allies had landed in Sicily, so he issued the order for a withdrawal. Manstein protested; he felt that the Soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in the area, and {{he did not want to}} stop until all his own reserves had been committed. Hitler, however, insisted on calling off the operation. Although Soviet casualties were indeed heavy, modern historians discount the possibility of a successful German continuation of the offensive.|$|E
50|$|This crab has a small, arrowhead-shaped body, {{which may}} be 20 mm in height, and long, spindly legs, which may grow to 60 mm in length. Its <b>pincers</b> are {{considerably}} sturdier than its legs and are tipped with white claws. The body is pinkish or reddish, and the legs and <b>pincers</b> are usually a darker red.|$|R

5|$|In 6 BC, Tiberius {{launched}} a <b>pincer</b> movement against the Marcomanni. Setting out northwest from Carnuntum on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through Quadi territory {{in order to}} invade the Marcomanni from the east. Meanwhile, general Gaius Sentius Saturninus would depart east from Moguntiacum on the Rhine {{with two or three}} legions, pass through newly annexed Hermunduri territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.|$|E
5|$|In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing Major General Charles P. Hall's XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and Major General Joseph M. Swing's 11th Airborne Division at Nasugbu, Batangas {{two days}} later. Combining with Sixth Army, the Eighth Army enveloped Manila {{in a great}} <b>pincer</b> movement. Eichelberger assumed {{personal}} command of the operation, which involved an advance on Manila by the lightly equipped 11th Airborne Division. The audacious advance made rapid progress until it was halted by well-prepared positions {{on the outskirts of}} Manila. MacArthur awarded Eichelberger another Silver Star.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1943 Australian-led forces {{mounted a}} <b>pincer</b> {{movement}} to capture Lae. On 4 September 9 Division made an amphibious landing {{to the east}} of the town and began advancing to the west. The following day, the US 503rd Parachute Regiment made an unopposed parachute drop at Nadzab, just west of Lae. Once the airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield the 7th Division was flown in and began advancing to the east in a race with the 9th Division to capture Lae. This race was won by the 7th Division, which captured the town on 15 September. The Japanese forces at Salamaua and Lae suffered heavy losses during this campaign, but were able to escape to the north.|$|E
50|$|H. tamulus {{specimen}} {{range in}} size from 50-90 mm. The coloration ranges from dark orange or brightly red-brown through dull brown with darker grey carinae (ridges) and granulation. Grey spots might be distributed irregularly across the cephalothorax and the mesosoma. The walking legs and the tip of the pedipalp <b>pincers</b> are brighter colored (orange-yellow to light reddish-brown). The mesosomal tergites always bear three distinct carinae. Their habitus is typical of buthid scorpions, with rather small pedipalp <b>pincers,</b> moderately thickened metasomal segments and a rather bulbous telson with large stinger. The base of the pedipalp <b>pincers</b> (manus) is slightly more inflated in males than in females.|$|R
