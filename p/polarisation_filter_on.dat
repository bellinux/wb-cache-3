40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{landmine}} detection performance of an infrared and a visual light camera both {{equipped with a}} <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> are compared with the detection performance of these cameras without <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters.</b> Sequences of images have been recorded with in front of these cameras a rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter.</b> Due to optical distortion of the rotating filter the sequence contains apparent motion. This motion is estimated from the images and corrected using bilinear interpolation. From the motion corrected sequences both the unpolarised intensity and the polarisation parameters are estimated. The detection performance is evaluated with Receiver Operator Characteristics curves. It is shown that, for higher detection rates, classifiers based on polarisation features perform better than classifiers based on the intensity cue only. The linear combination of both has the best overall performance for the scenes considered. The infrared camera outperforms the visual light camera in the difficult scene...|$|R

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) A camera {{navigation}} system was developed that attempted {{to mimic the}} way bees navigate using polarisation patterns of light. Initially, a simulation was performed to determine the mathematic calculations involved in transforming polarisation patterns into compass heading relative to the sun. Next, a simple inexpensive camera system was deployed to determine feasibility using ordinary cameras with <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters.</b> The final step involved taking this simple system {{and replacing it with}} a high-end camera system using fish eye lenses and mounting it on a fixed-wing model aircraft. This last step extended the work of previous researchers who had either only used <b>filtered</b> photodiode arrays <b>on</b> fixed-wing aircraft or <b>filtered</b> cameras <b>on</b> a non-pitching and non-rolling rotating wing aircraft (quad-copter). It was found that despite pitch and roll of the aircraft, a standard deviation of approximately 30 ° was achieved relative to true heading values obtained from the aircraft's flight computer. This result opens up future avenues of research that might one day lead to a robust camera polarisation system for navigation of autonomous vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{infrared}} (IR) radiation emitted or {{reflected in}} an off-normal direction from a smooth surface is partially polarised. This principle {{can be used}} for enhanced discrimination of targets from backgrounds in a marine environment. It has been shown that (man-made) targets do not demonstrate a pronounced polarisation effect when observed from near normal direction whereas the sea background radiation has a certain degree of polarisation in slant observation path. A measurement setup has been constructed for collecting polarised IR imagery. This setup contains a rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> that rotates synchronously with the frame sync of the camera. Either a long wave IR (LWIR) or a mid wave IR (MWIR) camera can be mounted behind the rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter.</b> The synchronisation allows a sequence of images to be taken with a predefined constant angle of rotation between the images. Out of this image sequence three independent Stokes images are constructed, containing the normal intensity part, the vertical/horizontal polarisation and the diagonal polarisation. Upto 20 full linearly polarised images can be acquired per second. Measurements are taken at the North Sea coast with this setup. The recorded images are analysed to determine the influence of polarisation on the detection of small targets in such an environment. Furthermore differences between polarisation contrasts in MWIR are analyse...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} detailed {{investigation of}} UV inscribed fibre grating based devices and novel {{developments in the}} applications of such devices in optical sensing and fibre laser systems. The major contribution of this PhD programme includes the systematic study on fabrication, spectral characteristics and applications {{of different types of}} UV written in-fibre gratings such as Type I and IA Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs), Chirped Fibre Bragg Gratings (CFBGs) and Tilted Fibre Gratings (TFGs) with small, large and 45 º tilted structures inscribed in normal silica fibre. Three fabrication techniques including holographic, phase-mask and blank beam exposure scanning, which were employed to fabricate a range of gratings in standard single mode fibre, are fully discussed. The thesis reports the creation of smart structures with self-sensing capability by embedding FBG-array sensors in Al matrix composite. In another part of this study, we have demonstrated the particular significant improvements made in sensitising standard FBGs to the chemical surrounding medium by inducing microstructure to the grating by femtosecond (fs) patterning assisted chemical etching technique. Also, a major work is presented for the investigation on the structures, inscription methods and spectral Polarisation Dependent Loss (PDL) and thermal characteristics of different angle TFGs. Finally, a very novel application in realising stable single polarisation and multiwavelength switchable Erbium Doped Fibre Lasers (EDFLs) using intracavity <b>polarisation</b> selective <b>filters</b> based <b>on</b> TFG devices with tilted structures at small, large and exact 45 ° angles forms another important contribution of this thesis.

40|$|Linear {{polarisation}} of Thermal InfraRed (TIR) radiation occurs whenever {{radiation is}} reflected or emitted from a smooth surface (such {{as the top}} of a landmine) and observed from a grazing angle. The background (soil and vegetation) is generally much rougher and therefore has less pronounced linear polarised radiation. This difference in polarisation can be used to enhanced detection of land mines using TIR cameras. A measurement setup is constructed for measurement of polarised TIR images. This setup contains a rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> which rotates synchronously with the frame sync of the camera. Either a Long Wave InfraRed (LWIR) or a Mid Wave InfraRed (MWIR) camera can be mounted behind the rotating <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter.</b> The synchronisation allows a sequence of images to be taken with a predefined constant angle of rotation between the images. Out of this image sequence three independent Stokes images are calculated, consisting of the unpolarised part, the vertical/horizontal polarisations and the two diagonal polarisations. An initial model is developed that describes the polarisation due to reflection of and emission from a smooth surface. This model predicts the linear polarisation for a landmine 'illuminated' by a source that is either hotter or cooler than the surface of them landmine. The measurement setup is used indoors to validate the model. The measurements agree well with the model predictions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an airborne experiment using horizontal and vertical polarising <b>filters</b> <b>on</b> a pair of co-mounted 12. 8 megapixel Canon 5 D digital cameras. These cameras were mounted in the underside camera port of a light aircraft, both cameras inclined at 30 degrees off-nadir. One camera had the <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter</b> oriented vertically and the other oriented horizontally. Forward-looking, overlapping, oblique aerial photography was captured over known seagrass meadows off the Adelaide metropolitan coastline, plus inland urban water bodies. The portrait oriented field of view allowed a progression on the image from near-nadir to beyond the critical Brewster angle of 53 degrees. Results show the removal of sky reflectance, turbulence and wave action <b>on</b> the vertically-oriented <b>filter</b> imagery compared to the horizontally-oriented filter imagery in both clear and turbid waters. For clear waters the removal of sky reflectance, waves and surface turbulence allowed visualisation of the seafloor suitable for benthic mapping in areas of seagrass. However in turbid water the removal of surface effects still did not allow the seafloor to be visualised due to multiple scatter {{in the body of the}} water. This method therefore also has application in differentiating clear and turbid waters on oblique photography...|$|R

50|$|In gemology/gemmology, the {{gemstone}} refractometer is one {{the fundamental}} {{pieces of equipment}} used in a gemological laboratory. Gemstones are transparent minerals and can therefore be examined using optical methods. Refractive index is a material constant, dependent on the chemical composition of a substance. The refractometer is used to help identify gem materials by measuring their refractive index, {{one of the principal}} properties used in determining the type of a gemstone. Due to the dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength of the light used (i.e. dispersion), the measurement is normally taken at the wavelength of the sodium line D-line (NaD) of ~589 nm. This is either filtered out from daylight or generated with a monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED). Certain stones such as rubies, sapphires, tourmalines and topaz are optically anisotropic. They demonstrate birefringence based on the polarisation plane of the light. The two different refractive indexes are classified using a <b>polarisation</b> <b>filter.</b> Gemstone refractometers are available both as classic optical instruments and as electronic measurement devices with a digital display.|$|R

40|$|Bad weather {{conditions}} including haze, fog, rain etc. degrade the picture quality which causes poor visualizations. Various {{methods have been}} proposed to eradicate the effects of above conditions. Initially, polarization filters were used to restore the foggy image. Though this method estimates airlight to quite good an extent {{but at the same}} time uses multiple images therefore, cannot be applied on dynamic scenes. In addition, it has very high time complexity. To overcome the use of multiple images Dark channel prior technique was used that effectively calculates the transmission map to restore the foggy image. For this purpose it requires usage of soft matting technique that causes halo effect and has high time complexity. We are of the opinion that if transmission map is calculated using dark channel prior and airlight is estimated using <b>polarisation</b> <b>filters,</b> the resultant process will not only have lower time complexity {{but at the same time}} overcomes the drawback of multiple images. The above mentioned technique is implemented in MATLAB- 9 and analysed in this paper. The results shows that usage of this hybrid approach gives quite better results...|$|R
