40|$|A control {{strategy}} for fault tolerant PM motors is developed and addresses the operation during a cooling {{failure in the}} power-electronic converter. A fault tolerant PM motor interfaced with a parallel H-bridge per-phase topology is considered. Conventional pulse-width modulation (<b>PWM)</b> based <b>voltage</b> generation is used under normal operation. However, the parallel H-bridge module per-phase topology benefits from the capability to generate quasi-square wave (QSW) voltages {{as an alternative to}} <b>PWM</b> <b>voltages.</b> The generation of a QSW voltage incurs lower switching losses compared with <b>PWM</b> based <b>voltage</b> generation and the former can be utilized as a safe operating mode for the converter. Typically, converters designed for aero-space applications are equipped with liquid cooling systems and may also require continuous duty operation under cooling system failure. This paper considers the possibility to alternate between these two switching methods for the regulation of converter temperature under contingency e. g., during reduced cooling conditions. Simulated operating point waveforms of current, voltage and torque during PWM and QSW modes are presented for a 18 kW 20 krpm machine. A reduction in losses in the range of 20 %- 50 % is estimated via simulations. Thermal simulations present the temperature regulation capability with the dual mode controller...|$|R

50|$|The output {{inverter}} {{consists of}} IGBTs that {{draw on the}} power of the DC bus to create an AC voltage. A voltage created by power-switching devices like IGBTs is not sinusoidal. It is a pulse-width modulated (PWM) waveform very high in harmonic distortion. This <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> is then passed through an inductor/capacitor filter system that produces a sine-wave voltage with less than 3% total harmonic distortion (standards for computer grade power allow up to 5% THD). By contrast, VFDs generate a <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> that limits their versatility and makes them unsuitable for many applications. Software in the DSP continually monitors and adjusts this generated voltage to produce a balanced three-phase output at all times. It also provides protective functions by shutting down in case of utility over-voltage and under-voltage or a fault. With the ability to adjust to changing conditions and maintain voltage balance, a digital phase converter can safely and efficiently operate virtually any type of three-phase equipment or any number of multiple loads.|$|E

Therefore, the assessment and improvement in the performance of transformer cores under <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> excitation have become prominent. This project intends to characterise the no-load performance, total power loss and acoustic noise level, of a model three-phase, three-limb laminated transformer core, operating under sinusoidal and <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> excitation. Measurements of total power losses and localised flux density in the joint regions of the core under sinusoidal and <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> excitation for assigned modulation index ma with switching frequency fs varied from 1 kHz to 3 kHz, has been carried out. The analysis highlights the form factor Kf of the secondary induced voltage as a key parameter in controlling the performance of eddy-current component loss in the core. The estimate localised rotational losses due to rotating flux and planar eddy-current losses due to normal flux density in the joints have been analysed, also the analysis of measurement results contributes towards a better understanding of the influence of ma and fs. Moreover, the acoustic noise level of the core and the corresponding vibration at investigated points on the core surface has been measured under sinusoidal and <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> excitation. Measurement results show that the values of acoustic noise and core vibration under <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> excitation were much higher than under corresponding sinusoidal voltage condition. Also, the magneto-mechanical resonant phenomenon of the core under <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> excitation has been observed, which was due to switching frequency fs close to the resonance vibration frequency of the core laminations that is a possible cause of increasing acoustic noise. The measurement results inferred that the resonant phenomenon could possibly occur in cores with different length laminations leading to variability of noise output according to how close the magnetising frequency or predominant harmonics are to the resonant frequency.

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} {{multilevel}} inverters, introduced about 20 years ago entails performing power conversion in multiple voltage steps to obtain improved power quality, lower switching losses, better electromagnetic compatibility, and higher voltage capability. The benefits are especially clear for medium-voltage drives in industrial applications {{and are being}} considered for future naval ship propulsion systems. The application of pulsewidth-modulated (<b>PWM)</b> <b>voltages</b> using two-level high-voltage inverters to a squirrel-cage induction motor (SQIM) can cause heating of rotor shaft, voltage spike across the motor terminals, etc. The {{increase in the number}} of steps of the motor voltage and hence decreasing the dv/dt applied to the machine terminals can be a solution to this problem. The existing topologies that generate this multistep voltage include cascading of a number of single-phase inverters or use of higher order multilevel inverters.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes a method of minimising the total losses of an inverter-fed 3 -phase squirrel-cage induction motor when the motor,is subjected to a pulse-width modulated (<b>PWM)</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform. The inverter is supplied from a d. c. link and operates at variable frequency to provide speed control of the motor. Appropriate triggering of the inverter's six main thyristors generates pulse-width modulated voltage waveforms for application to the induction motor. The operation of an induction motor with nonsinusoidal voltage applied results in a reduction of the motor's efficiency due to the harmonics present in the waveform. The aim of the project is to minimise the total losses by obtaining optimum <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> waveforms rather than by improving {{the design of the}} motor. This requires a thorough examination of motor losses. The determination of a RiM voltage waveform which may be produced by the described inverter is subjected to ccnstraints which characterise the operation of the drive system. The motor operates with constant airgap flux density throughout its speed range to obtain maximum output power at fixed per unit slip. In addition the switching frequency of the thyristors must not exceed a specified limit to avoid short circuiting of the inverter. The calculation of the motor's steady-state performances for both sine wave and PWM supplies is incorporated in a computer program. The detail of the experimental and theoretical performances are given and comparison is made between sinusoidal and <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> wave systems. Good agreement is obtained between test and calculated results on an inverter-fed 7. 5 kw squirrelcage induction motor. It is concluded that the degradation of motor efficiency due to the applied <b>PWM</b> <b>voltage</b> waves is mainly the result of increased copper losses, which are produced by harmonic currents. The minimisation of the losses for continuous, constant-flux, operation of the induction motor is achieved for the given constraints. It is found that the total losses can be further minimised if the d. c. link voltage is variable. This permits improved motor performance but adds complexity and cost to the d. c. link voltage supply...|$|E
