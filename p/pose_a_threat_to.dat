5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> both people and property.|$|E

5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{does not}} act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> both young and adults. As of 2007, the oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E
5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Bermuda, its government issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a {{school to be}} used as an emergency shelter, though few people used it.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{show that}} up to 500,000people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk. Lahars <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating {{that the threat of}} a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E

5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes {{to such an extent}} it never truly recovered. A native ruler, Psammetichus I was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> either Assyria or Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa and Australia, two of {{the three}} centers of species diversity, the natural {{habitats}} of these plants are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities. Expanding population centers (such as Queensland, Perth, and Cape Town) threaten many such habitats, as does the draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas. The droughts that have been sweeping Australia over the last 10 years also <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> many species by drying up previously moist areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Katrina, 150,000people and 120,000head of cattle in central Cuba were evacuated, {{according to a}} broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port.

5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} grey heron, European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of {{association}} with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution and large population, the red fox is one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade. Too small to <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark {{forms an}} {{important}} component of the commercial gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the highly populated region.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{animals are}} predators of or otherwise <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the wood turtle. They include snapping turtles, porcupines, raccoons, otters, foxes, and cats. All {{of these species}} destroy unhatched eggs and prey upon hatchlings and juveniles. Several animals that often target wood turtle eggs are the common raven and coyote, which may completely destroy the nests they encounter. Evidence of predatory attacks (wounds to the skin and such) are common on individuals, but the northern populations tend to display more scarring than the southern ones. In addition to these threats, wood turtles also suffer from leech infestations.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Yunnan hare {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it has been reported by residents to be commonly found. Although the current state of its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to be secure as it occurs in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions may <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. It occurs in protected areas and also in the Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.|$|E
