5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the <b>precedent</b> fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a <b>precedent</b> fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the <b>precedent</b> fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that when speakers refer to the same referent multiple times, they tend to standardize their descriptions by establishing linguistic <b>precedents.</b> In three experiments, we show that listeners reduce uncertainty in comprehension by taking advantage of these <b>precedents.</b> We tracked listeners' eye movements in a referential communication task and found that listeners identified referents more quickly when specific <b>precedents</b> existed than when there were none. Furthermore, we found that listeners expected speakers to adhere to <b>precedents</b> even in contexts where it would lead to referential overspecification. Finally, we provide evidence that the benefits of linguistic <b>precedents</b> are independent of mutual knowledge—listeners were not more likely to benefit from <b>precedents</b> when they were mutually known than when they were not. We conclude that listeners use <b>precedents</b> simply because they are available, not because they are mutually known...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a model of}} the complementarity of rules and <b>precedents</b> in the classification task. Under this model, <b>precedents</b> assist rule-based reasoning by operationalizing abstract rule antecedents. Conversely, rules assist case-based reasoning through case elaboration, the process of inferring case facts in order to increase the similarity between cases, and term reformulation, the process of replacing a term whose <b>precedents</b> only weakly match a case with terms whose <b>precedents</b> strongly match the case. Fully exploiting this complementarity requires a control strategy characterized by impartiality, the absence of arbitrary ordering restrictions on the use of rules and <b>precedents.</b> An impartial control strategy was implemented in GREBE in the domain of Texas worker's compensation law. In a preliminary evaluation, GREBE's performance was found to be as good or slightly better than the performance of law students on the same task.

5|$|An error as to a <b>precedent</b> fact, if committed, deprives {{the public}} {{authority}} {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition <b>precedent</b> or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was a <b>precedent</b> fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court <b>precedent.</b> Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with <b>precedent</b> because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court <b>precedent</b> was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the task of {{matching}} in case-based reasoning can often be improved by comparing new cases to portions of <b>precedents.</b> An example is presented that illustrates how combining portions of multiple <b>precedents</b> can permit new cases to be resolved that would be indeterminate if new cases could only be compared to entire <b>precedents.</b> A system that uses of portions of <b>precedents</b> for legal analysis {{in the domain of}} Texas worker's compensation law, GREBE, is described, and examples of GREBE's analysis that combine reasoning steps from multiple <b>precedents</b> are presented. 1 Introduction A central problem in automated legal reasoning is that many legal predicates lack definitions that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for their satisfaction (McCarty, 1990; Gardner, 1984). Such legal predicates are said to be "opentextured. " Open texture in legal predicates is an instance of the broader phenomenon of category polymorphy (Rosch and Mervis, 1975), the absence of precise [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Errors as to <b>precedent</b> facts, {{sometimes}} called jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a <b>precedent</b> fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E

50|$|The <b>precedents</b> {{are usually}} created in cases {{for which the}} {{applicable}} Acts of Parliament and decrees do not provide a clear solution for a question of law, or {{in which there is}} room for interpretation. Approximately 150 such <b>precedents</b> are decided each year.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any <b>precedent</b> fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the <b>precedent</b> fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated. On the facts of the case, the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the <b>precedent</b> fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E

40|$|When {{speakers}} {{refer to}} the same referent multiple times in a conversation, they tend to follow established patterns of usage, known as conversational <b>precedents.</b> Research has found that listeners expect speakers to follow <b>precedents,</b> and that this expectation guides their search for referents (Barr, D. J., &# 38; Keysar, B. (2002). Anchoring comprehension in linguistic <b>precedents.</b> Journal of Memory and Language, 46, 391 – 418). Recently, Metzing and Brennan (2003) (Metzing, C., &# 38; Brennan, S. E. (2003). When conceptual pacts are broken: partner-specific effects on the comprehension of referring expressions. Journal of Memory and Language, 49, 201 – 213) reported a speaker-specific effect for broken <b>precedents</b> that suggests early use of speaker information when <b>precedents</b> are broken. Results from two eyetracking experiments show that this speaker effect results from the late use of speaker information to recover from an early, partner-independent preemption effect. When a new description is heard, existing <b>precedents</b> preempt the mapping of the new description to an old referent. Later, listeners use speaker-information to inhibit <b>precedents</b> that are not known to the current speaker. Time-course data, {{as well as the}} results of a cognitive load manipulation, suggest that the preemption and speaker effects are supported by distinct processing systems. Our findings indicate that certain pragmatic effects in language comprehension are based on general expectations about language use, rather than assumptions about the beliefs and goals of particular speakers...|$|R
