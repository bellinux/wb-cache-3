5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all <b>persons</b> within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces <b>persons</b> within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also <b>persons</b> outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less <b>persons</b> than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all <b>persons</b> are treated alike, but rather that all <b>persons</b> in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently <b>persons</b> whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether <b>persons</b> falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all <b>persons</b> discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all <b>persons</b> not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E

5|$|Aggrieved <b>persons</b> who cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of <b>persons</b> is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all <b>persons</b> are treated alike, but rather that all <b>persons</b> in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of <b>persons</b> is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
