40|$|A {{new test}} {{structure}} {{was developed for}} evaluating the line spacing between conductors on the same layer using an electrical measurement technique. This compact structure {{can also be used}} to measure the sheet resistance, linewidth, and line <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the conducting <b>layer.</b> Using an integrated-circuit fabrication process, this structure was fabricated in diffused polycrystalline silicon and metal layers and measured optically and electrically. For the techniques used, the optical measurements were typically one-quarter micron greater than the electrical measurements. Most electrically measured line pitch values were within 2 percent of the designed value. A small difference between the measured and designed line pitch is used to validate sheet resistance, linewidth, and line spacing values...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{electromagnetic}} field analyses of superconducting power transmission cables consisting of coated conductors were made considering their three-dimensional spiraled structures. Thin strips of superconductor were wound spirally around a round former {{to represent a}} layer in a cable. The analyses were made for two-layer cables where the spiral <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the inner <b>layer</b> and that <b>of</b> the outer <b>layer</b> are different. A non-uniform lateral critical current density distribution, a trapezoidal distribution with shoulders, was assumed across each coated conductor. The calculated ac losses were compared with measured ones. The influence of the relative positions between the inner-layer coated conductors and the outer-layer coated conductors on the current distribution across each coated conductor as well as ac losses was discussed. The influence of the current distribution between layers, determined by the spiral pitches, on the ac losses was also studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to create a macromodel <b>of</b> {{interfacial}} transition <b>layer</b> in ceramic matrix composites. Chemical and mineralogical compositions were investigated by means of X-ray fluorescence analysis and X-ray diffractometry, ceramic and technological properties of raw materials were defined using standard test methods for argillaceous raw materials. Phase composition and structure of ceramic specimens were studied using a complex of modern physico-chemical analysis methods. The layer-by-layer model of shell-core transition in ceramic matrix material was suggested. Boundary conditions for obtaining specimens were defined in terms <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>layers,</b> thickness <b>of</b> such <b>layers</b> and <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> core-to-shell material ratio. Forced air supply was organized while burning for directed heat and mass transfer inside the specimens. Mineral composition <b>of</b> <b>layers</b> was defined for ceramic specimens with the core of iron ore waste and the shell of clay.

Experiments are conducted by maintaining constant wall temperature. Tests are performed on 3 different wire coiled coil matrix turbulators <b>of</b> different <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> 5, 10 and 15 mm without bonding of the turbulator. Three similar types of heat exchangers are fabricated and the wire coiled coil matrix turbulators with different <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> 5, 10 and 15 mm are inserted in the heat exchangers and bonding is done {{on the surface of}} the tube section. Results have indicated that the heat transfer rate enhances inversely with the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the wire coiled coil matrix turbulator with bonding. With a <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> 5 mm, the turbulators without bonding have resulted in almost 25. 4 % enhancement when compared with plain tube.
