The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package.

Incorporating appropriate <b>solar</b> <b>passive</b> features in climate responsive buildings are good options for energy conservation. This kind of building design integrates the micro-climate and architecture with human thermal comfort conditions and improves the building energy efficiency. From ancient times, people have used <b>solar</b> <b>passive</b> techniques in vernacular architectures throughout the world.
