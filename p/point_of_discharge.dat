25|$|Brush {{discharge}} occurs from a nonconductive charged {{surface or}} highly charged nonconductive liquids. The energy {{is limited to}} roughly 4 millijoules. To be hazardous, the voltage involved must be above about 20 kilovolts, the surface polarity must be negative, a flammable atmosphere must be present at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> and the discharge energy must be sufficient for ignition. Further, because surfaces have a maximum charge density, an area of at least 100cm2 has to be involved. This is {{not considered to be}} a hazard for dust clouds.|$|E

Gradually the Black Sea trade declined and Evan Thomas, Radcliffe, in common with other Cardiff shipowners, had to look elsewhere for their trade.

5000|$|Sewerage is the {{infrastructure}} that conveys sewage or surface runoff (stormwater, meltwater, rainwater) using sewers.

5000|$|The goal of {{the plasma}} {{generators}} is to convert the electric energy into the energy of charged and neutral particles - electrons, ions, atoms and molecules - which then would produce large quantities of chemical compounds of hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, in particular short-lived highly reactive species. Bombardment of the substrate with all constituent plasma species cleans and chemically activates the surface. In addition, at the contact <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> filaments the surface can locally reach high temperatures. This modifies the topography of the surface improving mechanical binding of the adhesive.|$|R
40|$|In August 2006, toxic wastes were {{discharged}} in {{the district}} of Abidjan, causing important health consequences in many households in the area. In order to appreciate the socio-economic impact of the consequences <b>of</b> toxic waste <b>discharge</b> on the households and of the measures taken by the authorities to deal with this catastrophe, and to appreciate the spatial extent of the pollution, we undertook a multidisciplinary transversal investigation at the sites <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> toxic waste, from October the 19 (th) to December the 8 (th), 2006, using a transect sampling methodology. This paper presents the results related to the socio-economic aspects of the survey while the environmental and epidemiological results are presented in two other published papers. The socioeconomics investigation, conducted using a questionnaire, concerned 809 households across the various sites <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> toxic waste. More than 62 % of households had at least one person who had been affected by toxic waste (affected households). 62. 47 % of these households were in Cocody district (with 2 sites and 4 <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge),</b> 30. 14 % in Abobo district (with 2 sites and 3 points) and 7. 39 % in Koumassi district (with 1 site and 1 point). To escape the bad smell and the nuisance, 22. 75 % of the 501 'affected' households had left their houses. To face the health consequences generated by the toxic waste, 30. 54 % of the 'affected' households engaged expenses. Those were on average of 92 450 FCFA (141), with a minimum of 1 000 FCFA (1. 5) and a maximum of 1500000 FCFA(2. 287), in spite of the advertisement of the exemption from payment treatment fees made by the government.
