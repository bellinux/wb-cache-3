5|$|Container and Ro-Ro Terminal – handles {{intermodal}} containers; {{contains a}} roll-on/roll-off ramp; accommodates <b>Panamax</b> ships, {{located in the}} eastern part of the port; operated by Jadranska vrata d.d.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{segregated}} {{into six}} major size categories: small, handysize, handymax, <b>panamax,</b> capesize, and very large. Very large bulk and ore carriers {{fall into the}} capesize category but are often considered separately.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} <b>Panamax</b> vessel {{is limited}} by the Panama canal's lock chambers, which can {{accommodate}} ships with a beam of up to 32.31m, a length overall of up to 294.13m, and a draft of up to 12.04m.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, some argue that double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for <b>Panamax</b> and Capesize vessels in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Some shippers choose {{instead to}} charter a ship, paying a daily rate {{instead of a}} set price per ton. In 2005, the average daily rate for a Handymax ship varied between $18,000$30,000. A <b>Panamax</b> ship could be {{chartered}} for $20,000$50,000 per day, and a Capesize for $40,000$70,000 per day.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} industrial centers in Israel. All industrial activities in the city are located in northern areas such as the port area, the northern industrial zone, and around the Lachish River. The port of Ashdod is the largest port in Israel, handling about 60% of Israel's port cargo. It was mainly upgraded in recent years and will be able to provide berths for <b>Panamax</b> ships. Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which also is home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the tunnel's {{construction}} and opening coincides with PortMiami Deep Dredge Project that will see the port dredged deeper to accommodate larger ships expected following {{the completion of the}} Panama Canal expansion, now expected to be completed in 2016 (previously 2014). This will allow much larger ships, known as New <b>Panamax,</b> which will have a capacity of more than double that of <b>Panamax</b> ships to traverse the canal. This is predicted to cause a major increase in the Port of Miami's cargo traffic, which would overwhelm the intersection of Port Boulevard and Biscayne Boulevard without the tunnel. In 2009, 870,000 trucks moved cargo {{in and out of the}} port; and port officials estimate that that number will increase to around 1.4 million when larger ships start arriving. In 2010, about 800,000 TEU's were moved through the port, and port director Bill Johnson said that with the right marketing to major shippers, that number should double by 2020. Currently, the largest cargo ships that dock at the port have a capacity of around 4,200 TEU's (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units). After the canal expansion and port dredging, ships as large as 7,500 to 8,500 TEU's will be able to dock there.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for <b>Panamax</b> vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New <b>Panamax</b> ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Panamax</b> {{crane can}} fully load and unload {{containers}} from a <b>panamax</b> class container ship capable of {{passing through the}} Panama Canal (190ft (57.91 m)limit in air draft, 12–13 containers wide).|$|E

25|$|The Panama Canal {{expansion}} project, {{also called}} the Third Set of Locks Project, doubled {{the capacity of the}} Panama Canal by adding a new lane of traffic allowing for a larger number of ships, and increasing the width and depth of the lanes and locks allowing larger ships to pass. The new larger size of ships, called New <b>Panamax,</b> are about one and a half times the previous <b>Panamax</b> size and can carry over twice as much cargo. The expanded canal began commercial operation on 26 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|The potash loading ships anchor at the dolphins, {{where the}} water's depth is 12.5 meters, {{allowing}} the mooring of <b>Panamax</b> ships {{of up to}} 225 meters in length and 60,000 tons capacity.|$|E
25|$|Locks {{restrict}} the maximum size of ship able to navigate a waterway, and some key canals have {{given rise to}} the name of standard ship sizes, such as the <b>Panamax</b> and the Seawaymax.|$|E
25|$|River {{traffic is}} mostly {{made up of}} cargo, {{especially}} on the Paraná River, which is navigable by very large ships (<b>Panamax</b> kind) downstream from the Greater Rosario area. This area produces and/or ships most of the agricultural exports of Argentina.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 third set of locks {{project has}} created larger locks, {{allowing}} bigger ships to transit through deeper and wider channels. The allowed dimensions of ships using these locks increased by 25% in length, 51% in beam, and 26% in draft, {{as defined by}} New <b>Panamax</b> metrics.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{refinery}} of oil {{had taken place}} near the well earlier, this moved to the consumer location during this stage. Oil production in the Middle East developed and the dominance of product tankers was replaced by crude oil carriers. Soon, <b>Panamax</b> tankers were built, soon followed by Aframax and Suezmax tankers because of economics.|$|E
25|$|The new locks {{opened for}} {{commercial}} traffic on 26 June 2016, {{and the first}} ship to cross the canal using the third set of locks was a modern New <b>Panamax</b> vessel, the Chinese-owned container ship Cosco Shipping Panama. The original locks, now over 100 years old, allow engineers greater access for maintenance, and are projected to continue operating indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Albany Port {{is located}} on the north shore of Princess Royal Harbour {{adjacent}} to the city of Albany. The port was first established in 1826 and has been expanded regularly since. The port now has five berths able to cater to <b>panamax</b> class vessels. The port typically caters for loading of about 120 vessels per annum.|$|E
25|$|The {{project is}} {{expected}} to create demand for ports to handle New <b>Panamax</b> ships. Several U.S. Eastern Seaboard ports {{will be ready for}} these larger ships, and others are considering renovations, including dredging, blasting, and bridge raising. In the UK, the Port of Southampton can handle post-Panamax vessels and is expanding to accommodate more; the Port of Liverpool was anticipated to be capable by 2015, although was delayed until mid-2016; and others are considering such expansion.|$|E
25|$|The most {{expensive}} regular toll for canal passage to date was charged on April 14, 2010 to the cruise ship Norwegian Pearl, which paid US$375,600. The average toll is around US$54,000. The highest fee for priority passage charged through the Transit Slot Auction System was US$220,300, paid on August 24, 2006, by the <b>Panamax</b> tanker Erikoussa, bypassing a 90-ship queue {{waiting for the}} end of maintenance work on the Gatun Locks, and thus avoiding a seven-day delay. The normal fee would have been just US$13,430.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the work}} is carried out on six {{conventional}} piers which handle such cargoes as agricultural exports, citrus fruit, timber, metals, pelletized cargo, sling cargo, bulk cargo in grabs, etc. These piers can handle all types of ships of up to 30,000 tons. Pier no. 5 has been deepened and fitted to work <b>Panamax</b> type ships of up to 60,000 tons deadweight. The piers are outfitted with excellent equipment for efficient working. There are also 4 berths for Roll On/Roll Off ships, one of them on the container pier.|$|E
25|$|Passenger {{vessels in}} excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS), known popularly as cruise ships, pay a rate {{based on the number}} of berths, that is, the number of {{passengers}} that can be accommodated in permanent beds. The per-berth charge since April 1, 2016 is $111 for unoccupied berths and $138 for occupied berths in the <b>Panamax</b> locks. Started in 2007, this fee has greatly increased the tolls for such ships. Passenger vessels of less than 30,000 tons or less than 33 tons per passenger are charged according to the same per-ton schedule as are freighters. Almost all major cruise ships have more than 33 tons per passenger; the rule of thumb for cruise line comfort is generally given as a minimum of 40 tons per passenger.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{volumes of}} imports from Asia, which {{previously}} landed on U.S. West Coast ports, are now {{passing through the}} canal to the American East Coast. The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (The canal's fiscal year runs from October through September.) This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and {{in the numbers of}} <b>Panamax</b> vessels passing through the canal, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009. Tonnage for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 320.6, 326.8 and 340.8 million PC/UMS tons carried on 13,660, 13,481 and 13,874 transits respectively.|$|E

"Kamsarmax" [...] : Maximum {{length overall}} 229 meters {{refers to a}} new type of ships, larger than <b>panamax,</b> that are {{suitable}} for berthing at the Port of Kamsar (Republic of Guinea), where the major loading terminal of bauxite is restricted to vessels not more than 229 meters.|$|E
500|$|Smaller tankers, {{ranging from}} well under [...] to [...] <b>Panamax</b> vessels, {{generally}} carry refined petroleum products, and {{are known as}} product tankers. The smallest tankers, with capacities under [...] generally work near-coastal and inland waterways. Although {{they were in the}} past, ships of the smaller Aframax and Suezmax classes are no longer regarded as supertankers.|$|E
500|$|Capesize bulkers are specialized: 93% {{of their}} cargo is iron ore and coal. Some ships on the Great Lakes Waterway exceed <b>Panamax</b> {{dimensions}} {{but they are}} limited to use on the Great Lakes as they cannot pass through the smaller St. Lawrence Seaway to the ocean. Very large ore carriers and very large bulk carriers are {{a subset of the}} capesize category reserved for vessels over [...] Carriers of this size are almost always designed to carry iron ore.|$|E
500|$|Since December 2004, <b>Panamax</b> and Capesize bulkers {{have been}} {{required}} to carry free-fall lifeboats located on the stern, behind the deckhouse. This arrangement allows the crew to abandon ship quickly {{in case of a}} catastrophic emergency. One argument against the use of free-fall lifeboats is that the evacuees require [...] "some degree of physical mobility, even fitness" [...] to enter and launch the boat. Also, injuries have occurred during launches, for example, in the case of incorrectly secured safety belts.|$|E
500|$|Another design, {{pursued by}} the Design Division section of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, was a [...] "cruiser-killer". Beginning on 17 January 1938, under Captain A. J. Chantry, the group drew up plans for ships with twelve 16-inch and twenty [...] guns, <b>Panamax</b> {{capability}} but otherwise unlimited displacement, {{a top speed of}} [...] and a range of [...] when traveling at the more economical speed of [...] Their plan fulfilled these requirements with a ship of , but Chantry believed that more could be done if the ship were to be this large; with a displacement greater than that of most battleships, its armor would have protected it only against the [...] weapons carried by heavy cruisers.|$|E
