40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question of why some top managers have the confidence that they can control their environments, while others do not. Based on two perspectives - information processing theory and managerial cognition -this thesis proposes that informational and perceived organizational contexts have different roles in influencing top manager's <b>perception</b> of <b>control.</b> To investigate this proposition, two studies were conducted focusing on Indonesia's competitive pharmaceutical industry. The first study examines how top managers' <b>perception</b> of <b>control</b> is influenced by the interplay of informational and perceived organizational contexts. Employing a quasi-experimental design, the study manipulated the types of environments that top manager's face, namely external and internal environments. Data was collected from 46 top managers through case scenarios-questionnaires and analysed through moderated multiple regression. Findings show that (1) informational context influences top managers' <b>perception</b> of <b>control</b> in a more complex way than previously understood, (2) perceived organizational context acts as a significant moderator between informational context and top manager's <b>perception</b> of <b>control,</b> and (3) different factors affect <b>perception</b> of <b>control</b> over internal and external environments differently. The second study endeavours to understand how organizational identity, which is a powerful aspect in perceived organizational context, is associated with top manager's <b>perception</b> of <b>control.</b> The study uses an interpretive approach to analyse 18 interviews with top managers and seeks to contribute to the literature by employing Bruner's schema accessibility principle. It finds that (1) decision integration, desired future image, and information sharing are keys in making identity dimensions accessible, thus enabling the activation of organizational identity concepts in the minds of top managers, and (2) top manager's <b>perception</b> of <b>control</b> is associated with {{the extent to which they}} are able to activate their organizational identity. The thesis integrates findings from the two studies and builds a framework to better understand top manager's <b>perception</b> of <b>control.</b> It concludes by discussing findings and the integrated framework in relation to strategic decision making and organizational action...|$|R

50|$|Perceptual {{control theory}} (PCT) {{can provide an}} {{explanatory}} model of neural organisation that deals with the current issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of behavior as being determined by control of hierarchically organized <b>perception.</b> <b>Control</b> systems {{in the body and}} in the internal environment of billions of interconnected neurons within the brain are responsible for keeping perceptual signals within survivable limits in the unpredictably variable environment from which those perceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there is an internal model within which the brain simulates behavior before issuing commands to execute that behavior. Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behavior is the organism's variable means to reduce the discrepancy between perceptions and reference values which are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for an organism to maintain its perceptual goals. In this way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learning through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. PCT proposes that conflict occurs between disparate reference values for a given perception rather than between different responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties of control systems (Marken & Powers 1989), rather than any specific response being reinforced. In this way, behavior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, rather than relying on learned action patterns that may not fit.|$|E

The Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous Anchor System offers an alternative, but it remains unclear to what extent it affects the <b>perception</b> and <b>control</b> of cable operation forces compared to the traditional shoulder harness. Objective: To compare cable force <b>perception</b> and <b>control</b> with the figure-of-nine harness versus the Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous Anchor System and to investigate force <b>perception</b> and <b>control</b> at different force levels. Study design: Experimental trial. Methods: Ten male able-bodied subjects completed a cable force reproduction task at four force levels {{in the range of}} 10 – 40 N using the figure-of-nine harness and the Anchor System. <b>Perception</b> and <b>control</b> of cable operating forces were quantified by the force reproduction error and the force variability. Results: In terms of force reproduction error and force variability, the subjects did not behave differently when using the two systems. The smallest force reproduction error and force variability were found at the smallest target force level of 10 N. Conclusion: The Anchor System performs no differently than the traditional figure-of-nine harness in terms of force <b>perception</b> and <b>control,</b> making it a viable alternative. Furthermore, users perceive and control low operation forces better than high forces. Biomechatronics & Human-Machine Contro...|$|R

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three sources of control proposed by Connell (1985), namely internal, unknown and powerful others, were evident in this sample of children in the general and physical domains. The factor structure of the subscales measuring <b>perceptions</b> of <b>control</b> in the social and cognitive did not replicate Connell's proposed model. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four and five factor solution in the social and cognitive domains, respectively. Evidence of some coherence between items from the original subscales was shown, although internal attributions for success and failure appeared to split in these domains. The domain and the source of control to which children attribute event outcomes can therefore be said {{to be the most important}} organising factor in determining children's <b>perceptions</b> of <b>control...</b>|$|R
