Since 1992, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia (MOH-RI) has implemented a contract scheme for medical doctor in the HC. This study is an explorative study in searching major factors influencing the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> medical doctor. Another objective {{of this study is to}} develop an approriate supervision model of the contract medical doctor in HC. Respondent consist of key policy makers at MOH-RI, provincial health officer and district health officer from Central Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara and South-East Sulawesi. Other respondent are 280 contract medical doctors who has been worked more than one year from 11 selected provinces. Focus group discussion, indepth interview and observation are used as the main methods for data collection at the policy makers level. Mailing questionaires are sent to the contract medical doctor as the main data collection method. The result of this study shows that age, motivation before and during employment, boring situation, job satisfaction and overtime of works are significant factors in influencing the performance of contract medical doctors. The most important finding is the uncertainty of post employment contract that made low <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> medical doctors. The creation of good environment, team works, good and appropriate supervision, and orientation of the HC programs in matching with the need and demand of the local problems should be carried out in improving the contract medical doctors in HC.

According to effort levels, credit is repaid or not by the group who can be refunded in the future. We show that the principal takes into account not only price incentives on farmers ’ effort but also on peer-monitoring. We compare the Principal-agent contract to the Nash-bargaining and Cournot solutions. Because of unenforceable contracts, the welfare analysis suggest that Nash-bargaining may be preferred to competition...|$|E

It focuses on the difficulty of establishing intention and consideration in circumstances where the context of a particular online interaction is difficult to categorize as either commercial or social. Next, it deals with problems relating to the application of the offer and acceptance model in online transactions. Some basic questions are posed: Is there an offer? If so, what are its contents? Is there an acceptance? If so, when does it become effective? Throughout the discussion it is assumed that each Internet-based communication method creates different problems, and each stage in the online contract formation process faces different technological challenges. Technology, while not changing contract law per se, adds complexity to the traditional analysis. The question is not: do traditional principles apply? but how do they apply...|$|E

The project requirements were to develop a formulation or multiple formulations that have high transparency (85 - 90 %) in the visible region, are hydrophobic (will not opacify with exposure to water vapor or liquid), and have at least 2 % resiliency (interpreted as recoverable 2 % strain and better than 5 % strain to failure in compression). Results from an unrelated project showed that silica aerogels covalently bonded to organic polymers exhibit excellent mechanical properties. At the outset of this project, we believed that such a route is the best to improve mechanical properties. We have applied Design of Experiment (DOE) techniques to optimize formulations including both silica aerogels and organically modified silica aerogels (''Ormosils''). We used these DOE results to optimize formulations around the local/global optimization points. This report documents that we succeeded in developing a number of formulations that meet all of the stated criteria.

40|$|For Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, but {{particularly}} for {{countries in the}} Sahel zone, full primary enrolment and completion at acceptable quality as codified in the Millennium Development Goals and the Education for All objectives still remains a major challenge. In order to enhance education supply, many of these countries have launched large scale teacher recruitment programs in recent years, whereby the teachers are no longer engaged in civil servant positions, but {{on the basis of}} fixed-term contracts typically implying considerably lower salaries and a sharply reduced duration of professional training. While this policy has led to a boost of primary enrolment, stakeholders in the education system generally fear an important loss in the quality of education. Using data from the "Program on the Analysis of Education Systems" (PASEC) for Niger in 2000 / 2001, we show that once confounding factors are controlled for, the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> teachers is not generally worse than the performance of other teachers. Matching students taught by contract teachers to those taught by civil servants provides no significant evidence of an advantage of the latter in grade 5. In grade 2, there is evidence for a sizeable advantage of traditional teachers - but only as long as job experience is not appropriately taken into account. Given the strong impact on enrolment and the generally insignificant effect on education quality, the overall assessment of the program remains clearly positive.
