5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be <b>Pareto</b> efficient.

5|$|In the Robinson Crusoe economy, {{there is}} only one {{individual}} – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility. The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, Man Friday. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe.

25|$|Visualization of the <b>Pareto</b> {{front is}} one of the a posteriori {{preference}} techniques of multi-objective optimization. The a posteriori preference techniques (see, for example,) provide an important class of multi-objective optimization techniques. Usually the a posteriori preference techniques include four steps: (1) computer approximates the <b>Pareto</b> front, i.e. the <b>Pareto</b> optimal set in the objective space; (2) the decision maker studies the <b>Pareto</b> front approximation; (3) the decision maker identifies the preferred point at the <b>Pareto</b> front; (4) computer provides the <b>Pareto</b> optimal decision, which output coincides with the objective point identified by the decision maker. From {{the point of view of}} the decision maker, the second step of the a posteriori preference techniques is the most complicated one. There are two main approaches to informing the decision maker. First, a number of points of the <b>Pareto</b> front can be provided in the form of a list (interesting discussion and references are given in) or using Heatmaps.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} <b>Pareto’s</b> methodological revolution on the Italian scientific tradition in public finance. To that end, {{the works of the}} most celebrated scholars from within the first, second, and final generations of this tradition are reviewed with reference to their reactions to <b>Pareto’s</b> idea of science as logico-experimental activities, and his contributions to the development of marginalism and theoretical sociology. The particular scholars considered across the three generations’ time span include Pantaleoni, De Viti, Barone, Einaudi, Sensini, Griziotti, Borgatta, Murray, and Fasiani. The main original contribution of this paper is the marshaling of evidence in support of the author’s proposition that Fasiani’s research program is characterized by a clearly Paretian mode of enquiry with regard to methodology and the economic investigation of fiscal activities, although the specific influence of <b>Pareto’s</b> sociology on Fasiani’s approach to fiscal studies was relatively modest. It is provisionally concluded that, in taking the best and most relevant of <b>Pareto’s</b> work for fiscal studies, Fasiani’s contributions came to represent the highest point {{in the evolution of the}} general theory of public finance in the Italian tradition...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of bi-objective problems, informing the {{decision}} maker concerning the <b>Pareto</b> front is usually carried out by its visualization: the <b>Pareto</b> front, often named the tradeoff curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane. The tradeoff curve gives full information on objective values and on objective tradeoffs, which inform how improving one objective is related to deteriorating the second one while moving along the tradeoff curve. The decision maker takes this information into account while specifying the preferred <b>Pareto</b> optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the <b>Pareto</b> front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty.

25|$|For a nontrivial multi-objective {{optimization}} problem, {{no single}} solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective. In that case, the objective functions {{are said to}} be conflicting, and there exists a (possibly infinite) number of <b>Pareto</b> optimal solutions. A solution is called nondominated, <b>Pareto</b> optimal, <b>Pareto</b> efficient or noninferior, if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values. Without additional subjective preference information, all <b>Pareto</b> optimal solutions are considered equally good (as vectors cannot be ordered completely). Researchers study multi-objective optimization problems from different viewpoints and, thus, there exist different solution philosophies and goals when setting and solving them. The goal may be to find a representative set of <b>Pareto</b> optimal solutions, and/or quantify the trade-offs in satisfying the different objectives, and/or finding a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences of a human decision maker (DM).|$|E
25|$|There are two generic ideas how to {{visualize}} the <b>Pareto</b> front in high-order multi-objective decision problems (problems with more than two objectives). One of them, which is applicable {{in the case of}} a relatively small number of objective points that represent the <b>Pareto</b> front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. – see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the <b>Pareto</b> front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973 who argued that such slices inform the decision maker on objective tradeoffs. The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the <b>Pareto</b> front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give a clear picture of tradeoffs between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the <b>Pareto</b> front are not stable since the <b>Pareto</b> front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form – in the form of the Interactive Decision Maps (IDM) technique.|$|E

The first one is obtained when the ratio between particles and boxes is low, and the second one - when the ratio is high. The obtained long tail distribution yields correctly the empirical Zipf law, <b>Pareto's</b> 20 : 80 rule and Benford's law. Therefore, it is concluded that the long tail and the "bell-like" distributions are outcomes of the tendency of statistical systems to maximize entropy. Keywords.
