500|$|According to Hudson, {{his early}} {{religious}} experiences shaped his later life. His father, a Presbyterian, became a Baptist when Hudson was nine. Six years later, his father became a Quaker. The elder Hudson's frequent changes of religion made his son a skeptic; Hudson claimed disgust with the [...] "failings and immoralities" [...] of [...] "many professing Christians." [...] Later, however, he cited the French Revolution as his religious [...] "awakening". Hudson was repelled by the uprising's violence and disregard for life; in 1798 he proclaimed himself a [...] "political Christian", {{and later a}} [...] "speculative Christian". From then on, Hudson felt it his duty to lead a religious life. He was quiet about his beliefs, however: [...] "My pride would not <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> unburthen my soul to any living person. I hated company". In his writings, Hudson cited the principles of [...] "morality, religion, law observance and education" [...] which may have influenced his later actions, including the settlement {{of land in the}} west.|$|E
500|$|According to Fraser, {{the animal}} that {{appears on the}} reverse is the American bison Black Diamond. In an {{interview}} published in the New York Herald on January 27, 1913, Fraser {{was quoted as saying}} that the animal, which he did not name, was a [...] "typical and shaggy specimen" [...] which he found at the Bronx Zoo. [...] Fraser later wrote that the model [...] "was not a plains buffalo, but none other than Black Diamond, the contrariest animal in the Bronx Zoo. I stood for hours... He refused point blank to <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get side views of him, and stubbornly showed his front face most of the time." [...] However, Black Diamond was never at the Bronx Zoo, but instead lived at the Central Park Zoo until he was sold and slaughtered in 1915. Black Diamond's mounted head is still extant, and has been exhibited at coin conventions. [...] The placement of Black Diamond's horns differs considerably from that of the animal on the nickel, leading to doubts that Black Diamond was Fraser's model. One candidate cited by Bowers is Bronx, a bison who was for many years the herd leader of the bison at the Bronx Zoo.|$|E
500|$|While Staunton {{was busy}} with the Shakespeare edition, he {{received}} a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the recent First American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy [...] "for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion" [...] and pointing {{out that he had}} not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in The Illustrated London News that he had [...] "been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game...If Mr. Morphy—for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration—be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions... ready to test and do honor to his prowess."In reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit New Orleans for the purpose of encountering Mr. Paul Morphy at Chess, <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon the practice of the game almost entirely except in the most desultory manner, and at the present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty I am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation.Under the circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest, even in this Metropolis, would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for the recovery of my old strength in play, together with such arrangements as would prevent the sacrifice of my professional engagements {{for the sake of a}} match at chess, and that the idea of undertaking one in a foreign country, many thousand miles from here, is admissible only in a dream.With friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist, whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate, and with compliments to you for the honour implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion, I beg to subscribe myself, with every consideration.Yours obediently,H. Staunton"—from Evidently reprinted from [...] Chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton's letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Some other chess historians disagree with Murray's interpretation of Staunton's response. Staunton did offer to play Morphy by electric telegraph, a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically. However this offer arrived after Morphy had left for Europe—which perhaps was fortunate, as the newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866.|$|E

Unlike the novel, the author was not faring well at this time. By August 1748, Richardson was in poor health. He had a sparse diet that consisted mostly of vegetables and drinking vasts amount of water, and was not robust enough to prevent the effects of being bled upon the advice of various doctors throughout his life.

Decorated with Ordinul Muncii, 1st Class, he also received {{a seat on the}} Grivița people's council in the 1950 local elections. His selected prose appeared in 1951 as Scrieri alese. As Bujor himself explained in articles for the official newspaper Scînteia, he was also co-opted by the World Peace Council, holding political meetings with Grivița workers to condemn the [...] "imperialist governments of the West."

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, Brandes turned to concentrating on [...] "great personalities" [...] {{as the source}} of culture. In this period, he {{discovered}} Friedrich Nietzsche, not only introducing him to Scandinavian culture but indirectly to the whole world. The series of lectures that he gave on Nietzsche's thought, which he described as [...] "aristocratic radicalism", were the first to present Nietzsche as a world cultural figure in need of full intellectual notice. Of Brandes' description of his philosophy, Nietzsche himself remarked: [...] "The expression 'aristocratic radicalism', which you employ, is very good. It is, <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say, the cleverest thing that I have yet read about myself". In 1909 the lectures were edited and published as the monograph Friedrich Nietzsche, which included the complete Nietzche/Brandes correspondence as well as two essays in homage to the late Nietzsche's life and thought. Translated into English by A.G. Chater, the volume was published by Heinemann in 1911 and Nietzsche's thought was thus able to reach a significant English language audience before World War I. It was Brandes who, in an 1888 letter, wrote to Nietzsche advising him to read the works of Søren Kierkegaard, with whom his thought had much in common. There is no evidence, however, that Nietzsche ever did read any volume by Kierkegaard.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do as much as I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's eyes light up when they step into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they're not interested in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Washington {{then gave}} a short but impassioned speech, {{now known as}} the , {{counseling}} patience. [...] His message was that they should oppose anyone [...] "who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood." [...] He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. [...] He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: [...] "Gentlemen, you will <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country." [...] This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. [...] Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. [...] He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. [...] Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. [...] Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed [...] "unshaken confidence" [...] in Congress, and [...] "disdain" [...] and [...] "abhorrence" [...] for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. [...] The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.|$|E
2500|$|The Mufti opposed all {{immigration}} of Jews into Palestine, {{and during the}} war he campaigned against the transfer of Jewish refugees to Palestine. No evidence has been forthcoming to show he was opposed to transferring Jews to countries outside the Middle East. The Mufti’s numerous letters appealing to various governmental authorities to prevent Jewish refugees from emigrating to Palestine have been republished and widely cited as documentary evidence of his participative support for the Nazi genocide. For instance, Husseini intervened on 13 May 1943, before the meeting with Himmler when he was informed of the Holocaust, with the German Foreign Office to block possible transfers of Jews from Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania to Palestine, after reports reached him that 4,000 Jewish children accompanied by 500 adults had managed to reach Palestine. He asked that the Foreign Minister [...] "to do his utmost" [...] to block all such proposals and this request was complied with. According to Idith Zertal, none of the documents presented at Eichmann's trial prove {{that it was the}} Mufti's interference, in these 'acts of total evil,' that prevented the children's rescue. [...] In June 1943 the Mufti recommended to the Hungarian minister {{that it would be better}} to send Jews in Hungary to concentration camps in Poland rather than let them find asylum in Palestine. [...] A year later, on 25 July 1944 [...] he wrote to the Hungarian foreign minister to register his objection to the release of certificates for 900 Jewish children and 100 adults for transfer from Hungary, fearing they might end up in Palestine. He suggested that if such transfers of population were deemed necessary, then:I ask your Excellency to <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> draw your attention to the necessity of preventing the Jews from leaving your country for Palestine, and if there are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be indispensable and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would find themselves under active control, for example, in Poland, thus avoiding danger and preventing damage." ...|$|E
