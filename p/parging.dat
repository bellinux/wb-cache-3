25|$|In 1712 {{the church}} {{requested}} a royal charter; {{seven years later}} it was granted by King George I {{in exchange for a}} peppercorn in rent every year. Two years later, in 1721, it was expanded, early in the half-century tenure of Dominie Petrus Vas. A doop huys, a sort of chapel, was built to handle baptisms, meetings and other consistorial activities. Vas would, three decades later, oversee the construction of a second church building. Surviving prints show a gambrel-roofed meetinghouse two bays wide with a tower on the front. Its siding seems to have been limestone rubble, although the first print shows a material that could be either in a coursed ashlar pattern or <b>parging</b> to mimic coursed stone. Fenestration consisted of three round-arched windows along the sides. It was dedicated on November 29, 1752, by Georg Wilhelm Mancius, Vas's assistant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parging</b> is a {{low-cost}} alternative to repointing, providing structural cohesiveness to masonry walls whose mortar {{has begun to}} fail. Parge coating {{can also be used}} to create air tightness for apartments.|$|E
50|$|The Wall - During the {{demolition}} challenge, {{two of the}} bedroom's walls were also taken down. In its place {{on one of them}} will be a faux log finish. To do this, foam must be applied onto the wall before the faux wall pieces (roughly-hewn lumber) are attached. Then, <b>parging</b> must be used to fill the gaps between the wall pieces. Neither Eric nor Brian P had managed to buy the washers needed to attach the foam to the wall (Brian P also lacked screws); they make do with construction adhesive instead. At the start of Day 3, Brian M threatens to leave rehab over {{the fact that he was}} not taught the use of a table saw or chop saw, even though neither are necessary for the project, and are not used by anyone else. The shouting match between Brian M and Andrew gets so intense Eric (working within earshot) forces them both to shut up; telling them that they were being a distraction. Eric, though, passes this challenge despite the distraction. Angie fails due to having assembled her log pieces vertically (leaving nothing to support the <b>parging,</b> upon that realization she opts to use spray foam insulation instead), as does Johnnie. The Brians both fail due to having large gaps in their log pieces (Brian M also getting the cement-based <b>parging</b> all over his wood), so much so that <b>parging</b> will never cover the foam adequately.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>parge</b> coat is a {{thin coat}} of a {{cementitious}} or polymeric mortar applied to concrete or masonry for refinement of the surface.|$|R
50|$|The house's {{north and}} south facades are made of uncoursed rubble. The south wall is devoid of window openings. The north wall has been <b>parged.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bricks {{were laid}} in lime mortar {{from the time}} of the Romans until supplanted by Portland cement mortar in the early 20th century. Cement blocks also {{sometimes}} are filled with grout or covered with a <b>parge</b> coat.|$|R
50|$|The {{house itself}} is a 21 ft cubical steel frame {{structure}} on a cinder block foundation faced in prefabricated 2 by 10 ft concrete panels with stucco <b>parging</b> topped by a bowl-shaped roof centered on a drain. At the main entrance on the curved eastern corner, there is an entrance portico.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parging</b> (or pargeting) {{is usually}} applied with a trowel and {{pressed into the}} {{existing}} surface. The intent {{is to create a}} contiguous surface by filling surface air voids and bugholes (eliminating bughole-induced outgassing), to level a surface with extreme rugosity, or to prep a surface for topcoating with a high-performance protective coating.|$|E
50|$|Abcore started July 25. They made a {{temporary}} landing {{area on the}} rock near the lighthouse of about 20 tires tied together and built a plywood walkway from this landing area to the lighthouse. They had a small launch with a hoist which transported all the scaffolding, ladders and supplies to the island from Jamestown. It was heartening to see the scaffolding in place and to watch the exterior gradually change from mottled brown to gleaming white with the final <b>parging.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a one-story frame building on a raised, <b>parged,</b> and scored concrete basement, separated from the first floor by a wooden water table. It is sided in rough stucco with small bits of inlaid glass. The gabled roof is shingled in asphalt.|$|R
50|$|The name Kozice {{has been}} {{explained}} as referring to Kozice Ridge {{south of the}} settlement, imagined {{to look like a}} goat (from Slovene koza 'goat'). The name Parga has been explained as derived from Slovene prga 'that which rakes (up)'. However, compare Gottscheerish parc, <b>parge</b> 'hill, mountain'.|$|R
50|$|The building, now {{a private}} home, {{was added to}} the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is a single-story three-by-three-bay frame {{structure}} on a stone foundation, now <b>parged</b> with concrete. A gabled roof is pierced by a brick chimney. To the west a modern shed-roofed wing on block piers projects.|$|R
50|$|Another {{detail in}} the {{rebuilding}} was the fabrication and testing of a solar-powered workable light, as well as chipping away all loose material on {{the exterior of the}} tower, repairing with tuck pointing, coating with a <b>parging</b> (tested in Newport for appropriate whiteness) and then coating with an antifungal material. The roof had to be replaced. The glass in the tower had to be replaced with double glazing. The brass window frames needed repair and replacement, and much of the walkway also needed repair and replacement. Considerable work had to be done to the inside staircase, wooden window boards were replaced with metal ones, and the door was replaced.|$|E
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the tower}} and the town hall are covered with <b>parging.</b> The semicircular arch connecting the two has been altered to accommodate a rectangular door. Several pipes encumber {{the first floor of}} the water tower. There is a wood staircase leading up to the second floor. The floor itself was constructed of wood and repaired after a 1905 fire. From the second floor a narrow staircase spirals through the tower along the interior wall for about 70 ft. The staircase and floors were constructed from the scaffolding theworkers used to build the tower. Then the exterior metal ladder and walkway must be used to access the tank. The town hall retains the pressed metal ceiling and cornice.|$|E

It was gutted, but the walls still stood. The congregation strongly supported the Patriot cause throughout the war. In 1782, George Washington, garrisoned near Newburgh to the south, visited the church. He enjoyed his visit enough that he wrote the congregation the letter of thanks currently displayed in its museum. By 1790 repairs to the church were complete. The tower was rebuilt with a cupola and clocks on all sides.|$|E

40|$|An {{operational}} orthorectification {{solution in}} support of the combined geometric and radiometric process- ing of currently available imaging spectrometry data is presented. The described parametric geocoding procedure (<b>PARGE)</b> strictly considers the aircraft and terrain geometry parameters and uses a forward transformation algorithm to create orthorectified imaging spectrometry cubes. The implementation princi- ples, the auxiliary data calibration strategies, and the workflow of the currently applied processor are dis- cussed. The major error sources of the approach are identified, and possibilities are shown how to make the most out of the available auxiliary data (INS/GPS) parameters. Results on HyMap and AVIRIS imaging spectrometry data show an absolute accuracy in the range of 1 - 3 pixels for this kind of imagery. The com- bination of <b>PARGE</b> with an atmospheric correction procedure is shown in part 2 to this paper. The depicted geo-atmospheric workflow is proposed as standard processing approach for available and future imaging spectrometry data...|$|R
50|$|Its {{original}} {{structural system}} for the upper stories is retained. They were supported by segmented terra cotta tiled arches spanning the spaces between the steel beams, connected by tie rods. Where they were exposed, they were <b>parged.</b> The roof has flat terra cotta slabs set in T-shaped steel purlins, supported by built-up trusses. The terra cotta arches are supplemented by built-up steel latticework columns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} [...] "T"-shaped steel frame structure on a <b>parged</b> concrete foundation with walls faced in brick above a granite water table. A two-story, 13-bay front administration building with a flat roof is joined to a structurally similar barrel vaulted -story drill shed. There is also a single-story former stable wing with a hipped roof projecting east from the southeast corner.|$|R
30|$|All colored glazes were {{deteriorated}} with surface loss, chemical deterioration {{and cracking}} at a microscopic level. Indents on the surfaces are likely from bubbles within the glaze created during firing. Deterioration of the glaze surface has exposed the bubbles and left an indented, rough surface that traps dust. Additional complications from previous repairs completed before their {{arrival at the}} Freer such as yellowed adhesive and gray <b>parge</b> encourage deterioration.|$|R
50|$|The theater {{building}} {{consists of}} two separate sections: a six-by-three-bay front with the foyer and lobby, and a one-story, seven-bay auditorium. It is built of concrete block, faced in buff brick with red coursing and trim. The side and rear are <b>parged</b> with brick piers dividing the bays. The front of the roof is behind a parapet; the rear is gabled. Both roof sections are shingled in asphalt.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a tall one-story building on a <b>parged</b> concrete foundation sided in hollow tile over which a brick veneer in common bond has been pasted and cast stone trim applied. Brick pilasters mark {{the corners of the}} north (front) facade and the three-bay side elevations. On top is a gabled roof, pierced by a narrow brick chimney at the southwest, with the ends clad in asbestos shingles. It has a frame rear wing oriented perpendicularly to the main block.|$|R
40|$|Exact {{solutions}} {{construction in}} scalar fields cosmology is of growing interest. In this work we review the results which obtained {{with the help}} {{of one of the most}} effective method. Namely, the method of generating functions for exact solutions construction in the scalar field cosmology. We also included into debate the superpotential method which may be considered as the bridge to slow roll approximation equations. Basing on the review, we suggested classification for the generating functions and found connection for all of them with the superpotential. Comment: 22 <b>parge...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} geometric and radiometric {{processing chain}} for hyperspectral data is presented. This paper describes the ortho-rectification {{solution for the}} geometric {{part of the whole}} problem. A parametric geocoding approach (<b>PARGE)</b> has been chosen. The geometrical model strictly considers all navigational parameters engaging a forward transformation methodology. For the implementation, a number of auxiliary data calibration and tuning possibilities are shown together with the work flow of the currently applied processor. Results of the procedure for HyMap and AVIRIS hyperspectral imagery are analyzed with respect to their absolute accuracy and coregistration errors. The geocoding procedure will be used in standard preprocessing chains in combination with the atmospheric correction procedure ATCOR 4 for current and future hyperspectral instruments. ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{interesting}} {{correlations among}} Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) prompt and afterglow properties {{have been found}} in the recent years. Some of these correlations have been proposed also to standardize GRB energetics to use them as standard candles in constraining the expansion history of the universe up to z> 6. However, given the still unexplained nature of most of these correlations, only the less scattered correlations can be used for constraining the cosmological parameters. The updated E_peak-E_gamma correlation is presented. Caveats of alternative methods of standardizing GRB energetics are discussed. Comment: 8 <b>parges,</b> AIP conf. proc.

50|$|Two {{interior}} brick chimneys rise up {{from the}} dwelling’s hipped roof, which is covered with tin shingles. The roof is accented by a deep, bracketed cornice that is typical of Italianate style buildings of the period. The entire house is covered by smooth weatherboard siding, and {{the corners of the}} main block of the building are highlighted by fluted Doric pilasters. A foundation of brick laid in the Flemish bond pattern supports the oldest sections of the house (this is relatively new brickwork. Evidence in the cellar indicates that the bond may have originally been five to six course common bond). A <b>parged</b> concrete masonry unit foundation supports a late nineteenth or early twentieth century addition to the rear.|$|R

50|$|Gelbman's workers {{assembled}} them on {{the site}} by bolting the arms to a partial steel frame on the interior so the exterior would remain flush and smooth after being sealed with a mortar <b>parge</b> and surfaced with stucco. The arms left a space inside for insulation, usually vermiculite, another new material at the time, that would go behind the plywood panels used for the walls. To build floors, the panels were just laid horizontally on the summer beams, with the floor's surface material (asphalt on the first story, cork originally upstairs) then laid on top, and {{the space between the}} arms available for infrastructure piping. Once the exterior was done, the openings for the doors and windows were cut and then they were installed.|$|R
40|$|Major {{environmental}} {{factors in the}} durability of exterior walls are temperature and moisture. Temperature is the factor examined in this study. Thermal movements can lead to induced stresses that may be high enough to cause cracking. Temperature cycling about the freezing point may lead to frost damage in wet walls. This paper examines the temperature measurements on an exterior wall of a nine-storey apartment building in the Ottawa-Carleton region. Measurements were taken {{over a period of}} two years at one location with a S-W orientation on the 8 th storey. The exterior wall consists of a clay brick veneer, an air gap, a loadbearing concrete blockwork <b>parged</b> on the inside face, building paper, thermal insulation between steel studs, a vapour barrier and a drywall interior finish...|$|R
