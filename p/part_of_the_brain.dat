5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is {{probably due to the}} great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E

5|$|The cerebrum, {{consisting}} of the cerebral hemispheres, forms the largest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> and is situated above the other brain structures. The outer region of the hemispheres, the cerebral cortex, is grey matter, {{consisting of}} cortical layers of neurons. Each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes.|$|E

5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently {{involved in their}} electrical sense.|$|E
5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates.

5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) {{end up with a}} permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss ({{on one side of the}} visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline {{on top of the}} brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may be examined microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of each <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg {{was being}} treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a brain–computer interface chip attached to their thalamus, the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> controlling dreams. Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E

5|$|The human {{cerebellum}} {{changes with}} age. These changes {{may differ from}} those <b>of</b> other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|R
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas {{at the edge of the}} neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} is large {{relative}} to the bird's size. The most developed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{is the one that}} controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.|$|E
5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior colliculus, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E

5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain.</b> Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, {{and it has been}} suggested that children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain)</b> or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
