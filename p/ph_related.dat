50|$|Octopus vulgaris {{can apply}} {{behavioral}} changes {{in order to}} manage wide varieties of environmental temperatures. Respiration rate in octopods is temperature sensitive - respiration increases with temperature. The oxygen consumption of Octopus vulgaris increases when in water temperatures between 16 -28 °C, reaches a maximum at 28 °C, and then begins to drop at 32 °C. The optimum temperature for metabolism and oxygen consumption is between 18-24 °C. Variations in temperature can also induce a change in hemolymph protein levels along oxygen consumption. As temperature increases, protein concentrations increase {{in order to accommodate}} the temperature. Also the cooperativity of hemocyanin increases but the affinity decreases. Conversely, a decrease in temperature results in a decrease in respiratory pigment cooperativity and increase in affinity. The slight rise in P50 that occurs with temperature change allows oxygen pressure to remain high in the capillaries, allowing for elevated diffusion of oxygen into the mitochondria during periods of high oxygen consumption. The increase in temperature results in higher enzyme activity yet the decrease in hemocyanin affinity allows enzyme activity to remain constant and maintain homeostasis. The highest hemolymph protein concentrations are seen at 32 °C and then drop at temperatures above this. Oxygen affinity in the blood decreases by 0.20 kPa/°C at a pH of 7.4. The octopod's thermal tolerance is limited by its ability to consume oxygen, and when it fails to provide enough oxygen to circulate at extreme temperatures the effects can be fatal. It {{is interesting to note that}} Octopus vulgaris have a pH-independent venous reserve that represents the amount of oxygen that remains bound to the respiratory pigment at constant pressure of oxygen. This reserve allows the octopus to tolerate a wide range of <b>pH</b> <b>related</b> to temperature.|$|E

Direct assessment of RV function using noninvasive {{techniques such as}} cardiac MRI may therefore be an appropriate way of determining response to therapy and monitoring disease progression in PH. Methods and Results In this pan-European study, 91 patients with PH (mean pulmonary arterial pressure 4615 mm Hg) underwent clinical and cardiac MRI assessments at baseline and after 12 months of disease-targeted therapy (predominantly endothelin receptor antagonists [47. 3 %] or phosphodiesterase type- 5 inhibitors [25. 3 %]). At month 12, functional class had improved in 21 patients, was unchanged in 63 patients, and had deteriorated in 7 patients. Significant improvements were achieved in RV and left ventricular ejection fraction (P< 0. 001 and P= 0. 0007, respectively), RV stroke volume index (P< 0. 0001), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (P= 0. 0015). Increases in 6 -minute walk distance were significant (P< 0. 0001) and correlated with change in RV ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume, although correlation coefficients were low (r= 0. 28, P= 0. 01 and r= 0. 26, P= 0. 02, respectively).
