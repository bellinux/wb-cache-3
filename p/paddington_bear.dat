5|$|The Global Edition of {{the week}} of July 20, 2011 was not aired in the UK as it {{included}} a segment mocking Rupert Murdoch's appearance before the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee {{in relation to the}} News International phone hacking scandal. Parliamentary rules ban parliamentary proceedings from being broadcast in a satirical context. Stewart dedicated a segment of the show on August 2, 2011 to lampooning the censorship of the episode in Britain. In May that year, The Daily Show mocked the ban on using footage of the Royal Wedding in a satirical context with an animated video that showed <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear,</b> Gollum and Adolf Hitler as guests at the wedding, and depicted its attendants engaging in various forms of violent and sexual behavior. Stewart later discussed the ban with guest Keira Knightley.|$|E

These proved so popular that they started selling them through the business with sufficient success to be able to pay the fees for Clarkson to attend Hill House School, Doncaster, and later Repton School.|$|E

500|$|... "Shine" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Gwen Stefani, featuring collaborative vocals by American entertainer Pharrell Williams. Originally intended for Stefani's band No Doubt, it was written and produced by Williams, with songwriting contributions from Stefani. It is a reggae pop and ska song that is featured in the 2014 animated film Paddington. The lyrics revolve around the lead character <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear's</b> journey to London and his identity crisis. Stefani initially disagreed with Williams' choice to use direct references to Paddington in the lyrics, but praised this decision after watching the film with her children. She reported that her involvement with the recording was inspired by her then-husband Gavin Rossdale and her children's connection to England.|$|R
50|$|In the 2014 film Paddington {{the villain}} is a {{taxidermist}} at the museum. She kidnaps the <b>bear</b> <b>Paddington</b> intending {{to kill and}} stuff him, but is thwarted by the Brown family after scenes involving chases inside and {{on the roof of}} the building.|$|R
500|$|The children's book {{character}} <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear</b> {{was named}} after the station. In the books, by Michael Bond, he is found at the station, having come from [...] "deepest, darkest Peru" [...] and with a note attached to his coat reading [...] "please look after this bear, thank you". A statue of him by Marcus Cornish, based on the original drawings by Peggy Fortnum, is located under the clock on platform 1.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} has several Christmas traditions: {{it is known}} as the former production site of Frango mints and for the Walnut Room Christmas tree. [...] It also hosts an ornate decorated display windows series at the street level.

[...] Annually a three-story tall conifer Christmas tree is brought in for the Holidays season.

500|$|Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick's filmed {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon. The critic John Riley, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided [...] "a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness". [...] The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children's animation series Paddington, {{which was based on}} the <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear</b> book series by Michael Bond. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on Paddington and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: [...] "it's a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue, both delicious in their way, but there is nothing more satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you".|$|E

40|$|The films Alice in Wonderland (2010) {{directed}} by Tim Burton and Paddington (2014) {{directed by}} Paul King, are re-workings of two established and well-known English children’s books. The contemporary re-birth of these texts as films make {{extensive use of}} digital techniques which visually and ideologically take the texts in new directions. A central consideration which arises on analysis of these films is the re-construction and re-positioning of the characters of nineteenth-century Alice and twentieth century Paddington in the digital age of the twenty-first century. Both Alice and Paddington are migrants: Alice into the fantasy world of Burton’s ‘Underland’ and <b>Paddington</b> the anthropomorphized <b>bear</b> who travels from the rain forests of Peru to central London. Each of these box office successes has an underlying theme {{of the experience of}} the migrant. Notably both films were released when migration and immigration were, and unfortunately still are, bitterly divisive subjects in the UK, Europe and America. This chapter analyses the experiences of the migrant characters and the influence of digital film making upon such construction. The case is made that literature for children when translated into media formats has ideological and moral themes relevant to the contemporary world...|$|R
500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the development of}} the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics. Williams was more [...] "specific" [...] regarding the lyrics as he wanted to include words directly connected to the film and its character like [...] "bear", [...] "Paddington", and [...] "station"; Stefani said that she preferred for the song to be a [...] "little more abstract". She later reversed this view, saying that she agreed with Williams' interpretation after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animations of the <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear</b> character. In an interview with American Top 40, Stefani credited Williams as being central to the recording's development, saying that he was [...] "the one who really got in there and was able to channel the film lyrically and make it really happen".|$|E
500|$|In an {{official}} statement, film executive Bob Weinstein called Stefani and Williams [...] "the perfect artistic duo", saying their work [...] "brought to life the charm that Paddington represents". Stefani said her involvement {{was motivated by}} her personal connection to the film's setting through her marriage to English musician Gavin Rossdale. She added that the film and the track allowed her children to recognise their origins. Williams considered the song to be [...] "a wonderful opportunity, as a parent, to contribute to something as classic, authentic and generational {{to all of our}} lives, as Paddington Bear"; Stefani said that she was [...] "honored to join forces with Pharrell and be part of bringing this beloved classic to life for Paddington's next big adventure". Williams called the song [...] "a trailer into a wonderful family experience" [...] and developed its concept from his children's interest in <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear.</b>|$|E
500|$|During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans {{from the}} low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear</b> and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include [...] "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge" [...] that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents [...] "without sounding overly patronizing". [...] "Shine" [...] ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.|$|E
2500|$|Latin {{translations}} of modern literature such as The Hobbit, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear,</b> Winnie the Pooh, The Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, Harry Potter, Walter the Farting Dog, Le Petit Prince, Max and Moritz, How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, The Cat in the Hat, {{and a book}} of fairy tales, [...] "fabulae mirabiles," [...] are intended to garner popular interest in the language. Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as Meissner's Latin Phrasebook.|$|E
2500|$|Abandoning {{his office}} job, {{he decided to}} instead take up both writing and {{illustrating}} his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as Anon E. Mouse for the local paper Anon, and St. Pancras Panda, a parody of <b>Paddington</b> <b>Bear,</b> for the Oxford-based Back Street Bugle. His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in NME music magazine, and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as Roscoe Moscow published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer Kurt Weill) in the weekly music magazine Sounds, earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter Leah, began claiming unemployment benefit to supplement this income. Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as Maxwell the Magic Cat in the Northants Post, under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child-murderer Gilles de Rais, something he {{found to be a}} [...] "sardonic joke"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing Maxwell the Magic Cat until 1986. Moore has stated that he would have been happy to continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community. Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them, stating that [...] "After I'd been doing [...] for a couple of years, I realised that I {{would never be able to}} draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist." ...|$|E
