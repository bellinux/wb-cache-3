500|$|Veltmann and {{his team}} talked to the accused men prior to the trial to prepare their defense. They {{discovered}} {{that not all of}} the 50 were experienced ship loaders. Two of the men taken to the brig had never before loaded ammunitionthey were permanently assigned as cooks because of physical conditions making them unsuited to loading. The two cooks had responded [...] "no" [...] when asked if they would load munitions. Another of the 50, who had a broken wrist in a sling was also asked if he would load ammunition, to which he replied that he would not. More importantly, Veltmann sensed that the men had not conspired to seize command from their superior officers. In a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>brief,</b> Veltmann cited the definition of mutiny from Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents and asked that the mutiny charges be dismissed as the formal charges against the 50 men failed to allege that they conspired together deliberately to [...] "usurp, subvert or override superior military authority". Coakley opposed with a brief stating that, under military law, a persistent refusal to work by two or more mensomething that might be called a [...] "strike" [...] among civilianswas sufficient proof of a conspiracy to override superior military authority and was equivalent to mutiny. Osterhaus agreed with Coakley and refused Veltmann's motion; the trial would proceed as planned.|$|E

After receiving notice of the pending suit, Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy stated that he believed the case to be [...] "baseless...

5000|$|The {{copyright}} phase {{consisted of}} several distinct claims of infringement: a nine-line rangeCheck function, several test files, the structure, sequence {{and organization of}} the Java application programming interface (API), and the API documentation. Oracle alleged infringement of 37 separate Java APIs. [...] After extensive <b>pre-trial</b> <b>briefing,</b> this phase began on April 16, 2012. [...] At {{the end of this}} phase, the jury ruled that the API was infringed, but deadlocked on Google's fair use defense for this claim.

[...] The ‘Military 1’ final brief alone exceeded 950 pages in length, and began with White’s authorship of an overview section entitled ‘The Philosophy of Genocide’ that placed the trial evidence of the events into a broader context. [...] Most of these contributions were during a period when there was little practical legal precedent in international criminal law and many of the issues were being dealt with for the first time.|$|R
