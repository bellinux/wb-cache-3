[...] The ensemble gave its first concert on 24 September 1958 as the 'Sinfonia Orchestra', at the City Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne, and gave six concerts in its first season, 1958-1959. [...] Hall acted as the organization's single leader, in effect as [...] "general manager, secretary, artistic director, conductor and fund-raiser", though without a formal title. The word 'Northern' {{was added to the}} orchestra's name in 1959 to give the name of 'Northern Sinfonia'. [...] The orchestra became an established institution in 1959, with Humphrey Noble chosen as the first chairman of the ensemble's management committee. [...] Hall resigned from the orchestra in 1964 but returned as a guest conductor in subsequent years. After Hall's departure, Rudolf Schwarz and Boris Brott took over musical leadership of the ensemble in parallel, with Schwarz being the first titled artistic director of the ensemble. Keith Statham served as the orchestra's general manager from 1966 to 1974.|$|E
40|$|While {{differences}} in greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes between ecosystems {{can be explained}} to a certain degree, variability of the same at the plot scale is still challenging. We investigated the spatial variability in soil-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{to find out what}} drives spatial variability on the plot scale. Measurements were carried out in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest in a former floodplain on a 250 m 2 plot, divided in homogenous strata of vegetation and soil texture. Soil gas fluxes were measured consecutively at 60 points along transects to cover the spatial variability. One <b>permanent</b> <b>chamber</b> was measured repeatedly to monitor temporal changes to soil gas fluxes. The observed patterns at this control chamber were used to standardize the gas fluxes to disentangle temporal variability from the spatial variability of measured GHG fluxes. Concurrent measurements of soil gas diffusivity allowed deriving in situ methanotrophic activity from the CH 4 flux measurements. The soil emitted CO 2 and consumed CH 4 and N 2 O. Significantly different fluxes of CH 4 and CO 2 were found for the different soil-vegetation strata, but not for N 2 O. Soil CH 4 consumption increased with soil gas diffusivity within similar strata supporting the hypothesis that CH 4 consumption by soils is limited by the supply with atmospheric CH 4. Methane consumption in the vegetation strata with dominant silty texture was higher at a given soil gas diffusivity than in the strata with sandy texture. The same pattern was observed for methanotrophic activity, indicating better habitats for methantrophs in silt. Methane consumption increased with soil respiration in all strata. Similarly, methanotrophic activity increased with soil respiration when the individual measurement locations were categorized into silt and sand based on the dominant soil texture, irrespective of the vegetation stratum. Thus, we suggest the rhizosphere and decomposing organic litter might represent or facilitate a preferred habitat for methanotrophic microbes, since rhizosphere and decomposing organic are the source of most of the soil respiration...|$|E

40|$|Ecosystem flux {{measurements}} {{using the}} eddy covariance (EC) technique were undertaken in 4 subsequent years during summer {{for a total}} of 562 days in an arctic wet tundra ecosystem, located near Cherskii, Far-Eastern Federal District, Russia. Methane (CH 4) emissions were measured using <b>permanent</b> <b>chambers.</b> The experimental field is characterized by late thawing of permafrost soils in June and periodic spring floods. A stagnant water table below the grass canopy is fed by melting of the active layer of permafrost and by flood water. Following 3 years of EC measurements, the site was drained by building a 3  m wide drainage channel surrounding the EC tower to examine possible future effects of global change on the tundra tussock ecosystem. Cumulative summertime net carbon fluxes before experimental alteration were estimated to be about + 15  g C m 22122 (i. e. an ecosystem C loss) and + 8  g C m 22122 after draining the study site. When taking CH 4 as another important greenhouse gas into account and considering the global warming potential (GWP) of CH 4 vs. CO 2, the ecosystem had a positive GWP during all summers. However CH 4 emissions after drainage decreased significantly and therefore the carbon related greenhouse gas flux was much smaller than beforehand (475 ± 253  g C-CO 2 -e m 22122 before drainage in 2003 vs. 23 ± 26  g C-CO 2 -e m 22122 after drainage in 2005) ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} frequent cardiac dysrhythmia. The {{aim of this study}} was to show the role and the efficacy of a dual chamber pacemaker with the algorithm of atrial dynamic overdrive, in the suppression of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Case report. A woman with a classical bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, and frequent attacks of atrial fibrillation, underwent the implantation of a single <b>chamber</b> <b>permanent</b> pacemaker (VVI). Pacemaker successfully treated the episodes of symptomatic bradycardia, but the patient had frequent attacks of atrial fibrillation, despite the use of different antiarrhythmic drugs, which she did not tolerate well. The decision was made to reimplant a <b>permanent</b> dual <b>chamber</b> pacemaker with the algorithm of atrial dynamic overdrive. The pacemaker was programmed to the basic rate of 75 /min, while rate at rest was 55 /min. In addition, sotalol was administered. After three months, the patient became asymptomatic with only 4 short − term episodes of atrial fibrillation, and a high level of atrial pacing (99 %). Conclusion. In selected patients with bradycardia−tachycardia syndrome, atrial-based pacing seemed to be very effective in reducing the incidence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation...|$|R

There {{was no significant difference}} in sex distribution, mean age or incidence of coronary heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke or renal failure between Groups 1 and 2. Overall, the predicted cumulative survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years was 89, 76 and 73 %, respectively, for Group 1 and 95, 82 and 70 %, respectively, for Group 2. In patients with preexistent congestive heart failure, the predicted cumulative survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years was 85, 66 and 47 %, respectively, for Group 1 (n = 53) and 94, 81 and 69 %, respectively, for Group 2 (n = 20). The 5 year predicted cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in Group 1 patients with preexistent congestive heart failure than in Group 2 patients with the same condition (p < 0. 02). There {{was no significant difference in}} 5 year cumulative survival rate between Groups 1 and 2 for patients without preexistent congestive heart failure.
