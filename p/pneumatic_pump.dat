25|$|The Sea Fury was {{powered by}} the newly {{developed}} Bristol Centaurus piston engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pump</b> was also driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored {{in a total of}} five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage {{directly in front of the}} cockpit and three housed within the wings.|$|E

[...] If an auger is used, the feeding takes about 45 to 60 seconds, however, modern systems usually use a tube fed by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pump</b> with an operation time of 2 to 3 seconds per duck.

At the cost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting Egyptian images one sees as I could manage, for pretty nearly twelve hours, I should guess at least, on end, I got over it. You'd hardly think what it meant in that heat and stink. I don't think any of them dreamt of the man inside. I was just a {{wonderful}} leathery great joss that {{had come up with}} luck out of the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly closeness! the mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! They lit a stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a lot of gory muck--the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside, the Beasts-- and burnt it all in my honour. I was getting a bit hungry, but I understand now how gods manage to do without eating, what with the smell of burnt-offerings about them. And they brought {{in a lot of the}} stuff they'd got off the brig and, among other stuff, what I was a bit relieved to see, the kind of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pump</b> that was used for the compressed air affair, and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me something disgraceful. It's extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing respect. If I'd had a hatchet handy I'd have gone for the lot of them--they made me feel that wild. All this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing anything better to do. And at last, when nightfall came, and the wattle joss-house place got a bit too shadowy for their taste--all these here savages are afraid of the dark, you know--and I started a sort of 'Moo' noise, they built big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut, free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel just as bad as I liked. And Lord! I was sick.|$|E

40|$|Centrifugal {{microfluidics}} {{has emerged}} as a unique approach to the development of integrated total analysis systems for medical diagnostics. However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the centripetal pumping mechanism in which fluids can only be moved {{from the center of the}} disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of centripetal pumping avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pumping</b> and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pumping</b> to siphon priming...|$|R

40|$|Engineering {{estimates}} of methane emissions from natural gas production {{have led to}} varied projections of national emissions. This work reports direct measurements of methane emissions at 190 onshore natural gas sites in the United States (150 production sites, 27 well completion flowbacks, 9 well unloadings, and 4 workovers). For well completion flowbacks, which clear fractured wells of liquid to allow gas production, methane emissions ranged from 0. 01 Mg to 17 Mg (mean = 1. 7 Mg; 95 % confidence bounds of 0. 67 – 3. 3 Mg), compared {{with an average of}} 81 Mg per event in the 2011 EPA national emission inventory from April 2013. Emission factors for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pumps</b> and controllers as well as equipment leaks were both comparable to and higher than estimates in the national inventory. Overall, if emission factors from this work for completion flowbacks, equipment leaks, and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pumps</b> and controllers are assumed to be representative of national populations and are used to estimate national emissions, total annual emissions from these source categories are calculated to be 957 Gg of methane (with sampling and measurement uncertainties estimated at ± 200 Gg). The estimate for comparable source categories in the EPA national inventory is ∼ 1, 200 Gg. Additional measurements of unloadings and workovers are needed to produce national emission estimates for these source categories. The 957 Gg in emissions for completion flowbacks, pneumatics, and equipment leaks, coupled with EPA national inventory estimates for other categories, leads to an estimated 2, 300 Gg of methane emissions from natural gas production (0. 42 % of gross gas production) ...|$|R

5000|$|Pneumatic, {{surgical}} tourniquets {{are frequently}} {{applied in the}} controlled environment of the operating room {{in order to control}} blood loss during an upper or lower extremity operative case. Aside from lower blood loss in itself, this improves visualization and surgical efficiency. Modern examples are found in many different sizes to accommodate different patients and sites of applications, with adult cuffs approximately 4" [...] wide. This distributes the pressure over, generally, a broader area than field (emergency, combat) tourniquets. The cuff is typically attached to an adjustable <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pump</b> with a built-in timer. Surgical tourniquet times in excess of 2 hours have been associated with an increased risk of nerve damage (e.g., neuropraxia), likely related to both direct nerve compression as well as decreased arterial inflow and oxygenation.
