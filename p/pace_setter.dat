5|$|Julián Leal took seventh after encountering {{traffic on}} his final lap {{and needed to}} pass one car to record his fastest time. Dillmann lined up in eighth place. Nasr set the early pace in Group B before {{settling}} for ninth and Frijns rounded out the top ten. Ericcson was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best time of one minute and 22.349 seconds was 1.208 seconds off Cecotto's pace. Ericsson paced Group B early on but was demoted as the session progressed. He was followed by Sergio Canamasas in 12th and Rossi in 13th place. Coletti was another Group B early <b>pace</b> <b>setter</b> but ended up starting from 14th position. Haryanto qualified in 15th but was demoted ten places on the grid for causing an avoidable accident at the previous round {{of the season in}} Catalunya. As a result Nathanaël Berthon inherited the place and was followed by Calado. Richelmi and Daniël de Jong filled the next two placings and 20th place qualifier René Binder was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Canamasas during the session. Giovesi thus started from Binder's qualifying position with Daniel Abt joining him on the grid's tenth row. Simon Trummer and Jake Rosenzweig clinched the 22nd and 23rd positions. Lancaster started from 24th after spinning his car at Sainte Dévote turn necessitating yellow flags to be waved in the area. The final position in the field was taken by Adrian Quaife-Hobbs whose fastest time was 2.2 seconds slower than Cecotto.|$|E
25|$|Mark Webber was {{the early}} <b>pace</b> <b>setter</b> in this 15 minute knock-out, but an amazing lap by Nico Rosberg easily secured his place into Q3. Button was {{struggling}} {{all through the}} session and ran wide and almost put the car into the wall on his final lap. He eventually finished a dismal twelfth. And with Barrichello having to drop 5 places down the grid after changing his gearbox before qualifying it wasn't looking to good for Ross Brawn's team. Barrichello left it late and jumped from eleventh to sixth to book {{his place in the}} top 10 shootout. The others to be knocked out were; Nakajima (P11), Räikkönen (P13), Buemi (P14) and Trulli in P15.|$|E
25|$|Friday evening's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. In contrast to previous years, qualifying was held in night time conditions, the first such occurrence in the GP2 Series. The track was less dusty {{than it had been}} in practice, and multiple drivers stood in pole position throughout the duration of the half hour session. Palmer clinched his first pole position of the season and the second of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 38.865 seconds. He flat spotted his first set of tyres and was aware with the second set equipped he would challenge for the pole position. Palmer was joined on the grid's front row by Vandoorne who recorded a lap three-hundredths of second slower than his rival. Vandoorne was temporarily investigated by the stewards for exceeding track limits at turn thirteen, but no action was prompted. Abt took third having been unable to improve on his lap time. Richelmi improved towards the end of the session and secured fourth. Haryanto took fifth ahead of sixth-placed Stefano Coletti. Early <b>pace</b> <b>setter</b> Evans fell once the field bettered their times and managed seventh.|$|E

25|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran {{for half}} an hour. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Qualifying began under cloudy weather conditions and thus most of the field drove onto the track when the session started. Rain fell five minutes into qualifying but was not heavy enough to affect the track. Simon Trummer was the early <b>pace</b> <b>setter</b> but was soon eclipsed by his teammate Coletti, who in turn, was suppressed by Ericsson. Leimer then moved {{to the top of}} the time sheets with a new GP2 Series lap record of the Bahrain International Circuit and later lowered it to a of one minute and 39.427 seconds lap time and this secured him the pole position. Ericsson appeared to challenge Leimer for pole but eased off after losing time in the final sector to join the latter on the grid's front row with a time nearly a second off Leimer's pace. Nasr equalled his qualifying result from the previous year's race to start from third. Coletti improved on his own fastest lap which was good enough for fourth. Dillmann was best of the late improvers and qualified fifth. Richelmi was close in arrears in sixth position. Rossi was in the top three early in the session but fell to seventh by its conclusion.|$|E

50|$|Kalala joined Swansea City {{on trial}} and played in several {{pre-season}} games, but wasn't offered a deal by Kenny Jackett who admitted the midfielder wasn't {{the type of}} player he was looking for. He then moved to England and joined Grimsby Town in June 2005 initially on a trial along with several other French league players Makhtar N'Diaye and Madjid Ben Haddou. His first appearance for Grimsby, was in a 1-1 draw against Rotherham United in pre-season in which Kalala hit the post from 25 yards. On 1 July 2005, he made his move to Grimsby a permanent one. Kalala was a regular in the first team, sitting in a central midfield role with Paul Bolland.

What was a surprise, however, was the extent of their dominance, for after topping the ladder with 100% success from 18 home and away matches, they swept to an unbeaten premiership on the strength of wins over Strathmore by 57 points in the 2nd semi final and 3 goals in the grand final.

50|$|The {{team had}} a new car ready for the Bathurst 1000 and Miedecke was the fastest Australian Sierra after Hardies Heroes in 5th place (though he would start 4th after the third Eggenberger Motorsport was withdrawn). Miedecke was then among the early <b>pace</b> <b>setters</b> along with Andy Rouse driving Allan Moffat's leased Sierra, and the Ford Europe backed Eggenberger Motorsport Sierra of Steve Soper. The trio {{continually}} swapping the lead over the first 30 laps of the race. While the European Sierra's had the edge in straight line speed, the Oxo car, thanks to Miedecke's open wheel experience, handled better and was quicker {{across the top of}} the mountain. Despite his power disadvantage Miedecke was able to stay with Soper and Rouse on the straights thanks to drafting and even managed to outbrake Soper at the end of Mountain Straight to take the lead in a move which surprised the Englishman. Unfortunately for the team, veteran Smith was some 8 seconds a lap slower than Miedecke which translated to lost time to the other leaders. The car also suffered two flat batteries mid-race thanks to a faulty alternator which put them out of contention. Car #35 eventually finished in 17th place, covering 144 of the 161 laps.|$|R
