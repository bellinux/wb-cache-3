I have got ten Napoleons in my pocket. That is as much as I shall want; for the General pays {{everything}} like a prince; and if I'm hit, why you know I cost nothing. Don't cry, little woman; I may live to vex you yet. Well, I shan't take either of my horses, but shall ride the General's grey charger: it's cheaper, and I told him mine was lame. If I'm done, those two ought to fetch you something. Grigg offered ninety for the mare yesterday, before this confounded news came, and like a fool I wouldn't let her go under the two o's. Bullfinch will fetch his price any day, only you'd better sell him in this country, because the dealers have so many bills of mine, and so I'd rather he shouldn't go back to England. Your little mare the General gave you will fetch something, and there's no d--d livery stable bills here as there are in London," [...] Rawdon added, with a laugh.

40|$|In this work, {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} the plasma nitrided AISI 316 LN type austenitic stainless steel specimens (both <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>rings)</b> have been analyzed. The experiments have been conducted in high vacuum and in air atmosphere using Vacuum based high temperature Pin-on-disc tribometer. The tribological parameters such as friction coefficient and wear resistance have been analyzed by Origin graphs. The wear mechanisms involved have been identified by recording surface morphology on the wear track and pin surface through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Optical profilometer. The self mating of AISI 316 LN type stainless steel (316 LN) exhibits strong adhesion between the contact surfaces and severe surface damage both in air and in vacuum atmosphere. But, the self mating of Plasma Nitrided 316 LN (CrN/CrN) reveals mild wear till the CrN coating peeled off from the pin surface. It has also been proved that Plasma Nitrided (CrN) layer on 316 LN ring was wear resistant layer when it issliding against the untreated 316 LN pin in air and high vacuum atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{research}} knowledge gap for the dry wear data of nitride treated Stainless Steel in high temperature and high vacuum environment. In order to fill this gap, plasma nitriding was done on austenitic Stainless Steel type AISI 316 LN (316 LN SS) and dry sliding wear tests have been conducted at 25 degrees C, 200 degrees C and 400 degrees C in high vacuum of 1. 6 x 10 (- 4) bar. The two different slider material (316 LN SS and Colmonoy) and two different sliding speeds (0. 0576 m/s and 0. 167 m/s) have been used. The tribological parameters such as friction coefficient, wear mechanism and volume of metal loss have been evaluated. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to study the surface morphology of the worn <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>rings.</b> Electronic balancing machine was used to record the mass of metal loss during wear tests. The 2 D optical profilometer {{was used to measure}} the depth of the wear track. The Plasma Nitride treated 316 LN SS rings (PN rings) exhibit excellent wear resistance against 316 LN SS pin and Colmonoy pin at all temperatures. However, PN ring vs. Colmonoy pin Pair shows better wear resistance than PN ring vs. 316 LN SS pin Pair at higher temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abrasives {{are used}} in various forms to produce fine {{finishes}} on metal surfaces. Previously, grinding and abrasive processes have been studied in isolation; the present work however has shown that grinding can be usefully interpreted in abrasive wear terms. Wear experiments using small grinding wheels on a <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> machine {{have been able to}} reproduce many of the effects observed not only in grinding but also in such specialised processes as super-finishing. Abrasive wear theory has been re-examined, especially the parameters making up the K factor, and then applied to the grinding process. In order to test theoretical predictions a grinding dynamomoter was constructed to measure forces in surface grinding. Idealised indentors having simple geometrical shapes, similar to those assumed in abrasive wear theory, were tracked across smooth metal surfaces. Measurements of the seratches produced were then compared with theory. Scratch tests on a range of heat-treated steels using both idealised indentors and abrasive grits showed that pile-up at the edge of scratches is a highly significant factor in determining wear rate in abrasion and cutting forces in grinding. Finally a wide range of techniques for examining abrasives has been studied, the most notable of which involved the use of a scanning electron microscope...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{microwell}} chip {{is developed}} {{that can be}} used to detect protein binding in a liquid environment, together with a liquid handling system that allows the performance of assays with picoliter volumes. A PDMS well structure is cast on a planar optical waveguide, providing reaction containers combined with a high-sensitivity fluorescence readout system. Individual wells of the array can be addressed, filled, and rinsed using a contact-mode <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> spotter. This allows for immunoassays in a heavily multiplexed way, as all steps of the assay can be individually chosen per well. An array density of over 1000 wells cm(- 2) is used for the current experiments. The wells provide a protected liquid environment in which the handling of proteins in their natural state is possible, thus maintaining their activity. The membrane protein annexin V is chosen as a model protein to demonstrate the current possibilities. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine (PS) head groups of lipids in a Ca(2 +) -dependent manner and is often chosen as a marker for cell apoptosis. Lipid vesicles with and without PS are spotted in individual wells and spontaneously formed a planar lipid bilayer on the bottom of the buffer-filled wells. Annexin V can be used to distinguish between wells containing PS groups previously incorporated in the membrane patches and reference wells without PS head groups. Also, the dependence on the calcium concentration can be shown. Fluorescence readout of the assays is performed using a highly sensitive system based on a planar optical waveguide...|$|R
40|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} is {{the primary}} reason for flap loss and classical venous anastomoses are hand-sewn under an operating microscope. Technical errors may result in damage at the anastomosis due to an inadequate eversion of the vessel walls, the introduction of unequal bite distances or endothelial injury at the suture sites, causing increased thrombotic potential. Since the introduction of microvascular free-tissue transfer, surgical technique modifications and new devices have become highly sought after as a means for improving overall outcome. Vessel couplers are one such device, with <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> coupling <b>rings</b> providing an alternative to traditional hand-sewn anastomoses.

50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as <b>pins,</b> thread plugs, <b>and</b> <b>rings,</b> are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved.

50|$|Where a vessel's rudder {{is mounted}} on the centre-line, it is usual to hang it on {{gudgeons}} and pintles, the latter being upright <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> the former, <b>rings</b> to fit round them. Together, they form a hinge. This naturally leaves a small gap between the sternpost and the rudder, into which stray items like kelp and rope can catch, causing drag and threatening {{the security of the}} vessel's steering. In ships such as Mary Rose, the skeg is a very small feature; a tapered extension of the keel below {{the leading edge of the}} rudder. This somewhat beard-like sternward extension of the keel is the basic skeg. Subsequently, the lowest pintle was commonly mounted below the rudder on a metal extension of the keel. This helped further stabilize and protect the rudder and the name skeg was transferred to it. It used to be relatively small until screw propellers were introduced, when it had to reach below the screw and became a proportionately larger feature protecting both screw and rudder from damage.|$|R
