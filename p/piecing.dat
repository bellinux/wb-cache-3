5|$|The {{technique}} of using flashbacks {{had been used}} in earlier films—most notably in The Power and the Glory (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as Citizen Kane. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and <b>piecing</b> together his life.|$|E
5|$|The film's musical score, {{written by}} cellist Fred Katz, was {{originally}} written for A Bucket of Blood. According to Mark Thomas McGee, author of Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts, each time Katz was {{called upon to}} write music for Corman, Katz sold the same score {{as if it were}} new music. The score was used in a total of seven films, including The Wasp Woman and Creature from the Haunted Sea. Katz explained that his music for the film was created by a music editor <b>piecing</b> together selections from other soundtracks that he had produced for Corman.|$|E
5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such {{that the image of}} one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by <b>piecing</b> together very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E

5|$|The riff was {{recorded}} with Krugman's Gibson ES-175 guitar, which was {{run through a}} Music Man 410 combo amplifier, and Dharma's vocals were captured with a Telefunken U47 tube microphone. The guitar solo and guitar rhythm sections were recorded in one take, while a four-track tape machine amplified them on the recording. Sound engineer Shelly Yakus remembers <b>piecing</b> together the separate vocals, guitar and rhythm section into a master track, with the overdubbing occurring in that order.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During {{the mission to}} Nibelheim, Cloud served under Sephiroth and Zack, a SOLDIER 1st Class, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud took up Zack's sword, catching Sephiroth off guard and stabbing him. Zack urges Cloud to kill Sephiroth after Sephiroth emerges alive, but when Cloud pursues him, he is run through by Sephiroth's sword. Cloud, to Sephiroth's shock, summons the strength to grab hold of the blade and lift Sephiroth off the ground, tossing him into a Mako vat below. Cloud and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation. Zack later escapes with Cloud, bringing him {{to the outskirts of}} Midgar before Shinra soldiers gun Zack down. Due to exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova's cells, in addition to the shame stemming from his personal failures, Cloud's mind fabricated a story blending together his own memories with accounts of Zack's heroics, creating a false personality. After <b>piecing</b> back together his identity, Cloud resumes his role as leader. At the game's conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud's mind a final time, but he is defeated in a one-on-one fight.|$|E
25|$|The T95E3 {{was armed}} with a T140 105mm rifled gun. With a muzzle {{velocity}} of 1079m/s, the armor <b>piecing</b> capability at 2000 yards is 122mm at a 60-degree firing angle. Standard equipment was 64 rounds.|$|E
5000|$|... 5. A <b>piece</b> captures {{an enemy}} <b>piece</b> by {{displacement}} as in Chess. A <b>piece</b> {{moves into the}} same space as the enemy <b>piece,</b> and the enemy <b>piece</b> is removed. It is possible that one player's <b>piece</b> can capture two enemy <b>pieces</b> in one turn. This happens when the player's <b>piece</b> is able to move two spaces on its own colored line, and displacing the two enemy <b>pieces</b> on those two spaces.|$|R

25|$|Most <b>pieces</b> in {{the game}} move in a unique manner. An {{opposing}} <b>piece</b> is captured by displacement: That is, if a <b>piece</b> moves to a square occupied by an opposing <b>piece,</b> the opposing <b>piece</b> is displaced and removed from the board. A <b>piece</b> cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly <b>piece</b> (meaning another <b>piece</b> controlled by the moving player).|$|R
25|$|The {{whole process}} of {{creating}} a quilt or quilted garment also involves other steps such as designing, <b>piecing,</b> appliqué, and binding.

25|$|When a {{hand loom}} {{was located in}} the home, {{children}} helped with the weaving process from an early age. <b>Piecing</b> needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to help their older sisters, and laws {{have to be made}} to prevent child labour becoming established.|$|E
25|$|Taking this success, Najwa {{got back}} to the drawing board for a new album. Months were spent <b>piecing</b> {{together}} lyrics and arrangements, and by mid-2003, the album was ready for release. Rotana set up a large launch party in Downtown Beirut, where over fifteen thousand of Karam's fans packed the streets, waiting for Najwa to appear and sing her new material.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposing}} <b>piece</b> {{is generally}} captured by displacement: That is, if a <b>piece</b> moves to an intersection occupied by an opposing <b>piece,</b> the opposing <b>piece</b> is displaced and {{removed from the}} board. A <b>piece</b> cannot move to an intersection occupied by a friendly <b>piece</b> (that is, a <b>piece</b> controlled by the same player). However, some shooting <b>pieces</b> are unable to capture by displacement, and therefore cannot move to an intersection occupied by an opposing <b>piece.</b>|$|R

50|$|All the <b>pieces</b> {{except for}} the king capture {{differently}} from their counterparts in chess, and all but the king have different names. The king is the only <b>piece</b> that captures, as chess <b>pieces</b> do, by moving into a square that is occupied by an enemy <b>piece.</b> All the other <b>pieces</b> capture enemy <b>pieces</b> in more complex ways. Friendly <b>pieces</b> are never allowed to capture other friendly <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
25|$|McCulloch {{was placed}} {{in command of the}} Indian Territory. He set up his {{headquarters}} at Little Rock, and began <b>piecing</b> together an Army of the West, with regiments from Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. He disagreed strongly with General Sterling Price of Missouri, but with the assistance of Brigadier General Albert Pike, he was able to build alliances for the Confederacy with the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek nations.|$|E
25|$|There were {{difficulties}} matching {{bones to}} one another due to the high amount of commingling of remains. Also, many bones in the body mature at different stages and therefore one individual may show maturation of some bones while still developing others. This made <b>piecing</b> together of entire individuals difficult and thus making inferences regarding health of individuals less distinct. Also, the sex of individuals was not clear since the entire skeletons {{were not able to}} be articulated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piecing</b> {{together}} landscapes {{requires a}} sometimes difficult union between natural and social sciences, {{close attention to}} geographic and temporal scales, {{a knowledge of the}} range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings {{in a way that is}} useful to researchers in many fields. Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from geography, biology, ecology, history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, ethnographic interviews, and landscape reconstructions.|$|E
50|$|Most of Bosch's guitar {{works were}} not {{published}} {{at the time}} they were written but in collections of Dix <b>Pièces</b> (ten <b>pieces)</b> in 1887 and 1894, 12 <b>Pièces</b> faciles (12 easy <b>pieces)</b> in 1892 and a further six easy <b>pieces</b> in 1894.

50|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of 4 corner <b>pieces,</b> 4 edge <b>pieces</b> and 1 centre <b>piece.</b> Each corner <b>piece</b> has four colours each, each edge <b>piece</b> has three colours each, while the centre <b>piece</b> has two colours (on the opposite faces). The puzzle {{can be thought}} of as twisting around its edge <b>pieces</b> - each twist causes one edge <b>piece</b> to rotate 180° in place, and the two adjacent corner <b>pieces</b> to swap positions (while also being rotated).|$|R

25|$|Underwood is {{introduced}} to Missouri billionaire Raymond Tusk, Walker's friend and advisor. Tusk reveals {{that he has}} been influencing Walker's decisions all along and convinced him to cancel the original agreement, and explains he will influence Walker to nominate Underwood for vice president if he does a favor benefiting Tusk's interests. Underwood counter-proposes to Tusk that they work together to fulfill both their interests, which Tusk accepts. Meanwhile, after Underwood ends their affair, Zoe begins <b>piecing</b> together clues about Underwood's various plots. The season ends when Underwood accepts the nomination for vice president.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{sequence}} assembly {{can be compared}} to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and <b>piecing</b> the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists are <b>piecing</b> {{together}} {{evidence that}} the earliest human settlements in North America were thousands of years before {{the appearance of the}} current Paleo-Indian time frame (before the late glacial maximum 20,000 plus years ago). Evidence indicates that people were living as far east as northern Yukon, in the glacier-free zone called Beringia before 30,000BCE (32,000BP). Until recently, it was generally believed that the first Paleo-Indian people to arrive in North America belonged to the Clovis culture. This archaeological phase was named after the town of Clovis, New Mexico, where in 1936 unique Clovis points were found in situ at the site of Blackwater Draw, where they were directly associated with the bones of Pleistocene animals.|$|E
50|$|Capturing the {{checking}} <b>piece,</b> {{with either}} the king or another <b>piece.</b> If the checking <b>piece</b> is on a square next to the king, the king can capture the <b>piece</b> if the king does not move into a new check, i.e. if the <b>piece</b> is not protected by another enemy <b>piece.</b> Note that the <b>piece</b> which is pinned to the king cannot capture the checking <b>piece</b> because such a move will place the king in a check from the pinning <b>piece.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For each {{partition}}, each agent has {{one or more}} <b>pieces</b> {{which they}} weakly prefer.

25|$|As the Methodists {{started having}} {{problems}} <b>piecing</b> together the necessary property, other civic leaders including J.C. Nichols began pushing {{to create a}} cultural center {{on either side of}} Brush Creek, just east of the Country Club Plaza. According to this plan the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and Kansas City Art Institute would be built north of Brush Creek around the estate of The Kansas City Star publisher William Rockhill Nelson and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a junior college) would be built south of the creek. In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of Kansas City Journal-Post publisher Walter S. Dickey. The hospital was never built.|$|E
25|$|Another American {{group to}} develop a {{distinct}} style of quilting were the Amish. Typically, these quilts use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqué, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: Lancaster County Amish {{are known for their}} Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish quilting, while Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier <b>piecing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{libretto}} is original. The main {{plots of}} acts {{two and three}} are the librettists' invention, {{with only a few}} passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the novel, <b>piecing</b> together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the novel. The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mimì's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mimì's.|$|E

5000|$|From here on, players {{take turns}} {{capturing}} each other's <b>pieces.</b> All moves must be capturing moves. [...] A player captures an enemy <b>piece</b> by hopping over {{it with their}} own <b>piece</b> similar to draughts; however, unlike draughts, captures can be done only orthogonally and not diagonally. The player's <b>piece</b> hops over the orthogonally adjacent enemy <b>piece,</b> and lands on a vacant space immediately beyond. The player's <b>piece</b> can continue to hop over enemy <b>pieces</b> {{but only in the}} same orthogonal direction. The player can stop hopping enemy <b>pieces</b> at any time, but must at least capture one enemy <b>piece</b> in a turn. After the <b>piece</b> has stopped hopping, the player's turn ends. Only one <b>piece</b> may be used in a turn to capture enemy <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{player in}} turn moves one <b>piece</b> {{from the point}} it {{occupies}} to another point. <b>Pieces</b> are generally not permitted to move through a point occupied by another <b>piece.</b> A <b>piece</b> can be moved onto a point occupied by an enemy <b>piece,</b> {{in which case the}} enemy <b>piece</b> is captured and removed from the board. A player cannot capture one of his own <b>pieces.</b> <b>Pieces</b> are never promoted (converted into other <b>pieces),</b> although the soldier is able to move sideways after it crosses the river. Almost all <b>pieces</b> capture using their normal moves, while the cannon has a special capture move described below.|$|R
