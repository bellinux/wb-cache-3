In the town of Osijek there were more parties and coalitions {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th century, and People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>party</b> (Narodna stranka) was in power in Osijek and the county of Virovitica. Osijek was multinational and multi-confessional town and center of Slavonia, and it was a center of many antagonisms of economical and political interests which were specifically expressed through the elections. In Osijek there was Croatian - Serbian coalition and there was agreed Osijek Resolution, before the Resolution of Rijeka was brought, and apart from the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>party,</b> great influence {{in the town}} of Osijek had Starčević 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>party</b> of Law (Stranka prava) and Croatian Farmers party (Hrvatska seljacka stranka). For the representatives in Croatian - Slavonian - Dalmatian parliament the results of elections in Osijek brought many changes, because in stead of former two representatives People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> (Hungarian) <b>party,</b> Croatian parliament was entered by one independent representative supported by the opposition (coalition) and one representative supported by the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>party,</b> who later became the dissident of the same party. Since the elections in 1906, the town of Osijek shared the destiny of the rest of Croatia and Slavonia, where the opposition (coalition) came to power, while the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>party</b> weakened, which for Osijek will mark the beginning of the end of Hungarian "People 2 ̆ 7 s" policy...|$|R

That location may be a forum in China or outside of China, and the means may be either litigation or arbitration. U. <b>S.</b> <b>parties</b> must draft their Dispute Resolution Clauses with an eye towards two main factors: legal validity of the clause under Chinese law, and the practicality of enforcing the clause and/or any judgments or awards that may ensue.

40|$|Autor na temelju znanstvene i publicističke {{literature}} te suvremenog tiska rekonstruira ishodišta i nastanak Hrvatskoga katoličkog pokreta i njegovo izvanstranačko i stranačko političko djelovanje u posljednjim godinama Austro-Ugarske Monarhije i prvom desetljeću Kraljevine Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca (1903. — 1929.). Posebnu pozornost posvećuje Hrvatskome katoličkom senioratu, elitnoj svećeničko- svjetovnjačkoj organizaciji i Hrvatskoj pučkoj stranci. The instigator of the Croatian Catholic Movement was the Bishop of Krk, Antun Mahnić (1903). It {{was on his}} {{own initiative}} that the Croatian Catholic Seniority — an exclusive organisation of secular and clerical intelligence — was established. In December 1912, the seniors — a circle around Dr Petar Rogulja — published their “political programme article” in which they declared themselves to be in favour of the “national unity” of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. After the “May Declaration” of 1917 had been published — whose ultimate goal was the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the constitution of the Yugoslav state — the Seniority accepted its political principles. In proportion to their numerical strength, the Seniors joined the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and actively participated in the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the constitution of the first Yugoslav union of states — the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918). In the Parliamentary life of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1919 — 1929), the Croatian People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> also participated. It was a “political branch” of the Croatian Catholic Movement, thus its integral part. Although the Yugoslav Catholic episcopate approved of the principles on the basis of which the party 2 ̆ 7 s politics was supposed to be led, that did not — in the least — mean that it accepted responsibility for the concrete political activity of the Croatian People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party.</b> Partaking in the political life of the then state, the Croatian People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> reached its peak in the elections for the Constituent Assembly (1920). In their “detached view” of the draught of the Government 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution, the members of the Croatian People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> advocated the autonomous system of government of the Yugoslav union of states. After the assassination of Stjepan Radić and his party members, the president of the Croatian People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party,</b> Stjepan Barić, joined the coalition government of the Rev Anton Koroπec, president of the Slovene People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> (1928).

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{governance}} and good governance has gained importance among practitioners of public administration, international aid agencies (IAA) and the OECD countries, due to rapid economic growth, remarkable breakthroughs in information technology, {{and as the}} role of third sector in poverty alleviation in the developing countries has emerged. Decentralized local governance and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation {{are two of the}} major policy concerns regarding governance and good governance. It is widely argued that decentralization ensures <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation, promotes political education and training, equal and efficient distribution of resources, trustworthy relationship among various actors of central and local governance and enhances responsiveness of the central government for citizen s demands and priorities. It has been widely accepted that poor governance and week institutions have constituted significant constraints on administrative, economic and political development since the independence of Bangladesh. Hence, decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation have been the political rhetoric of almost all successive regimes in Bangladesh. However, recent experiences show that these two important issues were actually not promoted by any successive government in Bangladesh since the independence. Given this background, the aim of this research, is to find out the threats and challenges of decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation in Bangladesh. The research has been conducted as an empirical study. Methods and techniques of qualitative research have been used to collect primary data for the study. These have included case study method, formal and informal questionnaires, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), local cultural appraisal (LCA), chain and purposeful approach (snowball approach) and participant observation. In addition, a considerable size of data and information has been gathered from various secondary sources. Governance, good governance, decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation constitute the key concepts of this study and they have been extensively clarified and analyzed through reviewing contemporary literatures ranging from neo-classical writers to political economists. Critical overview of decentralization policy and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation in Bangladesh in general is presented from historical perspective. The grassroots level reality of decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation is presented through analyzing data from the case studies, interviews and PRA sessions. The role of local government institutions (public, private and non-profit) are also presented in a comparative manner. This study has identified two different factors that reveal the existing threats and challenges for decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation in Bangladesh. These are classified as independent factors and dependent factors. Political intervention and bureaucratic resistance are considered as independent factors. Corruption, weak institutional framework, lack of resources, coordination and adequate knowledge are identified as the dependent factors. This study states that the dependent factors can not be eliminated unless and until the independent factors are effectively removed. The major findings of this research are: a) despite frequent reform measures, the policy of decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation is still entrapped around the discourse of governance as merely an illusionary vision, due to strong political and bureaucratic intervention; b) formal, informal and background (invisible) actors seriously jeopardize even the theoretical application of <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation; c) as a result, corruption has swelled and expanded into every sector of the country; d) although the contemporary non-profit and private institutions are structurally weaker than the public institutions, functionally they are stronger; and e) strong public institutions can not work properly given their various malfunctioning practices whereas weak institutional structures (NGOs) are able to work effectively due to their good practices. Based on these findings, the study suggests that a partnership based form of local governance system would work for the future decentralization and <b>people</b> <b>s</b> participation in Bangladesh.
