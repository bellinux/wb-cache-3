The benefit features of this vitamin are accompanied with {{the side effects of}} flushing, mainly, that have very negative influence to <b>patient</b> <b>compliance.</b> Independently, <b>T.</b> Soga and A. Wise have discovered the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR 109 A (HM 74 A in humans, PUMA-G in mice) as the receptor for nicotinic acid. This elucidation opened the way to elucidate the molecular identification of the mechanism of nicotinic acid-induced flushing. We have done several experiments with PUMA-G double-knockout mice which lacking the PUMA- G receptor. First of all, we have established the method for monitoring the flushing response after the administration of nicotinic acid and acipimox, its derivative with similar effect on the lipid metabolism. From our results, it implied that nicotinic acid and acipimox causes flushing response via the receptor PUMA-G. Thus we could say that PUMA-G receptors are involved in both lipid- lowering mechanism and flushing-mechanism. It has been postulated that NSAIDs can diminish the occurring flush response in the patients. Our experiments with COX- 1 -/- clearly showed that COX- 1 is one of the crucial enzymes in the nicotinic [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Compliance {{in health}} care refers to the patient's {{adherence}} to a prescribed medical regimen. With the shift in emphasis of health care from direct medical supervision to patient self-management, more of {{the responsibility of the}} success of treatment is placed on the patient. Health professionals are realizing of the impact <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> or noncompliance on health outcomes, and are thus increasing their attention to the issue of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance.</b> Some physical therapists believe that patient adherence to therapy programs {{is one of the most}} serious problems affecting their profession today. It is estimated that somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of patients are noncompliant with their therapy program. A number of factors influence a patient's compliant or noncompliant behavior, such as: characteristics of the patient, characteristics of the patient's illness, pain, characteristics of the patient regimen, and patient's attitudes. A patient's motivation and education concerning their illness and the therapy program prescribed to them affect the level of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> to their therapeutic program. In the questionnaire developed for this research project, physical therapists reported a lack of formal knowledge concerning <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> and a strong belief in the significance of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> in the physical therapy profession. They suggested using education, monitoring a patient's progress, giving positive feedback, and shifting the responsibility of therapy to the patient as methods of increasing <b>patient</b> <b>compliance.</b> If information and methods concerning <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> are explored and shared among health care professionals, the level of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> in physical therapy has the potential to rise. More patients can be rehabilitated and accurate assessments can be made concerning the quality of therapy provided. As a future physical therapist, I feel that the knowledge and insight gained from this research project will help to prepare me for upcoming challenges in the profession.

40|$|Abstract Background Whether {{the primary}} care physician's {{assessment}} of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> is a valuable prognostic marker to identify patients who {{are at increased risk}} of death, or merely reflects measurement of various treatment parameters such as HbA 1 C or other laboratory markers is unclear. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the prognostic value of the physicians' assessment of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> and other factors with respect to all-cause mortality during a one year follow-up period. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted among 1014 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 40 and over (mean age 69 years, SD 10. 4, 45 % male) who were under medical treatment in 11 participating practices of family physicians and internists working in primary care in a defined region in South Germany between April and June 2000. Baseline data were gathered from patients and physicians by standardized questionnaire. The physician's assessment of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> was assessed by means of a 4 -point Likert scale (very good, rather good, rather bad, very bad). In addition, we carried out a survey among physicians by means of a questionnaire to find out which aspects for the assessment of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> were of importance to make this assessment. Active follow-up of patients was conducted after one year to determine mortality. Results During the one year follow-up 48 (4. 7 %) of the 1014 patients died. Among other factors such as patient type (patients presenting at office, nursing home or visited patients), gender, age and a history of macrovascular disease, the physician's assessment of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> was an important predictor of all-cause mortality. <b>Patients</b> whose <b>compliance</b> was assessed by the physician as "very bad" (6 %) {{were significantly more likely to}} die during follow-up (OR = 2. 67, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 6. 97) after multivariable adjustment compared to <b>patients</b> whose <b>compliance</b> was assessed as "rather good" (45 %) or "very good" (18 %). The HbA 1 C -value and the cholesterol level at baseline showed no statistically significant association with all-cause mortality. According to our survey for most of the physicians self-acceptance of disease, treatment adherence, patient's interest in physician's explanations, attendance at appointments, a good self-management, and a good physician-patient relationship were key elements in the assessment of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance.</b> Conclusion The primary care physician's assessment of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> is a valuable prognostic marker for mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes. Identification of patients in need of improved compliance may help to target preventive measures. </p...|$|R

40|$|An interim {{analysis}} of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance</b> is reported in 234 hypertension outpatients who {{were entered into}} a large-scale, open, crossover, comparative study between a new-generation calcium antagonist, amlodipine (5 mg, once daily), and nifedipine SR (20 mg, twice daily). An analysis was also performed on 84 outpatients with stable angina pectoris, who were included in an open, parallel study and received the same dosing regimen of either amlodipine or nifedipine SR as the patients in the hypertension arm of the study. In the hypertensive patients, {{there were significant differences}} in favor of amlodipine, using all four methods to assess <b>patient</b> <b>compliance.</b> In the angina patients, {{a significant difference between the}} groups in favor of amlodipine was only found using the ''correct dosing'' and the ''timing compliance'' methods. With the traditional pill-counting and also the ''taking compliance'' methods, there was no observed difference in compliance between the two groups. It was concluded that, in terms of <b>patient</b> <b>compliance,</b> once-daily amlodipine was markedly superior to twice-daily nifedipine in the crossover study involving the hypertension patients. Amlodipine was also better tolerated than nifedipine.

The compliance of the 320 hypertensive patients with once-daily amlodipine was markedly superior to twice-daily slow release nifedipine. Therapeutic coverage was also significantly better for amlodipine in the hypertensive patients.
