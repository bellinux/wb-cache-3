25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{evaluate}} {{weight loss}} and cardiometabolic risk reduction achieved through an adapted Diabetes Prevention Program intervention among adults {{at high risk for}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Eight health care facilities implemented a group-based lifestyle intervention beginning in 2008. Participants attended 16 weekly core sessions followed by 6 monthly after core sessions. RESULTS — A total of 1, 003 participants were enrolled, 816 (81 %) <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> core and 578 (58 %) <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> after core. Of <b>participants</b> <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> core and after core, 45 and 49 % achieved the 7 % weight loss goal, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if perceptions of cohesion in exercise classes demonstrated sufficiently high consensus and between-group variance to support a conclusion that exercise classes are groups. Participants (N = 1, 700) in 130 classes were tested on either the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ) or the Physical Activity Group Environment Questionnaire (PAGEQ). Results showed that exercise classes satisfied the statistical criteria necessary to support a conclusion that they are true groups; that is, they exhibited acceptable levels of consensus about cohesion within classes and acceptable differences in cohesion between classes. In addition, index-of-agreement values were significantly greater for <b>participants</b> <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> PAGEQ than for <b>participants</b> <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> GEQ. Finally, consensus was greatest when participants evaluated how the exercise class satisfied their own personal task needs (i. e., individual attractions to the group-task), and second greatest when participants evaluated the collective unity around the task objectives (i. e., group integration-task) ...|$|R

50|$|An early review (1940) {{of romantic}} {{love in the}} Western worldemphasized the {{persistent}} association of obstacles or grave difficulties with the intensity of love, as in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In 1972, Richard Driscoll; along with Keith Davis and Milton Lipetz, published results from a longitudinal study on relationships, suggesting an underlying truth to the popular impressions. The research suggests that parental interference in a love relationship can intensify the feelings of romantic love between members of the couple, {{at least for a}} brief span of time. The study interviewed 140 couples, both married and unmarried, via questionnaires and surveys. Couples joined the study to gain more knowledge about the state of their romantic affiliation. The researchers measured feelings about the spouse, about their perceived love, spousal trustworthiness, neediness, and parental interference. The couples completed these procedures at a first session, and then around 6 months to a year later, completed identical surveying sessions to see how their relationships have endured the past months. About 80% of the original <b>participants</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> second session. Only {{a small portion of the}} original sample had ended their relationships or gotten divorced. In the results of the overall study, there was found to be an increase in love ratings for one's partner and parental interference. Interference did seem to have other frustrating effects, as it also was associated with decreased trust, increased criticalness, and increased frequency of negative, bothersome behaviors.|$|E
