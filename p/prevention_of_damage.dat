50|$|The {{current in}} the I-phase (stage 1) should be chosen {{depending}} on {{the capacity of the}} battery. In practice, it depends on the capability of the charger. The battery capacity C is expressed in Ah units, typically the C20 value based on a 20-hour discharge time. The charging current (in A units) can be written as C/t where t is a time. For example, for a battery with C = 40 Ah, a current C/(10 h) (usually written as C/10, omitting the 'hours' as time unit) is equal to 4 A. The charging current is a compromise between charging time (favoring high currents), the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> due to overheating or gassing (favoring low currents), and cost of the charger (favoring low currents). Recommendations for the maximum charging current vary between C/10 and C/2. At high charging currents, active cooling measures may be necessary to prevent overheating.|$|E
