25|$|In 1980, Conn left Wisconsin to {{join the}} University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he {{continued}} research in plasma physics and nuclear fusion, {{as well as in}} materials science and energy policy.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the operation features of <b>plasma</b> focus <b>chambers</b> using deuteriumâtritium mixture.

Decay of tritium is also accompanied by the accumulation of helium. Impurities lead to a decreased yield of neutron emission from <b>plasma</b> focus <b>chambers,</b> especially for long term operation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the ability of}} single and {{multiple}} gas plasmas to improve the solderability of PCB substrates, and hence allow the removal of flux from the soldering process for electronic assemblies has been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} asymmetric electrode <b>plasma</b> <b>chambers</b> allow the use of single gas plasmas for this purpose due to their greater efficiency compared to symmetric systems. It has also been shown that the use of triple gas plasmas results in improved cleaning ability when using symmetric electrode systems. Dynamic contact angle (DCA) analysis was the primary analytical technique used in this work. This technique produces two contact angles, advancing and receding. The advancing contact angle determines the surface energy of a solid. It has been shown using Auger analysis that contact angles of approximately 48 deg indicate low levels of hydrocarbon contamination. It has also been shown that plasma cleaning processes giving advancing contact angles of this magnitude result in the ability to solder Hot Air Solder Leveled (HASL) PCB substrates without the use of flux. In addition it has been shown that, whilst it is possible to reduce the advancing contact angle of copper substrates considerably, the reduction is not as great as for HASL substrates. Analytical models of RF <b>plasma</b> <b>chambers</b> have also been reviewed, and these adapted for the <b>plasma</b> <b>chambers</b> used in this work. The experimental work carried out in this research also shows that these models hold true.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the microwave-plasma coupling {{plays a significant role}} in the production of highly charged ion beams with electron cyclotron resonance ion sources (ECRISs). The coupling properties are affected by the mechanical design of the ion source <b>plasma</b> <b>chamber</b> and microwave launching system, as well as damping of the microwave electric field by the plasma. Several experiments attempting to optimize the microwave-plasma coupling characteristics by fine-tuning the frequency of the injected microwaves have been conducted with varying degrees of success. The inherent difficulty in interpretation of the frequency tuning results is that the effects of microwave coupling system and the cavity behavior of the <b>plasma</b> <b>chamber</b> cannot be separated. A preferable approach to study the effect of the cavity properties of the <b>plasma</b> <b>chamber</b> on extracted beam currents is to adjust the cavity dimensions.
