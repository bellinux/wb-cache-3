As a company, Voddler was founded in 2005 and developed its own streaming solution, called Vnet. Vnet is based on <b>peer-to-peer</b> (<b>p2p),</b> where all users contribute by streaming movies to each other, but, unlike traditional p2p, Vnet has a central administrator who decides which users that have access to which movies. Due to this exception, Vnet {{has been referred to}} as a [...] "hybrid p2p distribution system", [...] "walled garden p2p" [...] or [...] "controlled p2p". In addition to running the consumer service Voddler, the company Voddler also offers, since 2013, Vnet as a stand-alone technology for other streaming platforms. The service Bollyvod, a global VOD-service for Bollywood-content that Voddler built for the Indian movie industry, was released as a pilot in 2014.|$|E
