25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{adopted an}} atypical tail-first configuration; this approach {{had the effect}} of greatly reducing trim-drag while also generating increased lift at slower speeds. Longitudinal control was provided by the nose-mounted tail plane via trailing edge elevators, lateral control was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the <b>primary</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> surfaces were actutated by a quadruple-redundant electro-hydraulic control unit, designed by Boulton Paul. Fly-by-wire electrical controls and automatic control systems were also to be employed on the type. The undercarriage, designed by Dowty Group, used an arrangement of a single centre-fuselage main unit complete with four wheels, a nose unit with two wheels, and a pair of outriggers located on the engine nacelles.|$|E
500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each <b>primary</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two. With wing flaps up, [...] "control was reduced to the right inboard aileron and the innermost of spoiler section of each side".|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{powered by a}} pair of 14400 lbf kN General Electric YJ101-GE-100 turbofans, a development of the GE15, mounted next to each other to minimize thrust asymmetry {{in the event of an}} engine loss. For ease of maintenance, the engines are mounted in a steady-rest that allows removal from below the aircraft, without disturbing the empennage controls. Each engine drove an independent hydraulic system.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} of an actuator {{depends on the}} closed-loop position control (architecture and parameters), on the load frequency, and, for fault-tolerant actuators, on the operative mode. The stiffness response is of basic importance {{for the design of}} actuators for <b>primary</b> <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> especially for high-performance aircrafts. Actually, in-flight conditions characterized by high speed and high angle-of-attack, the dynamic interactions between aircraft structure, actuator, and aerodynamic loads can induce aeroservoelastic effects, which, if not controlled, can imply performance degradation and even instability. The study and the compensation of such concerns require the assessment of the resonant frequencies of the aeroservoelastic system, which can be performed only by characterizing the dynamic {{stiffness of}} the actuator. This article reports the experimental activities carried out for the characterization of the stiffness response of a fault-tolerant fly-by-wire actuator for the <b>primary</b> <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> of a modern jet trainer, starting from the feasibility studies of the experiments up to the execution of the vibration tests.
