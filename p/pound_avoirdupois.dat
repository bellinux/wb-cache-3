25|$|For {{the pound}} and smaller units, the U.S. {{customary}} {{system and the}} British imperial system are identical. However, they differ when dealing with units larger than the pound. The definition of the <b>pound</b> <b>avoirdupois</b> in the imperial system is identical {{to that in the}} U.S. customary system.|$|E
25|$|The avoirdupois pound, {{also known}} as the wool pound, first came into general use c. 1300. It was {{initially}} equal to 6992 troy grains. The <b>pound</b> <b>avoirdupois</b> was divided into 16 ounces. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the avoirdupois pound was redefined as 7,000 troy grains. Since then, the grain has often been {{an integral part of the}} avoirdupois system. By 1758, two Elizabethan Exchequer standard weights for the avoirdupois pound existed, and when measured in troy grains they were found to be of 7,002 grains and 6,999 grains.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{yard and}} pound {{were lost in}} 1834 when a fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard was a <b>pound</b> <b>avoirdupois.</b> They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.|$|E

50|$|In the avoirdupois system, sixteen ounces make up an <b>avoirdupois</b> <b>pound,</b> and the <b>avoirdupois</b> <b>pound</b> {{is defined}} as 7000 grains; one avoirdupois ounce is {{therefore}} equal to 437.5 grains.|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century many {{commodities}} had their own set of units, the units of measure for the wool and cloth industries had units of measure specific to those commodities, albeit derived on the <b>pound</b> <b>avoirdupois</b> or the foot while wine and beer used units with the same names but different sizes – the wine gallon being 231 cubic inches and the beer or ale gallon being 282 cubic inches. Agricultural produce was sold by the bushel which was based on yet another gallon – the dry gallon of 268.8 cubic inches. Even though not explicitly permitted by statute, many markets used bushels based on weight rather than volume when selling wheat and barley.|$|E

2500|$|The avoirdupois pound {{is legally}} {{defined as a}} measure of mass, but the name pound is also applied to {{measures}} of force.

2500|$|Under the Act of Union of 1707, Scotland, {{which had}} {{developed}} its own system of {{weights and measures}} independently of England, abandoned them in favour of English weights and measures. The Acts of Union 1800 which united Ireland with Great Britain had less of an effect on weights and measures—Irish weights and measures having been based on the English foot and <b>pound</b> <b>avoirdupois</b> since 1351, though the Irish acre and mile {{were based on a}} perch of 7 yards, not [...] yards as in England.|$|E

2500|$|During the Tudor period, {{numerous}} {{reforms were}} made to English weights and measures. In 1496 Henry VII ordered that reference copies of the yard, pound and gallon should be made of brass and distributed to specified towns and cities throughout the kingdom. Many weights and measures that had crept into use were banned: in 1527 Henry VIII banned the Tower pound (5400 grains against the 5760 grains of the apothecaries and troy pounds) and the mercantile pound (6750 grains against the 7000 grains of the <b>pound</b> <b>avoirdupois)</b> and in 1592 Elizabeth I ordered {{the use of the}} [...] "statute mile" [...] (5280 feet against the 5000 feet of the London or Old English mile).|$|E

It was most used in southern India, to the south of Akbar's empire, but has been recorded elsewhere in South Asia.

6000|$|We at once {{recognized}} {{the value of}} this discovery when, reaching the tents, we examined the quartz, and found it seamed and pitted with veins and geodes containing Colorado, earthy and crumbling metallic dust, chlorure, iodure, and bromure of silver, with various colours, red, ochre-yellow, and dark chocolate-brown. It stained the fingers, and was suspiciously light--n'importe. I must regret that here, as indeed throughout the exploration, all our specimens were taken from the surface: we had not time to dig even a couple of feet deep.
