40|$|The present paper {{describes}} new dedicated {{facilities for}} coating investigations that recently went into operation at the Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart. The first facility {{consists of a}} coating pilot plant in the scale of an automotive line in which, under actual production conditions, technologies from different fields including pretreatment, application techniques, drying and material recycling can be investigated. In addition to the main coating line, there are also two smaller spray booths {{with one of them}} designed for experiments under extremely well controlled climatic conditions. The coating facility is fully equipped with several <b>painting</b> <b>robots</b> <b>and</b> <b>reciprocators.</b> All materials including solvent-based, water-based and 2 K can be processed. On the experimental side, a full set of instruments for layer quality testing is available. So far, two diffraction particle sizers are used for atomization experiments, however, in the near future, also a phase-Doppler anemometer and laser light sheet equipment will be added. The second facility is a new capsulated climatic powder coating booth. In this booth, powder coating experiments can be carried out under well controleld conditions, including defined climate, air flow velocities, suction velocities and wall materials. Int he powder coating booth (height 1. 85 m width 3 m), workpiece sizes up to approximately 1000 mm x 1000 mm can be coated. An appropriate oven is available...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to validate a simulated model of an automotive factory spray paint gun. The project ensures that repeatable and valid data are obtained in the simulation of a paint process. A simulated paint gun model was created using DELMIA IGRIP simulation software; an interactive, 3 D graphic simulation tool for designing, optimizing, and programming robotic paint booths off-line. IGRIP is used to generate optimized robot paths using the workpiece CAD geometry <b>and</b> download <b>robot</b> motion <b>and</b> process programs. A Design of Experiment (DOE) study was executed to validate the simulated paint gun model. The DOE was performed using a physical <b>paint</b> <b>robot</b> <b>and</b> a virtual <b>paint</b> <b>robot.</b> Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) {{was performed on the}} two experiments in order to detect any differences in average performance of the paint process parameters tested. Understanding the contribution of each factor was significant to determine the validity of the simulation. The comparison of the outputs of the two experiments provided an assessment and validation of the simulated paint gun model. The IGRIP simulation software is limited in its abilities to quantify expected improvements of all paint quality characteristics in that it is not able to consider parameters of viscosity, humidity, temperature, air velocity. The IGRIP model that was developed must be calibrated to mimic the physical process results. This thesis advances the Simulation and Off-Line Programming project as it supports the development of a robust design for the paint process simulation.

40|$|Abstract. Structural {{synthesis}} of super-redundant mechanism {{is a key}} to design of <b>painting</b> <b>robot</b> for S-shape duct. Based on the principles of modular structure design, the <b>painting</b> <b>robot</b> for S-shape duct falls naturally into three separate control and design components: a moving platform, a locating mechanism, and a painting manipulator. The moving platform consists of a robot body, wheels, gasbags for position adjustment, and screw jacks. The 3 PR-type serial mechanism is adopted for location. The super-redundant 3 P 7 R-type serial mechanism is used for the painting manipulator. The restriction of the distance between connecting rods and the axis of the duct is employed to control self-motion of the painting manipulator for joint trajectory planning. Experiment result shows that minimal distance between <b>robot</b> joints <b>and</b> duct interior is 18 mm and that average dynamic accuracy is ± 6. 8 mm, which satisfies the working requirements...|$|R

It grasps a paintbrush with its own hand and paints a picture on a canvas. Because a brush is deformable, adequate control of a paintbrush is a challenging task. It is necessary to develop several manipulation methods with feedback control using both vision and force sensors effectively. Our proposed method enables a robot to find a paintbrush, to grasp it, to detect contact between a brush and a canvas, and to draw various curves by changing parameters, such as pressure and lean angle.

The definition and the three theorems of exponential mean Bézier curves are discussed. Then a spatial painting path generation method based on exponential mean Bézier curves is developed. A new simple algorithm for trajectory optimization on complex curved surfaces is introduced. A golden section method is adopted to calculate the values. The experimental results illustrate that the exponential mean Bézier curves enhanced flexibility of the path planning, and the trajectory optimization algorithm achieved satisfactory performance. This method can also be extended to other applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{most common}} view of any {{construction}} site {{today is a}} set of scaffolds margined around the walls of the buildings with laborers hanging around those scaffolds struggling to reach here and there with a full stretch of their body. Seems quite funny at times, but if we look carefully, it may result into grave consequences. Also most of the times the surrounding environments are so unhealthy that it’s almost an unbearable situation for the workers, forcing them either to quit or to welcome some deadly consequences to their health. The autonomous wall <b>painting</b> <b>robot</b> (Wall-E) developed is a silver lining to all the problems discussed above.

The autonomous wall <b>painting</b> <b>robot</b> (named Wall-E) developed can perform the entire task judiciously, quickly, efficiently and even effectively as compared to humans.

This motor will be responsible for the rotation (powered by a suitable source) of the belt. The robot basically will be controlled by the Bluetooth signals being sent from the android application.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this project is to {{determine}} the motion capture capabilities of the Kinect sensor. Motion capture is the process of recording human movement, and converting the captured data into a virtual environment. A simple implementation of motion capture is currently used by ABB for their Simplified Robot Programming project. Simplified Robot Programming allows the painter to program a robot by demonstrating the desired movement, instead of programming it. To simplify the programming of paths for robotic paint applications, the movements of a professional painter are recorded and translated into a corresponding path in virtual space. The programmer will no longer have to manually program the coordinates in a path for the robot to follow, as it will follow the motion of the painter. This is currently done by a magnetic motion capture system. This project will ideally determine if the Microsoft Kinect v 2 sensor can serve as a more cost efficient replacement for the current system. The Kinect sensor features a 1080 p camera and a time-of-flight based depth measuring technology. By combining these technologies, the goal of the implementation is to achieve tracking of a marker and compare the features of the Kinect to the current system. The scope of this project extends to analyzing the accuracy and precision measured by the Kinect. This will only include the measured position of a marker, not its orientation, as this requires additional sensors or a different implementation. To test the system's ability to track a dynamic target, the marker was mounted to an industrial ABB <b>paint</b> <b>robot.</b> The tracking <b>and</b> mapping capabilities of the Kinect worked to a satisfactory degree.
