25|$|One of {{the first}} uses of carbon-11 choline in <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> was with Alzheimer's disease patients.

25|$|Because of its {{involvement}} in biologic processes, several medical imaging techniques {{have been developed}} to monitor relative concentration and kinetics of choline in different diseases. Radiolabeling one of the nitrogen methyl groups on choline with carbon-11 allows it {{to be used as a}} tracer in <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> studies. Carbon-11 is radioactive with a half-life of 20.38 minutes. By monitoring the gamma radiation resulting from the decay of carbon-11, the uptake and retention of carbon-11 choline in different parts of the body can be measured.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine's {{status as}} a {{serotonin}} transporter (SERT) inhibitor at clinical doses in humans is uncertain. A <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> study on rhesus monkeys found that atomoxetine occupied >90% and >85% of neural NET and SERT, respectively. However, both mouse and rat microdialysis studies have failed to find an increase in extracellular serotonin in the prefrontal cortex following acute or chronic atomoxetine treatment. Supporting atomoxetine's selectivity, a human study found no effects on platelet serotonin uptake (a marker of SERT inhibition) and inhibition of the pressor effects of tyramine (a marker of NET inhibition).|$|E
25|$|<b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> {{studies have}} {{suggested}} low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5nbsp&mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2nbsp&mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established.|$|E

25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} another disease where carbon-11 choline <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> has found success. As with the brain, {{there is too}} much signal from the {{surrounding}} tissue, especially the bladder, to accurately measure tumor uptake with fluorine-18 FDG. While it was shown carbon-11 choline could be used to detect the initiation of prostate cancer, its value was found in detecting prostate cancer recurrence when it is the most deadly. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved carbon-11 choline as an imaging agent to be used during a PET scan to detect recurrent prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the factors}} most {{responsible}} for the acceptance of positron imaging was the development of radiopharmaceuticals. In particular, the development of labeled 2-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (2FDG) by the Brookhaven group {{under the direction of}} Al Wolf and Joanna Fowler was a major factor in expanding the scope of <b>PET</b> <b>imaging.</b> The compound was first administered to two normal human volunteers by Abass Alavi in August 1976 at the University of Pennsylvania. Brain images obtained with an ordinary (non-PET) nuclear scanner demonstrated the concentration of FDG in that organ. Later, the substance was used in dedicated positron tomographic scanners, to yield the modern procedure.|$|E

2500|$|PET scans are {{increasingly}} read alongside CT or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) scans, with the combination (called [...] "co-registration") giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, {{and what it is}} doing biochemically). Because <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners (so-called [...] "PET-CT"). Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between the two types of scans, the two sets of images are more precisely registered, so that areas of abnormality on the <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images. This is very useful in showing detailed views of moving organs or structures with higher anatomical variation, which is more common outside the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the short}} half-lives of most positron-emitting radioisotopes, the {{radiotracers}} have traditionally been produced using a cyclotron {{in close proximity to}} the <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> facility. [...] The half-life of fluorine-18 is long enough that radiotracers labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers. Recently rubidium-82 generators have become commercially available. These contain strontium-82, which decays by electron capture to produce positron-emitting rubidium-82.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} {{of a number of}} novel probes for noninvasive, in vivo <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> of neuroaggregate in human brain has brought amyloid imaging to the doorstep of clinical use. The earliest amyloid imaging probes included 2-(1-{6--2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) developed at the University of California, Los Angeles and N-methyl-2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (termed Pittsburgh compound B) developed at the University of Pittsburgh. [...] These amyloid imaging probes permit the visualization of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and could assist clinicians in making a positive clinical diagnosis of AD pre-mortem and aid in the {{development of}} novel anti-amyloid therapies. PMP (N-methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate) is a novel radiopharmaceutical used in <b>PET</b> <b>imaging</b> to determine the activity of the acetylcholinergic neurotransmitter system by acting as a substrate for acetylcholinesterase. Post-mortem examination of AD patients have shown decreased levels of acetylcholinesterase. PMP is used to map the acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain, which could allow for pre-mortem diagnosis of AD and help to monitor AD treatments. Avid Radiopharmaceuticals of Philadelphia has developed a compound called 18F-AV-45 that uses the longer-lasting radionuclide fluorine-18 to detect amyloid plaques using PET scans.|$|E
