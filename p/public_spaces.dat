By unlawfully taking up space in the city, streets artists challenge the laws and unwritten rules {{that make up the}} foundation of contemporary design and regulation of <b>public</b> <b>space.</b> Are these illegal actions a threat against an open and democratic city where <b>public</b> <b>space</b> should be accessible to everybody?

As a part of the urban landscape, <b>public</b> <b>space</b> contains centuries-old history in both the Western and Eastern world. Its definitions are also comparatively different. Including the Greek agora, Roman forum, medieval market places, pizzas, residential squares and American city parks, all these historic identities and physical places have become the foundation stone for the requirement of today’s urban <b>space</b> qualities.
