5|$|The fire's spread only {{stopped when}} {{it reached the}} 30th floor, {{which was the first}} fire-affected floor to have {{automatic}} sprinklers. Ten sprinklers extinguished the fire on the 30th floor and prevented continued spread. Contained by the automatic sprinklers and running out of fuel, the fire was declared under control at 3:01 PM. The fire lasted over nineteen hours, destroyed eight floors, and killed three firefighters and injured twenty-four. Twelve alarms were called, which brought fifty-one engine companies, fifteen ladder companies, eleven specialized units, and over three hundred firefighters. The fire caused an estimated US$100 million in direct <b>property</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Storm surges {{caused by}} extratropical {{cyclones}} {{have been recorded}} along the coastal areas. These storm surges are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land. They are formed due to {{the interaction between the}} semi-permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic, southeast of Argentina, creating strong winds from the south or southwest. The sudestada, which brings the worst storm surges, occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. Storm surges have caused flooding of coastal areas, leading to extensive <b>property</b> <b>loss</b> and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of storm surges are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin.|$|E

The disaster caused 75 deaths, which is the second highest death toll for a bushfire in Australia. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfire disaster has since surpassed Ash Wednesday on the list of disasters in Australia by death toll, with 173 confirmed fatalities as of 30 March 2009—although the 1983 fires still remain the worst in Australian history in terms of <b>property</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
