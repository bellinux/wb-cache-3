40|$|The {{quality of}} product is a {{condition}} of product that shows its ability to fulfill the needs. Nowadays, in the fierce of global competition, companies must be very clever {{to carry out a}} strategy in order to survive in the competition. One of the strategies is improving the quality of production. Then, companies need a policy that they usually take to keep and improve the quality of the product. The policy is by doing a quality control. Quality control is needed in the company because of the ability to push the amount of the damage of the product.

40|$|AbstractShelf-stable <b>pickled</b> <b>products</b> are {{thermally}} processed {{to ensure}} safety and stability. Carrots packed in glass jars and processed in a boiling water bath were chosen to construct models to predict accumulated lethality values given process conditions and heating times. Mixed models with a natural logarithmic transformation of accumulated lethality as response showed {{that the effect of}} blanching prior to filling did not significantly impact the response (P >  0. 05), while the effects of ln process time, jar size, carrots to brine ratio, carrot spear diameter, brine temperature, and concentration of sucrose in the brine and interactions among these variables significantly affected the response (P <  0. 001), as evaluated in different experimental designs. The residual unexplained replicate-to-replicate variability of all constructed models was always < 3 % and every trial was conducted in triplicate. Process authorities can use these models to establish processing guidelines or evaluate current processes for production of shelf-stable pickled carrots or similar foods (as demonstrated by the validation experiments) with pH values from < 3. 9 to 4. 4. This study also demonstrated that it is feasible to use this experimental setup to evaluate the impact of changes in processing conditions on the accumulated lethality values reached through thermal processing of similar foods.

40|$|ABSTRACT Fruits from 86 {{ecotypes}} of Mexican plum were {{harvested from}} the states of Guerrero and Morelos during the dry season. Of these, 22 were wild ecotypes and 64 were cultivated varieties. Among the variables measured, those with the highest variation coefficients were color, flavor, and mass (> 45 %), highlighting the presence of considerable intra-species variability. Cluster analysis separated the 86 accessions into 5 groups, mainly {{on the basis of}} color, flavor, length, and mass. Members from the first three groups had red (Group I), yellow (Group II), or purple (Group III) epicarps and higher values of mass (12. 2 - 16 g), length (29. 6 - 33. 9 mm), pulp yield (68. 8 - 71. 9 %), TSS (11. 16 - 11. 52 °Brix) and flavor index (14. 5 - 18. 3), making them suitable for horticultural use and fresh consumption. The wild ecotypes clustered in the remaining two groups and consisted of small (23. 2 - 27. 7 mm, 5. 5 - 8. 2 g) red drupes of differing hues. The cherry-red color of the fruits from Group IV suggests possible antioxidant properties due to the presence of polyphenolic pigments which could be of interest to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Finally, fruits from Group V, being the most acidic (pH 2. 7, 2. 1 % acidity), might be better suited for the preparation of <b>pickled</b> <b>products</b> and sauces...|$|R

40|$|Background: Foods {{with a low}} glycemic index are {{increasingly}} being acknowledged as beneficial {{in relation to the}} insulin resistance syndrome. Certain organic acids can lower the glycemic index of bread products. However, the possible effect of acids in fermented milk products on the glycemic index and on insulinemic characteristics has not been addressed. The metabolic effects of fermented milk or <b>pickled</b> <b>products</b> used as additives to mixed meals have also not been addressed. Objectives: One objective was to characterize the glycemic and insulinemic responses after intake of regular or fermented milk products (study 1). In addition, the acute metabolic effect of fermented milk (yogurt) and pickled cucumber as supplements to a traditional breakfast based on a high–glycemic index bread was evaluated (study 2). Design: Ten healthy volunteers were served different breakfast meals after an overnight fast. Capillary blood samples were collected before and during 2 (study 1) or 3 (study 2) h after the meal. White-wheat bread was used as a reference meal in both studies. Results: The lactic acid in the fermented milk products did not lower the glycemic and insulinemic indexes. Despite low glycemic indexes of 15 – 30, all of the milk products produced high insulinemic indexes of 90 – 98, which were not significantly different from the insulinemic index of the reference bread. Addition of fermented milk (yogurt) and pickled cucumber to a breakfast with a high–glycemic index bread significantly lowered postprandial glycemia and insulinemia compared with the reference meal. In contrast, addition of regular milk and fresh cucumber had no favorable effect on the metabolic responses. Conclusions: Milk products appear insulinotropic as judged from 3 -fold to 6 -fold higher insulinemic indexes than expected from the corresponding glycemic indexes. The presence of organic acids may counteract the insulinotropic effect of milk in mixed meals...|$|R
40|$|An active shrimp {{concentrate}} (SC), {{obtained from}} Litopenaeus vannamei cooking juice, {{was incorporated into}} a chitosan-gelatin matrix to develop edible packaging covers (coating and film). Both types of packaging, which showed antimicrobial activity against some fish spoilers and pathogenic organisms, were applied to preserve fish sausages during chilled storage. The storage trial showed that the coating increased the lag phase of total viable microorganisms and enterobacteria to 15 and 10 days, respectively, while the film drastically inhibited growth of these groups. No presence of Staphylococcus aureus or lactic acid bacteria was detected in any batches during storage. Total volatile bases and pH values also decreased during storage, the decrease being more pronounced in the film. With regard to physical-chemical properties, the coated sausages exhibited values for moisture, water holding capacity, and shear strength {{similar to those of}} the control sausages until about day 25. The coating was imperceptible and could be a promising way of improving the quality of sausages during storage since it delayed microbial growth. The sausages wrapped in the film showed a drop in pH and moisture, as well as texture hardening, and were described as resembling a <b>pickled</b> <b>product.</b> The sausages were stable for at least 42 days, which represents a shelf life increase of at least this time with respect to the control sausages (in commercial plastic casings). The coating and the film had different effects on the physicochemical and microbiological properties of the fish sausage, and therefore on the stability of the product. In addition, the film triggered modifications in the product that resulted in a product different from the original, offering an attractive alternative with regard to product design.
