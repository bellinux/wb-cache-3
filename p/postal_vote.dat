25|$|Voting for the {{referendum}} commenced on 27 August 2014, with {{the receipt of}} ballots by postal voters. As of 15 August, 680,235 eligible voters had registered for postal voting, a 20% increase compared with March 2014. During the <b>postal</b> <b>vote</b> phase, Police Scotland arrested a man from Glasgow on suspicion of selling his vote on eBay.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} cases of corrupt practices in recent years {{was that of the}} local government elections in the Bordesley Green and Aston wards of Birmingham in June 2004. The election court, presided over by Richard Mawrey QC, found that there had been extensive abuse of the <b>postal</b> <b>vote</b> system, resulting in the outcome of the election being changed. He accordingly reported that extensive corrupt practices had been committed, found six individuals personally guilty (although one was subsequently cleared by the Court of Appeal), and voided the elections.|$|E

A finding that corrupt and illegal practices {{for the purpose of}} securing Rahman's election, and that such general corruption so extensively prevailed such that it could be reasonably concluded to have affected the result was also returned. Alibor Choudhury was found personally guilty of bribery, making false statements about a candidate, and payment of canvassers.|$|E
40|$|Problems with <b>postal</b> <b>voting</b> have {{attracted}} attention in recent elections in Australia {{and in the}} United Kingdom. This paper reviews the international experiences with absentee (<b>postal)</b> <b>voting</b> in developed capitalist democracies. It concludes that: • Postal Voting can reduce costs of running elections; • Absentee voting can {{have a negative impact}} on the civic aspects of voting (cueing at the polling station has a politically edifying effect, which is minimised by absentee voting); • More generally (but of less relevance in Australia) Turnout has tended to be higher in contests that allow for <b>postal</b> <b>voting.</b> Contrary to some fears, this higher level of turnout does not generally decline of once the novelty of <b>postal</b> <b>voting</b> wears off. • Further, <b>postal</b> <b>voting</b> leads to higher turnout among those with fewest resources. There has been a growing interest in <b>postal</b> <b>voting</b> internationally, not least in Britain...|$|R

25|$|In April 2015, {{her father}} {{provoked}} a political {{crisis in the}} National Front because of two interviews he gave. Controversial statements included his opinion on World WarII and on minorities in France. Marine Le Pen organized a <b>postal</b> <b>vote</b> to ask the FN members to change the statutes of the party in order to expel her father. Le Pen père pursued his movement and the justice canceled the vote. On 25 August, the FN executive office voted to expel him from the party he had founded forty years earlier. Many observers noticed Marine's dependence on her closest advisor, Florian Philippot, a former left-wing technocrat. A national purge expelled the members who refused {{the evolution of the}} FN under Marine Le Pen's leadership.|$|E

Five cities amongst the nine were selected for the shortlist: Athens (Greece), Bangkok (Thailand), Moscow (Russia), Singapore, and Turin (Italy).

40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which {{political}} scandals influence trust in electoral institutions in established Western democracies. The second ballot of the 2016 Presidential election in Austria needed to be repeated because of inconsistencies in individual electoral districts (scandal districts). In particular, <b>postal</b> <b>votes</b> were counted carelessly. We use a difference-indifferences approach comparing the regular and the repeated round of the second ballot, and examine whether voter turnout, <b>postal</b> <b>voting,</b> invalid voting and the vote shares of the candidates changed in scandal districts. <b>Postal</b> <b>voting</b> declined, but the results do not show that districts with inconsistencies differ regarding voter turnout, <b>postal</b> <b>voting,</b> invalid voting, and vote shares of the candidates.
