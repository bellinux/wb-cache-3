5|$|With the {{enhanced}} {{features of the}} 32X, the developers were given more freedom in designing Knuckles' Chaotix compared to previous games. To {{take advantage of the}} more powerful hardware, several levels feature dynamic sprite-scaling effects, and the game's special stages were rendered with 3D polygons. A complex <b>palette</b> system was implemented as well, allowing each level to load its own unique <b>palette.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited <b>palette,</b> varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a <b>palette</b> knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo used {{a limited}} <b>palette</b> of {{pigments}} comprising lead white, azurite, verdigris and few others. He avoided ochres and used very little vermilion.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier <b>palette,</b> although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted <b>palette</b> to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E

Other themes in her work include the sand hills of the desert country.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of the original Mortal Kombat and its initial sequels were created using digitized sprites mostly based on filmed actors, as opposed to drawn graphics. Early Mortal Kombat games were known for their extensive use of <b>palette</b> swap, a practice of re-coloring certain sprites to appear as different characters which {{was used for the}} ninja characters. In fact, many of the most popular characters have originated as simple <b>palette</b> swaps. In the very first game, the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character; only the colors of their attire, fighting stance, and special techniques indicated the difference. Later games added other ninjas based on the same model, as well as several female ninja color swap characters initially also using just one base model (beginning with Kitana in Mortal Kombat II). All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} other modes: Color Edit, a <b>palette</b> swap editor {{that allows the}} player to customize nearly {{every aspect of the}} characters, including buckles and hair; Training, in which a player can practice with (and against) computer-controlled opponents and Arcade, similar to the survival mode featured in other fighting games.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the <b>palette.</b> Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game <b>palette,</b> which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E

5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film.

However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E

Persian-style colours used include lajvard (cobalt blue), firozi (cerulean), white, green, orange, yellow, and purple, while Persian-influenced motifs include star-shaped flowers and grapevines. The mosque also contains motifs of cypress trees, {{and is the}} first Mughal monument to have borrowed this motif from Persia.|$|E

5|$|Conceived in {{the wake}} of a series of {{distressing}} personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure for West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explored themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandoned conventional hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic <b>palette,</b> which included prominent use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his <b>palette</b> significantly brightened.|$|E
