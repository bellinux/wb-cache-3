5|$|In that situation, Levski's {{assistant}} Dimitar Obshti robbed an Ottoman postal convoy in the Arabakonak pass on 22 September 1872, without {{approval from}} Levski or {{the leadership of}} the movement. While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125,000 groschen, Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>investigation</b> and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation's size and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levski's leading role.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>preliminary</b> <b>investigation,</b> Geetha calls Georgekutty {{and family}} for questioning. Georgekutty, who had {{predicted}} {{that this would}} happen, had already taught his family how to change their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a <b>preliminary</b> <b>investigation,</b> Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E

5|$|Benbow's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He {{then moved}} to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he {{intermittently}} held {{for the next six}} years. He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord Torrington. He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage, and his evidence given in July 1690 to the <b>preliminary</b> <b>investigation</b> strongly favoured his old patron, Torrington. He did not however testify during Torrington's court-martial in December that year.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a <b>preliminary</b> <b>investigation,</b> Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements {{of the people who}} own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of the}} incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E
