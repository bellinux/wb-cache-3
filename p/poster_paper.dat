2500|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} (or dye-sub printer) is a {{computer}} printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or <b>poster</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised CMYK colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints.|$|E

The support structure can vary depending on size. Standard tradeshow display frames are often used, or it can be hung from or applied on a wall.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{workshop}} was to understand what effect circumstellar dust clouds will have on NASA's proposed Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission's ability to search for terrestrial-sized planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood. The workshop participants reviewed the properties of TPF, summarized {{what is known about}} the local zodiacal cloud and about exozodiacal clouds, and determined what additional knowledge must be obtained to help design TPF for maximum effectiveness within its cost constraint. Recommendations were made for ways to obtain that additional knowledge, at minimum cost. The workshop brought together approximately 70 scientists, from four different countries. The active participants included astronomers involved {{in the study of the}} local zodiacal cloud, in the formation of stars and planetary systems, and in the technologies and techniques of ground- and space-based infrared interferometry.

Games may require a few props such as sticky notes, <b>poster</b> <b>paper,</b> markers, random pictures from magazines, or thought provoking objects. Gamestorming skills include asking questions (opening, navigating, examining, experimenting, closing), structuring large diagrams, sketching ideas, fusing words and pictures into visual language, and most importantly, improvising to choose and lead a suitable game or invent a new one.|$|E

The styles can vary from abstract to trompe-l'≈ìil (a French term for [...] "fool" [...] or [...] "trick the eye"). Initiated by the works of mural artists like Graham Rust or Rainer Maria Latzke in the 1980s, trompe-l'oeil painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe.Today, the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to <b>poster</b> <b>paper</b> or canvas which is then pasted to a wall surface (see wallpaper, Frescography) to give the effect of either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.|$|E
