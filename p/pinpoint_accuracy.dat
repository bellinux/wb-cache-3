However, {{due to their}} sharing nature, SaaS clouds are vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this paper, we present IntTest, a scalable and effective service integrity attestation framework for SaaS clouds. IntTest provides a novel integrated attestation graph analysis scheme that can provide stronger attacker pinpointing power than previous schemes. Moreover, IntTest can automatically enhance result quality by replacing bad results produced by malicious attackers with good results produced by benign service providers. We have implemented a prototype of the IntTest system and tested it on a production cloud computing infrastructure using IBM System S stream processing applications. Our experimental results show that IntTest can achieve higher attacker <b>pinpointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> than existing approaches. IntTest does not require any special hardware or secure kernel support and imposes little performance impact to the application, which makes it practical for large-scale cloud systems...|$|R
25|$|Counter punchers are slippery, {{defensive}} style {{fighters who}} often {{rely on their}} opponent's mistakes {{in order to gain}} the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout.

A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks.

40|$|Active {{tracking}} of passive integrated transponder (PIT) -tags using portable antennae {{is becoming an}} increasingly common technique in fish habitat studies in shallow rivers. We carried out “blind testing” to test the efficacy (% tags found) and accuracy (distance between predicted and true tag location) of a portable antenna system (Texas Instruments) in winter conditions using 23 -mm PIT-tags. Up to 90 cm reading range was achieved and signals penetrated ice, rock, wood and water. In the “blind test” trials, {{a majority of the}} hidden tags (N = 12 – 30) were found indicating high tracking efficacy. PIT-tags that were oriented with their cylindrical axis parallel to the plane of the antenna coil inductor loop resulted in a bimodal detection field that had low detection range in the centre of the loop. The utilization of this bimodal detection field proved to be a very accurate method for identifying tag position (mean ± SE distance from predicted to true tag location 10. 9 ± 1. 4 cm) and thus well suited for microhabitat and activity studies in winter conditions. Aggregations of tags (multiple tags within 1 m 2) and obstacles for the antenna maneuvering (e. g., boulders, logjams) reduced the <b>pinpointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> (mean ± SE 13. 3 ± 1. 8 cm), but the reduction in accuracy was statistically non-significant between the single and aggregated tags...|$|R

Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography. Needham points out that the title of his book Flying Bird Calendar may have been a mistake, and that the book is more accurately entitled Bird's Eye Map. Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang's narrative [...] "Guitian fu" [...] contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of Confucius of the Zhou Dynasty, which Reiter suggests places maps (tu) on a same level of importance with documents (shu).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a lightweight probabilis-tic path authentication scheme for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) {{based upon a}} new cryptographic primitive composite MAC. The proposed path-authentication scheme allows us to reliably identify nodes on a route over which a sequence of packets traverses.

Furthermore, {{it allows us to}} detect, and up to a certain <b>accuracy</b> <b>pinpoint,</b> any misbehaving node that deviates from the correct forwarding behavior. In our scheme, composite MAC can have any length starting from one bit. This flexibility allows the proposed scheme to strike various trade-offs depending on the constraints imposed by the MANET and the desired security proper-ties. We provide an informal security analysis and argue that a short MAC can be sufficient to authenticate paths with high probability. I...|$|R

In attacking the failure of ‘sceptical deviancy theory’ to confront the wider structural sources of power and authority, its seeming inability to address gross social divisions of wealth and status, and its lack of attention to the larger political and economic interests that were embedded in departments of State and industrial and financial corporations alike, Gouldner <b>pinpointed</b> with some <b>accuracy</b> the radical motivations of the soon-to-emerge ‘new criminology’ – in both its ‘left idealist’ and ‘left realist’ guises.

40|$|Excessive {{rainfall}} events (e. g., "goose-drownders") {{that occur}} {{late in the}} growing season can cause flooding of rivers, creeks, and streams as well as ponded areas within fields distant from floodwaters. The consequences to grain yield and quality from {{the damage caused by}} such flooding/ponding are difficult to <b>pinpoint</b> with much <b>accuracy</b> because little research exists that addresses these chance-occurring yield-limiting factors. Risks and expectations, however, can be outlined.

Oxygen deprivation in saturated soils quickly causes significant deterioration and death of above- and below-ground plant tissue. Affected crops may only survive a few days with typical August temperatures. Further physical crop damage (soil erosion, washing away of plants, lodging of plants, and plant tissue damage) occurs from the force of the flowing water on land adjacent to flooded creeks and rivers as well as from any debris caught up in the floodwaters.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and {{evaluate}} the impact of two interventions, block scheduling and professional learning communities, on the academic achievement of English Language Learners (ELL) on the English language arts portion of the California Standards Test (CST). A nonequivalent independent groups design was used. A benchmark school was selected based on similar school characteristics and the pre and post intervention comparisons were made between the experimental school and benchmark school which had no treatment, but had historically outperformed the experimental school.; Participants in the study included the entire middle school population of 1, 072 students grades 6 - 8. The percentage of ELL students was 50 % of the entire population. The block schedule and professional learning communities began in August of 2007, the first day of school and continued through June of 2008. The primary findings would come from the student performance on the English language arts section of the CST that was administered in May 2008. Performance level data were coded on a scale of 0 - 4 for all students in grade 6 - 8.; A pre-post analysis of the experimental school indicated an increase on the English-language arts section of the CST for ELL students in grades 6 and 8. While 7 th grade did not increase, qualitative findings reflect that teachers implemented the multiple interventions at various levels of fidelity. The results also indicated a positive increase in the experimental school's Academic Performance Index (API) score for ELL students and students school wide.; When the experimental group was matched against the benchmark school, both schools had an 11 % increase the achievement of the ELL student on the CST. However, the benchmark school still outperformed the experimental school suggesting that the experimental school has room for considerable improvement.; This study only examined this research through the lens of the current California accountability system. It is still necessary for further research to be accomplished to <b>pinpoint</b> the <b>accuracy</b> of school achievement data for ELL student. In particular, longitudinal data is needed to track grade to grade student growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{achieving}} <b>pinpoint</b> landing <b>accuracy</b> in future space missions to extra-terrestrial bodies {{such as the}} Moon or Mars presents many challenges, including the requirements of higher accuracy and more flexibility. These new challenges may require the development of novel and more advanced guidance algorithms. Conventional guidance schemes, which generally require a combination of off-line trajectory generation and real-time, trajectory tracking algorithms, have worked well {{in the past but}} may not satisfy the more stringent and difficult landing requirements imposed by future mission architectures to bring landers very near to specified locations. In this paper, a novel non-linear guidance algorithm for planetary landing is proposed and analyzed. Based on Higher-Order Sliding Control (HOSC) theory, the Multiple Sliding Surface Guidance (MSSG) algorithms has been specifically designed {{to take advantage of the}} ability of the system to reach the sliding surface in a finite time. The high control activity seen in typical sliding controllers is avoided in this formulation, resulting in a guidance law that is both globally stable and robust against unknown, but bounded perturbations. The proposed MSSG does not require any off-line trajectory generation and therefore it is flexible enough to target a large variety of point on the planet’s surface without the need for calculation of multiple reference trajectories. However, after initial analysis, it has been seen that the performance of MSSG is very sensitive to the choice in guidance gains. MSSG generated trajectories have been compared to an optimal solution to begin an investigation of the relationship between the optimality and performance of MSSG and the selection of the guidance parameters. A full study has been performed to investigate and tune the parameters of MSSG utilizing reinforcement learning in order to truly optimize the performance of the MSSG algorithm. Results show that the MSSG algorithm can indeed generate trajectories that come very close to the optimal solution in terms of fuel usage. A full comparison of the trajectories is included, as well as a further study examining the capability of the MSSG algorithm under perturbed conditions using the optimized set of parameters...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{developments}} in fire sensor technology over the past ten years. Some, such as incipient smoke detection systems, have become readily available, while others remain in the research, pre-production, or newly released stage. This second group of sensors utilizes technologies ranging from optical fibers and wax, to integrated video and infrared sensors controlled by artificial intelligence algorithms. This paper presents an overview of several less known, yet promising, fire sensor technologies. Although it does not address specific applications, it illustrates the wide range solutions available for addressing a variety of fire detection needs. HEAT SENSOR DEVELOPMENTS There have been several developments in heat sensor technology in recent years. Two promising approaches are in the use of fiber optic cables as line-type heat de-tectors, and the detection of thermal fluc-tuations instead of temperature increase. Ericsson, a Swedish company, has devel-oped a very sensitive line type heat detec-tion system using laser and optical fiber technology. l The sensor cable can be up to 2 km long, and when the length of heated cable is at least 200 mm, the fire location can be <b>pinpointed</b> with an <b>accuracy</b> of about +/- 1 m. Up to 100 of these fire or overheat locations can be detected with the +/- 1 m accuracy as long as the separation between hot points is at least 3. 5 m. The activation temperature (alarm temperature) of the sensor is between 40 °C and 90 °C with a +/- 1 °C resolution. Although a specific ac-tivation temperature within this range can be selected, it is a function of the sensor materials, and is not currently field ad-justable. The sensor cable itself is composed of three primary components: an optical fiber, a wax-filled tube, and a protective covering material (jacket). The optical fi-ber is in parallel I with the wax filled tube, connected to it by an aramid thread (Figure 1). Utilizing an optical reflectom-etry technique, a short laser pulse is trans-mitted into the optical fiber 40, 000 times per second. As the light pulse travels at...|$|R
