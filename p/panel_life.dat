500|$|Although Brooks [...] "never meant" [...] {{to return}} to television, he was helping Tracey Ullman start The Tracey Ullman Show and when she could not find another producer, he stepped in. On the {{suggestion}} of friend and colleague Polly Platt, who gave Brooks the nine <b>panel</b> <b>Life</b> in Hell cartoon entitled [...] "The Los Angeles Way of Death" [...] which hangs outside Brooks' Gracie Films office, Brooks asked Life in Hell cartoonist Matt Groening to pitch {{an idea for a}} series of animated shorts to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his Life in Hell series. However, when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family in the lobby of Brooks' office. After the success of the shorts, the Fox Broadcasting Company in 1989 commissioned a series of half-hour episodes of the show, now called The Simpsons, which Brooks produced alongside Groening and Sam Simon. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. According to writer Jon Vitti, Brooks contributed more to the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute" [...] than to any other in the show's history. The Simpsons garnered critical and commercial acclaim, winning numerous awards and is still producing original content after 20 years. In a 1998 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, Time magazine named The Simpsons the century's best television series. In 1997, Brooks was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.|$|E

40|$|Inherited Retinal Degeneration (IRD) are a {{group of}} eye disorders, {{characterized}} by photoreceptors degeneration which include: Retinitis Pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, Usher Syndrome and Leber congenital amaurosis. The high genetic heterogeneity, the incompleteness of disease specific databases and the elevated number of genes involved in IRD, often hamper the correct molecular diagnosis and patients stratification.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented on fatigue crack growth behavior and fail safety of integral stringer panels typified by welded aircraft fabrications. The stringer panel {{is made of}} aluminum alloy 2024 -T 351 and fabricated by the variable-polarity plasma-arc welding process. The sample simulates {{a part of the}} lower-wing skin structures. Based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics, numerical simulations are performed for two configurations, two-stringer and nine-stringer panels, and three damage scenarios, in which welding-induced longitudinal residual stresses are taken into account. A typical load spectrum for large transport aircraft is employed for the analysis. For the two-stringer <b>panel</b> <b>life</b> predictions have a reasonably good correlation with the test results. Based on this validation, large-scale nine-stringer panels with three manufacture options, that is, riveted, integrally machined, and welded integral, are simulated for a skin crack under a broken central stringer propagating to two-bay length. Useful comparisons are made among the three variants. Finally, remedies to improve damage tolerance and fail safety of integral stringer panels are explored. The incorporation of crack retarder straps bonded to the inner surface of an integral panel has greatly improved the fail safety behavior of the component with dramatically increased crack growth live...|$|E
40|$|Over 95 % of all {{synovial}} sarcomas (SS) share {{a unique}} translocation, t(X; 18), however, they show heterogeneous clinical behavior. We analyzed multiple SS to reveal additional genetic alterations besides the translocation. Twenty-six SS from 22 patients were sequenced for 409 cancer-related genes using the Comprehensive Cancer <b>Panel</b> (<b>Life</b> Technologies, USA) on an Ion Torrent platform. The detected variants were verified by Sanger sequencing and compared to matched normal DNAs. Copy number variation was assessed in six tumors using the Oncoscan array (Affymetrix, USA). In total, eight somatic mutations were detected in eight samples. These mutations {{have not been}} reported previously in SS. Two of these, in KRAS and CCND 1, represent known oncogenic mutations in other malignancies. Additional mutations were detected in RNF 213, SEPT 9, KDR, CSMD 3, MLH 1 and ERBB 4. DNA alterations occurred more often in adult tumors. A distinctive loss of 6 q {{was found in a}} metastatic lesion progressing under pazopanib, but not in the responding lesion. Our results emphasize t(X; 18) as a single initiating event in SS and as the main oncogenic driver.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the development and implementation}} of an energy planning process in a Swedish municipality. This is a unique full scale test of the application of a number of tools for local planning and environmental assessments. The experiment is based on well-known theoretical knowledge and planning legislation as a “standard of good practice,” and involves a combination of analytical and procedural tools intended to aid decision-making: external scenarios, a citizens’ <b>panel,</b> <b>life</b> cycle analyses and qualitative environmental assessment. The implementation of the energy planning process illustrates that it is important to appoint a municipal work group to lead the process and be the driving force throughout the process. Furthermore, the application of this combination of tools suggests that they contribute substantially to the quality of the energy planning process, but that it is complicated to combine several different decision-making tools. The planning model needs further simplification before it can be used as a standard of good practice by practitioners.

40|$|The {{sampling}} procedure {{presented in this}} paper was used to collect panel data and {{it is based on the}} following rotation design. The <b>panel</b> <b>life</b> of the sample elements corresponds to their natural life. At different points of time, the deaths and outmigrants leave the panel; new elements are added, selecting them from the births and immigrants. Therefore, the rotation depends on “random” natural events, such as births and deaths, immigration and outmigration. The resulting panel should incorporate the target population dynamics and increase its representativeness. The unmatched and matched portions of successive samples provide estimates of the births, y(bt), and the continuing population, y(mt). In the matched portion, the doublesampling regression estimate is generally used, y’(mt). The best combined estimate of Y(t) is found by weighting y’(bt) and y’(mt) inversely as their variances (Cochran, 1977; Patterson, 1950). If y(bt) is systematically lower than y’(mt), then the doublesampling regression estimate does not work well. Alternative weights are the proportions of the births and the total units of population at time t. The matched portion may be estimated by a simple autoreressive model. This sampling design was applied to the administrative data of the National Institute of Social Security (INPS: Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale) for the years from 1982 to 1988, relative to the Province of Modena. The estimates of the population mean, total, and unit seemed to be satisfactory, as did their variances...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{real-time}} PCR (QRT-PCR) {{has been}} widely implemented for clinical viral load testing, but a lack of standardization and relatively poor precision have hindered its usefulness. Digital PCR offers highly precise, direct quantification without re-quiring a calibration curve. Performance characteristics of real-time PCR were compared to those of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for cytomegalovirus (CMV) load testing. Tenfold serial dilutions of theWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) CMV quantitative standards were tested, together with the AcroMetrix CMV tc <b>panel</b> (<b>Life</b> Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 50 human plasma specimens. Eachmethod was evaluated using all three standards for quantitative linearity, lower limit of detection (LOD), and accuracy. Quantitative correlation, mean viral load, and variability were compared. Real-time PCR showed somewhat higher sensitivity than ddPCR (LODs, 3 log 10 versus 4 log 10 cop-ies/ml and IU/ml for NIST andWHO standards, respectively). Both methods showed {{a high degree of}} linearity and quantitative correlation for standards (R 2 > 0. 98 in each of 6 regressionmodels) and clinical samples (R 2 0. 93) across their detectable ranges. For higher concentrations, ddPCR showed less variability than QRT-PCR for theWHO standards and AcroMetrix stan-dards (P< 0. 05). QRT-PCR showed less variability and greater sensitivity than did ddPCR in clinical samples. Both digital and real-time PCR provide accurate CMV load data over a wide linear dynamic range. Digital PCRmay provide an opportunity to reduce the quantitative variability currently seen using real-time PCR, but methods need to be further optimized to match the sensitivity of real-time PCR...|$|E
