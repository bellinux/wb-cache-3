40|$|Background:Public {{programs}} offering {{summer jobs}} {{to smooth the}} transition from school to work is commonplace. However, the empirical support for summer jobs is limited. This article exploits the availability of registered individual information and random allocation to summer jobs to provide empirical evidence on this issue. Objectives:To identify the effect of summer job programs on the <b>post-schooling</b> incomes of the intended participants. Also to identify the effect of sophomore girlsâ€™ high school work experience on their <b>post-schooling</b> incomes. Research Design:In this article, 1, 447 sophomore girls from 1997 to 2003 are followed 5 â€“ 12 years after graduation. They all applied to Falun municipalityâ€™s (Sweden) summer job program, and about 25 % of them were randomly allotted a job. The random allocation to a summer job is used to identify the causal effect of sophomore girlsâ€™ high school income on their <b>post-schooling</b> incomes. Subjects:All the 1, 447 sophomore girls who applied to Falun municipalityâ€™s summer job program during 1997 â€“ 2003. Measures:Annual <b>post-schooling</b> income is used as an outcome measure. The work experience of girls in high school is also {{measured in terms of}} total income while in high school. Results:The program led to a substantially larger accumulation of income during high school as well as 19 % higher <b>post-schooling</b> incomes. The high school income led to a <b>post-schooling</b> income elasticity of 0. 37 which is, however, potentially heterogeneous with regard to academic ability. Conclusions:Both the program effect and the causal effect of high school income on <b>post-schooling</b> incomes were substantial and statistically significant. experimental data; work experience; work while in school; selection bia...|$|R

40|$|Most {{investigations}} into the importance and determinants of adult cognitive skills assume that (1) they are produced primarily by schooling, and (2) schooling is statistically predetermined or exogenous. This study uses longitudinal data collected in Guatemala over 35 years to investigate production functions for adult cognitive skills—that is, reading-comprehension skills and nonverbal cognitive skills—as being dependent on behaviorally determined preschooling, schooling, and <b>post-schooling</b> experiences. We use an indicator of whether the child was stunted (child height-for-age Z-score < – 2) as our representation of preschooling experiences, and we use tenure in skilled occupations as our representation of <b>post-schooling</b> experiences. The results indicate that assumptions (1) and (2) lead to a substantial overemphasis on schooling and an underemphasis on pre- and <b>post-schooling</b> experiences. The magnitudes {{of the effects of}} these pre- and <b>post-schooling</b> experiences are large. For example, the impact on reading-comprehension scores of not being stunted at age 6 is equivalent to the impact of four grades of schooling. These findings also have other important implications. For example, they (1) reinforce the importance of early life investments; (2) point to limitations in using adult schooling to represent human capital in the cross-country growth literature; (3) support the importance of childhood nutrition and work complexity in explaining the “Flynn effect,” or the substantial increases in measured cognitive skills over time; and (4) lead to doubts about the interpretations of studies that report productivity impacts of cognitive skills without controlling for skill endogeneity.

To test these hypotheses, this paper carefully develops various measures of risk and skewness by occupational/educational classification of the worker and finds supportive evidence: wages rise with occupational earnings variance and decrease with skewness. In order to identify the discount rate and the degree of risk aversion, we also apply structural modelling of education and occupational choice and allow for non-lognormal wage distributions...|$|R
