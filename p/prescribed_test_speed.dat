40|$|The {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} polycarbonate was studied {{as a function}} of temperature (- 80 °C to + 80 °C) and <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> (10 - 5 to 10 m/s) using an instrumented, singleedged, notched tensile test (SENT). SENT tests give information on the fracture stress, fracture displacements, and fracture energies of polycarbonate, and from these data the average crack speeds were calculated and the brittle-ductile transitions were determined. The fracture stress and the fracture energies of ductile fracturing samples increased with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> The fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron analysis, and sometimes a mixed mode fracture, part ductile and part brittle, could be seen. At high <b>test</b> <b>speeds,</b> a sharp brittle-ductile transition was observed, while at low <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> the transition was more gradual, via a mixed mode region. This mixed mode region decreased in size with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> and was absent at the higher <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The average crack speeds in the ductile region were directly related to the <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The brittle-ductile transition temperature increased with the logarithmic of the <b>test</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene–EPDM blends were {{prepared}} on a twin screw extruder {{with a rubber}} content 0 – 40 vol%. On these materials the yield strength and the notched tensile behaviour was studied as function of <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> (10 − 4 – 10 m/s). With an infrared temperature camera the heat development in the notched samples is studied as function of <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> On fractured materials {{the structure of the}} deformation zone is studied {{in the middle of the}} sample, perpendicular to the fracture plane. The yield strength increases with the strain rate and at high rates this increase is stronger. The fracture energy shows a complex relationship with <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> At low <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> the fracture energy decreases rapidly with <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> At intermediate <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> however the fracture energy increases with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> On the micrographs of the high speed deformed samples the formation of a melt zone was observed. The temperature rise in the notched samples starts at approximately 10 − 5 m/s, and increases almost linearly with the logarithm of the <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> At 10 m/s a surface temperature increase to 90 °C was observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the rubber {{particle}} size and rubber content on the fracture behaviour of polypropylene–EPR blends was studied at low and high <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The particle size was varied by changing the molecular weight of the EPR phase, and ranged from about 0. 5 to around 4. 0 μm. The fracture behaviour was determined {{as a function of}} temperature by the notched Izod impact <b>test</b> (high <b>test</b> <b>speed)</b> and by a tensile test on notched Izod bars at 1 mm/s (low <b>test</b> <b>speed).</b> At high <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> the brittle–ductile transition temperature (Tbd) increases with increasing particle size. At low <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> the Tbd decreases slightly with increasing particle size. The weight average particle size gave a better correlation with the notched Izod results than the number average particle size. This suggests that the larger particles initiate the fracture more easily...|$|R

40|$|Acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene was blended in {{polycarbonate}} using a twin-screw extruder, producing dispersed and co-continuous blends. The blends were {{injection moulded}} into test bars. These materials {{were tested in}} single edge notch tensile tests {{as a function of}} <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> over a <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> range of 10 − 4 – 10 m s− 1 (2. 85 × 10 − 3 – 2. 85 × 102 s− 1). Infrared measurements were made to monitor the temperature development in the material during fracture. The fracture energies were higher at high <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> than could be expected based on the low speeds results. This effect was due to an increased fracture stress, initiation strain, and propagation strain. With infrared measurements a temperature increase of 30 – 40 °C was observed. Also the size of the deformation zone increased with <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> A possible explanation is a thermal blunting resulting from adiabatic heating at high speeds. The brittle–ductile transition temperature increased linearly with the logarithm of the strain rate by a factor of 18. 6. At high <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> the brittle–ductile transition developed with the formation of shear lips...|$|R

The seals were tested at a constant face load of 73 N (16. 4 lb) with ambient air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure as the fluid medium. The <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> range was from 7000 to 17, 000 rpm. The measured film thickness was compared with theoretical data from mathematical models. The mathematical models overpredicted the measured film thickness at the lower <b>speeds</b> of the <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> range and underpredicted the measured film thickness at the higher <b>speeds</b> of the <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> range...|$|R
40|$|A {{new kind}} of joint {{specimen}} has been developed to load the adhesive in pure shear on impact. The specimen is tested with three adhesives at five layer thicknesses, and at three <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> From these <b>tests</b> {{it can be concluded}} that the rod-ring specimen is suitable for use in impact <b>tests</b> at high <b>speeds</b> and for comparing impact tests with static tests. Owing to lateral contraction the specimen does not give the desired pure shear. Increasing the load speed causes an increase in energy absorption. A tough adhesive shows a larger energy absorption at impact than a brittle adhesive. There are optimum adhesive thicknesses at different <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> These thicknesses depend both on the adhesive used and on the <b>test</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R

40|$|Solder joint {{reliability}} {{concerns are}} increasing exponentially with the continuous push for device miniaturization, and the expanded use in portable electronic products. In order {{to predict the}} solder joint reliability under drop conditions, {{it is important to}} increase the <b>testing</b> <b>speed</b> of package level test methods, such as high-speed solder ball shear and pull. Traditional ball shear and pull tests are not considered suitable for evaluation of joint reliability under drop loading, since the applied <b>test</b> <b>speeds,</b> usually lower than 5 mm/s, are well below the impact velocity applied to the solder joint in a drop test. Recently, high-speed shear and pull test equipment (Dage 4000 HS) with <b>testing</b> <b>speeds</b> beyond 1, 000 mm/s has become available. The present study continues the efforts reported recently and investigates the effect of thermal aging on the attachment strength and fracture energy of SnAgCu lead-free solder balls during high <b>speed</b> ball shear/pull <b>tests.</b> The ball shear <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 100 mm/s to 1, 000 mm/s, while the ball pull <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 5 mm/s to 100 mm/s. The test specimens were aged at 125 °C or 150 °C for durations of 100, 300 and 500 hrs, with some additional samples exposed up to 1, 000 hrs. Correlations were established between solder joint fracture force/energy and IMC thickness, and between fracture energy and failure mode. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Wafer bonding {{is a key}} {{technology}} in the manufacturing of microelectronic and micromechanical systems on industrial scale. Especially glass frit bonding is often used for t he encapsulation of MEMS devices on wafer level. To ensure the reliability of these bonds and to prevent critical failure of the systems, characteristic mechanical properties of the bonded interface are required. The fracture toughness and the shear strength are suitable values to characterize the bonding strength and can be determined by micro chevron and shear testing. They depend on the bonding parameters {{as well as the}} <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> Due to the correlation between measured bonding strength and <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> a maximum <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> has to be identified to obtain reliable failure criteria regarding the fracture toughness and the shear strength...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} brittle solder joint failure mechanisms during high-speed solder ball shear and pull testing. BGA package samples with different solder alloys (Sn 4. 0 %Ag 0. 5 %Cu and Sn 37 %Pb) were fabricated {{and a series}} of solder ball shear and pull tests were conducted at various <b>testing</b> <b>speeds.</b> The ball shear <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 10 mm/s to 3000 mm/s, while the ball pull <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 5 mm/s to 500 mm/s. Following high-speed shear/pull testing, the brittle fracture surfaces of the solder balls and corresponding pad were inspected using SEM/EDX. The results describe an increased incidence of brittle interfacial fracture for SnAgCu solder compared to SnPb solder. Microstructure analysis of brittle solder joint fracture surfaces appears an effective method to aid correlation between board level drop test and high-speed solder ball shear/pull tests...|$|R

40|$|The Rolling Dynamic Deflectometer (RDD) was {{developed}} by the researchers at The University of Texas at Austin in the late 1990 s. It has been used in many project-level pavement studies in Texas. The current <b>testing</b> <b>speed</b> of the RDD is limited to 1 mph (1. 6 km/hr) using first-generation rolling sensors.

40|$|Background: Many commencing junior doctors {{worldwide}} feel ill-prepared to {{deal with}} their new responsibilities, particularly prescribing. Simulation has been widely utilised in medical education, but the use of extended multi-method simulation to emulate the junior doctor experience has rarely been reported. Methods: A randomised controlled trial compared students who underwent two, week-long, extended simulations, several months apart (Intervention), with students who attended related workshops and seminars alone (Control), for a range of outcome measures. Results: Eighty-four third year students in a graduate-entry medical program were randomised, and 82 completed the study. At {{the end of the first}} week, Intervention students scored a mean of 75 % on a <b>prescribing</b> <b>test,</b> compared with 70 % for Control students (P = 0. 02) and Intervention teams initiated cardiac compressions a mean of 29. 1 seconds into a resuscitation test scenario, compared with 70. 1 seconds for Control teams (P < 0. 01). At the beginning of the second week, an average of nine months later, a significant difference was maintained in relation to the <b>prescribing</b> <b>test</b> only (78 % vs 70 %, P < 0. 01). At the end of the second week, significant Intervention vs Control differences were seen on knowledge and reasoning <b>tests,</b> a further <b>prescribing</b> <b>test</b> (71 % vs 63 % [P < 0. 01]) and a paediatric resuscitation scenario test (252 seconds to initiation of fluid resuscitation vs 339 seconds [P = 0. 05]). Conclusions: The study demonstrated long-term retention of improved prescribing skills, and an immediate effect on knowledge acquisition, reasoning and resuscitation skills, from contextualising learning activities through extended multi-method simulation.
