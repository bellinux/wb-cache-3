5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an {{infinite}} number of <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two <b>possible</b> <b>values,</b> in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
50|$|Since the sin2 {{function}} is always greater than zero, u2 {{is the largest}} <b>possible</b> <b>value</b> of u and the inverse of the smallest <b>possible</b> <b>value</b> of r, i.e., the distance of closest approach (periapsis). Since the radial distance r cannot be a negative number, neither can its inverse u; therefore, u2 must be a positive number. If u1 is also positive, it is the smallest <b>possible</b> <b>value</b> of u, which corresponds to the largest <b>possible</b> <b>value</b> of r, the distance of furthest approach (apoapsis). If u1 is zero or negative, then the smallest <b>possible</b> <b>value</b> of u is zero (the orbit goes to infinity); in this case, the only relevant values of φ are those that make u positive.|$|R

5|$|This form of Cotes's spirals {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the two Poinsot's spirals (Figure 8). The <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> of λ range from zero to infinity, which {{corresponds to}} values of μ greater than the positive number L12/m. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that L is not too large for the given μ.|$|E
5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E
5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E

25|$|This {{is useful}} in {{computer}} science since most data structures have members with 2X <b>possible</b> <b>values.</b> For example, a byte has 256 (28) <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> (0–255). Therefore, to fill a byte or bytes with random values a random number generator which produces values 1–256 can be used, the byte taking the output value −nbsp&1. Very large Fermat primes are of particular interest in data encryption for this reason. This method produces only pseudorandom values as, after Pnbsp&−nbsp&1 repetitions, the sequence repeats. A poorly chosen multiplier can result in the sequence repeating sooner than Pnbsp&−nbsp&1.|$|E

25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a probability}} density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value {{at any given}} sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> taken by the random variable) {{can be interpreted as}} providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample. In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample.|$|E
