The company had revenues of $70 million in 1985, and Esselte Pendaflex paid $40 million for it. That year, Esselte Pendaflex also acquired a Los Angeles firm called Universal Paper Goods.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{expenditure}} on private consumption rose more rapidly than incomes because private households continued to spend {{in spite of the}} reticent development of incomes. As a consequence, the propensity to save declined and remained at a steady low level {{in the first half of}} 2002. Nevertheless, spending on consumption exceeded the actual level of the previous year by just 0. 2 percent. One major reason for this was the slack growth of incomes, faltering under the effects of a cyclical downturn, which could not be compensated by the introduction of the child-care benefit. The growth of consumption being mediocre at best is due mainly to the demand for durable goods (cars, furniture, jewellery, electric and electronic equipment), which is highly responsive to the business cycle, falling below the level of the first half of 2001 by 2. 2 percent. Demand for such goods sagged as a consequence of general income developments and the resistance to purchases in private households in connection with labour market developments. Demand also appears to have been stymied by the introduction of euro cash (which resulted in purchases advanced to the fourth quarter of 2001 and weak demand after the end of the double <b>price</b> <b>marking</b> period). Demand for non-durable goods and services (food, heating, rental, etc.), which constitutes a stabilising element in consumer demand in general and which changes little in the course of a business cycle, slightly rose in the second half of 2002 (by 0. 6 percent). Weak demand on the part of consumers also affected retailing. According to Statistics Austria, retailing sales (at constant prices and excluding motor vehicles) stagnated in the first six months of 2002 at the previous year's level. Growth during the double <b>price</b> <b>marking</b> phase was cancelled out by a subsequent decline. Even when seasonally adjusted, demand dropped once the double <b>price</b> <b>marking</b> phase had expired. On average in July and August, real retail sales once again topped those of the previous year (by 1. 5 percent), raising hope in retailers for this year's Christmas business. Christmas is gradually losing its former importance as a sales prop, mostly because of rising affluence, greater variation in the dates for paying the Christmas bonus, changes in consumer behaviour (holiday trips taken around Christmas, consciously refraining from giving presents), lower birth rates (Christmas as a the celebration of and by children), and less piety (problem of identifying with the religious occasion). Yet it is still of eminent importance to some sectors of the economy, as evidenced by peak sales in December. According to the WIFO models, Christmas-driven retail sales (defined as that part of the December sales in excess of "normal" sales), should arrive at and may perhaps even surpass, the previous year's level in real terms.

40|$|The {{starting}} point of the paper is in theoretical conception of value-chain which declares interrelated series of belonging valuing activities (primary and secondary). Systematically settled and distinct structure of chain represents very good basis for analyzing diverse economic industries like trade. All activities do not provide same contribution to the chain's margin, for that reason {{it is interesting to}} explore firstly those who are key for achieving competitive position of retailer in relation to other participants of distribution, and secondly separate those which are related to business logistics. Theoretical approach groundwork is theory of competition, and practical groundwork is concerning with retail structure. Paper will examine the links between business logistic in value-chain and competition among retailers. Results may show which primary logistics activities retailer should give more importance when consider about their competitive position and put them on strategic level. The need for exploring such a problem emerges from current fierce specialization in trade, especially retailing. The need is to determine which logistics jobs should be considered as a core business of retailer. It is assumed that those are the jobs which are not possible to reassign to other distribution actors, at least not in significant range, and in that scope it can be seen jobs like supervising goods, put gods in order, cashier jobs, receiving and storing goods and <b>price</b> <b>marking</b> jobs, selling raw food and dishes. value-chain, competition, logistics jobs, retailing. ...|$|E
40|$|The C 4 sales {{logistics}} rationalization subproject within stage II of {{the integrated}} materials handling systems research project {{was dedicated to}} the investigation, implementation and testing of the combination of individual sales-optimized logistics components and their central control system integration with regard to optimum materials flow and operational strategies. The concept developed by Fraunhofer-Institut (IML) and the Digitron company was designed for a closed electronic information flow and a continuous mechanization of the arrangement of goods in shelves. A container (goods shelf) for use by manufacturers, intermediate dealers and retailers was developed. Considering materials-flow and control functions such as transport, transshipment (commissioning), storage, and information acquisition and control, a mobile rack for goods shelves, a load suspension device for shelf insertion and removal {{by means of a}} shelf controller, and continuous data processing concepts were designed and developed. To test the functions and support marketing of the developed system the entire goods and information flow was modeled by means of a prototype. The project results have been contributing to major improvements in sales logistics rationalization. These improvements comprise the reduction of steps required to arrange goods in shelves, the automation and standardization of supply depot <b>price</b> <b>marking</b> procedures, interim storage and provision, electronic information and control systems for processing time and error source reduction, {{and the development of a}} low-cost storage system.
