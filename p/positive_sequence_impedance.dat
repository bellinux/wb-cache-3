Conventional out of step protection schemes are usually based on <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> at the relay location. PMUs provide an added advantage of phase angle measurements which can be useful in designing out of step protection by adding fast communication systems. Different schemes for out-of-step protection by taking advantage of phase angle differences using synchrophasor measurements are presented in [73, 74]. These schemes include detecting out-of-step protection based on RT swing curves and RT extended equal area criterion. The concept of adaptive out-of-step {{protection is}} implemented at the Florida-Georgia interface using synchrophasor measurements [75]. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO, Japan) implemented a predictive out-of-step protection system based on phase differences between power centers using the RT phasor measurement principle [76]. A combined out-of-step prediction and relay blocking scheme is presented in [77]. This scheme uses line end PMU inputs for detecting vulnerable relays and blocking their zone 1 trip for a limited time interval before ingression into zone 1.|$|E
40|$|This thesis Is {{concerned}} with {{the application of a}} small general purpose digital computer to the protection of transmission lines in modern high voltage substations. A model transmission line and data handling system have been built to enable fault waveforms to be analysed by computer in real time; the computer used was the DEC PDP- 8. Using impedance-type relaying principles, two techniques have been developed for the protection of transmission lines. The first method utilizes "table look-up" principles. This enables a fast calculation of impedance, however accuracy is not adequate. The second method, "peak-determination", uses a predictive calculation of peak fault current and voltage from a small number of samples. The accuracies are ± 10 $ for impedance modulus, ± 15 ° for impedance phase; these values are available 5 msec, after fault occurrence. The latter method has been extended to protect a three phase transmission line. The programme used to perform this detects the presence of a disturbance, derives an equivalent single phase relaying quantity dependent on fault type, and finally calculates the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of the line. The method is shown to be suitable for extension to use in a multi-line situation. Some computer specifications are outlined for this task...|$|E

Particularly, in [21, 22], the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> model is proposed in a static frame and then can be applied in stability analysis. In [22], an impedance-based stability analysis method is studied initially for a grid-connected inverter working under unbalanced grid voltage. However, the method in this paper neglects the coupling effects between the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> <b>impedances.</b> Knowing the <b>sequence</b> admittance of a VSC under sustained grid faults is helpful for judging {{the stability of the}} grid-connected converter system [23, 24]. It is also helpful for the design of the control system and for admittance shaping to manage power quality of the converter [25, 26, 27]. Therefore, the harmonic linearization method should be improved for unbalanced situations.|$|R

The proposed algorithm is different for phase-to-phase short circuits and for phase-to-earth short circuits in power lines. In the former case, iterative calculations are made with complex quantities, using the known <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> of a remote system; in the latter – with real numbers using the known zero sequence impedances of this system. In both cases, the ratio of phase conductor active resistance/line positive sequence reactance {{and the fact that}} the fault resistance is a real quantity are taken into account in the proposed algorithms. As a result of calculations, the positive sequence reactance from monitoring point to fault place and the fault resistance are obtained. Such an approach to the problem exerts influence on the shape of quadrilateral zone characteristics of distance protection. The right-side boundary of the protection operation zone can be set vertical (not tilted as it is now), the setting of this boundary can be common for all operation zones, each zone having only its own reactance setting, thus making unnecessary the load ingression feature in the distance protection. For radial lines, the same quantities are calculated using simpler mathematical expressions...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of transmission line (TL) impedance parameters helps to improve accuracy in relay settings and power flow modeling. To improve TL parameter estimates, various algorithms {{have been proposed}} {{in the past to}} identify TL parameters based on measurements from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). These methods are based on the positive sequence TL models and can generate accurate <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance</b> parameters for a fully-transposed TL when measurement noise is absent; however these methods may generate erroneous parameters when the TLs are not fully transposed or when measurement noise is present. PMU field-measure data are often corrupted with noise and this noise is problematic for all parameter identification algorithms, particularly so when applied to short transmission lines. This paper analyzes the limitations of the positive sequence TL model when used for parameter estimation of TLs that are untransposed and proposes a novel method using linear estimation theory to identify TL parameters more reliably. This method can be used for the most general case: short or long lines that are fully transposed or untransposed and have balanced or unbalance loads. Besides the positive or negative sequence impedance parameters, the proposed method {{can also be used to}} estimate the zero sequence parameters and the mutual impedances between different sequences. This paper also examines the influence of noise in the PMU data on the calculation of TL parameters. Several case studies are conducted based on simulated data from ATP to validate the effectiveness of the new method. Through comparison of the results generated by this novel method and several other methods, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated...|$|E

For example, in general a generator will have different <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance,</b> and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.|$|R

However, {{in the case of}} grid-tied voltage source converter (VSC) systems, dq impedances of source and load (VSC) subsystems are typically Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems in which case the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC) is required for analyzing the closed loop stability, which increases the complexity of the analysis.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of EngineeringTransmission {{lines are}} a vital yet often over {{simplified}} component {{in a power}} system. While digital power system models use impedance values to represent both the balanced and unbalanced states of a transmission line, these values are obtained from formulas using many simplifying assumptions. These values serve as accurate representations of a transmission line within {{the constraints of the}} assumptions. However, when conditions exist in a transmission line that are not accounted for in the modeling assumptions, significant error can result. Synchronized phasor measurement is a proven technology that has the ability to measure power system parameters and perform calculations in real time at speeds that were previously not possible. These real time calculations can be used to validate power system models, and predict dangerous transmission line conditions as system loading changes. Additionally, if transmission lines are closely monitored in real time, the ability to dynamically rate the transmission line's capacity becomes possible. This thesis work focuses on the use of a simplified calculation to determine transmission line <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance.</b> The benefit of using simplified calculations is that real time information can be analyzed without the additional overhead of processing vast amounts of historical data sets and critical loading events can be identified in time to take corrective action. Through the use of a minimal sample interval where all measurements represent the same system conditions, existing statistical methods may be readily applied and actual line parameters determined. As such, this work will focus strongly on quantifying the minimum sample interval and calculating actual positive sequence line parameters...|$|E

At the core of these methods lies the impedance modeling, which can either be obtained through analytical calculations, simulations, or measurements. The impedance models can be obtained into two main domains: the dq-domain and the sequence domain. In the dq-domain, the impedance model is a 2 × 2 matrix, while in the sequence domain, it is composed by the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> <b>impedance.</b> Recently, a third domain called the modified sequence domain was defined as an extension to the sequence domain, but also with clear similarities to the dq-domain. The objective {{of this paper is}} to unambiguously relate to each other the impedances in these three domains, and to show how this equivalence translates into their respective stability assessments. It is also proven that the <b>sequence</b> domain <b>impedance</b> has the same marginal stability condition as the dq-domain impedance matrix. The three-phase voltage source converter is used as an example converter in this paper, as its impedance model in all three domains is well established and reported by previous research. The results in this paper show that the modified sequence domain model can be derived from the dq-domain model (and vice versa), and that the stability analysis will be identical in these two domains. It is also shown how the original sequence domain model can be derived from the two other models through a model reduction. However, a small discrepancy between the two Nyquist plots is observed in the presence of components such as phase-locked loop or dc-link control...|$|R

This highlights the importance of using reliable procedures in order to compute these impedances since, up to now, their computations are based on simplified formulae. In this paper, results of some measurement campaigns have been compared with both simplified IEC formulae and advanced matrix procedures based on Multiconductor Cell Analysis (MCA) [1, 2, 3, 4]. MCA considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. One of the advantages of the MCA is the possibility of supplying the cable system with three sequence voltage phasors and of computing the ratios between voltage and current phasors for each phase.

Even if an insulated cable is cross-bonded with PTs (or in trefoil arrangement) there could be causes of asymmetry: 	minor sections with different lengths, so that the induced currents in the screens are not zeroed; 	the presence of joint chambers and terminals which introduce a flat arrangement and a consequent asymmetry; 	crossings of possible interfering services or natural obstacles usually overcome by means of directional drillings which can introduce a great spacing between the cables.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 High voltage {{transmission}} system availability and system security are key performance criteria for electricity utilities worldwide. System disturbances {{need to be}} cleared quickly and accurately in order to minimise the impact of faults and to facilitate speedy system restoration. In this context, the South African utility, Eskom has maintained a process of refreshing protective relaying technology as older equipment becomes obsolete {{and is no longer}} capable of meeting the utility’s requirements. The difficulties which a process of equipment renewal presents the organisation with include the risk of incorrectly applying the newer technologies within the complex electrical network. The application of new technology is affected by the complexities of the newer technology with respect to the older, more familiar technologies. Some of the difficulties can be addressed with revised commissioning procedures or the use of modern test equipment. Enhanced relay algorithms and settings calculation methodologies can however not be simplified. Protective relay maloperations cannot always be completely avoided and when they do occur, these must be investigated and addressed to prevent future recurrences. The research covered by this dissertation focuses on a number of protective relay maloperations on transmission lines using impedance protection algorithms. The research undertaken identifies the previously unidentified causes of the maloperations and describes a relay settings solution for improving the accuracy of the protective relays. The methodology that was followed in the research covers the following aspects: • Identification and highlighting of some of the protection relay maloperations that occurred during system faults, • Review of the fundamental principles involved in system fault analysis, • Comprehensive study of the theory involved in the calculation of an overhead line conductor self and mutual-inductance, as well as the calculation of the positive, negative and zero <b>sequence</b> <b>impedances</b> of an overhead line, • Brief evaluation of the effect of load impedance on relay measurements and the impact on fault clearing operation, • Analysis of the theoretical operation of various numerical relays during singlephase- to-earth faults in radial and meshed (complex) network conditions, • Mathematical calculations using typical Newton-Raphson methods to study the impact of resistive single-phase-to-earth faults on the voltage and current measurements at the relaying position with the exclusion of the capacitive components between conductors and conductors and earth, • Comparison and evaluation of mathematical calculations and system studies using network simulation software which included all steady state network parameters, • Review and analysis of actual system faults that had been previously analysed without definitive conclusion. The faults were re-analysed in an attempt to correlate findings with the hypothesis of the research, • Comparison of the performance of protective relay <b>impedance</b> charactersitics using <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> domain versus loop domain analysis techniques. This study concluded that significant benefits can be achieved by analysing system faults and relay operation using loop quantities in primary impedance values as opposed to <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> or apparent <b>impedance</b> quantities in secondary values. The inherent differences between the positive or apparent impedance characteristics of the relays are nullified when considered in the loop impedance domain, provided that the relays reach settings were calculated correctly. The study also showed that load current cannot be ignored when calculating settings as it has significant impact on the actual impedance measured during fault conditions. It is therefore crucial that when relays from different manufacturers are being used to protect the same circuit that the differences between the relays and the subsequent measurements are clearly understood and compensated for. Finally relay setting changes have been proposed for implementation based on the findings of this research. The combination of the theory, network simulations and secondary injections performed on the relays all correlate and therefore validate the research. It is left for the utility and or users of these relays to evaluate the results of this research and implement the necessary changes as applicable. Master...|$|R
