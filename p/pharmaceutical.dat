40|$|International audienceVeterinary <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> {{widely used}} in {{intensive}} livestock production, may contaminate surface waters. Identifying their sources and pathways in watersheds is difficult because i) most veterinary <b>pharmaceuticals</b> are used in human medicine as well and ii) septic or sewer wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) can release <b>pharmaceuticals</b> into surface water, even in agricultural headwater watersheds. This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of animal-specific, mixed-use, and human-specific <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> from agricultural headwaters with intensive livestock production and a WWTP to a watershed used for Water Framework Directive monitoring. Grab sampling was performed during one hydrological year upstream and downstream from a WWTP and at three dates in seven nested watersheds with areas of 1. 9 - 84. 1 km 2. Twenty <b>pharmaceuticals</b> were analyzed. Animal-specific <b>pharmaceuticals</b> were detected at all sampling dates upstream and downstream from the WWTP and at concentrations {{higher than those of}} human-specific <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> The predominance of animal-specific and mixed-use <b>pharmaceuticals</b> vs. human-specific <b>pharmaceuticals</b> observed at these sampling points was confirmed at the other sampling points. Animal-specific <b>pharmaceuticals</b> were detected mainly during runoff events and periods of manure spreading. A large percentage of mixed-use <b>pharmaceuticals</b> could come from animal sources, but it was difficult to determine. Mixed-use and human-specific <b>pharmaceuticals</b> predominated in the largest watersheds when runoff decreased. In areas of intensive livestock production, mitigation actions should focus on agricultural headwater watersheds to decrease the number of pathways and the transfer volume of veterinary <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> which can be the main contaminant...|$|R
