During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable <b>political</b> <b>problem.</b> Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E

Chapters five and six deal with the activities of many groups, crises, military coups, and civil war.

25|$|James VI's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, was {{considered}} a plausible successor to the English throne. At the beginning of Elizabeth's reign she sent ambassadors to England when a parliament was summoned, anticipating a role for parliament in settling the succession in her favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and her proximity to the succession {{was a factor in}} plotting, making her position a <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> for the English government, eventually resolved by judicial means. She was executed in 1587. In that year Mary's son James reached the age of twenty-one, while Arbella was only twelve.|$|E

James's greatest <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> was his Catholicism, which left him alienated from both parties in England. The low church Whigs had failed in their attempt to pass the Exclusion Bill to exclude James from the throne between 1679 and 1681, and James's supporters were the high church Anglican Tories. In Scotland, his supporters in the Parliament of Scotland stepped up attempts to force the Covenanters to renounce their faith and accept episcopalian rule of the church by the monarch.|$|E

500|$|Early Restoration Movement leaders {{varied in}} {{their views of}} slavery, {{reflecting}} the range of positions common in the antebellum U.S. [...] Barton W. Stone was a strong opponent of slavery, arguing {{that there was no}} Biblical justification for the form of slavery then being practiced in the United States and calling for immediate emancipation. [...] Alexander Campbell represented a more [...] "Jeffersonian" [...] opposition to slavery, writing of it as more of a <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> than as a religious or moral one. [...] Having seen Methodists and Baptists divide over the issue of slavery, Campbell argued that scripture regulated slavery rather than prohibited it, and that abolition {{should not be allowed to}} become an issue over which Christians would break fellowship with each other. [...] Like the country as a whole, the assumption of white racial superiority was almost universal among those on all sides of the issue, and it was common for congregations to have separate seating for black members.|$|E

Then again, {{she would be}} as fond of him as ever. In 1583 she informed ambassadors that Lettice Dudley was [...] "a she-wolf" [...] and her husband a [...] "traitor" [...] and [...] "a cuckold". Lady Leicester's social life was much curtailed. Even her movements could pose a <b>political</b> <b>problem,</b> as Francis Walsingham explained: [...] "I see not her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester. There is great offence taken at the conveying down of his lady."

[...] Disturbed by Frémont's actions, Lincoln felt that emancipation was [...] "not {{within the range of}} military law or necessity" [...] and that such powers rested only with the elected federal government. [...] Lincoln also recognized the monumental <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> that such an edict posed to his efforts to keep the border states in the Union. [...] He was particularly worried about reports he heard of the furor in Kentucky over the edict, writing, [...] "I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game." [...] According to Lincoln in a letter to a supporter of Frémont, a unit of Kentucky militia fighting for the Union, upon hearing of Frémont's proclamation, threw down their weapons and disbanded. Lincoln determined the proclamation could not be allowed to remain in force. However, to override the edict or to directly order Frémont to strike out or modify the paragraph had its own political dangers—such an act would outrage abolitionists throughout the North. [...] Sensitive to the political pitfalls on all sides, Lincoln wrote to Frémont, [...] "Allow me to therefore ask, that you will, as of your own motion, modify that paragraph..." ...|$|E

President Truman appointed him Secretary of Defense, {{but the two}} disagreed [...] over budgets and Truman fired him in 1949 when Forrestal took the Navy's side in a public protest against White House policy known as the Revolt of the Admirals. A basic <b>political</b> <b>problem</b> was that the Secretary of Defense did not fully control the budgets of the three services. [...] Each one worked with powerful Congressmen to enhance their budgets despite the White House determination to hold down spending. In [...] 1948-49 the [...] "Revolt of the Admirals" [...] came [...] when a number of retired and active-duty admirals publicly disagreed with President Truman and with his replacement for Forrestal [...] Louis A. Johnson because they wanted less expensive [...] strategic atomic bombs delivered by the Air Force. Forrestal had supported the Navy position and had obtained funding for an aircraft carrier from Congress. [...] Truman [...] fired Forrestal, and Johnson cancelled the carrier and announced plans to move Marine Corps aviation out of the Navy and into the Air Force. [...] During Congressional [...] hearings public opinion shifted strongly against the Navy. In the end the Navy kept Marine aviation and eventually got its carrier, but its revolting admirals were punished and it [...] lost control over strategic bombing. The Truman administration essentially defeated the Revolt, and civilian control over the military was reaffirmed. Military budgets following the hearings prioritized the development of Air Force heavy bomber designs, accumulating a combat ready force of over 1,000 long-range strategic bombers capable of supporting nuclear mission scenarios.|$|E
