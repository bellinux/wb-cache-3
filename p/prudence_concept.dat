40|$|This study {{examines}} the non-financial corporations’ accounting quality of higher International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) compliance in Malaysia. Fourteen IFRS standards {{commonly used in}} different industries have been chosen and specific focus was placed on assessing the quality of IFRS compliance in financial reporting of the non-financial corporations listed in the main market. During the study, content analysis, which focused mainly on disclosure statements in financial reports, was conducted. We have determined the criterion to assess the higher quality of accounting in line with IFRS and using QSR NVivo 8 software to run content analysis on the specific fourteen common IFRS standards presented in annual reports of the 158 listed companies in the main market of Bursa Malaysia. We apply multiple regression accounting quality models to achieve the finding determinants of accounting quality of higher IFRS compliance by using SPSS and our empirical research highlights that the financial reporting system of non-finacial corporations listed in the main market in Bursa Malaysia highly complies with IFRS. The inferences, taken together, also provide a novel insight into the impact of accounting quality of compliance with IFRS, that is statistically associated with the firms’ good corporate governance and transparent and disclosure practice of the firms in Bursa Malaysia. Moreover, the accounting quality of compliance with IFRS provides the evidence of <b>prudence</b> <b>concept,</b> and improvement of firms’ price earning measures in the market...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} studies on IFRIC 15 is very limited. The {{available}} studies have either been conducted before the introduction of IFRIC 15 or {{at an early stage}} of the implementation. This study examines IFRIC 15 s practice from a longer perspective. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explain the effect that the interpretation IFRIC 15 has had on accounting objectives and qualitative characteristics of the revenue recognition of Swedish construction companies. The study will also analyze whether the construction companies has changed their perception of IFRIC 15 after applying it form a longer time perspective. Data were collected through interviews with the companies JM, NCC, PEAB and Skanska, as well as from the annual report of the companies.   The result shows that all construction companies in this study have been obliged to apply IAS 18. The change in accounting standards has led to a change in accounting method from the percentage of completion to completion method of revenue recognition of certain types of projects. The change of accounting method in the application of IFRIC 15 has an effect on the qualitative characteristics and accounting objectives, as the companies largely apply the realization concept and the <b>prudence</b> <b>concept.</b> The application of IFRIC 15 has also had different effects on the qualitative characteristics of the companies' revenue recognition. The consequence of this is that three of the studied companies believe that the financial statements don’t give a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the company, which has led to an establishment of a segment reporting. While one of the companies believes that IFRIC 15 reflects the business well. Study results also indicate that companies are still critical of IFRIC 15...|$|E

40|$|The {{harmonization}} {{of accounting}} among {{the member states}} of the EU {{has been going on}} since the late 1960 s. In 2001 it was decided that all listed groups within the EU should use the accounting standards IAS/IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in their consolidated accounts from 2005. All countries are also free to allow use of IAS/IFRS in individual accounts as well if they want to, which would be a step towards further harmonization. The use of these standards imply a changed way of accounting, adapted to provide relevant information to the capital market instead of the traditional continental European use of the <b>prudence</b> <b>concept</b> of conservatism to protect creditors. The use of these new standards creates problems in relation to the Swedish connection between accounting and taxation which implies that the financial accounting is the base for taxation. To continue to use this connection while introducing IAS/IFRS in individual accounts would have effects on the tax base as there will be a risk of distribution of untaxed profits and having to pay tax on unrealized profits. Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how the most practical connection between accounting and taxation in Sweden should be formulated within the near future in relation to the use of IAS/IFRS and the development of accounting harmonization within the EU. To gain relevant data to be able to fulfill our purpose we have chosen a qualitative method. We have conducted four semi-structured interviews with five interviewees knowledgeable in accounting and taxation. The data retrieved through the interviews have been analyzed by the use of data reduction in matrixes. Our overall conclusion is that the connection between accounting and taxation needs to be changed. The most likely and suitable solution in the near future would be to keep the connection where the accounting is used as a base for taxation and remove the connection where tax rules affects the accounting. We advocate a use of IAS/IFRS in individual accounts for larger companies and that potentially arising issues due to the kept connection will be solved with specific tax rules. We do not deem complete disengagement with development of a new tax rule system to be a usable solution at the moment. Furthermore, we cannot see any signs of accounting harmonization among SME:s within the near future...|$|E

5000|$|In accounting, {{prudence}} {{was long}} {{considered one of}} the [...] "fundamental accounting concepts" [...] in its determination of the time for revenue recognition. The rule of prudence meant that gains should not be anticipated unless their realisation was highly probable. However, recent developments in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have led academic critics to accuse the international standard-setting body IASB of abandoning prudence. In the British reporting standard FRS 18, prudence, along with consistency, was relegated to a [...] "desirable" [...] quality of financial information rather than fundamental <b>concept.</b> <b>Prudence</b> was rejected for IFRS because it was seen as compromising accounts' neutrality.|$|R

Along with relating the principles of <b>prudence</b> to the <b>concept</b> of great power responsibility, it highlights two pillars of prudent decision-making: circumspection and awareness of one's limits.

The conclusion shows that {{on the basis of this}} normative yardstick, it is not possible to classify Operation Iraqi Freedom as a prudent action by a responsible great power...|$|R
40|$|O propósito deste artigo é analisar o adoubement e a Cavalaria no Ocidente feudal, com ênfase no romance Eracle, escrito pelo clérigo francês Gautier d’Arras entre 1159 e 1184. Nessa obra, o herói protagonista é submetido ao adoubement (ritual de passagem) para integrar a Cavalaria, categoria considerada por alguns historiadores como a instituição dominante durante o Feudalismo. Estudamos a evolução e as etapas do ritual, assim como as principais virtudes cavaleirescas (coragem, lealdade e prudência), os conceitos de largueza e prodomie e a arte da guerra. Para isso, empregamos comparativamente textos dos séculos XI-XII.

40|$|Article 31 of the Fourth Directive, which {{specifies}} {{the general}} valuation principles to be applied {{in the preparation of}} financial statements, shows a difference in emphasis between the different language versions. Except for the English version of the Directive, all others emphasize prudence, as opposed to the other valuation principles required by the article. The earlier drafts of the Directive are examined in an attempt to trace the development of this difference between the English and the other language versions. It seems that the particular wording of Article 31 with its relatively greater weight on prudence probably results from UK influence, more specifically from SSAP 2. A possible solution is then suggested as to why this particular emphasis on prudence was not retained in the English version of the Directive. Further, it is noted that German law did not explicitly make <b>prudence</b> an overriding <b>concept</b> before the Fourth Directive and nor does the German implementation of Article 31. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{introduces}} spiritual {{direction in}} relation to the mystery of the Trinity. Based on the existing terminology (direction, fatherhood and support), it distinguishes three basic dimensions of spiritual direction, defined according to their relation to the three divine Persons. It concerns the charisma of direction, discernment and fatherhood, which enables the Holy Spirit to work via spiritual director on the guided in order to become the follower of Jesus Christ in a more radical way, to resemble Christ and to be united with him. The relation with the persons of God determines also the requirements to the guided person (modesty, trust and good judgement) and to the director (knowledge, experience and <b>prudence).</b> This theological <b>concept</b> is complemented with anthropological observations: the author offers his own model for spiritual direction (with the personal and temporal structure of human being, the instances of censor and mirror and the dynamics of thoughts and Word), suggests the interaction between the guide and the guided and criticises the itineraries of spiritual development...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation:	AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF TOLERATION Bican Sahin, Doctor of Philosophy, 2003 Dissertation Directed by:		Professor Charles E. Butterworth 	Department of Government and Politics This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the concept of toleration. It asks: "Did Plato and Aristotle contribute {{to the emergence of}} toleration?" This question is important because it is widely believed that the concept of toleration is a product of modern times. If it can be shown that although they did not have an explicit theory of toleration the ancients had something to say about it, this would be a significant improvement in our understanding of the historical evolution of toleration. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation the relationship between skepticism and toleration is analyzed. The examination of the theories of knowledge of Plato and Aristotle shows that neither philosopher was a skeptic, thus, they did not contribute to the emergence of toleration on the basis of skepticism. While Plato fits the definition of the "dogmatist," Aristotle has a more modest stance in his claims of knowledge in the fields of ethics and politics. To the extent that Aristotle does not reject other views absolutely, it can be expected that he would be more tolerant. In the second part, the relationship between prudence and toleration is examined. Upon a close examination of Plato and Aristotle's moral and political views, it becomes clear that Plato emphasizes harmony and order in both individual and society and to that extent rejects conflict that can be caused by moral and/or ideological differences. Thus, he does not have a prudent approach to conflict emphasizing stability and peace rather than harmony. On the other hand, Aristotle exhibits a prudent stance towards conflict in the polis. Although he also has an ideal view of politics in which conflict is minimized, Aristotle does not dismiss less than perfect political arrangements. By requiring the citizens to be ready to have consensus only on the matters that concern everybody, Aristotle's concept of political friendship provides a private sphere in which the citizens can experience their differences. In this regard, on the basis of <b>prudence,</b> Aristotle's <b>concept</b> of political friendship is similar to the modern concept of toleration in terms of not enforcing uniformity among the citizens...|$|R
