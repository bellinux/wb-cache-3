40|$|Optical supercontinuum (OSC) laser {{source is}} a new {{generation}} wideband laser which has various commercial applications such as telecommunication, biomedicine, and optical sensing systems. However {{the high costs of}} current OSC laser sources generally have impeded them to be used more widely. In this thesis, we demonstrated a low-cost OSC laser source based on a continuum wave (CW) pumped Erbium/Ytterbium co-doped fiber (EYCDF) ring cavity with a 1. 2 km highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF). This OSC laser source has 350 nm spectral coverage, from 1550 nm to 1900 nm in wavelength. This is the first CW pumped OSC that generates continuum spectrum above 1750 nm. The wide spectral coverage in the long wavelength range allows more advanced utilization of OSC sources. In this thesis, the evolution mechanism of the CW pumped OSC is discussed. The analysis of the results shows that self-phase modulation (SPM), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) dominate the evolution of OSC. Therefore, the evolution pattern is different to those of previous CW pumped OSCs where the modulation instability (MI) and SRS effects, or purely SRS effect dominate OSC generation. In addition, the experimental results suggest that the OSC generated by this evolution pattern has high flatness, which is caused by two reasons. Firstly, the intense SRS effect suppresses the MI effect, which could induce spectral vibration. Secondly, SPM induced spectrum broadening produce a smooth spectrum. The intense SPM and SRS effect are benefited from the ring-cavity structure which effectively increases the effective length of nonlinear fiber. Keyword.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{three-dimensional}} CFD methodology {{to improve the}} performance of hydraulic components is shown. The study regardsresearch activities developed {{during the last two}} year by the Hydraulic Research Group of the University of Naples Federico II coordinated by the Prof. Adolfo Senatore. Models were build up with PumpLinx®, a commercial CFD 3 D code developed by Simerics Inc. ®, that solves numerically the fundamental conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy and includes accurate physical models for turbulence and cavitation. The paper demonstrate that this methodology may produce a significant improvement of the performance of several different components with an important costs reduction for prototyping phase. The paper presents results obtained on variable displacement vane pump and on a vane pump power split transmission, both pumps are used for mobile application. Analyzing the results of this paper it is possible to appreciate the transversality of the adopted methodology. The first analysis is made to avoid cavitation phenomena.

Additional analyses were developed to predict transient behavior of the ring {{and the effects of}} temperature rises occurring in the hydrodynamic film between the ring and shaft.

The design analysis was used to size all of the rings and to select the ranges of clearances, thickness, and loading. Although full quantitative agreement was lacking, relative agreement existed in that rings that were predicted to perform well theoretically, generally performed well experimentally. Some causes for discrepanices between theory and experiment are believed to be due to starvation, leakage past the secondary seal at high pressures, and uncertainties in the small clearances and local inlet temperatures to the <b>pumping</b> <b>ring.</b> A separate preliminary analysis was performed for a pumping Leningrader seal.

40|$|A {{femtosecond}} supercontinuum generating {{system is}} presented by employing a microstructured fiber within a synchronously <b>pumped</b> <b>ring</b> resonator. Via the ring resonator, optical feedback is introduced, {{which leads to}} the creation of a highly nonlinear oscillator and to the formation of nonlinear dynamics like period multiplication, limit cycle, and chaos. The effect of delayed feedback on supercontinuum generation is studied numerically and experimentally, using the input pulse power and the resonator length detuning as control parameters. In combination, these two control parameters allow for a systematical adjustment of the regimes of nonlinear dynamics, which leads to an alteration of the pattern of pulse trains. Changing the resonator length on a sub-wavelength scale enables manipulation of the feedback phase, which can be used to adjust shape and bandwidth of the optical spectrum. Furthermore, a possibility to tailor the modes of the optical frequency comb is demonstr ated, and the influence of the feedback phase on the noise properties of the supercontinuum generating system is discussed...|$|R
