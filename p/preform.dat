25|$|A <b>preform</b> is a pre-made {{shape of}} solder {{specially}} {{designed for the}} application where {{it is to be}} used. Many methods are used to manufacture the solder <b>preform,</b> stamping being the most common. The solder <b>preform</b> may include the solder flux needed for the soldering process. This can be an internal flux, inside the solder <b>preform,</b> or external, with the solder <b>preform</b> coated.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the surface}} tension, the shape is {{smoothed}} during the drawing process, and {{the shape of the}} resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the <b>preform.</b> Nevertheless, careful polishing of the <b>preform</b> is important, since any defects of the <b>preform</b> surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the <b>preform</b> for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the confocal optical microscope.|$|E
25|$|The <b>preform,</b> however constructed, {{is placed}} in a device known as a drawing tower, where the <b>preform</b> tip is heated and the optical fiber is pulled out as a string. By {{measuring}} the resultant fiber width, the tension on the fiber can be controlled to maintain the fiber thickness.|$|E

25|$|In outside vapor {{deposition}} or vapor axial deposition, {{the glass}} is formed by flame hydrolysis, a reaction in which silicon tetrachloride and germanium tetrachloride are oxidized by reaction with water (H2O) in an oxyhydrogen flame. In outside vapor deposition {{the glass is}} deposited onto a solid rod, which is removed before further processing. In vapor axial deposition, a short seed rod is used, and a porous <b>preform,</b> whose length is not limited {{by the size of}} the source rod, is built up on its end. The porous <b>preform</b> is consolidated into a transparent, solid <b>preform</b> by heating to about 1,800K (1,500°C, 2,800°F).|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{variations}} of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging <b>preform</b> from liquid metal. The casting is removed {{after it has}} solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the <b>preform</b> is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Preformed</b> {{thermoplastic}} pavement markings (sometime called [...] "tape", {{but not to}} {{be confused}} with <b>preformed</b> polymer tape) are thermoplastic cut into the final shapes by the manufacturers and ready to position onto an asphalt or concrete pavement surface. <b>Preformed</b> thermoplastics are put into place on the road surface and applied using a propane heat torch. Some models require heating the road surface prior to the placement of the <b>preformed</b> thermoplastics. These markings are used primarily because of their durability and cost-effective service life. Since the plastics are melted into the surface, they are not easily damaged by the snowplows. Typically, the <b>preformed</b> thermoplastic markings can last 3 to 6 years. The most common applications of <b>preformed</b> thermoplastic pavement markings are found at intersections as transverse markings such as stop lines, legends, crosswalks, arrows, bike lane symbols, and accessibility symbols.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two basic}} molding methods for PET bottles, {{one-step}} and two-step. In two-step molding, two separate machines are used. The first machine injection molds the <b>preform,</b> which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch blow molding.|$|E
25|$|Besides this {{external}} (post-consumer) polyester bottle recycling, {{numbers of}} internal (pre-consumer) recycling processes exist, where the wasted polymer material does not exit the production site {{to the free}} market, and instead is reused in the same production circuit. In this way, fiber waste is directly reused to produce fiber, <b>preform</b> waste is directly reused to produce preforms, and film waste is directly reused to produce film.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the narrow}} {{temperature}} range and high thermal conductivity, aluminium forging can only be realized in a particular process window. To provide good forming conditions a homogeneous temperature distribution in the entire workpiece is necessary. Therefore, {{the control of the}} tool temperature has a major influence to the process. For example, by optimizing the <b>preform</b> geometries the local effective strains can be influenced to reduce local overheating for a more homogeneous temperature distribution.|$|E

With braiding, many yarns are used, non-geodesic yarn paths are possible, and the interlaced structure of braids provides typical mechanical properties such as high impact strength. Previously, several models were developed to predict the fibre angles on simple, stationary braided <b>preforms,</b> but not for complex, non-axisymmetric <b>preforms.</b> This paper presents a fast and efficient model to predict the fibre angles on complex biaxially braided <b>preforms.</b> The model is verified with experiments on two mandrels and the experimental and numerical results show good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background and Purpose: Antibiotic-loaded cement spacers are {{typically}} manufactured by surgeons {{in the operating}} room. However, if the infecting organism is known preoperatively, the cement spacer can be fabricated (Spacer-G ® or the InterSpace ® Hip) in advance. It is unclear if <b>preformed</b> hip spacers are superior to surgeon-made hip spacers {{in the treatment of}} periprosthetic joint infection following primary THA. Methods: A literature review of the peer-reviewed literature indexed by MEDLINE and Embase was performed to identify studies reporting the outcomes of <b>preformed</b> and surgeon-made hip spacers in the treatment of infection following primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). A total of 43 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis to compare the reinfection rate, Harris Hip Score (HHS) and spacer complication rates between surgeon-made and <b>preformed</b> hip spacers. Results and Interpretation: The analyzed studies included a total number of 1631 infected THA cases (n= 1027 surgeon-made; n= 604 <b>preformed</b> spacers). We found similar reinfection rates (6. 0 % surgeon-made, and 5. 5 % <b>preformed</b> spacers) and similar mean HHS at latest follow-up after reimplantation (HHS= 84. 3 surgeon-made, and HHS= 81. 8 <b>preformed</b> spacers) between both groups. However, patients treated with a surgeon-made articulating spacer had a higher spacer fracture rate compared to <b>preformed</b> articulating spacer. The use of <b>preformed</b> articulating spacers in the treatment of infected THA is not superior to surgeon-made articulating spacers regarding infection control and functional outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Prepreg-based {{materials}} {{currently used}} in high-end applications {{as well as}} SMC/BMC-based materials used in automotive body panels {{are not likely to}} lead the future growth in the application of fibre-reinforced composites in primary as well as secondary vehicle structures. Out-of-autoclave techniques based on rapid fibre <b>preforming</b> and part consolidation will drive the structural composites applications in aerospace and automotive sectors. Fibre <b>preforming</b> has been identified as a key bottleneck in the composites supply chain, considering recent growth predictions in civil airframe and automotive markets. Automated Tape Laying machines have modest deposition rates, and global autoclave capacity is not likely to cope with projected growth rates in composites. This paper investigates the potential for near-net <b>preforming</b> using conventional textile technology as well as robotic approaches. Robotic or multi-axial machines have been shown to extend the <b>preforming</b> capability of weaving, braiding and stitching concepts. A multi-axial weaving machine, equipped with automated trimming of non-interlaced tows, can create 3 D woven <b>preforms</b> tapered in width as well as length directions. 3 D <b>preforms</b> with through-thickness reinforcement have been created with a robotic system equipped with dry fibre lay-up and tufting capability. A 9 -axis complex winding machine in conjunction with braiding has been demonstrated for <b>preforming</b> over complex mandrels. KEYWORDS...|$|R
2500|$|With inside vapor deposition, the <b>preform</b> {{starts as}} a hollow glass tube {{approximately}} [...] long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a lathe. Gases such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) or germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) are injected with {{oxygen in the}} end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the gas up to 1,900K (1,600°C, 3,000°F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce silica or germania (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD).|$|E
