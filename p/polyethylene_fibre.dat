40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{properties of}} extracted gel-spun <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibres</b> {{depend on the}} spinning conditions. The main structures in the extracted fibre are shish-kebabs and lamellae.

After hot-drawing, due to melting/recrystallization, both structures are transformed on a 100 nm scale into a dense structure consisting of shish-kebabs or fibrils containing a void volume fraction of about 1 %, as revealed by the scattering power of equatorial SAXS experiments. Moreover, a slight decrease of the equatorial intensity especially at the smallest angles after treating the hot-drawn fibres with paraffin oil, points to a small contribution of multiple scattering to the equatorial scattering. This implies the presence of a superstructure of not too closely packed macrofibrils.

The composites with a [0 Â°r/ 90 Â°] lay-up had an out-of-plane compressive strength that was dictated by in-plane tensile fibre fracture. By contrast, the out-of-plane compressive strength of the uni-directional composites was significantly lower and was not associated with fibre fracture. The peak strength of the [0 Â°/ 90 Â°] composites increased with increasing in-plane specimen dimensions and was dependent on the matrix and fibre strength {{as well as on the}} ply thickness. A combination of micro X-ray tomography and local pressure measurements revealed the existence of a shear-lag zone at the periphery of the specimens. Finite Element (FE) and analytical micromechanical models predict the compressive composite response and reveal that out-of-plane compression generates tensile stresses along the fibres due to shear-lag loading between the alternating 0 Â° and 90 Â° plies. Moreover, the compressive strength data suggests that the shear strength of DyneemaÂ®DyneemaÂ® is pressure sensitive, and this pressure sensitivity is quantified by comparing predictions with experimental measurements of the out-of-plane compressive strength.

Natural fibres have benefited from the perception that they are "green" or eco-friendly.

At the same time, interest has been growing rapidly in the potential offered by self-reinforced composites, such as polypropylene fibre reinforced polypropylene and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polyethylene. Each of these composite systems offers its own advantages and a number of disadvantages. One way to reduce or remove many of these deficiencies would be to combine these two systems to develop a novel hybrid system that is fully recyclable. Hoo Tien N Kuan ABSTRACT Abstract The work outlined in this research project aims to develop, manufacture and fully characterise the properties of environmentally-friendly composites based on natural fibre and polymer fibre reinforcements, and their fibre metal laminates. The composites are based on natural fibres (e. g. hemp, basalt or flax) and polymer fibres (polypropylene). The composites are manufactured via a compression moulding procedure and their properties are investigated both statically and dynamically through a series of tension, flexure and low velocity impact tests. The fracture region of the laminates is also investigated using optical microscopy techniques. The mechanical response of the laminates is modelled using laminate theory and the impact response is predicted using simple impact models. A range of green composites and hybrid materials has been developed and investigated. The experimental data have shown that the composites based on basalt fibres offer an excellent all-round mechanical performance exceeding those associated with other natural fibre composites. Combining natural fibre composites with SRPP (Self- Reinforced Polypropylene) and aluminium alloy can enhance the mechanical behaviour of the composite. These environmentally-friendly composite systems offer significant potential in engineering design and could potentially help to reduce waste and pollution.
