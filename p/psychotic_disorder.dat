40|$|BACKGROUND: Alternative and {{traditional}} healing methods are common and popular in Sudan, particularly for treating {{people with mental}} disorders, but little information is available about the outcome of theses traditional healing approaches. OBJECTIVES: To study the outcome of treating patients with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> by traditional healers, and to understand the type of services, interventions procedures and treatments methods used by traditional healers to manage patients with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders.</b> METHOD: A prospective follow-up quantitative study of a cohort of inpatients with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> was carried out from admission until discharge. Subjects were people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> undergoing treatment in traditional healer centres in central Sudan. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to diagnose the <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) {{was used to assess}} the severity of psychotic symptoms on admission and discharge from the traditional healer centre. RESULTS: We interviewed 129 inpatients with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> on admission and discharge from the traditional healers centres. There was a significant reduction in the PANSS score (p =. 0001) after a mean period of stay of 4. 5 months. The mean for the overall PANSS score was 118. 36 on admission and 69. 36 on discharge.

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between ethnicity, <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> and criminal behavior by investigating differences in prevalence rates of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> between detainees from Black and minority ethnic (BME) groups and non-BME detainees. Method A systematic review of all empirical studies on the prevalence of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders,</b> comparing at least two ethnic groups in a psychiatric penitentiary or regular prison setting. No national or language restrictions were made. Results Ten out of sixteen medium to high quality studies found higher prevalence rates of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> in BME detainees compared to non-BME detainees. The country where a study was executed appeared to be irrelevant to the results. The overrepresentation of BME detainees with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> was especially reported on psychiatric penitentiary units and less often on regular prison units. Conclusions BME detainees show elevated prevalence rates of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> compared to non-BME detainees. This phenomenon appears to be internationally relevant. Summations • The overrepresentation of BME patients is not restricted to certain countries but is of international significance. • Future research needs to focus on why BME patients with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> tend to be overrepresented {{in the criminal justice}} system and how it can be achieved to get BME patients into regular mental health care instead.

5000|$|F10.5 alcohol: Alcohol is {{a common}} cause of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> or episodes, which may occur through acute intoxication, chronic alcoholism, withdrawal, {{exacerbation}} of existing disorders, or acute idiosyncratic reactions. Research has shown that alcohol abuse causes an 8-fold increased risk of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> in men and a 3 fold increased risk of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> in women. While {{the vast majority of}} cases are acute and resolve fairly quickly upon treatment and/or abstinence, they can occasionally become chronic and persistent. Alcoholic psychosis is sometimes misdiagnosed as another mental illness such as schizophrenia.|$|R
25|$|Approximately {{three percent}} of people who are {{suffering}} from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorder,</b> i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that children and adolescents are sometimes given antipsychotic drugs as a first-line treatment for mental health problems or behavioral issues other than a <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorder,</b> {{which is not the}} ideal treatment approach for these drugs. In the United States, the usage of these drugs in young people has greatly increased since 2000, especially among children from low-income families. More research is needed to specifically assess the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medications in pediatric populations. Because of the risk of weight gain, metabolic side effects, and cardiovascular changes with antipsychotic use, the use of the drugs in pediatric populations is highly scrutinized.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} ORS. Hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT) demonstrated hypoperfusion of the frontotemporal lobe in one case. That is to say, part of the brain was receiving insufficient blood flow. In another, functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out while the person with ORS listened to both neutral words and emotive words. Compared to an age and sex matched healthy control subject under the same conditions, the individual with ORS showed more activation areas in the brain when listening to emotionally loaded words. This difference was described as abnormal, but less pronounced as would be observed in the brain of a person with a <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, when {{analysing}} {{the long-term}} trends (2000 – 2013), {{the rates of}} admission for all other mental disorders increased significantly except for the rates of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders,</b> which fell by almost 14 % in this period. One possible reason could be a reverse diagnostic ‘spill-over’ where minors previously diagnosed with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> were being given a diagnosis of BD. Notably, BD {{as a proportion of}} all psychiatrically related discharges increased from 0.22 to 0.27 % in this period. Equally however, <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> could also have been replaced by other disorders such as substance-related disorders which have also shown a significant increase in this period and therefore, from this dataset, one cannot reasonably infer the reverse diagnostic spill-over phenomenon. Another possibility could be an increase in the quality and number of community-based early intervention treatments for <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> in recent times. However, at this stage, such assumptions remain speculative, and further research on the long-term trends for rates of <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> and aetiological factors is needed, which {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper.|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} and {{converging}} evidence that cannabis {{may be a}} major risk factor in people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> and prodromal <b>psychotic</b> symptoms. The lack of available pharmacological treatments for cannabis use indicates that psychological interventions should be a high priority, especially among people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, {{there have been few}} randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions among this group. In the present study we critically overview RCTs of psychological and pharmacologic interventions among people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders,</b> giving particular attention to those studies which report cannabis use outcomes. We then review data regarding treatment preferences among this group. RCTs of interventions within "real world" mental health systems among adults with severe mental disorders suggest that cannabis use is amenable to treatment in real world settings among people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders.</b> RCTs of manual guided interventions among cannabis users indicate that while brief interventions are associated with reductions in cannabis use, longer interventions may be more effective. Additionally, RCTs reviewed suggest treatment with antipsychotic medication is not associated with a worsening of cannabis cravings or use and may be beneficial. The development of cannabinoid agonist medication may be an effective strategy for cannabis dependence and suitable for people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders.</b> The development of cannabis use interventions for people with <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorders</b> should also consider patients 2 ̆ 7 treatment preferences. Initial results indicate face-to-face interventions focussed on cannabis use may be preferred.

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorder,</b> i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|E
500|$|The {{similarity}} of psilocybin-induced symptoms {{to those of}} schizophrenia has made the drug a useful research tool in behavioral and neuroimaging studies of this <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorder.</b> In both cases, psychotic symptoms are thought to arise from a [...] "deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information" [...] in the brain that ultimately lead to [...] "cognitive fragmentation and psychosis". Flashbacks (spontaneous recurrences of a previous psilocybin experience) can occur long after having used psilocybin mushrooms. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) {{is characterized by a}} continual presence of visual disturbances similar to those generated by psychedelic substances. Neither flashbacks nor HPPD are commonly associated with psilocybin usage, and correlations between HPPD and psychedelics are further obscured by polydrug use and other variables.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{is complex and}} does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative. Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome {{are thought to be}} rare in historical records before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled behavior were common. A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews, and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature. The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German alienist Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a <b>psychotic</b> <b>disorder</b> (hebephrenia). In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). [...] Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long-term, smouldering systemic or [...] "whole body" [...] disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade. [...] His use of the term [...] "praecox" [...] distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which typically occur later in life. It is sometimes argued that {{the use of the term}} démence précoce in 1852 by the French physician Bénédict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century.|$|E
