40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results and the approach of an interdisciplinary research that deals with {{the study of the}} relationship between the protection of the right to health and the design and use of space of hospitals. The research aims to provide criteria for the evaluation and design of space and organization in relation to regional and national policies on health. The approach takes as a reference the theory of social rights as rights based on the "relationship", whose effectiveness contributes to the quality of the spaces in which these relations take place. Key to the reading of the approach is the patient’s flow of experience in the public spaces of the hospital. The tools of configurational analysis in architecture were intertwined with sociological methods and investigation methodologies on the constitutional protection of rights. The research results are a set of knowledge articulated in a model, <b>process</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> and indicators for the evaluation of the flows in hospital. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{basis of}} {{packaging}} design and performance is the component materials.

Sometimes these are adequate. Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics.|$|R

During the design stage, the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes, allowing for further safety and operational investigations, such as a Hazard and operability study (HAZOP). To do this, it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems, as well as how these systems connect.|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{component}} data, {{commonly known}} as "data sheets" are the sustenance of a circuit designer. Each new book of <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> possibly solves some outstanding idea or design problem. Given such {{a prominent role in}} a designer's life, it is of critical importance that <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> representation in a computer be more than just a photographic image of the original. This paper examines some of the issues in the computer representation of <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> for active components. It begins by examining different types of <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> along with the varying types of representation required. Next, the issues of data and parameter representation are described. The problems of describing the behavior, or model definition immediately follows, concluding with the problems of assembly and test. 1.

40|$|For {{reliable}} {{energy yield}} predictions an accurate modeling of the PV module behavior is essential. In this analysis we compare two different possibilities for acquiring the necessary parameters: indoor measurements and <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> values. We found that temperature coefficients of power given in <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> {{can be used}} for yield prediction without introducing higher uncertainties. On the other hand the derivation of model parameters for the modeling of irradiation dependent efficiency of PV modules based on <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> is associated with high uncertainties.

30|$|Different new {{contents}} of safety <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are to be}} generated, processed and communicated by mid- 2015 or 2018. This means more mandatory information in the safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet,</b> new formats, new classification and labelling according to the CLP Regulation and new parameters - becoming available from registrations - for the risk assessment {{and the protection of}} humans and the environment (in particular DNELs, PNECs). The required exposure scenarios for substances need to be attached as an annex to the safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet.</b> Suppliers of mixtures, who do not need to prepare exposure scenarios themselves, can choose: either they can attach the relevant exposure scenarios as an annex to their safety <b>data</b> <b>sheets</b> or they can incorporate the relevant items of information in sections 1 to 16.|$|R
40|$|Chemical process routes {{can already}} be {{assessed}} {{as early as}} {{in the development and}} design phases. Process screening should not look at economic and technical aspects only, but also the safety, health, and environmental performances. In this paper, a method called the Health Quotient Index (HQI) is presented for the preliminary process design phase. The HQI provides a simple approach to quantify workers' health risk from exposure to fugitive emissions e. g. in petrochemical plants. The method utilizes <b>process</b> <b>data</b> from flow <b>sheet</b> diagram, which is already available at the preliminarydesignstage. Since the mechanical details of the process are still unknown, a database of the precalculated fugitive emissions for typical operations in chemical plants was created to simplify the assessment. The HQI can be used to rank alternative process concepts or to quantify the risk level of processes. As a case study, six process routes for producing methyl methacrylate are discussed. Three health indexes are compared in the case study. The HQI is able to highlight the difference of hazard levels between the routes better as a result of more detailed assessment of the exposures...|$|R

40|$|Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> are {{the primary}} source of hazard {{information}} on chemical substances and mixtures and are used to inform risk assessments. It is imperative to ascertain the quality of this primary source of information in informing risk based decision making. The content of Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> (SDS) is governed by regulatory requirements outlined under the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS).
