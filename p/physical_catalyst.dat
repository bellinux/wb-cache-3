30|$|Nanostructuring of {{semiconductor}} surfaces via {{ion beam}} sputtering {{has been shown}} to yield a variety of ordered nanostructures [1 – 3]. While there is speculation about the mechanism of nanostructure evolution on compound semiconductors, the structuring of single-component semiconductor materials, and more specifically silicon, remains elusive. Although structuring of silicon surfaces using ion beam bombardment at normal incidence was first reported by R. Gago et al.[4], studies, later on, have shown that structuring of silicon dots on silicon surfaces at zero incidence angle is possible only if a certain level of impurity is available on the surface during the sputtering process [5]. Moreoever, other studies have shown that irradiating silicon surfaces with no impurity seeding results in surface smoothing at normal incidence [6, 7], in contradiction to the results of R. Gago et al. The role of impurities, which usually comes from the ion gun and the clips holding the samples, was discussed by Ozaydin et al.[8, 9] and Sanchez-Garcia et al.[10] who suggested several mechanisms on how impurity seeding can induce nanostructure formation on silicon. The formation of silicides, modification of the collision cascade, and stress generation during ion bombardment were the suggested possible impurity effects on silicon nanostructuring. In this work, we report the formation of silicon nanodots on silicon substrates via low-energy ion irradiation of ultrathin film gold coatings on Si. No impurity seeding was necessary to form Si nanostructures. The gold acted as a <b>physical</b> <b>catalyst</b> to form the structures, which was later eliminated from Si nanostructures via preferential sputtering. This process is unlike the previous studies where the impurities are kept implanted in the samples due to the continuous seeding of impurity particles from ion source grids or sample grips throughout the irradiation process.|$|E

Formaldehyde remains a key, large volume industrial chemical which is ubiquitous to household, commercial, aviation, pharmaceutical and automotive products due to its high reactivity and versatility. Critical analysis of the various technological approaches used to manufacture formaldehyde, characteristics of silver catalysts employed, process conditions, and performance values has been presented. The three common plant types are: almost complete conversion (BASF type); incomplete conversion followed by distillation (ICI type); and the off-gas recycle process which dominates world production due to its extensive use in China. Polycrystalline silver remains the most popular catalyst, with only minimal use of alternate supported catalysts or gauze materials. <b>Catalyst</b> <b>physical</b> properties such as bulk density, purity, mechanical strength, size fraction and shape are important in relation to overall formaldehyde synthesis performance.

However, catalytic performance under pulverised fuel boiler conditions has received relatively little consideration. For the first time, the research set out in this thesis systematically compares the reactivity of catalysed and uncatalysed bituminous coal samples during combustion in a drop tube furnace (DTF) and a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). All of the inorganic compounds investigated were accordingly found to increase the rate of TGA char oxidation, with certain transition metal halides proving to be extremely successful additives. But these trends did not always translate into analogous carbon burnout improvements on th~ medium-scale DTF. This {{was due to the}} inherent variability associated with this experimental setup, the use of <b>physical</b> mixtures for <b>catalyst</b> dispersion and the intrinsic volatility of some of the tested salts. Furthermore several very effective additives on the TGA, the copper halides, seemingly deactivated under the conditions experienced in the DTF, reducing the attained carbon burnouts to levels below those observed with the uncatalysed coal fractions. Complex interactions were subsequently discovered between copper (I) bromide and the coal's mineral matter, implying that a copper-iron association could have been behind this behaviour. In contrast, the thermally labile iron halides were found to be exceptional additives for enhancing DTF carbon burnout, even at temperatures above their predicted boiling points in what could have previously been assumed to be a completely mass transfer controlled reaction regime. The combustion improvements associated with the introduction of iron (Ill) bromide were thus rigorously established and then related to the retention of the additive's cation, as indicated by SEM/EDX and ICP-MS.

40|$|Abstract – Numerous {{methods for}} {{processing}} of hydrogen chloride to chlorine are known. A traditional method is electrolysis of an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. Chemical methods include oxidation of hydrogen chloride by nitrogen oxides or air oxygen (with heating {{in the presence}} of <b>catalysts).</b> <b>Physical</b> methods are ultraviolet irradiation and the electrical pulse discharge. The present work deals with the possibility of converting HCl to molecular chlorine {{with the use of a}} nanosecond electron beam in liquid and gas phases and as an aerosol. The experiments were realized on a radiochemical installation based on a URT- 0. 5 accelerator (400 keV, 50 ns, 1 kW). It is shown that the highest conversion (up to 25 %) is achieved in aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid. The conversion in the irradiated gas phase is a maximum at the minimum pressure of the water vapor: not over 1 %. Irradiation of aerosols practically does not initiate the desired process. In the experiments, the adsorbed dose was 0. 16 to 1. 6 MGy. The use of hydrochloric acid more than 1 % strong does not increase the amount of chlorine and, therefore, for adaptation of this process to industrial requirements it is expedient to separate chlorine as crystalline hydrate. The process is realizable in a continuous regime and can be aimed at recycling of hydrochloric acid waste and production of chlorine-containing oxidizers and whiteners. The proposed process can also be used to disinfect water. The exposure of ~ 0. 02 % hydrochloric acid to an electron beam can provide a “chlorinating agent”. The addition of this “chlorinating agent ” to potable water will have an effect similar to chlorination. An advantage of this scheme is the elimination of poisonous molecular chlorine. Generally, the process can be referred to processes of “green chemistry ” as it does not require the use of high temperatures, dangerous reagents and solvents.

The research described investigates material property-reactivity relationships that influence the catalytic performance of early transition-metal carbides and nitrides for reactions involved in the conversion of biomass to liquid transportation fuels, namely selective hydrogenation of oxygenates, water-gas shift, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. 	In particular, this work focuses on understanding the role of three main <b>physical</b> properties on <b>catalyst</b> chemistry, composition, structure, and catalytic reactivity: hydrogen adsorption sites; surface redox chemistry; and strong metal-catalytic support interactions. Experimental and computational results indicate that molybdenum nitride contains hydrogen adsorption sites both on the surface (NH) and in the subsurface layers (MoH). The relative density of surface versus subsurface hydrogen {{was found to have}} a direct effect on the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, with materials consisting of 95 % subsurface hydrogen yielding ~ 93 % selectivity to crotyl alcohol (C=O hydrogenation). Another study compared the synthesis, structural and compositional properties, and water gas shift activities of catalysts produced by depositing platinum onto unpassivated and passivated molybdenum carbide. Passivation (controlled surface oxidation) {{had a profound effect on}} the character of interactions between the Pt and support resulting in deleterious effects on Pt loadings, structures, and water gas shift rates. In particular, the unpassivated support adsorbed 3 times as much Pt and exhibited water-gas shift turnover frequencies nearly 4 times higher than those for the passivated support. These differences were determined to result from redox chemistry occurring between molybdenum carbide and the depositing Pt. Lastly, the presence of strong interactions, facilitated at high temperatures, between a molybdenum carbide support and deposited early transition metals was probed using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Ruthenium and cobalt were found to be inactive when supported on molybdenum carbide but not on silica, a typical Fischer-Tropsch support. By avoiding high temperature treatments, addition of ruthenium to molybdenum carbide resulted in turnover frequencies 18 times higher than those of bare molybdenum carbide alone and 4 times that of ruthenium on silicon dioxide. These relationships between material properties and reactivity will help inform the design and synthesis for specific applications of these catalysts...|$|R
40|$|No {{product or}} {{destination}} will survive without positive and impactful web presence and continuous investment. A positive food image {{is crucial in}} destination promotion and {{a key factor in}} the selection of a destination (Beerli and Martin, 2004). Consequently, consumer-generated media is increasingly the most powerful vehicle for destination marketing which is challenging and disrupting traditional approaches. Social media and the internet have helped businesses galvanise the potential for promoting regional tourism, given they are relatively inexpensive compared with other advertising media. It is acknowledged that an effective website or social media presence can help products reach global audiences; accessible all day, from anywhere in the world. For tourists, the multimedia and interactive nature of social media is now fundamental, adding a new dimension to destination and product marketing. Findings are presented from a two-year study of the historic city of Cambridge. It is a city which has increasingly become regarded as a ‘clone town’ where alternative food producers are forced to occupy a periphery physical location because of the exorbitant cost of retail space {{in the heart of the}} city (a not uncommon situation for historic touristic cities). In this paper we present findings from a research project of the city’s main food event, the ‘Eat Cambridge Festival’ (#EAT). Eat Cambridge is a not for profit festival showcasing the city’s independent food scene. In 2014, a survey of 29 food traders and two interviews with key gatekeepers was undertaken to explore the impacts of the event. In 2015 the research was expanded to include 52 in-depth interviews with the event’s Director and all the producers trading at the event. Using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, #EAT supports local producers and provides a vehicle for celebration, collaboration and networking via its physical site and its online presence. This paper highlights the increasingly important role that social media has in marketing alternative food markets and for generating business. Moreover, the paper suggests that social media and the fostering of ‘digital capital’ is vital in helping local food producers resist the influence of powerful commercial interests in line with theoretical frameworks such as Chalip’s (2004) ‘event leverage model’. We found that #EAT is an example of an organisation using social media to disrupt ‘core’ food and drink offerings in the form of subtle resistance against powerful and economic forces. This paper presents rich and insightful qualitative and quantitative data to theorise how social media is being used to transcend core/peripheral spaces. The paper firstly draws on concepts of resistance (and specifically notions of ‘creative resistance’ (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987) and the transcendence of third spaces to explain the situation for local producers in the city. Secondly, #EAT is presented as an example of an event that provides a <b>physical</b> ‘in person’ <b>catalyst</b> to generate a long term relationship and nurture social media engagement, and helps solidify existing networks, whilst providing other alternative events that small businesses can benefit from. Finally, we argue that social media offers a vehicle of ‘traceability’, allowing consumers to literally ‘follow’ the producer and the food throughout the year; #EAT offers an ongoing digital presence and a ‘core’ position long after the temporary physical event is over...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} investigation on catalytic combustion of lean methane mixtures emitted from coal mine ventilation air. The study involves catalyst preparation, catalytic activity and stability evaluation under simulated ventilation air methane (VAM) gas, and understanding the catalyst deactivation phenomena. The investigation on the chemical and <b>physical</b> properties of <b>catalysts</b> employed a number of techniques including nitrogen physisorption, hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electronic microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Investigation {{on the influence of}} pre-treatment conditions on Pd/Al₂O₃catalysts discloses significant differences in the light off temperatures and the extent of coke deposition, depending on whether the catalysts were pre-treated under oxidising or reducing conditions. The oxidised palladium catalysts were reduced by methane under reaction conditions and exhibited similar activity compared to catalysts which were activated under hydrogen. The long-term stability tests of the catalysts prepared for this study suggest that the primary factor responsible for low temperature catalyst deactivation is the water vapour present in the feed stream. Although no palladium hydroxide phase was observed during short-term experiment, extended exposure to wet feed results in the formation of palladium hydroxide, which appears to match the progressive deactivation of the Pd/Al₂O₃catalyst. Introducing VAM dust causes a variation in catalytic activity originating from coal-dust ignition and the effect of chloride {{on the surface of the}} catalyst. Nevertheless, in the presence of inhibiting agents, an average methane conversion of higher than 75 % over 1, 100 h was achieved at reaction temperatures below 600 ºC. Although supported Pd catalysts are higher in activity, nano-sized Co₃O₄catalysts exhibit excellent stability. No changes in oxidation/chemical states were observed from the Co₃O₄catalyst after time on stream experiments. In contrast, the presence of strongly bonded hydroxyl species on the surface of Fe₂O₃catalysts highlights the role of water vapour in catalyst deactivation. Oxygen TPD shows that higher oxygen surface coverage of Co₃O₄is suggested to be responsible for a higher activity in comparison with Fe₂O₃catalysts. Co-precipitating gold particles with cobalt oxide or iron oxide does not enhance the activity of the catalyst, which is most likely due to blocking the active site of support by the gold particles. Enhanced hydrothermal stability was observed over a novel Pd/TS- 1 catalyst during 1, 900 h time-on-stream experiments, where a 90 % methane conversion level was successfully maintained at temperature < 500 °C. Surface oxygen mobility and coverage plays a major role for the activity and stability of this catalyst in the presence of a large excess of water. It was identified that water adsorption and in turn hydrophobicity of the catalyst support was a major factor influencing the long term stability of combustion catalysts. The hydrophobicity and competitive adsorption of water with oxygen is suggested to influence oxygen surface coverage and in turn apparent activation energy over the catalysts. Catalyst characterization of Pd/Al₂O₃confirms that the deactivation is due to palladium migration and particle growth and is the most prominent in the presence of water in the feed. The formation of α-Al₂O₃during long-term stability tests explains the changes in pore structures which is responsible for the re-dispersion of palladium particles. Four accelerated ageing procedures were performed with a target of mimicking the properties of long-term used catalysts. Interestingly, no formation of α-Al₂O₃phase was found from the aged catalysts suggesting that, the transformation of alumina phase occurs at a very slow rate. Among the four procedures, ageing under wet-oxygen in helium provides the most similarity to the properties of long-term used catalysts. Increasing the aging temperature up to 830 °C leads to depletion of surface palladium, which permanently reduces the performance of the catalyst...|$|R
