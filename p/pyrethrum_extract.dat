While <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>extract</b> is composed of 6 esters which are insecticidal, the semi-synthetic pyrethroid is a composed of only one chemically active compound. As a result, the liver has to break down these additional chains first, which allows the toxicity levels to rise within the bloodstream, which can lead to hospitalization and even death. [...] Therefore the use of pyrethrin in products such as natural insecticides and shampoos increases the likelihood of toxicity in mammals that are exposed. Medical cases have emerged showing fatalities from the use of pyrethrin, prompting many organic farmers to cease use.

40|$|Introduction – <b>Pyrethrum</b> <b>extract</b> is {{a mixture}} of six insecticidal {{compounds}} from the flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium L [...] Since they only have low to moderate mammalian toxicity they can be used as natural insecticides in agriculture or to develop low cost and safe dermatological formulations. Because of the thermal instability of pyrethrins, analytical methods based on liquid chromatography (LC) are preferred over those based on gas chromatography (GC). A few applications using LC with mass spectrometry detection are presented in the literature. Current protocols for their characterisation by LC rely on the use of less sophisticated detectors such as UV detection. Objective – To develop the first liquid chromatography‐electron ionisation‐mass spectrometry (LC‐EI‐MS) method for pyrethrins detection and quantitation in pyrethrum extracts. Methodology – A commercial <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>extract</b> and various samples of flower heads from C. cinerariaefolium L. were investigated using reversed‐phase nano‐liquid chromatography coupled to direct electron ionisation‐mass spectrometry (nanoLCdirect EI‐MS). The eluted compounds were identified through searches of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library, exploiting the direct EI capability to produce high quality EI mass spectra.

40|$|The {{escalating}} {{usage of}} pyrethroids {{has resulted in}} an increased awareness about resistance towards pyrethroids in insects. Pyrethroids inhibit voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSC) in nerve cell membranes and are composed of synthetic molecules based on pyrethrins present in <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>extracts</b> from Chrysanthemum species. VSSC are transmembrane proteins that are important for electric signalling over the membrane in insects. Mutations in the gene encoding the sodium channel {{have proved to be}} a common reason for resistance against pyrethroids. Pyrethroid resistance among pollen beetles is spread all over Sweden and also abroad and is increasing. Mapping of the gene encoding the VSSC and search for mutations known to provide resistance in insects is necessary to know if that is the reason for resistance in pollen beetles. The VSSC protein consists of four domains, where the first three domains already have been sequenced so what is left to do is to obtain the sequence encoding the fourth domain. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the DNA fragment out of the pollen beetle genome. The following step was to use ligation and transformation to verify the DNA fragment by sequencing of obtained clones. The experimental part with domain IV was successful and the sequence can be seen in appendix 2. However, the work to amplify the whole gene encoding the VSSC was difficult. Only one of all amplifications gave a DNA fragment of 6, 000 bp, so no further experimental work was possible. Pyrethroid resistance can also be due to increased metabolism by cytochrome P 450 (CYP). The experimental part with CYP aimed to sequence gene fragments encoding different CYP. Ligation and transformation of PCR products was repeated many times without any positive results. Amplified samples purified from agarose gels were sent for sequencing instead and the sequences can be seen in appendix 2...|$|R

Tasmanian pyrethrum production is among the most innovative, high-tech agricultural industries in the world. With an output that nearly quadrupled since 1996, Botanical Resources Australia (BRA) now supplies more then 30 % of the global pyrethrum markets. Developments such as vacuum precision direct seeding allowed dramatic expansion in the total area planted to pyrethrum which is now ~ 3, 000 ha. Using new generation cutter rower the flower is dried, pelletised and extracted. Initially the hexane extracted dark, treacly crude <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>extract</b> was exported to be refined overseas. BRA designed, built and commissioned a refinery in Tasmania during 1999. This environmental friendly process involving carbon dioxide was cutting edge technology. BRA is currently commissioning a new large-scale multi-purpose hexane extraction plant. The unique solvent-propellant properties of liquid carbon dioxide (CO 2) were the basis for the BOC global patent. This patent described Pestigas as a non-flammable, high-pressure (5, 000 kPa) aerosol spray (droplets range 2 - 20 µ) with natural pyrethrins as the quick knockdown, wide spectrum, non-residual and low mammalian toxicity insecticide. The non-flammable, liquid CO 2 solvent-propellant is recycled from by-product industrial processes. The small droplet size range (2 - 20 µ) of the particles formed results in the pyrethrins being suspended for ~ one hour.

Methods We compared efficacy of the new product to a positive dimeticone control group, a sample of four other insecticidal and natural head lice products marketed in Germany, and an untreated control. In a bioassay, lice were exposed ex vivo to products and examined for activity for up to 24 hours, following a standard protocol. Results After 6 and 24 hours, 13. 7 and 88. 5 % of untreated control lice did not show major vital signs. In contrast, no lice showed major vital signs 5 minutes after treatment with the new product or the control dimeticone group (NYDA ®). This effect persisted at all observation points (100 % efficacy). Efficacy of 0. 5 % permethrin (Infectopedicul ®) ranged between 76 and 96 % in evaluations between 5 min and 6 hours.

Pyrethrins are often used in household insecticides and for the control of parasites on pets or livestock. Maceration is the cheapest method, but the values of the percent of extracted material compared to the weight of the dried flowers are lower. The extraction with supercritical CO 2 is less efficient than the Naviglio extractor, but it has the advantage of not requiring the use of solvents. Consequently, all three techniques are valid for the extraction of compounds from pyrethrum flowers. The results obtained show that by suitably varying the parameters of the three extraction procedures, it is possible to obtain pyrethrin extracts for use in the production of low toxicity insecticides for warm-blooded animals and low pollution. In particular, extraction with supercritical CO 2 presents an additional advantage; although oleoresin is a natural product, its extraction involves the use of solvents, while SFE is a highly efficient extraction process due to the use of CO 2 in the supercritical phase without the use of solvents. On the other hand, the Naviglio extractor is an inexpensive technique and requires a minimum energy loss when compared to the extraction with supercritical fluids. Thus, the latter is more convenient on an industrial level but is not universally applicable. Nevertheless, the supercritical extraction {{can be used as a}} medium detergent of the oleoresin produced to avoid residues of the solvents left during the extraction process. Therefore, for demonstration purposes, for the SFE CO 2 extraction process, numerical simulations have been performed, allowing for helpful results to optimize the process for further tests...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: There {{are more}} than 500 {{different}} bacterial species in the oral cavity which can cause tooth decay and periodontal diseases. Anacyclus Pyrethrum {{has been used to}} manage dental and periodontal diseases in traditional Iranian medicine. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the antibacterial activity of Anacyclus Pyrethrum against some of the oral bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans,Streptococcus sanguis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Materials and Method: At first, The antibacterial effect of serial concentrations (1 / 10 to 1 / 100 mg/ml) of methanolic extract of Anacyclus Pyrethrum root were tested by using well assay method on Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the second examination, 150 - 1000 mg/ml concentrations were tested and the agar dilution method, recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Standards, was used. Then, the lowest concentrations of the extract which inhibited visible growth of organisms on the media plate; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), were determined. Results: The inhibition zone was only seen in the 1. 10 mg/ml concentration. The diameters were 15 and 12 mm in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguis agar media plate, respectively. In the second examination, the greatest inhibition zones were 27 mm for Staphylococcus aureus and 21 mm for Streptococcus sanguis in 1000 mg/ml. There was not any inhibition zone for Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the concentrations. The MBC was achieved as 800 mg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguis. Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew in all the concentrations. Conclusion: The antibacterial effect of Anacyclus <b>Pyrethrum</b> <b>extract</b> against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguis was not significant. Anacyclus Pyrethrum had no antibacterial effect against either Streptococcus mutans or Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethrum is a {{perennial}} daisy that is predominantly out-crossed. It is grown commercially in Tasmania for pyrethrins, which are {{extracted from the}} flowers and {{are used in the}} preparation of insecticides. A pyrethrum breeding program was conducted by the University of Tasmania from 1978 to 1998, with the aim of developing varieties suitable for Tasmanian growing and production systems. The primary selection character was pyrethrins yield, and the program consisted of population improvement through recurrent selection for two indirect selection characters; visually-estimated flower yield and the UV-assay of pyrethrins at a specific maturity stage (open but not over-blown). Varieties, consisting of either clones or single crosses between two clones, were selected from each successive recurrent selection generation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the selection methods used for the University's breeding program from the period of 1985 to 1998, and to assess the impact on breeding methods of the change in the mid- 1990 's from the establishment of the crop by clonal splits planted at a contant spacing (0. 5 m) to establishment by direct-drilling at a somewhat higher average plant density. Data records for the two main selection characters were analysed in order to identify genetic changes in the breeding population. This indicated {{that there had been a}} genetic gain in UV-assays but not in flower yield. The efficiency of direct selection for first year yields in the Univeristy's base population was compared with indices of the indirect selection characters and yield components. A trial was established to obtain estimates of genetic parameters to construct selection indices and predict selection responses. Estimated heritability was moderate for pyrethrins yeld (0. 26 - 0. 39) and for the yield components of pyrethrins content (0. 24 - 0. 34) and flower yield (0. 17 - 0. 30), and low for percent dry matter content (0. 00 - 0. 15). Estimates were also obtained for two product quality characters, both derived from the ratio of the six different esters that form the active product in the <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>extract.</b> Heritability for these character was moderate to high. The effect of planting density on selection for pyrethrins yield was also investigated. The index of the two indirect selection characters was the most efficient method for single-plant selection in the planting densities used commercially from 1980 to 1995. However, an index of component characters was more efficient for the densities currently used in commercial areas. There was evidence for a genotype-density interaction for flower and pyrethrins yield but not for percentage pyrethrins or the ratios of pyrethrins esters. The potential to reduce the length of the period of obligate vegetative growth through breeding was also assessed. There was evidence for significant level of additive genetic control for this character and it was concluded that the vegetative period could be reduced by recurrent selection. The performance of new synthetic varieties were evaluated and the relative merits of varieties derived from a single cross of two clones and polycross of several clones were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethrum is {{the name}} of a {{petroleum}} extract from the flower of the chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. This extract has been used commercially by the industrialised world as an insecticide for more than 150 years and even references as far back as Ming dynasty around year 70 AD have been found. The flower has been grown several places (Dalmatia, Japan, South America) but it has been proven that the content of the active constituents called pyrethrins are at its peak when the flowers are grown in places with 12 h daylight / 12 h (wich means around equator) and between 1700 - 2200 meters above sea level. Kenya with its great highland plains is one of todays major producers of <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>extract.</b> The flowerheads are handpicked by the farmer and the family and sold to the national Kenya Pyrethrum Bureau. The watercontent is reduced from 80 % to 10 % by drying in sunlight or by mechanical means. The first extraction gives a oleo-resin of dark brownish colour. After second extraction one get what is called a pale extract. This is used in for instance domestic insecticide sprays. The pyrethrins of pyrethrum are six closelly related esters (fig. 1). Analysis is performed by HPLC (liquid chromatography) or GC (gas chromatography). All the esters are fatsoluble and can be extracted with the lipids from for instance food objects treated with pyrethrum. WHO/FAO have established the maximum residue values for pyrethrins in different kind of food sold for human consumption. For dried cod who has been sprayed with pyrethrum to keep the flies away, the maximum residue leve 1 of pyrethrins is 3 mg/kg. Pyrethrins are readily broken down if ingested by varmblooded animals by the esterase activity in the stomach/gut. It is also relativly harmless when inhaled. Injected into the blood can the effect be lethal in smaller doses. Pyrethrum have been used as a cure for gastrointestinal parasites and doses up to 50 mg caused no negative effect to the host. There have never in the long history of pyrethrum been reported of death caused by overexposure. Pyrethrum has become interesting today because of the positive results conserning removing of salmon lice on salmon in fishfarming. Salmon lice cost norwegian farmers millions of US$ every year in loss of fish, devaluation of the fish due to wounds and buying of expencive chemicals to remove the lice. The chemicals in use are about to be abandoned because of ill effects to both farmers and environment. Pyrethrum is readily broken down in nature, in fact so fast that an antioxydant must be added. Mixed in water, pyrethrum is lethal to fish, but administered in an oil-layer on top of the cages, the salmon delouse themselves by jumping through this oil-layer. The pyrethrum in the oil selectivly kill the louse because the pyrethrins can pass their outer lipid membrane but the fish who have a water soluble mucus layer, are not affected. NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Pyretrum er navnet på et naturekstrakt fra blomsterhodene på en krysantemumblomst, Chrysantemum cinerariaefolium. Dette ekstraktet er et "gammelt" middel og har blitt brukt som et insekticid i lang tid. Glynne Jones, (1989) har laget et historisk sammendrag som strekker seg over 150 år. Den første kjente eksport fant sted fra Dalmatia (nå ca. Ungarn) til det vestlige Europa i 1820 og i 1825 fantes pyretrum pulver i de fleste apotek i den industrialiserte del av verden. Pyretrums bruk og virkning er veldokumentert på mange forskjellige arter av insekter. Staudinger & Ruzicka (1924) publiserte de første vitenskaplige artiklene omhandlende pyretrum og la grunnlaget for en vitenskaplig vurdering av pyretrum som insekticid. Rundt 1930 ble analysemetoder utviklet og gav en mulighet til å estimere aktiviteten til pyretrumprodukter. "The Association of Official Agricultural Chemists" - (AOAC) har utviklet en analysemetode for bestemmelse av total mengde pyretrum i ekstrakt. De første analysemetodene fant to aktive substanser i pyretrum som ble kalt pyretrin I og pyretrin II. Ved videre-utvikling av kjemiske kunnskaper og analysemetoder har det blitt funnet fire aktive substanser til. Disse seks forbindelsene er estere som refereres til under samlebetegnelsen pyretriner. Alle pyretrinene er fettløselige og dagens analysemetoder går ut på å ekstrahere dem ut sammen med fett og andre fettløselige stoffer. De må så skilles fra fettet og i enkelte tilfeller er det nødvendig med en omgang til med rensing/oppkonsentrering før de kan separeres med hjelp av kromatografiske metoder. I dag er det mest vanlig å benytte HPLC (væske-kromatografi) til den endelige bestemmelsen av mengde pyretriner i en prøve. Hovedprodusenten av pyretrum-ekstrakt er Kenya. De har enkelte år problemer med å holde en stabil produksjon p. g. a. tørke. Dette faktum kombinert med økende priser fikk i midten av 70 -årene amerikanerne til å fremstille syntetiske varianter av pyretrum, kalt pyretroider. Etter en stor tørke i 1976 tok de over mye av markedene i USA og Europa. I de kommersielle blandingene er som regel kun tale om et aktivt stoff. Det har vist seg at insekter kan bygge opp resistens mot disse. De brytes heller ikke så raskt ned som pyretrinene i naturlig pyretrum gjør. Ved avlusning av laks benyttes i dag Nuvan som er en farlig miljøgift, den er også helsefarlig for oppdretteren. Hvis vår arbeidshypotese er riktig; at pyretrum kan gjøre avlusningen med minst samme effektivitet og til konkurrerende pris, vil dette være av betydning av miljøhensyn og ikke minst for oppdretterne som da vil arbeide med et stoff som ikke er farlig for deres egen helse...|$|E
