An infinite-horizon {{stochastic}} DD problem: The cow replacement problem (Taken from Miranda and Fackler) Consider a stochastic infinite-horizon problem near to {{the hearts}} of any agricultural economist – the question of when to replace your dairy cow. Here’s how dairy cows work. They get pregnant; they give birth; and then they produce milk for a while. That sequence of events is one lactation cycle. In the Miranda and Fackler framework, they assume that a dairy cow can be used up to n 1 lactation cycles and its productivity {{can be one of}} n 2 classes. Each cow belongs to a <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> x yields qxy(s) tons of milk during the s th lactation cycle so that all cows follow the same pattern for their yields, but the level of their yields varies depending on the cows. The farmer does not know the <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> of a cow until after its first lactation. There are two state variables in this case,- the lactation cycle of the cow: s=lactation number of cowS 1 ={ 1, 2,…,n 1 }- the quality of the cow: x=cow qualityX={ 1, 2,…,n 2 } The choice variable is: z= 0 (keep cow), or z= 1 (replace) The state equation for the lactation number is simple...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between energy availability and species richness (the species-energy relationship) {{is one of}} the best documented macroecological phenomena. However, the structure of species distribution along the gradient, the proximate driver of the relationship, is poorly known. Here, using data on the distribution of birds in southern Africa, for which species richness increases linearly with energy availability, we provide an explicit determination of this structure. We show that most species exhibit increasing occupancy towards more productive regions (occurring in more grid cells within a <b>productivity</b> <b>class).</b> However, average reporting rates per species within occupied grid cells, a correlate of local density, do not show a similar increase. The mean range of used energy levels and the mean geographical range size of species in southern Africa decreases along the energy gradient, as most species are present at high productivity levels but only some can extend their ranges towards lower levels. Species turnover among grid cells consequently decreases towards high energy levels. In summary, these patterns support the hypothesis that higher productivity leads to more species by increasing the probability of occurrence of resources that enable the persistence of viable populations, without necessarily affecting local population densities. ...|$|E

40|$|Improvements in {{harvesting}} technologies, economic incentives, and {{the potential}} to control fire behavior have all led to an increased interest in harvesting woody biomass in Utah and other western states. Elevation, climate, and substrate are hugely variable in the west resulting in differing forest types, potential productivity, and large variations of possible biomass yield. Studies to determine biomass harvesting efficacy often include estimates of current growing stock by forest type, which helps answer questions regarding utilization potential and possible yield. However, projections of biomass yield, {{and the potential}} influence of active management on increasing yields, is rarely evaluated. Using Forest Inventory and Analysis data collected in Utah between 2000 and 2009, we compared potential biomass yield of managed and unmanaged stands for the major forest types in Utah. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator to make 100 year projections of standing biomass by forest type and potential <b>productivity</b> <b>classes.</b> Results showed that management resulted in increased growth of residual stands which translated into modest increases in total standing biomass over time. Increased residual growth {{as a result of}} management was more pronounced in productive forest types (e. g., spruce-fir or aspen) than less productive forest types (e. g., common pinyon or Utah juniper). Within forest type, sites with higher potential productivity had higher biomass yield projections than sites with lower potential productivity.

There are two maps: bedrock aquifer productivity and superficial deposits aquifer productivity. Version 1 of these datasets was produced in 2004. Version 2 uses updated geological linework and a slightly modified methodology. The aquifer productivity maps describe the potential of aquifers across Scotland to sustain various levels of borehole water supply, and the dominant groundwater flow types in each aquifer. The bedrock aquifer productivity map has five aquifer <b>productivity</b> <b>classes</b> (very high, high, moderate, low and very low); and three groundwater flow categories (significant intergranular flow; mixed fracture/intergranular flow; and fracture flow). The superficial deposits productivity map has four <b>productivity</b> <b>classes</b> (high; moderate to high; moderate; and a category to signify that a deposit is ‘not a significant aquifer’). All superficial deposits aquifers in Scotland are assumed to have primarily intergranular groundwater flow. The aquifer productivity maps are a tool to indicate the location and productivity of aquifers across Scotland.

The assessment included all of the inputs to establish a forest stand (seedlings, site preparation, and planting), to treat that stand through harvest maturity (thinning and fertilization) and to harvest the merchantable logs from the stand. To provide a region-wide representation under different management strategies, three forest management scenarios were structured for both the Southeastern U. S. and Pacific Northwest regions. Within each region, three combinations of management intensity and site productivity were allocated to acreages corresponding to the U. S.

This work aims to initiate the forest site classification for pine plantations in the southern Andean region of Ecuador. Forest productivity, estimated by the dominant height of 20 -year-old trees (DH 20), was related to data from climate, topography, and soil using 23 plots installed in pine plantations {{in the province of}} Loja. Forest site productivity was classified as: low (class C: 13. 4 m), middle (class B: 16. 6 m), and high (Class A: 22. 3 m). Strong determinants to differentiate the forest site classes were: the short to medium term available Ca and K stocks (organic layer + mineral soil standardized to a depth of 60 cm), soil acidity, the C:N ratio, clay and sand content, forest floor thickness, altitude, and slope. The lowest forest <b>productivity</b> (<b>Class</b> C) is mainly associated with the lowest short to medium term available K and Ca stocks. Whereas, in site classes with the highest forest productivity, pines could benefit from a more active microbial community releasing N and P, since the soil pH was about 1 unit less acidic.

One hundred five profiling flight lines totaling 9166 km were flown over the entire county; east-west. The lines, spaced 3 km apart north-south, duplicate the systematic pattern of the Norwegian Forest Inventory (NFI) ground plot arrangement, enabling the profiler to transit 1290 circular, 250 square meter fixed-area NFI ground plots while collecting the systematic LiDAR sample. Seven hundred sixty-three plots of the 1290 plots were overflown within 17. 8 m of plot center. Laser measurements of canopy height and crown density are extracted along fixed-length, 17. 8 m segments closest {{to the center of}} the ground plot and related to basal area, timber volume and above- and belowground dry biomass. Linear, nonstratified equations that estimate ground-measured total aboveground dry biomass report an R(sup 2) = 0. 63, with an regression RMSE = 35. 2 t/ha. Nonstratified model results for the other biomass components, volume, and basal area are similar, with R(sup 2) values for all models ranging from 0. 58 (belowground biomass, RMSE = 8. 6 t/ha) to 0. 63.

The aim of this paper was to test to what extent these factors affect the scaling exponents of two allometric relationships in pure, even-aged, canopy-closed forest stands: stem diameter (D) versus stem height (H) and versus stem density (N). Data were collected by tree species (Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea), wood <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> and reproductive mode (seed origin and sprouting stands) from published forest yield tables. Reduced major axis analysis was used to estimate the slopes of regression lines in the log-log space of H-D and D-N. The scaling exponent of the H-D relationship was significantly larger in birch than in beech stands (0. 897 versus 0. 745), and in low productivity, beech stands as compared with their high productivity counterparts (0. 876 versus 0. 745). However, no significant difference was detected between high stands and coppices of durmast oak. The scaling exponent of the D-N relationship was significantly larger in birch than in beech stands (- 0. 690 versus - 0. 558), in low than in high productivity beech stands (- 0. 694 versus - 0. 558), and in seed origin than in sprouting stands of durmast oak (- 0. 609 versus - 0. 580). We explained these results in terms of plant stem growth strategies and resource availability from a biomechanical perspective. Contrary to certain studies that have reported an invariant scaling relation between stem diameter and density across tree species and communities, but in accordance with other recent studies, we have brought new evidence on species-specific allometric scaling under self-thinning. In addition, we have revealed within-species variance of the scaling exponent of stem diameter-density relationship. </span...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{economics}} report 81. Cover title. "This manual supplements 'An iterative {{linear programming}} procedure for estimating patterns of agricultural land use,' {{by the present}} authors. " 28 p. tablesDevelopment of land resources poses many problems for the planning agency. From the viewpoint of the economist {{perhaps the most important}} problems are those relating to the desirability of a project in terms of some income or efficiency objective. Typically, a project objective is stated as the maximization of individual, regional, or national income depending upon the jurisdiction of the developing organization. To effectively evaluate a land development, in terms of its objectives, it is necessary to anticipate the pattern of land use that will likely result in the project area. This study presents a quantitative approach for estimating land use patterns when use of the project land is restricted to agriculture. Planning problems concerned with agricultural as compared to non-agricultural uses, project financing, conditions of repayment, and form of tenure are ignored. The empirical application of the estimating procedure consists of estimating land use patterns for a project currently being undertaken by the State of Hawaii. Objectives: The primary objective is to develop a procedure for estimating the perfect competition equilibrium production of several crops, on lands of varying quality, in spatially separated producing areas. Market supply and demand equations are include in the model so that the patterns of land use will be established by market forces. The model indicates, by physical land <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> and project area, the acreage used to produce each crop. It also gives the equilibrium market price and quantity supplied for each included commodity. The objective of the empirical applications of the model was to estimate patterns of land use based on different wage rate, labor availability, and unit size assumptions for several tracts of state-owned land that are included in a current development project. These lands, which are located at Waimanalo and Waianae Kai on the Island of Oahu and at Hoolehua on the Island of Molokai, make up the three project areas considered in this study. Procedure: The first step was to construct cost of production and yield budgets, by land <b>productivity</b> <b>class,</b> for a group of crops that represent most of the production alternatives faced by prospective farmers in the project areas. These budgets are based upon existing cost of production studies supplemented by interviews with crop specialists. Because of limited resources, only those crops for Which cost studies are presently available are included in the analysis. This group of crops includes pineapple, pasture, papaya, apple banana, tomatoes, snap-beans, cantaloupe and Manoa lettuce. Market supply and demand functions were developed for each crop and included in the estimating model. This was done in an effort to duplicate the market forces that actually contribute to the establishment of a land use pattern. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that all vegetable crop production will be sold on the Honolulu market. This market restriction is imposed because producers will not export until the Honolulu market price falls to a point Where export offers the most profitable outlet. This price would probably be somewhat lower than the West Coast price less transportation charges. Available information suggests that under prevailing management practices, which are assumed, this price would not be sufficient to cover production costs (39; 49, p. 11). The estimating model is an iterative linear programming system that allows for adjustments in supply from existing producers as price changes and does not permit production to exceed quantity demanded at any given price. This model constructs a static equilibrium for a specified number of crops while allowing them to compete with one another for scarce resources as they would in the market. The scarce resources are allocated to their most profitable use...|$|E
40|$|Forest carbon {{stocks and}} fluxes are highly dynamic {{following}} stand-clearing disturbances from severe fire and harvest and this presents a significant challenge for continental carbon budget assessments. In this work we use forest inventory data to parameterize a carbon cycle model to represent post-disturbance carbon trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes for specific forest types growing in {{high and low}} site <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> settings. We then apply these trajectories to landscapes and regions based on forest age distributions derived from either the FIA data or from Landsat time series stacks (1985 – 2006) for 54 representative scenes {{throughout most of the}} conterminous United States. Weestimate the net carbon uptake in forests caused by post-disturbance growth and decomposition (“regrowth sink”) for forested regions across the country. At the landscape scale, the prevailing condition of positive net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is in stark contrast to local patcheswith large sources, particularly in the west where fires and clear cuts create contiguous disturbed patches. At the continental scale, regional differences in disturbance rates reflect management patterns of high disturbance rates in the Southeastern and South Central states, and lower disturbance rates in the Northeast andNorthern Lakes States. Despite low contemporary disturbance rates in the Northeast and Northern Lakes States (0. 61 and 0. 74 % y− 1), the regrowth sink there remains of moderate to large strength (88 and 57 g C m− 2 y− 1) owing to the continued legacy from historical clearing. Large regrowth sinks are also found in the Southeast, South Central, and Pacific Southwest regions (85, 86, and 95 g C m− 2 y− 1) where disturbance rates also tend to be higher (1. 59, 1. 38, and 0. 93 % y− 1). Overall, the Landsat-derived disturbance rates are elevated relative to FIA-derived rates (1. 19 versus 0. 93 % y− 1) particularly for western regions. The differences only modestly adjust regional- and continental-scale carbon budgets, reducing NEP from forest regrowth by about 8 %...|$|E

Through statistical analysis (coefficient of determination - R 2 % and standard error of estimate – Syx%), graphical residual analysis and Cui-square analysis aiming set the best site classification model, were tested four (4) models namely: Schumacher, Chapman & Richards, Baily & Clutter (three parameters) and Prodan. From the best model was constructed the guide curve and adopted 20 ears old as reference age, with three site classes and was made mapping the area using the interpolation method inverse distance weight (IDW). It was built a data matrix consisting of dominant height and soil variables for correlation analysis and identification of soil factors limiting the height growth of P. caribaea v. hondurensis.

To better capture the productivity of a software engineer and his value to a company, the productivity problem is reformulated here as a pattern recognition problem and solved using clustering. By defining a general productivity operator, clustering has been used to map the domain of the productivity operator to a range of <b>productivity</b> <b>classes.</b> This new approach has been successfully applied to randomly generated project data and actual project data from the NASA SATC software metric database. ...|$|R

This research examined the farm-gate price needed for switchgrass to provide per-acre net returns equal to those obtained from traditional crops in south central North Dakota. Future production costs for switchgrass and net returns from traditional crops were estimated for three soil <b>productivity</b> <b>classes</b> and also were developed to reflect the historical revenue and cost patterns associated with producers who are typically more or less profitable (i. e., average net return per acre) than regional averages. Prices were calculated using an annualized equivalent analysis of switchgrass production costs and net returns from traditional crops from 2008 through 2017. Switchgrass production costs ranged from just over $ 40 per ton on marginal soils to $ 34. 80 per ton on highly productive soils. Breakeven switchgrass prices across the three soil <b>productivity</b> <b>classes</b> ranged from $ 47 per ton in the low productivity soils to $ 76 per ton in the most productive soils. Production costs for low-profit producers were estimated at $ 47 per ton, compared to the regional average of $ 37. 50 per ton. Switchgrass production costs for the remaining profitability groups ranged from about $ 33. 50 per ton to about $ 36. 75 per ton. The breakeven farm-gate price for switchgrass ranged from $ 56 per ton for the two lowest profitability groups to over $ 94 per ton for the most profitable producers. A key economic criterion influencing the breakeven price for switchgrass will be the foregone net revenue from displaced traditional crops. On marginal soils, just under one-third of the breakeven price {{was derived from the}} level of foregone net returns from traditional crops; whereas, over 80 percent of the breakeven price was derived from the level of foregone net returns from traditional crops on the most productive soils. As net returns from traditional crops decreased the more that breakeven switchgrass prices approached production costs for switchgrass. Under current conditions of high input costs, escalating transportation costs, and given the increases in net returns from traditional crops, switchgrass, as a feedstock to a cellulosic ethanol plant, will be more expensive than previously estimated. switchgrass, production costs, farm-gate price, North Dakota, soil productivity, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{internship}} was to implement a motivationally based remedial reading program, using principles of behaviour modification, designed to improve the performance of seven grade five children who were severely retarded in reading and were apathetic to improvement. A related aim was to provide school personnel with some evaluative data concerning the efficacy of behaviour modification as a practical technique to apply in the remediation of reading difficulties. [...] Subjects {{of the study were}} five girls and two boys who lived in the Shea Heights area of St John's. They ranged in chronological age from twelve to fourteen and in mental age from 8 - 4 to 12 - 5 years. The students attended St. John Bosco School where they received regular class instruction which was supplemented by help in reading given in another classroom by a remedial teacher. Each student had a history of academic failure and was retarded by at least two years in reading achievement. Most were from low socioeconomic families and all were highly negative in their attitudes toward school. [...] The internship covered a period of approximately seven weeks. During this time the intern worked with the subjects' remedial teacher in carrying out the procedures designed to fulfill the purposes of the study. These procedures included diagnosing the subjects' instructional needs in reading, planning and implementing effective remedial reading instruction, and establishing a token reinforcement system whereby students received reward contingent upon their performance in specified reading activities. [...] The effectiveness of the internship in achieving its purposes was reflected by desirable changes in students' reading achievement, <b>productivity,</b> <b>class</b> attendance, and attitudes toward school. The subjects showed gains in reading achievement of 0. 3 years in vocabulary and 0. 8 years in comprehension which, when compared with anticipated growth, were statistically significant for comprehension (p. 10). The students accomplished more and better work. Attendance figures improved for those whose rate of absenteeism had been high. Attitudes toward school became more positive through increased enjoyment of remedial class sessions and heightened enthusiasm for school work. [...] It was concluded that the internship was generally effective in achieving its purposes. Recommendations were made to school personnel concerning the application of behaviour modification techniques to the remediation of reading difficulties...|$|E

Both abiotic resource availability and biotic interactions during forest succession affect C accumulation rates and maximum C stocks. However, the timing and controls on the peak and decline in C accumulation rates as stands age, trees increase in size, and canopy gaps become prevalent are not well-understood. Our study examines measured change in live and dead woody C pools from 8767 inventory plots on 9. 1 million ha of Pacific Northwest National Forest lands to determine how the balance of tree growth, mortality, and dead wood decomposition varied by stand age, plant community type, and site productivity; and to compare the contribution of different tree sizes to C accumulation. Maximum non-mineral soil C for old-growth stands varied significantly by <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> within plant community types, but on average stands accumulated 75 % of maximum stocks by age 127 ± 35 yr. We did not see a decline in net primary production of wood (NPP[subscript]w) with age in moderate and low-productivity classes, but found a 33 % reduction in high-productivity classes. Mortality increased with stand age such that net change in live tree biomass, and change in total woody C, was not significantly different from zero in old-growth stands over age 400 (0. 15 ± 0. 64 Mg C·ha⁻¹·yr⁻¹ for woody C). However, significant though modest C accumulation was found in forests 200 – 400 yr old (0. 34 – 0. 70 Mg C·ha⁻¹·yr⁻¹, depending on age class). Mortality of trees > 100 cm diameter exceeded or equaled NPP[subscript]w, but trees were growing into the larger sizes at a high-enough rate that a net increase in large tree C was seen across the region. Although large trees accumulated C at a faster rate than small trees on an individual basis, their contribution to C accumulation rates was smaller on an area basis, and their importance relative to small trees declined in older stands compared to younger stands. In contrast to recent syntheses, our results suggest that old-growth and large trees are important C stocks, but they play a minor role in additional C accumulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work performed in Task 11 "Modelling Young's modulus on small clear specimens in relation to silvicultural treatments" was the modelling of Young's modulus (MOE) on small clear specimens of 24 Belgian Norway spruces in relation with the silvicultural treatment. The {{aim of the research}} was also to compare Young's modulus on small clear specimens with Young's modulus on commercial size specimens with a view to defining the rate of prediction of wood quality of specimens including the natural timber defects. This work is corresponding to one task among the twelve of a large ECC Project entitled "SilvicuItural control and non destructive assessment of timber quality in plantation grown Spruces and Douglas fir" for which 210 trees have been sampled through 6 different European countries. The experimental raw material comes from the southern and eastern part<; of Belgium and concerns four different kinds of stands characterized by the site <b>productivity</b> <b>class</b> and the thinning intensity. Within each stand, the trees have been sampled in three different social positions classes. The small clear specimens have been marked off with reference to the radial and axial positions inside the 24 trees. On the whole 350 clear wood specimens have been selected and tested by two different laboratories in order to get young's modulus by a non destructive four points flexural method described by the French Standard NF B 51 - 016. Young's modulus appears to be positively related with specific gravity and negatively related with growth ring width. Stands growing on high productive sites or those submitted to low thinnings and also suppressed trees give rise to a stiffer wood. Among all these factors, only the social position of the tree within the stand influences significantly the Young's modulus values. Nevertheless, a slow growth producing a heavier timber is not always linked with a stiffer wood. Young's modulus differences between juvenile and adult wood vary in connection with the specific gravity class considered. In other words, juvenile wood is stiffer than adult wood when referring to low density classes, but adult wood becomes stiffer than juvenile wood when referring to high density classes. That means that the stiffness of adult wood is more sensitive to changes in specific gravity than the stiffness of juvenile wood. The distribution of Young's modulus in relation with specific gravity shows a higher variability when specific gravity increases. In searching the reasons for a higher Young's modulus variability when specific gravity increases by looking back to the population of clear specimens, we point out a very low slope of grain on some specimens and above all the presence of compression wood on other specimens. When rejecting these defects, then it appears that Young's modulus is more strongly related to specific gravity, thus giving rise to more accurate models. Among all these models, the best one is corresponding to a combination of variables such as specific gravity and growth ring width per sampling level within the tree. The variance analysis of residues of each model has revealed a tree effect always very highly significant. On the opposite, the other factors, as site productivity, thinning intensity and social position of the tree within the stand, have no significant effect on Young's modulus values. That means that inter trees variability is far higher than the other sources of variation (intra tree variability, site productivity variability, thinning intensity variability and social position variability). This also means that the general model established is valid whatever the silvicultural treatment could be...|$|E
40|$|Within the Kyoto Protocol, {{the clean}} {{development}} mechanism (CDM) is an instrument intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development, with the multiple goals of poverty reduction, environmental benefits and cost-effective emission reductions. The CDM {{allows for a}} small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon ‘sink’ projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27 % in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land <b>productivity</b> <b>classes.</b> If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Dead {{trees are}} an {{important}} part of the forest ecosystem and their attributes have been studied at the stand scale. However, their distribution over a large region has rarely been examined. In this study, the distribution and dynamics of sound wood in dead trees and the ratio of dead to live trees across the Arkansas landscape were analyzed using U. S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis data. These data showed that deadwood volumes followed patterns of potential timberland productivity. Values were lowest in the northwestern portion of the State and increased to the south and east. For potential timberland productivity in the range of 20 - 49 ft 3 per acre per year, mean deadwood volume was 52 ft 3 per acre. Where potential site productivity was high (range = 165 - 224 ft 3 per acre per year), mean deadwood volume was 177 ft 3 per acre. The ratio of the number of dead trees to number of live trees was not statistically significant among potential site <b>productivity</b> <b>classes.</b> Across all sites the ratio of dead to live trees was 0. 089 (95 percent confidence interval = ± 0. 009).
