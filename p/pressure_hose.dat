25|$|Remote lines: Used to {{increase}} maneuverability, a remote {{line is a}} high- <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> connecting the fuel tank to the marker allowing the tank to be stored in a backpack or harness. It is mostly found in Mil-Sim, woodsball and scenario events.|$|E
25|$|A medium (intermediate) <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> is used {{to carry}} {{breathing}} gas (typically at between 8 and 10 bar above ambient) from the first stage regulator to the second stage, or demand valve, which is held in the mouth by the diver, or attached to the full face mask or diving helmet.|$|E
25|$|The reach method, (or hose trace method), is {{the most}} {{reliable}} as it will work in all cases where the DV is not snagged somewhere. The diver reaches back over the right shoulder to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> feeding the DV, and loops thumb and fingers round the hose, then slides the hand along the hose, pulling it forward and over the shoulder until the DV is in the right hand, at which stage it can be turned the right way round and replaced in the mouth.|$|E
40|$|Tendencies of {{development}} {{of ways of}} protection of a hydraulic drive of vehicles from unauthorized emission of working liquid at destruction of high pressure holes are analyzed. The analysis of work of traction vehicles, detects the reasons at {{which there is a}} destruction of high <b>pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> of hydraulic system and the emission in the atmosphere of working liquid that violate environmental safety. Technical solution is proposed for elimination of negative consequences of destruction of high <b>pressure</b> <b>hoses,</b> which authorâ€™s rights are protected by the patent. Its essence is, that the locking device is further supplied with a rod with the axial through channel, which will allow a plunger in case of a gap of head <b>pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> reliably to block radial holes in a rod, to provide that high reliability of the overlap of supply of working liquid in head <b>pressure</b> <b>hoses</b> in case of their destruction and effective protection of hydraulic drive against unauthorized emission of working liquid...|$|R

25|$|As {{a nearly}} {{universal}} standard practice in modern recreational diving, the typical single-hose regulator has a spare demand valve fitted for emergency {{use by the}} diver's buddy, typically {{referred to as the}} octopus because of the extra hose, or secondary demand valve. The octopus was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO around 1965-6 to support the free dive attempts of Jacques Mayol. Woodward believed that having the safety divers carry two second stages would be a safer and more practical approach than buddy breathing {{in the event of an}} emergency. The medium <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> on the octopus is usually longer than the medium <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> on the primary demand valve that the diver uses, and the demand valve and/or hose may be colored yellow to aid in locating in an emergency. The secondary regulator should be clipped to the diver's harness in a position where it can be easily seen and reached by both the diver and the potential sharer of air. The longer hose is used for convenience when sharing air, so that the divers are not forced to stay in an awkward position relative to each other. Technical divers frequently extend this feature and use a 5-foot or 7-foot hose, which allows divers to swim in single file while sharing air, which may be necessary in restricted spaces inside wrecks or caves.|$|E
25|$|Some dive {{computers}} {{are designed to}} measure, display, and monitor pressure in the diving cylinder. This can be very beneficial to the diver, but if the dive computer fails the diver can no longer monitor his or her gas reserves. Most divers using a gas-integrated computer will also have a standard air pressure gauge. The computer is either connected to the first stage by a high <b>pressure</b> <b>hose,</b> or has two parts - the pressure transducer on the first stage and the display at the wrist or console, which communicate by wireless data transmission link; the signals are encoded to eliminate the risk of one diver's computer picking up a signal from another diver's transducer or radio interference from other sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E

25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the pressure relief valve on the first stage opens, or a low <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the cylinder drops to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|E
500|$|Another {{potentially}} deadly threat to respiration is {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT), in which blood forms a clot in immobile limbs; the clot can break off and form a [...] pulmonary embolism, lodging in the lung and cutting off blood supply to it. DVT [...] is an especially high risk in SCI, particularly within 10 days of injury, occurring in over 13% in the acute care setting. [...] Preventative measures include anticoagulants, <b>pressure</b> <b>hose,</b> and moving the patient's limbs. The usual {{signs and symptoms of}} DVT and pulmonary embolism may be masked in SCI cases due to effects such as alterations in pain perception and nervous system functioning.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom, has a {{standardised}} {{range of}} metric hose diameters: 7, 9, 12.5 and 15 cm (2.8, 3.5, 4.9 and 5.9 in), {{with the two}} smallest diameters sometimes used twined to provide adequate flow rates. Within this range, the [...] hoses are fitted with [...] "Instantaneous Couplings"; the [...] hoses have Storz couplings; and the [...] hose comes in two types, one with [...] "Instantaneous Couplings" [...] and one with Storz fittings. Fire Service Manuals provide tables of maximum volumetric flow rates for a given pump <b>pressure,</b> <b>hose</b> diameter and total hose length.

2500|$|Gas leaks: [...] Air leaks can {{be caused}} by burst or leaky hoses, {{defective}} o-rings, blown o-rings, particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low <b>pressure</b> <b>hose</b> will usually lose gas faster than a burst high <b>pressure</b> <b>hose,</b> as HP hoses usually have a flow restriction orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke clamp seal extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or elastic deformation of the clamp by impact with the environment.|$|E
