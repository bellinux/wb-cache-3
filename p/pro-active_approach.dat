The result would be that all mandatory sentences would contravene Article 21. The Court of Appeal held {{that this was not}} the law applicable in Singapore. The Court was also of the opinion that in India Article 21 was given relative pride of place in its constitutional framework due to the [...] "economic, social and political conditions prevailing in India and the <b>pro-active</b> <b>approach</b> of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India". The situation in Singapore was different. Finally, the Court gave two reasons for declining to imply a provision against inhuman punishment into Article 9(1). Singapore's constitutional history was markedly different from that of other Commonwealth countries, and its Constitution does not contain express prohibitions against cruel and inhuman punishments as it is not modelled upon the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission specifically considered whether to include a constitutional provision against inhuman punishment. However, the proposal was not taken up by the Government.|$|E

30|$|Failure {{probability}} in grid computing environments {{is potentially}} higher {{due to its}} heterogeneous nature as compared to other conventional parallel computing environments (Nazir et al. 2012). Therefore, {{it is critical to}} perform beforehand measures to address the expected or even unexpected problems. Fault tolerance in grid environments can be divided into two major categories, namely: (a) fault tolerance using <b>pro-active</b> <b>approaches</b> and (b) post-active approaches (Garg and Singh 2011; Ganga et al. 2012). <b>Pro-active</b> fault tolerant <b>approaches</b> consider failures proactively before scheduling jobs on grid resources. Fault prediction and fault forecasting techniques are used in designing a proactive fault tolerant approach (Haider 2007; Haider and Ansari 2012). Proactive fault tolerance is relatively diffcult to implement as compared to reactive or post-active fault tolerant approaches (Zhang et al. 2009). Proactive fault tolerance approaches require different types of faults related knowledge with respect to the future (Haider and Ansari 2012). In the literature, most of the work regarding fault tolerance is based on post-active approaches rather than the <b>pro-active</b> <b>approaches</b> (Garg and Singh 2011; Haider and Ansari 2012). On the other hand, a post-active fault tolerant technique reacts or activates after the encountered failures. Reactive or post-active techniques uses fault identification techniques before responding to the occurred faults and only the identified faults can be tolerated (Haider et al. 2007). For example, if a network failure has occurred and a grid node is not responding due to the network failure, then a response to such a state could be {{in the form of a}} retry or replication (Haider et al. 2011). Here, retry or replication is the fault tolerant technique that will be applied after an identified problem, such as a network failure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis C viral (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a significant}} public health problem. In the UK, an estimated 200, 000 individuals have active HCV infection, {{most of whom are}} injecting drug users (IDUs). Many IDUs spend time within the prison system therefore screening for HCV infection in this setting is important. However, uptake of testing within prisons is very low. Methods Qualitative interview study. 30 interviews with 25 male and 5 female prisoners with a history of injecting drug use. Results Personal and institutional barriers to uptake of testing for HCV were identified. Personal barriers included: prisoners' fears and lack of knowledge about HCV, low motivation for testing, lack of awareness about the testing procedure, and concerns about confidentiality and stigma. Institutional barriers included: the prisons' applications procedure for testing, inadequate pre- and post-test discussion, lack of <b>pro-active</b> <b>approaches</b> to offering testing, and lack of continuity of care on discharge and transfer. Conclusion This study highlights potential areas of development in the management of HCV in prisons. Further research is needed to evaluate care pathways for HCV in the prison setting and to develop and assess interventions to improve the uptake of testing for HCV by prisoners. </p...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial with assignment to either usual care or case-management by district nurses, among informal caregivers of older adults with dementia symptoms who live at home and the older adults who receive informal care. METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomized controlled trial, effectiveness as well as cost-effectiveness of case-management is evaluated. It concerns case-management in early-detected patients with dementia symptoms and their primary informal caregivers. Participants are followed up to twelve months after baseline assessment. The main outcome measure of the effect evaluation is the caregiver's sense of competence to care for the older person with dementia symptoms. The economic evaluation is performed from a societal perspective. DISCUSSION: This is one of the first trials on case-management that includes an economic evaluation. In addition, it concerns a tailor-made intervention in early-detected patients with dementia symptoms and their caregivers. The results of this randomized controlled trial will provide valuable information for health professionals and policy makers on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early tailor-made case-management for patients and their informal caregivers.

40|$|Abstract — Various {{mechanisms}} for fault-tolerance (FT) are used today {{in order to}} reduce the impact of failures on application execution. In the case of system failure, standard FT mechanisms are checkpoint/restart (for reactive FT) and migration (for pro-active FT). However, each of these mechanisms create an overhead on application execution, overhead that for instance becomes critical on large-scale systems where previous studies have shown that applications may spend more time checkpointing state than performing useful work. In order to decrease this overhead, researchers try to both optimize existing FT mechanisms and implement new FT policies. For instance, combining reactive and <b>pro-active</b> <b>approaches</b> in order to decrease the number of checkpoints that must be performed during the application’s execution. However, currently no solutions exist which enable the evaluation of these FT approaches through simulation, instead experimentations must be done using real platforms. This increases complexity and limits experimentation into alternate solutions. This paper presents a simulation framework that evaluates different FT mechanisms and policies. The framework uses system failure logs for the simulation with a default behavior based on logs taken from the ASCI White at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We evaluate the accuracy of our simulator comparing simulated results with those taken from experiments done on a 32 -node compute cluster. Therefore such a simulator can be used to develop new FT policies and/or to tune existing policies. I...|$|R
