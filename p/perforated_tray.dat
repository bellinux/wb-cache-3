50|$|The trays or plates used in {{industrial}} distillation columns are fabricated of circular steel plates and usually installed inside the column at intervals of about 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 inches) up {{the height of}} the column. That spacing is chosen primarily for ease of installation and ease of access for future repair or maintenance. An example of a very simple tray is a <b>perforated</b> <b>tray.</b> The desired contacting between vapor and liquid occurs as the vapor, flowing upwards through the perforations, comes into contact with the liquid flowing downwards through the perforations. In current modern practice, as shown in the adjacent diagram, better contacting is achieved by installing bubble-caps or valve caps at each perforation to promote the formation of vapor bubbles flowing through a thin layer of liquid maintained by a weir on each tray.|$|E

40|$|The {{occasional}} {{structural failure}} of distillation and absorption trays operating at low vapour rates has been attributed {{in the literature}} to fatigue of tray parts caused by flow-induced vibration. We suggest that synchronous oscillation of gas flow through tray perforations can occur when the perforations are evenly spaced, and the velocity through them is not too high. The controlling mechanism {{is that of a}} Helmholtz resonator, in which an oscillating mass of liquid near to each perforation cyclically exchanges kinetic energy with potential energy (head) in the bulk liquid across the tray. The rate of exchange is limited by the wave speed in the bulk liquid. A correlation scheme is suggested for the oscillation frequency based on literature data. We show that effective elastic constants can be calculated for <b>perforated</b> <b>tray</b> panels, and draw attention to the stress concentration around holes near the tray edge that exposes trays to fatigue cracking during vibration. Vibration analysis of an idealised tray structure identified the first 30 modes with resonant frequencies between 25 and 70 Hz, the range where excitation by flow-induced pressure pulsations is possible. Recommendations are made to avoid vibrational damage caused by such pulsations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Complete {{adhesion}} of {{the impression}} materials to trays {{is important to}} prevent impression materials from being pulled away from trays during removed from the mouth {{and to ensure that}} the direction of polymerization shrinkage will be towards the tray. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of two retention features of custom trays (adhesive vs holes) on the dimensional accuracy of master casts made from two alginate impression materials. Materials and methods: In this in vitro study, 88 impressions were made in eight groups (n= 11) of a stainless steel model with three index studs and then poured with a Type III dental stone. Three variables were considered: type of irreversible hydrocolloid material, retentive perforations in impression trays and application of a spray-on tray adhesive. The distances between the reproduced index studs were measured to ± 0. 01 mm with a digital caliper. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, ANOVA and t-test were used for data analysis (α= 0. 05). Results: ANOVA revealed significant differences between the groups only in the vertical dimension (p value = 0. 001). There were significant differences between the two tray and alginate types only in the vertical dimension (p value < 0. 001 and p value = 0. 011). There were no significant differences between the adhesive and non-adhesive groups. There were significant differences in the means of all the dimensions of the two trays as compared with master model. Iralgin alginate group exhibited significant differences in the means of all the three variables compared to the main cast; Xantalgin alginate exhibited differences only in the longitudinal dimension. Non-adhesive group exhibited significant differences in all the three dimensions but the adhesive group did not reveal significant differences only in the vertical dimension. Conclusion: <b>Perforated</b> <b>tray,</b> Xantalgin alginate and use of adhesive produced more accurate casts in all the dimensions compared to corresponding groups. In cases in which an adhesive is not used dimensional accuracy will improve via perforated trays. By using an adhesive with non-perforated tray, Xantalgin alginate has more accurate results; use of an adhesive along with perforated trays produces better results with Iralgin alginate, but no improvements are achieved with Xantalgin.

Experiments were conducted on a 2. 44 m diameter air-water distillation simulator, in which {{flow patterns}} were investigated by direct observation, using directional flow pointers; by water cooling, to simulate mass transfer; and by height of clear liquid measurements across the tray. The flow rates used are typical of those found in practice. The approach adopted {{was to investigate the}} effect of the gas flow on the liquid flow by comparing water only flow patterns across an unperforated tray with air-water flow patterns on <b>perforated</b> <b>trays.</b> Initial gas-liquid contacting experiments on the 6. 35 mm hole tray showed that, under certain conditions, the gas flow pattern beneath the test tray can {{have a significant effect on}} the tray liquid flow pattern such that gas-driven liquid circulation was produced. This was found to be a function of this particular air-water simulator design, and as far as is known this is the first time that this phenomenon has been observed. Consequently non-uniform gas flow effects were removed by modification of the gas distribution system. By eliminating gas circulation effects, the effect of the gas flow on the separation of liquid flow was similar to that obtained on the 1. 0 mm hole tray (Hine, 1990). That is, flow separation occurred at the ends of the inlet downcomer which produced large circulating zones along the tray segments both on the non-perforated and <b>perforated</b> <b>trays.</b> The air when forced through the liquid, inhibited circulating flow such that it only occurred at high water inlet velocities. With the 6. 35 mm hole tray, the growth and velocity of circulating flow was reduced at high superficial air velocities, and in the experiments to simulate distillation, liquid was in forward flow over most of the tray...|$|R

40|$|The {{simulation}} of batch distillation columns during start-up operations {{is a very}} challenging modelling problem because of the complex dynamic behaviour. Only few rigorous models for distillation columns start-up are available in literature and generally required a lot of parameters related to tray or pack geometry.

40|$|At King Saud University's College of Dentistry, final {{impressions}} for removable partial dentures {{are made}} using polysulfide rubber, fast-set and regular set irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials. Custom trays used are either single-spaced or double spaced. Further, impression material {{attachment to the}} tray could be through tray perforations {{or the use of}} adhesives. Literature to support each one of these methods separately to obtain an "accurate impression" is available. There is, however, a dearth on literature reporting on the influence of these combined variables. The purpose of this investigation was to simultaneously study the influence of impression material type, tray space and method of tray attachment on the accuracy of the resulting cast dimensions. A factorial experimental design was used. One master model representing a Kennedy Class III Modification 2 partial edentulous arch was used. Three reference points A, B, and C were placed on the master cast and reproduced on all experimental casts. Ten combined variables of tray space (2), impression material (3), and method of tray attachment (2) were used. Eight casts were made utilizing each of the combined variables resulting in 80 experimental casts. The dimensions AB, AC and BC were accurately measured (+ 10 /jm) on the master model and all experimental casts. Each measurement was repeated twice and averaged resulting in 480 experimental measurements (80 casts x 3 dimensions x 2 readings). One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to discern differences between the dimensions of the master model and those of casts produced by each of the combined variables including the effect of the impression material. Tukey's standardized range test was used to discern accuracy differences among the combined variables. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences for the dimensions A-B, A-C, or B-C between the master model and those produced by the ten combined variables. Nonetheless, the mean B-C dimensions on casts produced by the ten combined variables tended to be smaller (though not significantly) than for the master model. Further, while {{there were no significant differences}} for the dimensions A-B and A-C among casts produced by the ten combined variables, significant differences were detected for the B-C dimension. Casts poured in regular set alginate impressions in single spaced <b>perforated</b> <b>trays</b> showed significantly larger B-C dimension than those derived from fast-set alginate impressions in double spaced <b>perforated</b> <b>trays</b> (P< 0. 05).

Chepil (4) noted {{that some of the}} coaxse soil grains left loose on the surface following rainfall contributed to the ini-tial stages of wind erosion. Such coarse grains remain on the surface after dispersal of surface soil by raindrop impact and splash (3, 4). Crust formation associated with rainfall presumably would reduce wind erosion by increasing bulk density and lowering aggregation (8). Soil crust-ing is also associated with soil salinity (2, 3, 7, 9, 10). Wind erodibility of soiIs following rainstorms of various intensities and relatively short dura-tions have not been studied extensively.

Before, the resin became rubbery, a metal nut with retentive threads was embedded so that an eye bolt could be thread into it for attachment during tensile testing. The specimens were stored in ambient air for 24 hours before testing. Ten specimens were exposed to freshly prepared 1 : 213 iodophor and additional 10 resin specimens were exposed to freshly made 10 % sodium hypochlorite disinfectant solution. The specimens were stored in sealed plastic bags for 24 hours. The remaining 10 specimens served as control. After application of adhesive, addition reaction silicone impression material was injected over the tray specimens. The force necessary to separate the impression from the tray material was recorded using Instron Universal Load Testing Machine. The {{results indicated that the}} use of iodophor and sodium hypochlorite disinfectant solutions reduced the bond strength of impression adhesive system to autopolymerizing resin tray compared to control (iodophor =. 38 MPa, sodium hypochlorite =. 49 MPa, control. 52 MPa). It is therefore suggested to <b>perforate</b> the <b>tray</b> at the construction stage and disinfected in the laboratory to overcome the reduced bond strength of polyvinyl silicone impression adhesive/system to tray material.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the dimensional stability of heavy and light bodied condensation silicones after immersion in disinfectant solution for 10 or 20 minutes. The impression materials were Optosil Comfort and Xantopren VL Plus and the disinfectant solutions were 1 % sodium hypochlorite and 2 % glutaraldehyde. Impressions were made on a <b>perforated</b> stainless steel <b>tray,</b> according to the American Dental Association specification No. 19, adding up to a total of 50 samples. The double mixing method (one time, two viscosities) was used. Impressions were removed from the roulette block after 7 minutes to ensure complete curing and then immersed in the solutions. Impressions not submitted to treatment composed the control group. After these steps, the impressions were removed from the solution, rinsed in running water and air-dried. Three-dimensional measurements were calculated using an optic microscope graduated at 0. 001 mm. The two-way ANOVA indicated no differences (p> 0. 05) for any combination between variables. The results showed that the solution studied can be safely used to disinfect condensation silicone in clinical prosthodontic procedures...|$|R
40|$|Dimensional {{changes are}} a common {{occurrence}} in impressions, either during or after impression taking. It produces {{a difference in the}} dimensions of the object and the model, which leads to the restoration being ill-fitted. Several causal factors have been proposed such as friction between the impression material and the teeth, the bulk of the impression material, the type of impression materials used, the impression technique, the pouring time and many others. The exact causal factor is still unknown and the dimensional change mechanism is still poorly understood. The objective of this research was to investigate the role of the perforation on the ring trays in producing dimensional changes in the impression by using perforated and non-perforated ring trays. Alginate impressions were made on the frustum of cone metal master die with a 7. 08 mm base diameter, 7. 03 mm top diameter and 9. 23 mm height using perforated and non-perforated ring trays with 9. 40 mm in diameter and 14. 17 mm in height. The dimensional change was determined by comparing the dimension of the dental stone die and its metal master die. The results showed that the percentage of dimensional changes that occurred by using <b>perforated</b> ring <b>tray</b> were (+) 0. 56 ± 0. 40 on the top area, (-) 3. 54 ± 2. 92 on base area and (+) 1. 54 ± 0. 83 in height, respectively. As compared to using non-perforated ring trays, the percentage of dimensional changes that occurred were (-) 0. 49 ± 0. 49 on top area, (-) 8. 76 ± 3. 95 on base area and (+) 1. 19 ± 0. 71 in height, respectively. There was {{a significant difference in the}} direction of the dimensional changes on both the top areas, but not in the base areas and height...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{growth and}} survival of juvenile blacklip pearl oysters (Pinctada margaritifera) {{in a number of}} intermediate culture systems: lantern nets, panel nets, <b>perforated</b> plastic <b>trays,</b> and attached to ropes enclosed by mesh, Juveniles with initial dorsoventral measurements of 8. 3 to 51. 5 -mm increased in size by 20. 4 to 24. 8 -mm in 3 months, and 30. 7 to 36. 5 -mm in 5 months. Growth rates of juvenile P. margaritifera cultured in the open reef systems of the Solomon Islands compared favorably with those reported from the established pearl culture operations in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands. Initial experiments showed that survival of oysters in lantern nets in shallow reef areas was poor as a result of predation by fish and invertebrates. Siting of culture systems in deeper water decreased mortality by fish, although predation by invertebrates that recruited from plankton was still a potential problem. In general, {{there were no significant differences}} in growth or survival between juveniles held in lantern nets and panel nets; however, lantern nets were more difficult to clean and inspect for predators. Juvenile {{growth and survival}} did not differ significantly (p >. 05) between panel nets and trays after 5 months, although the rigid trays were easier to clean of fouling organisms. Juveniles placed loosely into trays tended to aggregate, and rates of growth and survival of oysters glued separately into trays were significantly greater (p <. 05) than those for oysters placed loosely into trays. There was no significant difference in growth between oysters glued into trays and those glued onto ropes and enclosed behind plastic mesh. Overall, this study shows that important criteria of the growout units needed for the intermediate culture of P. margaritifera in the Western Pacific include ease of cleaning and access for regular inspection and removal of predators...|$|R
