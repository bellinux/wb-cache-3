50|$|Over time, the {{building}} experienced {{deterioration of the}} original Plexiglas panels and the adverse effect of humidity on some metal elements. The greenhouse was closed for extensive renovations in 1988 and reopened in March 1990. The original Plexiglas glazing was replaced with 2,425 panes of heat-strengthened glass (containing a <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayer</b> called Saflex) and coated with a low-emissivity film. In 2010, the Botanical Garden celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Climatron.|$|E
50|$|Seismic glass-break detectors, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as shock sensors, are different {{in that they are}} installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, {{depending on the type of}} glass and the presence of a <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayer.</b> Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{laminated}} glass {{is produced by}} bonding two or more layers of ordinary annealed glass (or tempered glass) together with a <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayer,</b> usually polyvinyl butyral or ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The PVB or the EVA are sandwiched by the glass, which is either passed {{through a series of}} rollers, or vacuum bagging systems, and ovens, or autoclaves, to expel any air pockets. Then it is heated to form the initial melting. These constructions are then heated under pressure in an autoclave or oven, to achieve the final bounded product(fully crosslinked {{in the case of the}} thermoset EVA). The tint at the top of some car windshields is in the PVB. Also, colored PET films can be combined with the thermoset EVA material, during the laminating process, in order to obtain a colored glass.|$|E

There is an unsafe practice of cutting both sides separately, pouring a flammable liquid such as denatured alcohol into the crack, and igniting it to melt the interlayer {{to separate the}} pieces.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for transparent constructions {{leads to an}} expanded use of glass as a supporting element. To solve safety {{issues related to the}} brittle nature of the material, commonly laminated glass is used. The latter consists of several glass sheets which are attached to <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayers</b> over their entire surface. In case of fracture of a glass pane, this polymer interlayer is able to absorb energy, so the fraction of multiple glass sheets is in most cases avoided. Moreover, the glass fragments stick to the interlayer, so the risk of possible injury is diminished. This research specifically focuses on the mechanical behaviour of laminated glass with an ionomer interlayer, namely SentryGlas®, in structural applications. SentryGlas® is a relatively stiff interlayer, of which the mechanical behaviour is less known than e. g. the more traditional interlayer material PVB. Therefore, an extensive test program was executed with both torsional and bending tests, by which the time and temperature dependent stiffness of the laminates was determined experimentally. As a first step in the analysis, the relationship between the test temperature and the load duration was determined. The corresponding time-shift function allows the prediction of the long term behaviour at a certain temperature level based on the experimental results of short tests performed at a higher temperature. Additionally, it becomes possible to analyse together the results of multiple test series, performed between 5 °C and 65 °C. All results were then processed using the equivalent thickness method, as proposed in the European pre-standard prEN 13474. The outcome indicated that the resulting equivalent thickness is highly dependent on the test configuration and therefore not directly useful to predict the laminate stiffness under divergent loading conditions. Therefore, all results of experiments on laminated glass were transformed into the actual material properties of the intermediate layer itself, using both analytical and finite element modelling. Finally, a user-friendly material model was composed, based on the numerically obtained shear modulus of the interlayer which yielded the lowest dispersion and seemed to fit best with the real test configuration. The model allows the calculation of a laminated structural element in an application with realistic loading conditions. This is possible with both simplified elastic models, as with finite element packages for more complex visco-elastic simulations...|$|R
40|$|In Compression Shear Tests (CST) {{specimens}} of Laminated Safety Glass (LSG) are inserted {{in a special}} test device with an angle of 45 ° with respect of the loading force so that the compression and the shear components acting in {{the plane of the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayer</b> have always the same magnitude. The CST procedure has been adopted in the present research in order to assess the ultimate shear stresses of PVB interlayers of different kinds.

40|$|Laminated glass {{structures}} are formed by stiff layers of glass {{connected with a}} compliant <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayer.</b> Due to their slenderness and heterogeneity, they exhibit a complex mechanical response {{that is difficult to}} capture by single-layer models even in the elastic range. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce an efficient and reliable finite element approach to the simulation of the immediate response of laminated glass beams. It proceeds from a refined plate theory due to Mau (1973), as we treat each layer independently and enforce the compatibility by the Lagrange multipliers. At the layer level, we adopt the finite-strain shear deformable formulation of Reissner (1972) and the numerical framework by Ibrahimbegović and Frey (1993). The resulting system is solved by the Newton method with consistent linearization. By comparing the model predictions against available experimental data, analytical methods and two-dimensional finite element simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed formulation is reliable and provides accuracy comparable to the detailed two-dimensional finite element analyzes. As such, it offers a convenient basis to incorporate more refined constitutive description of the interlayer. Comment: Moderate revisions; 17 pages, 6 figures, 8 table...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{adhesion}} between glass panes and plastic interlayers is a requisite of fundamental importance for the safety and the structural integrity of laminated glass. The level of adhesion depends on many factors: type of materials, autoclave temperature, pressure and time of bonding process, cleaning process etc. Surprisingly, any national or international standard requires minimum adhesion properties in spite of the importance to know and model bonding mechanisms between glass and polymers in order to get high quality LSG and to avoid delamination phenomena between glass and PVB. Furthermore, the high adhesion of PVB to glass ensures, in the post-breakage phase, that fragments remain attached to the plastic film. On the other hand, a Laminated Safety Glass with low PVB adhesion guarantees a higher impact resistance, since more energy is absorbed by elastic deformation of the plastic material. Therefore, the control of the adhesion properties should be such to satisfy {{at the same time the}} capacity to absorb impacts and the need for a sufficient bond strength. In Compression Shear Tests (CST) specimens of Laminated Safety Glass (LSG) are inserted in a special test device with an angle of 45 ° with respect of the loading force so that the compression and the shear components acting in the plane of the <b>plastic</b> <b>interlayer</b> have always the same magnitude.

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} {{and extension}} characteristics of tension side, view side and compression side of ceramic/metal joints were investigated under cyclic bending loading. Location of cracks and propagations were investigated by SEM and X-ray compositional analysis methods. The {{stress and strain}} distribution under cyclic bending loading were investigated by FEM analysis. The results obtained are as follows. (1) Crack initiation occurred at ceramic/interlayer interface at the specimen corner under cyclic bending loading. The unstable fracture occurred from the interface crack. At the 84 〜 90 % of mean strength, crack initiated at ceramic/interlayer interface at the specimen corner. (2) After a main crack occurred many microcracks appeared in order near the main crack region {{with the increase of}} maximum stress. Finally they united to the main crack under cyclic loading. The length of crack was increased with increasing maximum stress. The curve slopes of crack lengths versus stresses also increased with increasing maximum stress. Under constant cyclic bending loading, the cracks intermittently grew. (3) At compression side, when the absolute value of maximum stresses were higher than those of tension side, cracks started on the ceramic/interlayer interface and grew up to about 40 μm, and finally halted. (4) The crack initiations occurred at the ceramic/brazing filler interface. The location of crack initiation under cyclic bending loading was same as monotonic strength. (5) The crack length increment was decelerated with increasing energy release rate, then increased. The difference of the relationship between crack length increment and energy release rate was less than that of crack length increment and maximum stress. (6) From the FEM analysis, the plastic deformation progressed in interlayer when specimen was loaded and the <b>plastic</b> strain of <b>interlayer</b> left when unloaded. In the interlayer of interface, as compressional plastic strain was constrained by materials around it, tensile residual stresses occured at the compression side at end of unloading. That is why crack initiation occurred in the compression side...|$|R
