5|$|Many {{objective}} measures {{show the}} positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 9,000 papers based on Hubble data {{have been published}} in <b>peer-reviewed</b> <b>journals,</b> and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.|$|E
