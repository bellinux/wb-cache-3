40|$|SUMMARY – The aim of {{this review}} was to {{estimate}} the influence of patronage nurses on bre-astfeeding. A retrospective research was conducted {{in the form of}} telephone questionnaire on a total of 25 subjects. Eighteen (72 %) mothers had previous experience with breastfeeding, while 7 (28 %) had no such experience. In 18 (72 %) mothers, patronage nurses assessed the technique of breastfee-ding because of difficulties with breastfeeding and examined breasts in 13 (52 %) women. Exclusive breastfeeding was recommended to 21 (84 %) mothers, while in 4 (16 %) cases giving water and/or tea to the child was suggested. Breastfeeding on demand was recommended in 14 (56 %) and brea-stfeeding by schedule in 4 (16 %) cases. Advice about maternal nutrition during breastfeeding was given in 21 (84 %) cases, while this type of advice was not necessary in only 4 (16 %) cases. Patronage nurses helped the mothers with breastfeeding in 12 (48 %) cases, had no influence on breastfeeding in 9 (36 %) cases, and hindered breastfeeding in 4 (16 %) cases. <b>Patronage</b> <b>service</b> has a relevant role in the preventive health sector. Patronage nurses should have better collaboration with maternity and pediatric care centers, so they can provide up to date breastfeeding education and thus offer their professional support...|$|E

The main {{objectives}} of patronage nurses as key professionals in primary health care are: health promotion, health prevention, care and rehabilitation of families. The purpose of this scientific paper is through a systematic analysis and survey of users of health services, such are families of {{children with special needs}} to see the level of quality of patronage visits, the level of communication and respect for ethical norms in relation health worker - customer and the cervice of day care centers - what they offer in this category of users within the municipality of Kumanovo. Aa a material for this research were used the responses from the parents of 50 families of children with special needs {{at the level of the}} municipality of Kumanovo, as well as the data from the day care centers from the registers for the every day activities, rehabilitation and socialization of this category of children. Based on the results, the survey responses of the set targets in terms of knowledge and attitudes of nurses and it can make the following conclusions: • Patronage nurses need higher education for treatment and rehabilitation of children with special needs at home; • There is a need for greater coordination and cooperation of <b>patronage</b> <b>service</b> with other health, social and educational institutions; • Patronage nurses, as health care professionals should work more actively to raise the level of health culture and public awareness of the population (especially in traditional families and rural areas) and to help inside the families to break the stigma. That will help a lot for the families and specially for children, impoving the possibility of providing the child with special needs to live, learn and create, within its capabilities; • It is providing high quality communication in the health care worker relationship - customer, because to give confidence for their own health expertise is needed, but pleasant, warm and honest word; • There is a need for more promotion of day care centers in the community, openness, bringing their programs and activities to all vital segments, because everyone has the right to dignified life.

40|$|Abstract Reference {{services}} {{have always been}} essential in academic libraries by meeting undergraduates’ information needs for enhanced academic achievement. It provides personalised information services to users in ensuring that their needs are adequately satisfied. However, in recent times, users’ satisfaction with reference services has become of great concern, as poor satisfaction of reference services will negatively affect subsequent use. There is dearth of scholarly research on <b>patronage</b> of reference <b>services</b> by undergraduates in Nigeria. The study, therefore, investigated the influence of users’ needs and satisfaction on the <b>patronage</b> of reference <b>services</b> by undergraduates in selected universities in Osun State, Nigeria. The survey research design was adopted for the study while questionnaire tagged “User Needs, Satisfaction, and <b>Patronage</b> of Reference <b>Services</b> (UNSPRS) ” was used for data collection. Random sampling technique was used to select 400 out of 29, 013 undergraduates in the selected universities in Osun State. Frequency counts, mean and standard deviation, correlation and multiple regression were used to analyse the data with hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The results showed that inadequate time for reference services, lack of current reference materials, poor service quality and unfriendly reference personnel affect the <b>patronage</b> of reference <b>services</b> by the undergraduates. Reference services were moderately patronised by the undergraduates. The mean analysis revealed that undergraduates of the selected universities showed a moderate need for reference services and are only moderately satisfied with the reference services available to them. There was positive significant relationship between user needs and <b>patronage</b> of reference <b>services</b> (r= 0. 455, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was also {{a significant relationship between}} user satisfaction and <b>patronage</b> of reference <b>services</b> (r= 0. 422, P 3 ̆e 0. 05). The study recommended that the university libraries in Osun State should provide user-oriented reference services that will meet the users’ needs and increase patronage by undergraduates.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the political party structure on the incentives for politicians to focus on <b>patronage</b> versus <b>service</b> delivery improvements in Pakistan. By analysing inter-provincial variations in the quality of service delivery in Pakistan, the paper argues that the more fragmented, factionalised, and polarised the party systems, the greater are the incentives for <b>patronage,</b> weakening <b>service</b> delivery improvements. Fragmentation and factionalism both exacerbate the information problems that voters have in assigning credit (blame) for service delivery improvements (deterioration), thereby creating the incentives for politicians to focus on targeted benefits. Polarisation, particularly ethnic polarisation, reduces the ability of groups to agree on the provision of public goods, again causing politicians to favour the delivery of targeted benefits.

Services from Melbourne to Leongatha and Yarram were withdrawn on 6 June 1981, with replacement buses starting three days later. The Yarram train was a loco hauled train, while the Leongatha train was a DRC railcar hauling MTH carriages. To fill the gaps between those services, local trains were introduced on a three-month trial from Dandenong to Lang Lang, but were withdrawn on 3 October 1981, due to insufficient <b>patronage.</b> <b>Services</b> to Leongatha were restored on 9 December 1984, and free train shuttles to Korumburra were provided to mark the occasion. The 1984 timetable included two round trips per day from Monday to Saturday, and one round trip on Sundays. However, the services were again withdrawn on 24 July 1993. With the withdrawal of freight services from Koala siding in January 1998, the line became unused beyond Cranbourne. The exception was a tourist operation, which commenced operation between Nyora and Leongatha. It later became known as South Gippsland Railway [...] In 1995 the section between Dandenong and Cranbourne was electrified and a station added at Merinda Park, as part of a $27 million Federal Government-funded project.|$|R

From a rational-choice perspective, tipping makes sense only if desired outcomes are contingent on how much is tipped.

Hypotheses derived from these potential explanations for tipping were tested in a study in which restaurant customers were interviewed (as they left the restaurant) about their dining experience and tipping behavior.

30|$|Only a {{very small}} {{percentage}} (4 %) of the camel owners of the present study consult veterinary services.

However, the low <b>patronage</b> of veterinary <b>services</b> was mainly attributed to lack of available veterinary services (Chafe et al. 2008). The importance of patronizing veterinary care cannot be over-emphasized as past studies revealed that access to veterinary services considerably reduced camel calves’ mortality (Simpkin 1985). Access to veterinary care have also been shown to improve sexual maturity, hence reducing age of cow at first calving (Megersa et al. 2008). However, other factors such as inadequate plane of nutrition could also delay sexual maturity (Mukasa-Mugerwa 1981).|$|R

Mass rapid transit {{seems to be}} the only way out that is expected to mitigate traffic congestion in the city. However, without common fare system, travelers need to pay an initial entrance fee every time they enter each transit system. This excess cost tapers the demand and affects the efficient use of the system. This research investigates the influence of fare price on transit use which is measured by price elasticity of demand and proposes the optimum fare price if the common fare is used. The analysis is based on the findings from the stated preference survey techniques. Finally, the conclusion on fare level that encourage more <b>patronage,</b> maintain <b>service</b> quality and operator revenue is addressed...|$|R
