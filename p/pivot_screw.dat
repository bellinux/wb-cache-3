25|$|The Umnumzaan blade pivot is {{implemented}} with a <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> and pin, and {{is supported by}} perforated phosphor bronze thrust washers. The functions of the perforations are to reduce friction due {{to a reduction in}} surface area relative to that of a solid washer, and to increase the duration of use between cleanings by housing lubricant in the perforations. Over the life of the Umnumzaan, the pivot and washers have been incrementally modified.|$|E

50|$|Distributed by the Elkhart, Indiana-based Gemstone Musical Instruments, Stephanhouser creates alto, tenor, soprano, and {{baritone}} saxophones for musicians at all levels, {{from student}} to professional. Stephanh√∂user received three United States patents {{in less than}} five years of operation. The Stephanhouser innovations include the ScrewLess pin design, which eliminates <b>pivot</b> <b>screws</b> in post rods and enhances instrument durability, a procedure for creating a saxophone bow out of a single piece of brass for a more resonant sound, and a more precise octave key design. The Stephanhouser brand was created and developed by Dane Scott Stephens of Castroville, Texas in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The System 1 bridge can be {{replaced}} successfully with a Floyd Rose licensed bridge.The slightly wider <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> spacing of the System 1 bridge needs a Floyd Rose licensed bridge design with one <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> cutaway that extends {{to the edge of}} the bridge allowing the Floyd Rose licensed bridge to mount onto the System 1 pivot screws. This configuration is most common in a [...] "Floyd Rose Gotoh" [...] bridge. Most Floyd Rose bridge designs have two <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> cutaways that are limited to the width of the pivot screws, and these will not fit the System 1 <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> spacing.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 336 is {{designed}} to be easily disassembled for cleaning. Removal of the lever <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> with a flathead screwdriver, allows field stripping of the lever arm, bolt, and ejector for maintenance. [...] Unlike many lever action designs, the Model 336 can be cleaned from the breech, much like a bolt-action rifle. [...] This in turn avoids damage to the muzzle caused by cleaning rods and tools.|$|E
5000|$|The upper caliper in {{the image}} (at the right) {{requires}} manual adjustment prior to fitting. Fine setting of this caliper type is performed by tapping the caliper legs lightly on a handy surface until they will almost pass over the object. A light push against {{the resistance of the}} central <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> then spreads the legs to the correct dimension and provides the required, consistent feel that ensures a repeatable measurement.|$|E

5000|$|The Fender {{two-point}} {{system uses}} two pivot points, one {{at each end}} of the pivot, rather than a row of six as in the original Strat trem. Conceptually, such a mechanism can be achieved by removing four of the six <b>pivot</b> <b>screws</b> from a traditional Strat trem, leaving only the two at the ends of the row, and there have been magazine articles suggesting this but it is risky. In practice, both for strength and for satisfactory performance, the pivots need to be carefully engineered. In some designs the pivots are also moved further apart than the 2.2" [...] spacing of the outermost two screws in the original, in others they are just strengthened and more carefully shaped.|$|R
50|$|The System I bridge {{string height}} is set by {{adjustable}} <b>pivot</b> post <b>screws</b> {{and has no}} individual string height adjustments but has individual string intonation adjustments and {{is very much like}} the Gibson Tune-o-matic bridge in terms of intonation and string height adjustments.The System I tremolo system uses a behind the nut string locking mechanism.The System II and System III bridges have individual string height and individual string intonation adjustments.The System II and III tremolo systems use a height adjustable locking nut.|$|R

5000|$|After {{eight years}} of making fixed blade knives, Strider turned to making folding knives. [...] Strider's goal was to produce a folding knife that was as strong as a fixed blade. [...] To work toward this goal, Strider relied {{on the use of}} G10 Fiberglass handles, {{titanium}} liners thicker than what was in current use throughout the cutlery industry and an oversized <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> 0.19" [...] in diameter. [...] The end results were two linerlocks known as the AR and GB models. Strider makes titanium handled framelock folding knives. [...] These models utilize the handle itself as the locking mechanism and are named the SMF, SnG, PT, and RC models.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, the tjasker is a {{drainage}} mill {{with common}} sails connected to an Archimedean screw. This {{is used for}} pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required. The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to <b>pivot.</b> The Archimedean <b>screw</b> lifts water into a collecting ring, where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level, thus draining the land.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{of the six}} centre pieces <b>pivots</b> on a <b>screw</b> (fastener) held by {{the centre}} piece, a [...] "3D cross". A spring between each screw head and its {{corresponding}} piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact, but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can be tightened or loosened to change the [...] "feel" [...] of the Cube. [...] Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted.|$|R
60|$|Finding {{that the}} spot {{which he had}} first chosen for his {{observations}} {{was not a very}} good one, the Professor changed his position to a point farther down on the steep sloping rocks that form the left bank of the Glacier des Bois. Here the theodolite was fixed. This instrument as even our young readers may probably know, is a small telescope attached to a stand with three long legs, and having spirit-levels, by means of which it can be fixed in a position, if we may say so, of exact flatness with reference to the centre of the earth. Within the telescope are two crossed hairs of a spider's-web, so fine as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye, and so arranged that their crossing-point is exactly in the centre of the tube. By means of <b>pivots</b> and <b>screws</b> the telescope can be moved up or down, right or left, without in the smallest degree altering the flatness or position of its stand. On looking through the telescope the delicate threads can be distinctly seen, and the point where they cross can be brought to bear on any distant object.|$|R
5000|$|First {{introduced}} in 1990, the basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish CPM S30V steel blade.There are numerous {{options for the}} embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory.Originally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel. [...] In 1996, the blade material was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza blade material transitioned to CPM S30V steel. CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve. [...] Damascus steel blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel.A feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex wrench in the box. Another feature of the Sebenza {{is the use of}} a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered.This bushing allows the user to tighten the <b>pivot</b> <b>screw</b> completely without having to manually adjust the pivot tension.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} an {{orientation}} mechanism of industrial robots for mounting of <b>pivots</b> and <b>screws</b> into the mounting holes. In {{the first phase}} there is a research of inventions mainly realized in the United States Patent and Trademark Office database. Subsequently {{the conditions of the}} assembly are solved. On the base of the conditions the functional requirements are described. The diploma thesis includes seven conceptual variants, which are proposed as a 3 D design. Using the basical multi-criteria method the best conceptual variant is specified. That is specified due to the accepted criterias. In the next part of the diploma thesis there is a calculation, that comprises this technically and economically most promising conceptual variant. The calculation consists of a statics, a kinematics and a dynamics of the propel, a stenght control of the mechanism and kinematics analysis of the whole mechanism. Results of the calculation are used by the detailed design of orientation mechanism, that also comprises technological production theory and a correct assembly. Economical analysis, which comprises cost of produce of this newly developed automation equipment, is worked up in the conclusion of the diploma thesis. The diploma thesis also comprises drawings. The variant solves a new conception, which can be patented as an utility model...|$|R
5000|$|What made most {{models of}} the 'Pianette' so {{innovative}} was the positioning of the tuning pins. On {{any other type of}} piano, tuning pins are pounded into holes which are sufficiently, deliberately and exactly smaller than the pins so that a long-lasting tightness will keep them from sliding, no matter what force is put upon them while stretching the wires into tune. These holes are positioned beneath a metal soundboard and have a specified depth. On many {{models of the}} 'Pianette' minipiano, however, these tuning pins have to be longer so that they can emerge {{at the front of the}} instrument just below the keyboard. By allowing a wooden flap to fall positioned neatly beneath the keyboard, tuning pins are revealed at the front. These pins can be adjusted with a standard star-shaped piano wrench. The monochords used on the lowest 31 strings are relatively easy to tune. The bichords are somewhat more difficult but if the pins are still tight enough, they can be adjusted with slight movements of the wrench until the desired tone is reached. Unfortunately, however, this system which involved the use of specially made tuning pins specific to the minipiano, has proven to be its greatest problem to people attempting to salvage the instruments today. Although all pianos suffer to some degree from a natural loosening of these pins over time the minipiano is most highly criticized for the tendency of all the pins, especially those belonging to bichords, to loosen and slide much more quickly especially if they are not kept in a warm stable environment. [...] Although it is possible to access the tuning pins from the back as well, it is infinitely prefereable to be able to tune the minipiano from the front because in order to open the back one has to entirely detach the wooden lid, remove a whole set of metal rods, some screws above and across the wooden contraption holding the striking pad mechanism as well as two wooden rods attached to the pedals controlled by the player's feet. This is done to allow the central striking mechanism to pivot outwards on an axis pivoting on two large screws at the bottom of the wooden contraption. But before the wooden structure can <b>pivot</b> on the <b>screws</b> attaching it firmly to the instrument, two curved metallic 'handles' that connect two wooden bars passing horizontally just behind the row of metal rods have to be detached as well by the removing the screws holding them to the higher of the two bars. After this, the whole structure should gracefully pivot outwards, allowing access to both the piano wires and the tuning pins.|$|R
