40|$|The {{morphology}} of grains grown <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> and coagulation is revaled {{by a new}} laboratory {{method of}} synthesizing cosmic dust analogs. Submicron carbon particles, grown <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> of carbon atoms from a gas, have a spherical shape with a cauliflower-like surface and an internal micro-structure of radial columns. This shape is probably common for grains grown <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> at a temperature well below the melting point. Coagulated grains, consisting of spheres that collided to form irregular strings, were also synthesized. Another shape we produced had a bumpy non- spherical morphology, like an interplanetary particle collected in the terrestrial stratosphere. Besides these isolated grains, large spongy aggregates of nanometer-size particles were also found for various experimental conditions. Grains were synthesized using ions to sputter a solid target, producing an atomic vapor at a low temperature. The ions were provided by a plasma, which also provided electrostatic levitation of the grains during their growth. The temporal development of grain growth was studied by extinguishing the plasma after various intervals...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} the flow produced <b>by</b> the <b>accretion</b> of gas from a rotating cloud onto a point gravitational source. It is shown that, for a cloud initially in uniform rotation, the effect of accretion is to produce a Taylor column in the cloud parallel to the rotation axis. Only gas within the column is accreted; the gas outside the column undergoes oscillatory flow, which is probably subject to shear instability. The column forms in approximately one-half rotation period from the time at which accretion begins. Its initial radius is determined <b>by</b> the <b>accretion</b> rate and the angular velocity of the cloud. Application of the results to the formation of Jupiter <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that massive stars form <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> can be investigated by simple analytical calculations that describe {{the effect that}} the formation of a massive star has on its own accretion flow. This paper investigates the effects of the ionizing radiation of a massive star forming within a very simple accretion model that includes angular momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories around a star. Very different HII region morphologies, that might appear to indicate different underlying models, may be related to this same basic accretion flow model with different model parameters. The hypercompact HII regions may be related to, and perhaps theoretically defined as, those HII regions associated with massive stars that are still growing <b>by</b> <b>accretion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{innermost}} regions of bulges with surface brightness data derived from combined HST/NICMOS and ground-based NIR profiles. Bulge profiles to 1 - 2 kpc may be fit with Sersic laws, and show a trend with bulge-to-disk ratio: low-B/D bulges are roughly exponential, whereas higher-B/D bulges show increasing Sersic shape index n, indicating higher peak central densities and more extended brightness tails. N-body models of accretion of satellites onto disk-bulge-halo galaxies show that satellite accretion {{contributes to the}} increase of the shape index n as the bulge grows <b>by</b> <b>accretion.</b> The N-body results demonstrate that exponential profiles are fragile to merging, hence bulges with exponential surface brightness profiles cannot have experienced significant growth <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> of dense satellites. 1...|$|R

40|$|Dust grains grow in {{interstellar}} clouds <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> and coagulation. In this paper, {{we focus}} on these two grain growth processes and numerically investigate how they interplay to increase the grain radii. We show that accretion efficiently depletes grains with radii a 0. 001 on a time-scale of 10 Myr in solar-metallicity molecular clouds. Coagulation also occurs on a similar time-scale, but accretion is more efficient in producing a large bump in the grain size distribution. Coagulation further pushes the grains to larger sizes after {{a major part of}} the gas phase metals are used up. Similar grain sizes are achieved by coagulation regardless of whether accretion takes place or not; in this sense, accretion and coagulation modify the grain size distribution independently. The increase of the total dust mass in a cloud is also investigated. We show that coagulation slightly 'suppresses' dust mass growth <b>by</b> <b>accretion</b> but that this effect is slight enough to be neglected in considering the grain mass budget in galaxies. Finally we examine how accretion and coagulation affect the extinction curve: The ultraviolet slope and the carbon bump are enhanced <b>by</b> <b>accretion,</b> while they are flattened by coagulation.
