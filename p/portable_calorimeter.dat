Minute ventilations ranging from rest up to heavy exercise were compared with simultaneous measurements from a 120 - 1 Tissot gasometer. Each of the three TEEM 100 pneumotachs were tested. Three hundred and sixty-one separate ventilation tests were performed using the low-flow, medium-flow, and high-flow heads of the <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> For each of the pneumotachs, the correlation between the <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter</b> values and the gasometer values exceeded r = 0. 94. The standard error of estimate for the low-, medium- and high-flow pneumotach were 5. 96, 4. 89 and 9. 0 %, respectively, expressed relative to the mean gasometer value. Simultaneous measurements of using the <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter</b> and the SensorMedics 2900 unit were compared during rest and at work rates starting at zero watts, increasing by 25 W to 150 W. Each work rate was of 4 min duration. The average of data from minutes 3 and 4 were used in all analyses. There was very close agreement between the two metabolic measurement systems. Except at the 100 -W work rate, where the difference was small (3. 9 %), yet statistically significant, all of the other differences in were small and non-significant.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{classification}} accuracy of previously published RT 3 accelerometer cut-points for youth using energy expenditure, measured via portable indirect calorimetry, {{as a criterion}} measure. Design: Cross-sectional cross-validation study. Methods: 100 children (mean age 11. 2. ±. 2. 8 years, 61 % male) completed 12 standardized activities trials (3 sedentary, 5 lifestyle and 4 ambulatory) while wearing an RT 3 accelerometer. V̇O 2 was measured concurrently using the Oxycon Mobile <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> Cut-points by Vanhelst (VH), Rowlands (RW), Chu (CH), Kavouras (KV) and the RT 3 manufacturer (RT 3 M) were used to classify PA intensity as sedentary (SED), light (LPA), moderate (MPA) or vigorous (VPA). Classification accuracy was evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and weighted Kappa (κ). Results: For moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), VH, KV and RW exhibited excellent accuracy classification (ROC-AUC. ≥. 0. 90), while the CH and RT 3 M exhibited good classification accuracy (ROC-AUC. >. 0. 80). Classification accuracy for LPA was fair to poor (ROC-AUC.. 0. 90), while RW, CH, and RT 3 M exhibited good classification accuracy (ROC-AUC. >. 0. 80).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{conducted}} a laboratory-based calibration {{study to determine}} relevant cutpoints for a hip-worn accelerometer among women ≥ 60 years, considering both type and filtering of counts. MethodsTwo hundred women wore an ActiGraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer on their hip while performing eight laboratory-based activities. Oxygen uptake was measured using an Oxycon <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> Accelerometer data were analyzed in 15 -second epochs for both normal and low frequency extension (LFE) filters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to calculate cutpoints for sedentary, light (low and high), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using the vertical axis and vector magnitude (VM) counts. ResultsMean age was 75. 5 years (standard deviation 7. 7). The Spearman correlation between oxygen uptake and accelerometry ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 85 for the normal and LFE filters and for both the vertical axis and VM. The area under the ROC curve was generally higher for VM compared to the vertical axis, and higher for cutpoints distinguishing MVPA compared to sedentary and light low activities. The VM better discriminated sedentary from light low activities compared to the vertical axis. The area under the ROC curves were better for the LFE filter compared to the normal filter for the vertical axis counts, but no meaningful differences were found by filter type for VM counts.

40|$|Accelerometers {{have been}} widely {{deployed}} in public health studies in recent years. While they collect high-resolution acceleration signals (e. g., 10 - 100 Hz), research has mainly focused on summarized metrics provided by accelerometers manufactures, such as the activity count (AC) by ActiGraph or Actical. Such measures {{do not have a}} publicly available formula, lack a straightforward interpretation, and can vary by software implementation or hardware type. To address these problems, we propose the physical activity index (AI), a new metric for summarizing raw tri-axial accelerometry data. We compared this metric with the AC and another recently proposed metric for raw data, Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO), against energy expenditure. The comparison was conducted using data from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study, in which 194 women 60 - 91 years performed 9 lifestyle activities in the laboratory, wearing a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT 3 X+) on the hip set to 30 Hz and an Oxycon <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter,</b> to record both tri-axial acceleration time series (converted into AI, AC, and ENMO) and oxygen uptake during each activity (converted into metabolic equivalents (METs)) at the same time. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that both AI and ENMO were more sensitive to moderate and vigorous physical activities than AC, while AI was more sensitive to sedentary and light activities than ENMO. AI had the highest coefficients of determination for METs (0. 72) and was a better classifier of physical activity intensity than both AC (for all intensity levels) and ENMO (for sedentary and light intensity). The proposed AI provides a novel and transparent way to summarize densely sampled raw accelerometry data, and may serve as an alternative to AC. The AI's largely improved sensitivity on sedentary and light activities over AC and ENMO further demonstrate its advantage in studies with older adults...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a robust and <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter</b> for use in radiotherapy photon and electron beams. The system consists of the calorimeter itself, means for thermal isolation and temperature control, and a temperature measurement system. The requirement for portability placed restrictions on the design which led to higher heat transfer between components than was desirable and much effort was put into thermodynamic modelling of the system. Effort was also focussed on {{the development of a}} temperature control system sensitive enough to allow measurements of temperature rises of the order of 1 mK. The control system maintains the temperature of the calorimeter to within +/- 0. 2 mK over several hours in an uncontrolled environment. A full characterisation of the calorimeter was earned out at NPL in 60 Co radiation and X-ray and electron beams from the NPL linear accelerator. This showed the system is capable of measuring a dose of 1 Gy at doserates as low as 1. 5 Gy min- 1 with a measurement uncertainty of +/- 0. 3 % (1 standard deviation). In comparisons with the present NPL primary standards the calorimeter gave agreement within the overall uncertainties. The robustness and portability of the calorimeter were proven in a number of external tests, firstly in an intercomparison between NPL and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in the BIPM's 60 Co beam in Paris. In the final test an ion chamber was calibrated in a 6 MV X-ray beam from a clinical linac, yielding a calibration factor 0. 68 % different from that obtained in the NPL linac beam. This difference is within the measurement uncertainties and indicated that there is no significant error in the transfer of ion chamber calibrations from NPL to the radiotherapy clinic...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of pregnancy, breed, and hair coat on body temperature and sweating rate (SR) of hair sheep. St. Croix White (STX; = 9) and Dorper × STX (DRPX; = 9) ewes (3. 6 yr of age) were evaluated over 4 d at 126 d of gestation (PREG) and over 4 d at 46 d postpartum (OPEN) in the shade and sun and in the morning (AM; 0900 to 1200 h) and afternoon (PM; 1300 to 1600 h) after a 20 min acclimation to each condition on each day. Data loggers recorded vaginal temperature (VT) at 10 -min intervals for 96 h. Rectal temperature (RT) was measured using a digital veterinary thermometer, and respiration rate (RR) was measured as breaths per minute (bpm). Sweating rate was calculated from measured air properties passing over a shaved (300 cm) and unshaved area of the ewes' body using a <b>portable</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> Data were analyzed using GLM procedures of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) with breed, pregnancy status, sun exposure, and time of day as main effects. Mean temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, wind speed, and solar radiation on the days of data collection were 28. 2 °C, 82. 8 %, 80. 3, 4. 2 km/h, and 237. 5 W/m, respectively. There was no difference (> 0. 10) in RT, RR, and SR between DRPX and STX ewes. The PREG ewes had lower RT (0. 10) in RT.

40|$|Due to {{expanding}} {{activities in}} remote, cold environments such as resource {{development in the}} Arctic and new polar cruise routes, measurement of the thermal protection of garments and shelters is becoming critical {{to ensure the safety}} of crews and passengers in extreme conditions. Thermal manikins offer an alternative to the ethics of human subject testing; however, some manikin results have disagreed in a recent round-robin test. The source of the inconsistency between manikins could be methodological or calibration. Inconsistent measurements dilute the argument for using manikins in place of human subjects. Since manikins are not mass-produced and a variety of designs are in use, a calibration tool is needed to make manikin data credible and prove equivalence to human subject testing.

40|$|Background: For over 20 years, {{normative}} {{data has}} guided the prescription of physical activity. This data {{has since been}} applied to research and used to plan interventions. While this data seemingly provides accurate estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in young adults, the accuracy of use among older adults is less clear. As such, a thorough evaluation of the metabolic cost of daily activities in community dwelling adults across the lifespan is needed. Methods: The Metabolic Costs of Daily Activity in Older Adults Study is a cross-sectional study designed to compare the metabolic cost of daily activities in 250 community dwelling adults across the lifespan. Participants (20  + years) performed 38 common daily activities while expiratory gases were measured using a <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> (Cosmed K 4 b 2). The metabolic cost was examined as a metabolic equivalent value (O 2 uptake relative to 3. 5  mL min− 1  kg− 1), a function of work rate – metabolic economy, and a relative value of resting and peak oxygen uptake. Results: The primary objective is to determine age-related differences in the metabolic cost of common lifestyle and exercise activities. Secondary objectives include (a) investigating the effect of functional impairment on the metabolic cost of daily activities, (b) evaluating the validity of perception-based measurement of exertion across the lifespan, and (c) validating activity sensors for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity.

40|$|Background Accurate {{assessment}} of energy expenditure {{provides an opportunity}} to monitor physical activity during cardiac rehabilitation. However, the available assessment methods, based on the combination of heart rate (HR) and body movement data, are not applicable for patients using beta-blocker medication. Therefore, we developed an energy expenditure prediction model for beta-blocker-medicated cardiac rehabilitation patients. Methods Sixteen male cardiac rehabilitation patients (age: 55. 87. 3 years, weight: 93. 111. 8 kg) underwent a physical activity protocol with 11 low- to moderate-intensity common daily life activities. Energy expenditure was assessed using a <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter.</b> HR and body movement data were recorded during the protocol using unobtrusive wearable devices. In addition, patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test and resting metabolic rate assessment. Energy expenditure estimation models were developed using multivariate regression analyses based on HR and body movement data and/or patient characteristics. In addition, a HR-flex model was developed. Results The model combining HR and body movement data and patient characteristics showed the highest correlation and lowest error (r(2) = 0. 84, root mean squared error = 0. 834 kcal/minute) with total energy expenditure. The method based on individual calibration data (HR-flex) showed lower accuracy (i(2) = 0. 83, root mean squared error= 0. 992 kcal/minute).

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{descriptive}} article {{illustrates the}} application of Global Positioning System (GPS) professional receivers {{in the field of}} locomotion studies. The technological challenge was to assess the external mechanical work in outdoor walking. METHODS: Five subjects walked five times during 5 min on an athletic track at different imposed stride frequency (from 70 - 130 steps x min(- 1)). A differential GPS system (carrier phase analysis) measured the variation of the position of the trunk at 5 Hz. A <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> recorded breath-by-breath energy expenditure. RESULTS: For a walking speed of 1. 05 +/- 0. 11 m x s(- 1), the vertical lift of the trunk (43 +/- 14 mm) induced a power of 46. 0 +/- 20. 4 W. The average speed variation per step (0. 15 +/- 0. 03 m x s(- 1)) produced a kinetic power of 16. 9 +/- 7. 2 W. As compared with commonly admitted values, the energy exchange (recovery) between the two energy components was low (39. 1 +/- 10. 0 %), which induced an overestimated mechanical power (38. 9 +/- 18. 3 W or 0. 60 W x kg(- 1) body mass) and a high net mechanical efficiency (26. 9 +/- 5. 8 %). CONCLUSION: We assumed that the cause of the overestimation was an unwanted oscillation of the GPS antenna. It is concluded that GPS (in phase mode) is now able to record small body movements during human locomotion, and constitutes a promising tool for gait analysis of outdoor unrestrained walking. However, the design of the receiver and the antenna must be adapted to human experiments and a thorough validation study remains to be conducted...|$|R

EI did not differ between conditions in obese participants (CON: 4935 (sd 1490) kJ; PVG: 4902 (sd 1307) kJ; AVG: 4728 (sd 1358) kJ; EX: 4643 (sd 1335) kJ), and was significantly lower in lean participants after EX (2847 (sd 577) kJ) compared with PVG (3580 (sd 863) kJ) and AVG (3485 (sd 643) kJ) (P< 005). Macronutrient intake was not significantly different between the groups or conditions. Hunger was significantly higher and satiety was lower in obese participants but no condition effect was observed. Overall, moderate-intensity exercise provides better effect on energy balance than an isoenergetic hour of active video gaming in lean adolescent boys by dually affecting EE and E...|$|R

We also thank the Dr Beatrice Morio for their help and encouragements to {{initiate}} this workBackgroundWhile decreased physical activity and increased sedentary behaviours are incriminated for their role in the progression of obesity, active video games (AVG) may offer a new alternative to increase energy expenditure in youth. This study is the first to examine the effect of a 1 -h AVG play on lean and obese adolescents' energy expenditure. MethodsBody composition and aerobic fitness were assessed in 19 obese and 12 lean adolescent boys (12 - 15 years old). Participants performed a 1 -h AVG session (Kinect Sports technology) while wearing a <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> (K 4 b 2) to assess their energy expenditure and heart rate. ResultsBody weight (91. 09. 5 vs. 58. 5 +/- 12. 4 kg), body mass index (32. 2 +/- 3. 1 vs. 20. 3 +/- 1. 6 kgm(- 2)) and body fat (38. 1 +/- 2. 7 vs. 13. 4 +/- 3. 9 %) were significantly higher in obese adolescents (P< 0. 001). Absolute energy expenditure was significantly higher in obese (P< 0. 05) but not when corrected for body composition. Maximal heart rate reached during AVG was significantly higher in lean adolescents (190 +/- 25 vs. 183 +/- 28 bpm, P< 0. 05). Time spent between 3 and 6 METs (Metabolic Equivalent Task) was not different between groups but time spent above 6 METs was higher in lean adolescents (P< 0. 05). ConclusionAlthough lean and obese adolescent boys experienced similar energy expenditure relative to their body size during a 1 -h Kinect AVG session, lean adolescents spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activit...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} cost of 10 gardening tasks {{was measured}} in children to determine the exercise intensities associated with these tasks. Seventeen children [(mean ± SD) aged 12. 4 ± 0. 7 years and body mass index 21. 6 ± 4. 0 kg·mˉ²] participated in this study. The children performed the 10 gardening tasks at a garden previously established in Cheongju, Chungbuk, South Korea. They visited the garden twice and performed five different tasks on each visit. Five minutes were provided to complete each gardening task and a 5 -minute rest was allowed between each task. The children wore a <b>portable</b> telemetric <b>calorimeter</b> and a heart rate monitor for measurement of oxygen uptake and heart rate during the gardening tasks. The {{results show that the}} 10 gardening tasks represented moderate- to high-intensity physical activity for the children [4. 3 ± 0. 5 to 6. 6 ± 1. 6 metabolic equivalents (MET) ]. Digging (6. 6 ± 1. 6 MET) and raking (6. 2 ± 1. 5 MET) were high-intensity physical activities, and digging was more intense than the other gardening tasks performed in this study (P < 0. 05). Tasks such as weeding (5. 8 ± 1. 1 MET), mulching (5. 5 ± 1. 3 MET), hoeing (5. 3 ± 0. 7 MET), sowing seeds (5. 0 ± 1. 1 MET), harvesting (4. 8 ± 0. 6 MET), watering (4. 6 ± 1. 1 MET), mixing growing medium (4. 4 ± 0. 6 MET), and planting transplants (4. 3 ± 0. 5 MET) were moderate-intensity physical activities. The MET data for the gardening tasks will facilitate the development of garden-based exercise interventions for children, which can promote health and physically active lifestyle...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{measurement}} of activity energy expenditure (AEE) via accelerometry {{is the most}} commonly used objective method for assessing human daily physical activity and has gained increasing importance in the medical, sports and psychological science research in recent years. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine which of the following procedures is more accurate to determine the energy cost during the most common everyday life activities; a single regression or an activity based approach. For this we used a device that utilizes single regression models (GT 3 X, ActiGraph Manufacturing Technology Inc., FL., USA) and a device using activity-dependent calculation models (move II, movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen adults (11 male, 8 female; 30. 4 ± 9. 0 years) wore the activity monitors attached to the waist and a <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> (IC) as reference measure for AEE while performing several typical daily activities. The accuracy of the two devices for estimating AEE was assessed as the mean differences between their output and the reference and evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The GT 3 X overestimated the AEE of walking (GT 3 X minus reference, 1. 26 kcal/min), walking fast (1. 72 kcal/min), walking up-/downhill (1. 45 kcal/min) and walking upstairs (1. 92 kcal/min) and underestimated the AEE of jogging (- 1. 30 kcal/min) and walking upstairs (- 2. 46 kcal/min). The errors for move II were smaller than those for GT 3 X for all activities. The move II overestimated AEE of walking (move II minus reference, 0. 21 kcal/min), walking up-/downhill (0. 06 kcal/min) and stair walking (upstairs: 0. 13 kcal/min; downstairs: 0. 29 kcal/min) and underestimated AEE of walking fast (- 0. 11 kcal/min) and jogging (- 0. 93 kcal/min). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the activity monitor using activity-dependent calculation models is more appropriate for predicting AEE in daily life than the activity monitor using a single regression model...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} the ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of physical activity intensity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) using oxygen uptake (VO 2) as the criterion measure. Thirty children and adolescents with CP (mean age 12. 6 ± 2. 0 years) wore an ActiGraph 7164 and a Cosmed K 4 b 2 <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> during four activities; quiet sitting, comfortable paced walking, brisk paced walking and fast paced walking. VO 2 was converted to METs and activity energy expenditure and classiWed as sedentary, light or moderate-to-vigorous intensity according to the conventions for children. Mean ActiGraph counts min - 1 were classiWed as sedentary, light or moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) intensity using four diVerent sets of cut-points. VO 2 and counts min¡ 1 increased signiWcantly with increases in walking speed (P < 0. 001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that, of the four sets of cut-points evaluated, the Evenson et al. (J Sports Sci 26 (14) : 1557 - 1565, 2008) cut-points had the highest classiWcation accuracy for sedentary (92 %) and MVPA (91 %), as well as the second highest classiWcation accuracy for light intensity physical activity (67 %). A ROC curve analysis of data from our participants yielded a CP-speciWc cut-point for MVPA that was lower than the Evenson cut-point (2, 012 vs. 2, 296 counts min¡ 1), however, the diVerence in classiWcation accuracy was not statistically signiWcant 94 % (95 % CI = 88. 2 - 97. 7 %) vs. 91 % (95 % CI = 83. 5 - 96. 5 %). In conclusion, among children and adolescents with CP, the ActiGraph is able to diVerentiate between diVerent intensities of walking. The use of the Evenson cut-points will permit the estimation of time spent in MVPA and allows comparisons to be made between activity measured in typically developing adolescents and adolescents with CP. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|The American Dietetic Association (ADA) {{standard}} of care for obese adults utilizes indirect calorimetry for calculating caloric targets for weight loss (1). Even though rates appear to be leveling off (2), childhood obesity {{is one of the}} major public health concerns of our time and much attention is currently being given to understanding the obese state. Resting energy expenditure (REE) makes up 60 - 70 % of total energy expenditure and plays a major role in determining an individuals' daily energy needs and metabolism. In the clinical setting, indirect calorimetry is often unavailable, thus predictive equations are typically used to help set caloric goals for weight loss.   The first objective was to compare measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) using a <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> with five predictive equations used to determine energy needs for children participating in the East Carolina University's Healthy Weight Clinic. The investigators also wanted to determine which of these equations are best to use in an obese pediatric population in the clinical setting. Results indicate that there is a significant (p< 0. 05) and strong correlation between MREE and these five predictive equations; however, there are also significant discrepancies. Overall, the Harris Benedict equation demonstrates the lowest mean calorie difference when compared to MREE.   Secondly, it was hypothesized that those subjects with a higher baseline MREE would be more successful with weight loss, and that metabolic factors such as leptin may contribute to weight change in an obese pediatric population. It was also proposed that there may be validity in adjusting MREE to body weight and/or body composition to account for confounders such as age and gender. MREE does not appear to predict success with weight change in obese youth aged 7 - 18 years. In older obese youth (Tanner Stage 5) it appears that those with a lower baseline fat mass and higher adjusted MREE to fat mass, may have more success with decline in BMI z score. Also, leptin and fat mass significantly (p < 0. 05) and negatively correlated with BMI z score change in older youth.   Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Generally, typical {{physical}} activities (e. g. walking and cycling) increase positive affect and decrease negative affect. However, {{few studies have}} investigated the effects on mood of activities that are frequently pursued during leisure time (e. g. dynamic stretching and video games). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the influences of different types of physical activity on mood. We selected 16 activities (kendama, active video games ["Wii Sports" tennis, baseball, boxing], static and dynamic stretching, jumping rope, step exercise, table tennis, darts, ball juggling, cycling, balance ball exercise, golf putting, walking, and dumbbell exercise) for investigation and divided them into 4 protocols. The duration of each activity was 10 min, except for dynamic stretching and step exercise (3 min). Fifteen young adults (8 males and 7 females) participated in at least 2 protocols (8 activities). Before and after each activity, levels of arousal and pleasure were measured using a two-dimensional mood scale. Metabolic equivalent (MET) as an index of exercise intensity was monitored throughout all activities using a <b>portable</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> (MetaMax 3 B). The changes in arousal and pleasure levels were tested by paired t test. The influence of activity type on changes in arousal and pleasure levels was analyzed by ANCOVA (factor: activity type 16 levels; covariate: METs) using a Mixed model. In ANCOVA models, the influence of each activity was evaluated in comparison with walking. All activities except static stretching (p= 0. 199) significantly increased the arousal level (p< 0. 010). The pleasure level was significantly increased after 3 sessions of active video games, static stretching, table tennis, and balance ball exercise (p< 0. 044). The results of the ANCOVA models revealed that the main effect of activity type on changes in arousal and pleasure levels was significant (p≤ 0. 007), while MET showed no significant regression coefficient (p≥ 0. 075). Increases in pleasure level during an active video game (baseball) and table tennis were significantly higher than during walking (p≤ 0. 025), whereas the influence of step exercise was significantly lower than during walking. These findings suggest that physical activity generally increases arousal level independently of exercise intensity, and that performing activities with another person such as conducting active video games or table tennis, significantly increases pleasure level in comparison to walking...|$|R

40|$|NMi has {{developed}} a sealed-water calorimeter for absorbed dose to water measurements in high-energy photon beams. The calorimeter has as a unique feature that it is transportable, and can therefore {{be used to determine}} absorbed dose rates on location in accelerator beams. The electronic detection circuit of the calorimeter is based on a method that involves a high-precision digital multimeter (DMM), rather than on a more traditional technique that employs Wheatstone bridges. To test its performance the NMi water calorimeter was compared directly with the absorbed-dose-to-water standard based on the NMi graphite calorimeter for 60 Co gamma radiation. A preliminary evaluation of this comparison yields a value of 1. 0010 ± 0. 0051 (1 σ) for the ratio of the dose rate determined with the water calorimeter compared to that derived from the graphite calorimeter. Furthermore the NMi water calorimeter was tested in high-energy photon beams, measurements of absorbed-dose-to-water rates were performed at the BNM-LNHB with a Saturne 43 accelerator for 6, 12, and 20 MV photon beams. By calibrating a set of 5 NE 2611 A chambers against the water calorimeter, beam quality correction factors kQ were derived that agreed very well with the literature. Presently, a NCS subcommittee Uniformity Dosimetry Protocols is working on implementing absorbed-dose-based Codes of Practice (CoPs) for external beam radiotherapy in Belgium and The Netherlands. These CoPs will be consistent with international recommendations and replace the current CoPs based on air kerma calibration factors. In agreement with the recommendation given in IAEA TRS- 398, that preferably experimental kQ values should be used, the subcommittee is presently performing kQ measurements in nine representative clinical photon beams with the <b>portable</b> NMi water <b>calorimeter</b> for four different graphite-walled ionization chamber types.

40|$|Background: The {{greatest}} {{increase in}} obesity {{rates have been}} seen with young adults in college due to their unhealthy dietary habits and behaviors. Interventions at this life stage may reduce the development of obesity related health concerns. There is an evident need for nutrition and lifestyle interventions yet there is limited research on the implementation of comprehensive nutrition programs for college students. Objective: This research study has a dual focus. We aim (1) to describe nutrition services offered through the Georgia State University Student Recreation Center to include nutrition assessment in a college population. Specifically, measured energy needs (Korr ReeVue™ <b>Portable</b> Indirect <b>Calorimeter)</b> were compared with estimated energy needs (predictive equations) and nutrition software (BioEx Nutrition Maker Software© Plus 2. 0). In addition, this study aims (2) to survey what types of nutrition services are offered by campus recreation centers {{that are part of}} the Urban 13 research-sharing institutions. Methods: (1) Twenty-three healthy weight (n= 8) and overweight/obese (n= 15) 18 - 37 year old males (n= 11) and females (n= 12) that were members of the Georgia State University student recreation center and had undergone indirect calorimetry. Paired samples t-tests were used to compare the means of measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) with RMR estimated from the Harris-Benedict and Mifflin-St. Jeor equations. Measured and estimated RMR were used to calculate total energy expenditure (TEE). Paired sample t-tests were also used to compare the means of each calculated TEE. A p-value ≤ 0. 05 defined significance. (2) The 21 campus recreation centers of the Urban 13 were asked to complete a five-question survey by email or phone. Survey results were tabulated based on result frequencies. Results: (1) A statistical significance (p 3 ̆c 0. 003) was found when comparing the means of measured RMR (1627 ± 393 kcal/day) with RMR estimated with the Harris Benedict equation (1781 ± 321 kcal/day). Significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) were found between TEE calculated via measured RMR (2153 ± 534 kcal/day) and TEE calculated with estimated RMR via the Harris-Benedict equation (2354 ± 420 kcal/day) and Nutrition Maker© Plus 2. 0 (2623 ± 582 kcal/day). Results were not statistically significant when comparing the means (p= 0. 308) of measured RMR (1626 ± 393 kcal/day) with RMR estimated with the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation (1677 ± 287 kcal/day), or between the means (p= 0. 317) of calculated TEE from measured RMR (2153 ± 534 kcal/day) and the Mifflin St-Jeor equation (2218 ± 381 kcal/day). (2) Of the 21 schools evaluated, seven stated nutrition services were provided through the campus recreation center. Of the seven schools, five staff an RD at the recreation center, and two schools, including Georgia State University, staff an RD and offer indirect calorimetry. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe nutrition services offered at a campus recreation center. In the absence of indirect calorimetry, the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation is the best method to estimate energy needs for a college population. Nutrition services provided by an RD are limited at campus recreation centers of the Urban 13. Furthermore, only two campuses, including Georgia State University, provide nutrition assessment via indirect calorimetry...|$|R
