40|$|Twenty three {{herbicides}} {{including the}} current registered herbicides were screened for activity on pre-emergent, juvenile and mature plants of the weedy Sporobolus grass species Sporobolus pyramidalis P. Beauv. and Sporobolus fertilis (Steud.) Clayton. No new herbicides trialled effectively controlled mature plants. <b>Propaquizafop,</b> fluazifop-P-hutyI, flupropanate, haloxyfop-R-methyl ester, glyphosate-ipa and clethodim + haloxyfop-R-methyl ester mix showed good activity on juvenile plants while atrazine, flupropanate, dithiopyr and imazapyr where effective as pre-emergent herbicides. Further work {{needs to be}} done to define the recommended application rates for juvenile and pre-emergent plant stages and to determine the selectivity of these herbicides on native and exotic pasture grasses...|$|E
40|$|Dentre as causas da ineficácia no controle de plantas daninhas destaca-se a resistência delas aos herbicidas. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram avaliar a suspeita de resistência de Eleusine indica a inibidores de acetil-CoA carboxilase (ACCase) e {{investigar}} a ocorrência de resistência cruzada entre os inibidores de ACCase. Biótipo de Eleusine indica originado do Mato Grosso com suspeita de resistência aos herbicidas inibidores de ACCase foi avaliado em casa de vegetação na sua suscetibilidade para diversos produtos do grupo dos ariloxifenoxipropionatos e cicloexanodionas. Estudos de resposta à dose confirmaram que o biótipo era 18 vezes mais insensível ao sethoxydim do que biótipo suscetível nunca aspergido com herbicidas. Também se constatou resistência cruzada ao fenoxaprop, cyhalofop, <b>propaquizafop</b> e butroxydim. Não se observou resistência cruzada aos produtos fluazifop, haloxyfop, quizalofop e clethodim. Among {{the causes}} for weed control inefficacy, the worst one is resistance to herbicides. The objectives {{of this work}} were to evaluate an Eleusine indica biotype suspected of resistance to ACCase inhibitors and to investigate the occurrence of cross- resistance to several ACCase inhibitors. One biotype of Eleusine indica originated from Mato Grosso with suspected resistance to ACCase inhibitors was evaluated in a greenhouse in relation to its susceptibility to several products of the ariloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione groups. Studies on dose response confirmed that the suspected biotype was 18 times more insensitive to sethoxydim than the susceptible biotype {{that had never been}} treated with herbicides. Cross-resistance was confirmed for fenoxaprop, cyhalofop, <b>propaquizafop</b> and butroxydim. No cross-resistance was observed with fluazifop, haloxyfop, quizalofop, and clethodim...|$|E
40|$|Study was {{conducted}} during the rabi season 2000 - 01, to investigate the effectiveness of different post-emergence herbicides for controlling weeds in canola. The treatments were post-emergence application of ronstar (oxadiazon), fusilade (fluzifop-butyle), topik (clodinofop), puma super (fenoxaprop-ethyle) and agil (<b>propaquizafop)</b> @ 0. 36, 0. 26, 0. 03, 0. 75 and 0. 15 kg ha - 1. Weedy check was also included for comparison. Herbicidal treatments significantly effected weeds density m - 2, number of branches plant - 1, number of siliquae plant - 1, siliquae length (cm), number of seeds siliqua - 1, 1000 seeds weight (g) and seed yield (kg ha - 1). Among the herbicides, fusilade showed promising results with seed yield (1563 kg ha - 1) as compared to weedy check (920 kg ha - 1). The weed species found were Convolvulus arvensis, Medicago denticulate, Rumex crispus, Vicia sp. and Anagalis arvensis. </i...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the selectivity and efficacy of ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in castor bean crop, at Paraguacu Paulista, São Paulo, during the 2002 / 03 agricultural season. The experimental design used was randomized complete blocks, with eleven treatments and four replicates, constituted by the following herbicides and adjuvants: fluazifop-p-butyl 313 g ha(- 1)) + Agral (TM) 0. 2 % v/v); sethoxydim 322 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); haloxyfop-methyl 120 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); clethodim+ fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 75 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); quizalofop-pethyl 125 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); clethodim 156 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); <b>propaquizafop</b> 175 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); tepraloxydim 400 g ha(- 1)) + Dash (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); butroxydim 100 g ha(- 1)) + Dash (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); isoxaflutole 60 g ha(- 1)) and weed-free check. At the moment of application, castor bean plants presented 4 to 6 leaves and Cenchrus echinatus, 1 to 5 tillers. AL Guarany 2002 cultivar presented high selectivity to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, without visible symptoms of phytotoxicity in 14 DAA days after application), except for tepraloxydim, whose symptoms persisted until 21 DAA, and isoxaflutole HPPD inhibiting), which showed injuries in older leaves and significant yield reduction. C. echinatus infestation was efficiently controlled by ACCase-inhibiting herbicides between 14 and 21 DAA (>= 95. 0 %) ...|$|E
40|$|A two-factorial field {{experiment}} should reveal {{the performance of}} Clearfield® oilseed rape under different cropping intensities. The experiment was conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof in 2014, with cropping intensity as factor 1 and herbicide strategy as factor 2, all treatments sown with variety PT 228 CL. Treatments of cropping intensities were “normal sowing” (NS; soil inversion tillage tillage, 50 seeds m- 2, 12 cm row spacing), “reduced sowing density” (DS; soil inversion tillage, 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing) and striptill (ST; 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing). The two herbicide strategies were pre-emergence strategy (VAS; application of Colzor® Trio (30 g L- 1 Clomazone, 187. 5 g L- 1 Dimethachlor, 187. 5 g L- 1 Napropamide) one day after sowing and of Agil® S (100 g/L <b>Propaquizafop)</b> 3. 5 weeks after sowing) and Clearfield® strategy (CLS; application of Clearfield®-Vantiga® (375 g L- 1 Metazachlor, 125 g L- 1 Quinmerac, 6. 25 g L- 1 Imazamox) and Dash® E. C. (345 g L- 1 fatty acid methyl ester, 205 g L- 1 fatty alcohol alkoxylates, 46 g L- 1 oleic acid) at {{the same day as}} Agil® S). NS resulted in the highest yield (3. 9 t ha- 1) which was significantly more than obtained by ST (3. 6 t ha- 1), the least-yielding intensity. There were no significant interactions of the effects. Weed density was highest in DS/CLS and ST/CLS with 12. 8 and 13. 9 plants m- 2, respectively, and thus the two to threefold of the other treatments. The results indicate a lack of efficacy of Clearfield®-Vantiga® under the presumably higher weed pressure in DS and ST, specifically in controlling the weeds Stellaria media and volunteer cereals (in this case: Hordeum vulgare). An economic evaluation will follow...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors pyridate and phenmedipham (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, flufenacet and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds. In summary, besides the two aforesaid compounds, the graminicide cycloxydim and - more cautiously - clodinafop and <b>propaquizafop</b> may be hopefully introduced in poplar nurseries after emergence, in association with the wide action range mixture of phenmedipham, desmedipham and ethofumesate...|$|E
