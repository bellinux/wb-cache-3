25|$|The yellow <b>plastic</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{actually}} a child’s toy that sounds when the pipe is whirled around. The metal pipe shown {{was used in the}} Concorde cockpit to provide cooling air to the pilots, but its loud tone got it canceled. This whistle is similar in many respects to the hole tone, in particular the teapot whistle. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops. There are numerous articles on the internet about this whistle and it has been studied.|$|E
25|$|A termite-bored didgeridoo has an {{irregular}} shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies {{that are not}} harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the harmonic spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical <b>plastic</b> <b>pipe,</b> whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency (a frequency ratio somewhat less than 3:1).|$|E

It is, however, customary to fill the metallic drain pipe annulus with rockwool packing. Even with the best of intentions, it would be difficult for the firestopper to install a sealant, because the installer is not allowed to remove the flange, which is partially used to support the drain pipe below during the installation process.|$|E

25|$|Some {{researchers}} use chicken mash for feed. A <b>plastic</b> <b>pipe</b> {{can be cut}} in {{half lengthwise}} to make two troughs {{which can be used}} as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).|$|E
500|$|Ferret-legging {{has existed}} for centuries, but the sport made a brief {{resurgence}} in popularity during the 1970s. According to a 2005 report published in the English Northern Echo newspaper, whether due to a [...] "lack of brave contestants or complaining wives", ferret-legging is now [...] "a dying sport" [...] that is being replaced by ferret racing, in which the animals race through a <b>plastic</b> <b>pipe.</b> Although the sport is now uncommon, annual competitions were held at the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival in Richmond, Virginia from 2003 through 2009. In 2007 the Manitoba Ferret Association held a ferret-legging competition in St. Vital Park, Winnipeg, to raise money {{in support of the}} organization's shelter for homeless ferrets. Marlene Blackburn, who works with the Ferret Rescue League to ensure that no ferrets are harmed in the sport, claims that during the years the competitions have been held in Richmond no contestant has ever been bitten, although some may get a few scratches. According to Kelly Yager of the Manitoba Ferret Association, the animals actually like small, confined spaces. Jay Lugar, spokesman for the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival, said ferrets are [...] "generally very harmless, fun-loving creatures." [...] Reg Mellor, however, commented that at their very worst, they can be [...] "cannibals, things that live only to kill, that'll eat your eyes out to get at your brain".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the propagation wave speed and wave attenuation in viscoelastic fluid-filled pipes. Relatively predictable for metal pipes, these are largely unknown for <b>plastic</b> <b>pipes,</b> since they depend onthe pipe wall properties. Wave number measurements, encompassing both wave speed and wave attenuation, were carried out on different water-filled <b>plastic</b> <b>pipes</b> using three hydrophones. The frequency-dependent wave speed and attenuation were calculated from the transfer function between three pressure measurements. Experimental results for different pipe wall materials, particularly those with applications in water supply installations, are presented. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a method of analysis in the frequency domain that can be used to determine the acoustical properties of fluid-filled <b>plastic</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Paintball {{is played}} at both {{commercial}} venues, which require paid admission, and private land; {{both of which}} may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context. [...] Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers {{are little more than}} air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of <b>plastic</b> <b>pipe</b> tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as [...] "can" [...] and [...] "snake" [...] bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.|$|E
