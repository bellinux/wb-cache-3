5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking,</b> as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{species are}} mostly {{external}} parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include Cancricepon elegans, {{found in the}} gill chambers of crabs; Athelges tenuicaudis, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; Crinoniscus equitans living inside the barnacle Balanus perforatus; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and free-living isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab and shrimp. Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what {{is believed to be}} the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.|$|E
25|$|Sugarbeet root aphids are {{characterized}} {{to be as}} small as pinheads, and take on a pale white-yellow color.

There are both winged and wingless sugarbeet root aphids.|$|R
2500|$|Sugarbeet root aphids {{have been}} found in North America and Europe. They infect sugarbeets, but also other plants like tablebeets and Swiss chard. Their size has been likened to that of a pinhead, and are pale white-yellow in color. Sugarbeet root aphids have soft bodies that are bulbous in shape, with mandibular parts that can <b>pierce</b> <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> <b>and</b> paired {{abdominal}} tubes that point backwards, and come in both winged and wingless forms.|$|R
5000|$|Pemphigus betae, {{also known}} as the {{sugarbeet}} root aphid, is a species of gall-forming aphid that forms galls specifically on the commonly found Narrowleaf Cottonwood (aka the Willow-leaved Poplar tree), Populus angustifolia.Sugarbeet root aphids have been found in North America and Europe. They infect sugarbeets, but also other plants like tablebeets and Swiss chard. Their size has been likened to that of a pinhead, and are pale white-yellow in color. Sugarbeet root aphids have soft bodies that are bulbous in shape, with mandibular parts that can <b>pierce</b> <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> <b>and</b> paired abdominal tubes that point backwards, and come in both winged and wingless forms. [...] They are known for their consequential effects on agriculture due to infestation of plants, and efforts to control the pests have proved to be difficult.|$|R
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> mouthparts {{which are used}} to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E
25|$|The larvae are {{specialised}} predators, with elongated mandibles {{adapted for}} <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking.</b> The larval body form varies between different families, {{depending on the}} nature of their prey. In general, however, they have three pairs of thoracic legs, each ending in two claws. The abdomen often has adhesive discs on the last two segments.|$|E
25|$|The Permian {{had great}} {{diversity}} in insect and other invertebrate species, including the largest insects {{ever to have}} existed. The end-Permian is the only known mass extinction of insects, with eight or nine insect orders becoming extinct and ten more greatly reduced in diversity. Palaeodictyopteroids (insects with <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> mouthparts) began to decline during the mid-Permian; these extinctions {{have been linked to}} a change in flora. The greatest decline occurred in the Late Permian and was probably not directly caused by weather-related floral transitions.|$|E
50|$|The dog flea's {{mouthparts}} are {{adapted for}} <b>piercing</b> skin <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> blood. Dog fleas are external parasites, living by hematophagy off {{the blood of}} dogs. The dog often experiences severe itching in all areas where the fleas may reside.|$|R
50|$|Eurymeloides bicincta {{is found}} on Eucalyptus trees where both nymphs <b>and</b> adults have <b>piercing</b> {{mouthparts}} <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> the sap. The excess fluid is secreted and is fed upon by ants {{which are often}} found associated with the leafhoppers. The ants do not harm the leafhoppers but may drive off potential predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} the order Hemiptera is the possession of mouthparts where the mandibles and maxillae are modified into a proboscis, sheathed within a modified labium, which is capable of <b>piercing</b> tissues <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> out the liquids. For example, true bugs, such as shield bugs, feed on the fluids of plants. Predatory bugs such as assassin bugs have the same mouthparts, but {{they are used to}} pierce the cuticles of captured prey.|$|R
500|$|Sucking lice {{are small}} {{wingless}} insects ranging from [...] in length. They have narrow heads and oval, flattened bodies. They have no ocelli, and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent. Their antennae are short with {{three to five}} segments, and their mouth parts, which are retractable into their head, are adapted for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking.</b> There is a cibarial pump {{at the start of}} the gut; it is powered by muscles attached to the inside of the cuticle of the head. The mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed, and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside the proboscis, contaiing a salivary canal (ventrally) and a food canal (dorsally). The thoracic segments are fused, the abdominal segments are separate, and there is a single large claw at the tip of each of the six legs.|$|E
2500|$|They possessed an {{inflated}} frons {{and a long}} rostrum (<b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> mouthpart), [...] {{indicating that}} they fed on xylem fluids like some other modern hemipterans.|$|E

50|$|All cimicids are small, oval-shaped, {{and flat}} in appearance, {{although}} their bodies bulge after feeding. They do not fly, but do have small, nonfunctional wing pads. They also have beak-like mouth parts {{with which they}} <b>pierce</b> the skin <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> the blood of their hosts.|$|R
5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera – the nectarivorous who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to <b>pierce</b> <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|R
50|$|The froth {{serves a}} number of purposes. It hides the nymph from the view of predators and parasites, it insulates against heat and cold, thus {{providing}} thermal control and also moisture control; without the froth the insect would quickly dry up. The nymphs <b>pierce</b> plants <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> sap causing very little damage, much of the filtered fluids go into {{the production of the}} froth, which has an acrid taste, deterring predators. A few species are serious agricultural pests.|$|R
50|$|Adult cicadas can be {{encountered}} in summer feeding on sap from trees or shrubs, with their mouthparts well adapted for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking.</b>|$|E

50|$|Palaeontinids {{had large}} bodies covered with {{bristles}} (setae). They had small heads and broad wings. They superficially resemble moths. Large palaeontinids like Colossocossus had forewings that reached {{the length of}} 57 to 71 mm.They possessed an inflated frons and a long rostrum (<b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> mouthpart), indicating that they fed on xylem fluids like some other modern hemipterans.|$|E
25|$|One pair of antennae, {{each with}} five segments, {{protrudes}} from the insect's head. Head lice also have {{one pair of}} eyes. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member), but are reduced or absent in most {{other members of the}} Anoplura suborder. Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for <b>piercing</b> skin <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding.|$|R
500|$|Fleas are {{wingless}} insects, 1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.5 to 3.3mm) long, {{that are}} agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown {{of the cat}} flea), with a proboscis, or stylet, adapted to feeding by <b>piercing</b> the skin <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> their host's blood through their epipharynx. [...] Flea legs end in strong claws {{that are designed to}} grasp a host.|$|R
50|$|Lace bugs {{are usually}} host-specific {{and can be}} very {{destructive}} to plants. Most feed on the undersides of leaves by <b>piercing</b> the epidermis <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> the sap. The then empty cells give the leaves a bronzed or silvery appearance. Each individual usually completes its entire lifecycle on the same plant, if not the same part of the plant.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouthparts}} show, {{according to}} the systematic group, a variety of conformations. Mouthparts are modified and combined into a sucking proboscis, which is highly variable in structure. The ancestral condition is the <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> type proboscis, more modified proboscis forms variously rasp or sponge fluids. Some species have non-functional adult mouthparts. No flies bite {{in the sense of}} cutting food.|$|E
50|$|The {{silver birch}} aphid {{is a light}} green colour with a bluish tinge. The blueness {{is due to the}} dusting of blue wax {{particles}} which are particularly obvious on the antennae and legs. All adults have membranous wings and during the spring and summer, all individuals are female. The mouthparts are specialised to form a slender stylet for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> sap from their host tree.|$|E
50|$|Tests in the USA {{have found}} 'Cathedral' {{to be less}} {{resistant}} to Dutch elm disease than its WARF stablemates such as 'New Horizon', although damage is usually confined to the branch tips. Studies in France by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) confirmed the tree as only 'moderately resistant'. The leaves are also favoured by leaf hoppers and other insects that feed by <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ants {{harvest the}} seed, {{attracted}} by the fleshy, oil rich elaiosome (or seed stalk), which they bury and store in widely dispersed locations. These seeds are buried ready for germinating with the next soaking rains. However a [...] "wattle seed-eating insect' which enjoys liquid meals using its proboscis-like injector to <b>pierce</b> the testa <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> out the embryo often reduces the seeds viability.|$|R
50|$|Insect {{mouthparts}} {{exhibit a}} range of forms. The earliest insects had chewing mouthparts. Specialisation includes mouthparts modified for siphoning, <b>piercing,</b> <b>sucking</b> <b>and</b> sponging. These modifications have evolved a number of times. For example, mosquitoes (which are flies) and aphids (which are bugs) both <b>pierce</b> <b>and</b> suck; however, female mosquitoes feed on animal blood whereas aphids feed on plant fluids. This section {{provides an overview of}} the individual mouthparts of chewing insects.|$|R
40|$|Published online: 16 July 2017 The brown pod-sucking bug, Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stäl (Hemiptera: Coreidae), causes {{significant}} damage to cultivated cowpea, Vigna unguiculata Walp, a staple crop in sub-Saharan Africa. C. tomentosicollis <b>pierce</b> <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> sap from cowpea pods, resulting in reduced grain yield and quality. The complete, 16, 089 bp mitogenome of C. tomentosicollis encodes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and an A + T rich control region, with gene order and orientation {{identical to that}} of the insect ancestral gene order. The initiation and termination codons for the PCGs used standard ATN codons and TAA or TAG codons respectively. All predicted tRNAs fold into a clover-leaf secondary structures with the exception of tRNA-Ser (AGN) with a semi-loop dihydrouridine arm. The 1509 bps A + T rich region contains a single 89 bp tandem repeat unit duplicated 3. 7 times. When compared with other published Coreoidea mitogenomes, C. tomentosicollis was also highly A − T skewed, and similar in both size and A − T%; however, its longer tandem repeat within the A + T rich region was unique. The C. tomentosicollis mitogenome can serve as a foundation to combine molecular marker data with pest monitoring strategies to better understand the population dynamics of this species.

50|$|Insects {{exhibit a}} range of mouthparts, adapted to {{particular}} modes of feeding. The earliest insects had chewing mouthparts. Specialization has mostly been for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking,</b> although {{a range of}} specializations exist, as these modes of feeding have evolved {{a number of times}} (for example, mosquitoes (which are flies) and aphids (which are true bugs) both pierce and suck, however female mosquitoes feed on animal blood whereas aphids feed on plant fluids). In this page, the individual mouthparts are introduced for chewing insects. Specializations are generally described thereafter.|$|E
50|$|Most hemipterans are phytophagous, {{using their}} sucking and {{piercing}} mouthparts {{to feed on}} plant sap. These include cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, froghoppers, aphids, whiteflies, scale insects, and some other groups. Some are monophages, being host specific and only found on one plant taxon, others are oligophages, feeding on a few plant groups, while others again are less discriminating polyphages and feed on many species of plant. The relationship between hemipterans and plants appears to be ancient, with <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> of plants evident in the Early Devonian period.|$|E
500|$|Fleas {{are small}} flightless insects {{that form the}} order Siphonaptera. As {{external}} parasites of mammals and birds, they live by consuming the blood of their hosts. Adults are up to about [...] long and usually brown. Bodies flattened sideways enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers; strong claws prevent them from being dislodged. They lack wings, and have mouthparts adapted for <b>piercing</b> skin <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> blood <b>and</b> hind legs adapted for jumping. The latter enable them to leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by froghoppers. Larvae are worm-like with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris.|$|R
5|$|The adult {{body has}} a {{hardened}} exoskeleton, {{except for the}} abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> <b>suck</b> blood or fruit juices. Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced. The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, act as olfactory radar, and also aid navigation, orientation and balance during flight. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external genitalia. The genitalia are complex and {{provide the basis for}} family identification and species discrimination.|$|R
5000|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} hemipterans is their [...] "beak" [...] {{in which the}} modified mandibles and maxillae form a [...] "stylet" [...] which is sheathed within a modified labium. The stylet is capable of <b>piercing</b> tissues <b>and</b> <b>sucking</b> liquids, while the labium supports it. The stylet contains a channel for the outward movement of saliva and another for the inward movement of liquid food. A salivary pump drives saliva into the prey; a cibarial pump extracts liquid from the prey. Both pumps are powered by substantial dilator muscles in the head. The beak is usually folded under the body when not in use. The diet is typically plant sap, but some hemipterans such as assassin bugs are blood-suckers, and a few are predators.|$|R
