Various ophthalmological and clinical-chemical parameters, including fluorescence angiography, were assessed. Compared with placebo therapy a significant improvement in visual acuity was observed with ticlopidine for branch vein occlusions; the same trend was seen for the central retinal vein occlusions. Increased ADP-induced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> was frequently found: in 72 % of the central retinal vein occlusions and 70 % of the branch vein occlusions.

NND-IV-PLA 2 {{is the most}} catalytically active enzyme isolated from the Indian cobra venom. The acidic PLA 2 profile of Southern regional Indian cobra venom is distinctly {{different from that of}} the Western and Eastern regional venom. However the acidic PLA 2 s from all the regions follow the pattern of increasing catalytic activity with increase in the acidic nature of the PLA 2 isoform. NND-IV-PLA 2 is a class B 1 <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> inhibitor and <b>inhibits</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> induced by ADP, collagen and epinephrine. Modification of the active site of Histidine abolishes both catalytic activity and <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> inhibition activities, while aristolochic acid an acidic PLA 2 inhibitor has only a partial effect on the two activities.

40|$|AbstractThe serine-proteinase {{cathepsin}} G (CG) is {{a potent}} agonist of <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> inducing the release and surface expression of α-granule adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen (Fg) and thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1). Because Fg and TSP- 1 are potential substrates for the enzymatic activity of CG, we investigated the fate of these proteins during CG-induced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> using an immunoblot technique. Only {{a small proportion of}} secreted Fg was proteolyzed by CG and <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> was efficiently <b>inhibited</b> by anti-fibrinogen Fab fragments. In contrast, TSP- 1 was extensively proteolyzed on aggregated platelets releasing in the milieu a fragment with Mr ≈ 28 000, corresponding to the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD). Several antibodies, directed against the cell-associated carboxy-terminal TSP- 1 f fragment (Mr ≈ 165 000) impaired the formation of stable macroaggregates, indicating that this fragment may contribute to <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> {{in the absence of the}} HBD...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the hypotensive action produced by ketanserin during chronic treatment in humans remains unknown. In contrast to previous reports, recent data show that ex vivo inhibition of the serotonin-induced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> can be demonstrated in men during chronic ketanserin administration, provided that the pH is controlled in the in vitro assay. This test {{could be used as}} a tool to measure the degree of serotonin inhibition, at least at the platelet level. There has been some controversy as to whether ketanserin, a serotonin S 2 receptor antagonist, inhi-bits serotonin-induced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> during chronic administration to men. In a previous paper, we described the hypotensive action and the ex vivo <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> induced by serotonin during chronic treatment with ketanserin in patients with hypertension' 11. Ketanserin lowered the blood pressure but the ex vivo <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> was not <b>inhibited</b> after 3 weeks, although inhibition wa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{administration}} of intracoronary streptokinase {{to a patient}} with a prior history of rheumatic fever {{was associated with the}} retrograde propagation of thrombus from the left anterior descending coronary artery into the left main coronary artery with near catastrophic consequences. The addition of streptokinase to platelet-rich plasma from the patient initiated <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> and secretion in vitro. <b>Platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> was also seen in 1 of 15 control subjects after the addition of streptokinase, and the addition of plasma or immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the index patient supported <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> in the presence of streptokinase in all of the previously nonreactive control subjects. This in vitro <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> was specific for streptokinase and not initiated by either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator. Streptokinase-induced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> was not <b>inhibited</b> by aprotinin, but was completely attenuated by the addition of an excess of antihuman IgG Fab. These findings suggest that streptokinase can initiate specific antibody-mediated <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> in vitro and may be more than coincidentally related to clot propagation or thromboembolism in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{nematode}} parasites {{that cause}} human lymphatic filariasis survive {{for long periods}} in their vascular habitats despite continual exposure to host cells. Platelets do not adhere to blood-borne microfilariae, and thrombo-occlusive phenomena are not observed in patients with circulating microfilariae. We studied the ability of microfilariae to <b>inhibit</b> human <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation</b> in vitro. Brugia malayi microfilariae incubated with human platelets caused dose-dependent inhibition of agonist-induced <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation,</b> thromboxane generation, and serotonin release. As few as one microfilaria per 10 (4) <b>platelets</b> completely <b>inhibited</b> <b>aggregation</b> of <b>platelets</b> induced by thrombin, collagen, arachidonic acid, or ionophore A 23187. Microfilariae also <b>inhibited</b> <b>aggregation</b> of <b>platelets</b> in platelet-rich plasma stimulated by ADP, compound U 46619, or platelet-activating factor. The inhibition required intimate proximity but not direct contact between parasites and platelets, and was mediated by parasite-derived soluble factors of low (less than 1, 000 Mr) molecular weight that were labile in aqueous media and caused an elevation of platelet cAMP. Prior treatment of microfilariae with pharmacologic inhibitors of cyclooxygenase decreased both parasite release of prostacyclin and PGE 2 and microfilarial inhibition of <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation.</b> These results indicate that microfilariae <b>inhibit</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>aggregation,</b> via mechanisms that may include the elaboration of anti-aggregatory eicosanoids...|$|R
