5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} the main <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of Embarkation. The congestion {{at the port}} led experts to realize {{the need for a}} port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E

25|$|In March 1898, Camp Black {{was formed}} on the Hempstead Plains (roughly the shared {{location}} of Hempstead and Garden City), {{in support of}} the impending Spanishâ€“American War. Camp Black was bounded on the north by Old Country Road, on the west by Clinton Road, and on the south by the Central Line rail.

25|$|Also, {{due to a}} {{micro-climate}} in {{the area}} of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit cultivation (something rare {{to the rest of the}} island), where oblong apples (similar to pears in shape) were grown. The small port of Alagoa, for many decades, was the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for orange exports from the valley; an example of a successes in a peripheral economy, orange exports were sent directly to England, by English and Portuguese ships.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the twentieth}} century, the port of Libau became a central <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for {{immigrants}} traveling to the United States. By 1906 the direct ship service to the United States was used by 40,000 migrants per year. Simultaneously, the first Russian training school of submarine navigation was founded. In 1912 {{one of the first}} water aerodromes in Russia was opened in Libau. In 1913, 1,738 ships entered Libau, with 1,548,119 tones of cargo passing through the port. The population had increased from 10,000 to over 100,000 within about 60 years.|$|E

Many of the pubs to which they provided access from water level were destroyed by bombing during World War II. For centuries these locations dotted along {{the entire length of}} the river Thames shoreline were the final <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> at which countless individuals began a forced or chosen new life overseas. It remains to be seen if these strange emotive architectural curiosities, milestones in London's long maritime history, that are located outside the now restored old Pool of London's borders, will be preserved for future generations.|$|R
50|$|Eugenio Serrano de Casanova (journalist, {{writer and}} entrepreneur) tried {{to launch an}} {{exposition}} in 1886, and when that failed, the Mayor of Barcelona, Francesc Rius i Taulet, took over the planning of the project. The fair was hosted on the reconstructed 115 acre site of the city's main public park, the Parc de la Ciutadella, with Vilaseca's Arc de Triomf forming the entrance. More than 2 million people from Spain, the rest of Europe, and other international <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> visited the exhibition, which made the equivalent of 1,737,000 United States dollars. The fair was opened by Alfonso XIII of Spain and Maria Christina of Austria. Twenty-seven countries participated, including China, Japan and the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, {{when the}} then Governor General, Lord Northbrook decided to visit Assam, the local {{administration}} focused its {{attention on a}} grand welcome for Northbrook.

Later the place adjacent to the Sukreswar Devalaya, {{was selected as the}} spot where the Governor General's ship would anchor. And construction of the gate started at the location.|$|R
500|$|Another plan {{seeks to}} turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, {{as well as a}} {{functioning}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated. As part of the development plans, the Israeli Navy, which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between Bat Galim and Hof Hashaket. A [...] long esplanade which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass {{on their way to the}} sea.|$|E

2500|$|The draft {{agreement}} says that U.S. military and Defense Department civilian personnel {{are exempt from}} visa requirements and taxation. Afghan taxes and other fees will not be imposed on the entry or exit of goods specifically {{for the use of}} U.S. forces. An annex to the draft lists locations where Afghanistan agrees to provide facilities for U.S. forces, including Kabul; Bagram, north of the capital, where the United States has its largest current base; Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan; Herat in the west; Kandahar in the south; Shindand in Herat province; Sharab in Helmand province; Gardez, south of Kabul; and Jalalabad, to the east. The draft document gives the U.S. the right to deploy American forces on nine bases, including the two biggest, the airfields in Bagram and Kandahar. It also allows U.S. military planes to fly in and out of Afghanistan from seven air bases, including Kabul International Airport. U.S. forces would be permitted under the document to transport supplies from five border crossings, described along with the air bases as [...] "official <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and debarkation." [...] All bases in Afghanistan would revert to Afghan ownership and sovereignty after 2014, according to the draft.|$|R
40|$|Itineraries are under-researched within tourism, {{which is}} arguably strange given their {{potential}} importance as determinants of visitor expenditure distribution, and how itinerary planning {{may become a}} tool of destination management in determining which areas are most affected by visitor flows, whether positively or negatively. This exploratory study required students in New Zealand and the Peoples' Republic of China to draw maps of potential trips to the south-west of the USA {{in order to assess}} to what degree differences might exist as to (i) preferred places to visit; (ii) durations of stay; (iii) speeds of dispersion and concentration at the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and disembarkation (in this instance Los Angeles); and (iv) total distances travelled. Differences were indeed found, and ethnicity appeared to be the main explanatory variable for the differences. Chinese students were found to travel slightly less, not to become so dispersed overall, but were also found to have higher rates of dispersion and slower rates of concentration at the commencement {{and at the end of}} the trip. The itineraries also suggest a further triangular pattern of travel that can be added to the categories identified by Oppermann. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
2500|$|When {{transporting}} troops, Commonwealths usual {{route from}} Stonington to New York City was slightly altered, with the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> sometimes moved to Groton, Connecticut and the destination to Jersey City. After disembarking at Jersey, regiments then typically travelled on by train to Philadelphia. Here they were invariably given an enthusiastic reception {{by the local}} populace, which included a [...] "splendid repast" [...] at the Cooper Shop Refreshment Saloon, a venue maintained for the troops throughout the war by local volunteers. While the meal was greatly appreciated, some soldiers {{are said to have}} left the city with fonder memories still of the passionate embraces of the local females, who lined the streets to bid them farewell on their departure.

2500|$|An {{important}} work by a Flemish [...] "follower of Patenir" [...] is the Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast of about 1540 (787 x 1447mm), in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, [...] "which has justly been labelled {{the earliest known}} pure marine painting". [...] This probably represents the meeting of two small fleets involved in escorting a Portuguese princess going to be married; a type of ceremonial maritime subject which remained very common in court art until the late 17th century, although more often set at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> or arrival. Another example is the painting in the Royal Collection showing Henry VIII embarking for the Field of the Cloth of Gold, which is typical in clearly showing the ships side-on, with no attempt to adjust for the high view point. [...] A superb coloured drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger of a ship crowded with drunken lansquenets was perhaps done {{in preparation for a}} mural in London. [...] This adopts the low viewpoint typical of the ship portrait.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{entry to}} World War I, the U.S. {{government}} took {{over control of}} the Hamburg-American Line piers in Hoboken under eminent domain, and Hudson became the major <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for more than three million soldiers, known as [...] "doughboys". In 1916, an act of sabotage literally and figuratively shook the region when German agents set off bombs at the munitions depot in New York Bay at Black Tom. The fore-runner of Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was established on April 30, 1921. Huge transportation projects opened between the wars: The Holland Tunnel in 1927, The Bayonne Bridge in 1931, and The Lincoln Tunnel in 1937, allowing vehicular travel between New Jersey and New York City to bypass the waterfront. Hackensack River crossings, notably the Pulaski Skyway, were also built. What was to become New Jersey City University opened. Major Works Progress Administration projects included construction of stadiums in Jersey City and Union City. Both were named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who attended the opening of the largest project of them all, The Jersey City Medical Center, a massive complex built in the Art Deco Style. During this era the [...] "Hudson County Democratic Machine", known for its cronyism and corruption, with Jersey City mayor Frank Hague at its head was at its most powerful. Industries in Hudson were crucial to the war effort during WWII, including the manufacture PT boats by Elco in Bayonne. Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne (MOTBY) was opened in 1942 as a U.S. military base and remained in operation until 1999.|$|E
5000|$|Fort Benton {{was founded}} in 1846-48 by Alexander Culbertson, a fur trader working for the Chouteau {{brothers}} firm. It was named for Senator Thomas Hart Benton, and was originally {{little more than a}} palisaded fort, with the facilities of the trading firm within. At first goods were moved up and down the river by keelboats and other human or animal-powered watercraft. In 1859 the Chouteaus acquired a steamboat, and began service from St. Louis, Missouri. At more than 3000 river miles from the sea, it has been described as [...] "the world's innermost port". From 1860 to 1890 it was one <b>of</b> the principal <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for supplies and good that drove the development of the American West. Its proximity to Canada meant that goods and supplies also traveled north, helping fuel the growth of cities such as Edmonton, Alberta. Goods were loaded and unloaded on the levee, and merchants managing the trade had their business on Front Street, with homes nearby. The river trade declined in the late 19th century after railroads became a more reliable means of transportation in the region.|$|R

40|$|Astronomy {{is by far}} {{the most}} popular of the {{physical}} sciences, enticing enough to become a major cultural preoccupation for many, and for some an enthralling scientific activity which veritably rules their lives. What is the nature of that seemingly unstoppable attraction? In this lively and compelling account, William Sheehan â€“ professional psychiatrist, noted historian of astronomy, and incurable observer - explores the nature of that allure through the story of man's visual exploration of the planets. In this volume, the first of a trilogy, Sheehan starts with observational astronomyâ€™s profound and lasting effect on his own life, setting the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> for the journey to come. He travels across the historical landscape seeking the earliest origins of man's compulsion to observe the planets among the hunter gatherers of the upper palaeolithic, and traces the evolving story from the planetary records of the earliest cities, to Pharonic Egypt through to Hellenistic Greek astronomy culminating in Ptolemy. The necessity to observe played its part in the perceptual changes wrought by the Copernican revolution, as well as the observational advances achieved by such extraordinary characters as Tycho with his sharpest of eyes, and his luxurious practice of total astronomy. The two epochal advances published in 1609, both born through planetary observation, namely Kepler's discovery of the true nature of the orbit of Mars and Harriot and Galileoâ€™s observations of the Moon, have a pivotal place in this account. Sheehan weaves a rich tapestry of social and technological settings, patronage and personalities, equipment and skills, cosmologies and goals, motives and compulsions to try to explain why we have observed, and continue to observe, the planets. The compelling text of A Passion for the Planets is enhanced by the specially commissioned planetary artwork of Julian Baum, himself son of a noted planetary observer and historian of planetary observers, and Randall Rosenfeld. A Passion for the Planets will be of interest to all amateur astronomers; active planetary observers; armchair astronomers; those interested in the history of astronomy; the cultural history of science; and astronomical art...|$|R

25|$|During World War II, San Francisco was {{the major}} {{mainland}} supply <b>point</b> and port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> {{for the war in}} the Pacific. It also saw the largest and oldest enclave of Japanese outside of Japan, Japantown, completely empty out many of its residents as a result of Executive Order 9066 that forced all Japanese of birth or descent in the United States to be interned. By 1943 many large sections of the neighborhood remained vacant due to the forced internment. The void was quickly filled by thousands of African Americans who had left the South to find wartime industrial jobs in California as part of the Great Migration. Many African Americans also settled in the Fillmore District and most notably near the Bayview-Hunters Point shipyards, working in the dry-docks there. The same docks at Hunters Point would be used for loading the key fissile components of the first atomic bomb onto the USS Indianapolis in July 1945 for transfer to Tinian.|$|R
