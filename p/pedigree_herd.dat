40|$|The {{majority}} of sires used in New Zealand herds are obtained from pedigree breeders and in consequence, the genetic merit {{of the national}} herd depends largely upon {{the quality of the}} pedigree section of the cattle breeding industry. The continued use of pedigree sires by many commercial farms has probably resulted in a narrowing of the genetic margin between registered and non-registered dairy cattle. Upon this genetic margin the present elite status of pedigree cattle depends and if it were possible to demonstrate that this margin was negligible then the present rigid distinction between pedigree and non-pedigree stock would not be justified. This would have far reaching implications the most important of which would be that there would be little justification in restricting sires used in the industry to those bred in <b>pedigree</b> <b>herds.</b> On the other hand if it were possible to demonstrate that <b>pedigree</b> <b>herds</b> were improving genetically and preserving a genetic margin over commercial herds then the present policy of attempting to effect national herd improvement through the pedigree section of the industry would be vindicated...|$|R

40|$|Genetically similar {{nulliparous}} Polled Hereford heifers from {{a closed}} <b>pedigree</b> <b>herd</b> {{were used to}} evaluate the effects of dietary protein during the first and second trimester of gestation upon fetal, placental and postnatal growth. Heifers were randomly allocated into two groups at 35 d post AI (35 dpc) to a single bull and fed High (15. 7 %CP) or Low (5. 9 %CP) protein in the first trimester (T 1). At 90 dpc, half of each nutritional treatment group changed to a High or Low protein diet for the second trimester until 180 dpc (T 2). High protein intake in the second trimester increased birthweight in females (P = 0. 05) but there was no effect of treatment upon birthweight when taken over both sexes. Biparietal diameter was significantly increased by high protein in the second trimester with the effect being greater in the female (P = 0. 02) but also significant overall (P = 0. 05). Placental weight was positively correlated with birth weight, fibroblast volume, and relative blood vessel volume (P < 0. 05). Placental fibroblast density was increased and trophoblast volume decreased in the high protein first trimester treatment group (P < 0. 05). There was a trend for placental weight to be increased by high protein in the second trimester (P = 0. 06). Calves from heifers fed the high protein treatment in the second trimester weighed significantly more on all occasions preweaning (at one month (P = 0. 0004), 2 mths (P = 0. 006), 3 mths (P = 0. 002), 4 mths (P = 0. 01), 5 mths (P = 41 0. 03), 6 mths (P = 0. 001)), and grew at a faster rate over the 6 month period. By 6 mths of age the calves from heifers fed high nutrition in the second trimester weighed 33 kg heavier than those fed the low diet in the second trimester. These results suggest that dietary protein in early pregnancy alters the development of the bovine placenta and calf growth to weaning...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic parameters for milk production and selected fertility traits in Irish dairy cattle. Data were derived from 74 seasonal spring-calving dairy herds with a potential cow population of 6, 783 in the 1999 calving season. The average 305 -day yields (kg) of milk, fat, and protein, the concentrations (g/kg) of fat and protein were 6572, 245, 222, 37. 6 and 33. 9, respectively. Calving to first service interval (CFS), calving to conception interval (DO) and first service to conception interval (FSCO) averaged 72, 90, and 17 days, respectively, while pregnancy rate to first service (PRFS) and number of services/cow were 0. 48 and 1. 78, respectively. The proportion of cows conceiving within the first 21, 42, and 63 days after start of breeding (PR 21, PR 42, and PR 63) were 0. 36, 0. 57 and 0. 72, respectively. (Co) variance components were estimated for the complete data set as well as a separate analysis for pedigree and non-pedigree herds within the data set. Heritability estimates, using the complete data set, for milk production traits ranged from 0. 22 (± 0. 042) for milk yield to 0. 70 (± 0. 049) for milk fat concentration while heritability estimates for fertility traits ranged from zero for PR 21 to 0. 03 (± 0. 017) for CFS and SBFS (start of breeding to first service interval). Heritability estimates were numerically greater than zero for all fertility traits in the <b>pedigree</b> <b>herd</b> data set with the exception of PR 21. Only two fertility traits had heritability estimates for the non-pedigree herds, namely, CFS (0. 03 ± 0. 030), SBFS (0. 03 ± 0. 030); analyses for the other fertility traits failed to converge. Genetic correlations between production and fertility traits were mostly antagonistic, for example, correlations between milk yield and number of services (0. 98 ± 0. 35) and PRFS (- 0. 51 ± 0. 61).

40|$|At present {{there is}} a lack of {{information}} concerning the breeding methods practised by owners of pedigree dairy cattle in New Zealand. This deficiency is a serious handicap in attacking some of the major problems facing the dairy industry in this country. Since the emergence of the Dairy Board in 1936 as the main national force concerned with herd improvement a great deal has been achieved in the field of dairy cattle improvement and the evolution of a sire survey applicable to conditions obtaining in New Zealand is one of the major achievements of the Dairy Board. But many aspects of the pedigree industry which provides the majority of sires used in the Dominion remain to be elucidated. For example, the present scarcity of proven sires, and the more or less stationary level of production of commercial herds are some of the problems which have direct bearing on the pedigree section of the dairy industry. These facts alone illustrate the importance of the study of current breeding methods and of the pedigree system as it exists in New Zealand. Many investigations relating to dairy cattle breeding have been carried out overseas. Although many of the problems studied are encountered in New Zealand, the Dominion's typical grassland farming and the seasonal dairying associated with it limit the usefulness of such investigations. With more information becoming available breed societies are beginning to adjust themselves to a new phase of cattle breeding. The increasing emphasis on production as an aid to selection, and the acceptance of artificial insemination are two phases in which a change of attitude is desirable. The rapid growth of <b>pedigree</b> <b>herds,</b> the more frequent appearance of performance details in pedigrees and the increasing number of pedigree animals mated artificially each year illustrate this gradual change...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} accounts in Farm Account Scheme (FAS) format of two Scottish farms in Organic conversion are examined and compared to Scottish average data. Farm 1 {{is a family}} run mixed farm with cereals, seed potatoes, cattle and sheep. Conversion has been phased with conversion ground in grass and set-aside, while cereals and potatoes have been grown conventionally until they could be grown organically. Cereal area was reduced so that livestock numbers and potato area could be maintained. The phased conversion plus organic aid payments has maintained the above average profitability although good prices for organic malting barley and seed potatoes have helped but these premiums may not be maintained. Farm 2 is an all grass dairy farm with two 150 cow <b>pedigree</b> Holstein <b>herds</b> on a high input high output system now 9 months into conversion. The two herds were reduced and merged on to one site to form one 200 cow herd.

40|$|A {{seroepidemiological study}} was {{undertaken}} in a <b>pedigree</b> dairy <b>herd</b> {{that had a}} history of abortions due to neosporosis. The infection in this closed herd was thought to have arisen from a point-source infection, after which sporadic abortions have occurred. All cattle were bled twice, once in the winter and again the following summer and antibodies to N. caninum measured using an ELISA. The overall seroprevalence of Neospora was found to be 18 %. Three data sets; age-prevalence data, dam-daughter pair analysis and family tree data showed vertical transmission to be an important route of transmission of neosporosis in this herd. Analysis of anti- Neospora antibody titres with respect to the stage in the breeding cycle of cows appeared to show no association on a herd level. Data was collected on the number of Artificial Insemination (AI) services per successful pregnancy which showed a significantly greater number of Al services in Neospora-seropositive cattle compared with Neospora-seronegative cattle. This is the first study to assess the effect of neosporosis on cattle fertility in a quantitative manner and suggests that a wider study is justified. N. caninum shares many similarities with T gondii and has widely been assumed also to have a world-wide distribution. Two regions of Africa, Ghana in West Africa and Tanzania in East Africa, were studied in a cross-sectional survey of neosporosis in cattle indigenous to these areas. A prevalence of 8. 1 % and 2 % was found in two different areas in cattle native to Tanzania. Despite sampling a significant number of cattle in all three ecological zones of Ghana and of several different breeds, no Neospora-seropositive cattle were found. Possible reasons for the apparent absence of N. caninum in West Africa are discussed. To determine the overall genetic diversity in laboratory isolates of N. caninum, RAPD and AFLP methods were used. Genetic diversity was found to be low amongst Neospora laboratory isolates, relative to T. gondii, but demonstrated that genetic heterogeneity does exist within the species. Both RAPD and AFLP data were subjected to pair-wise similarity and cluster analysis and showed that there was no clustering with respect to host or geographical origin. The genetic similarity between cattle and dog isolates suggests that these hosts are epidemiologically related. In order to exploit the genetic heterogeneity in N. caninum to analyse a wider range of clinical field samples, several methods were attempted to devise PCR-based sequence-specific typing approaches that could be used on infected bovine tissue. Microsatellite markers were identified in N. caninum DNA sequences, however none of the microsatellite regions gave rise to detectable size differences, although they remain to be tested on a wider range of field samples. Laboratory isolates of N. caninum were also analysed for polymorphisms with two conserved minisatellite probes, 33. 6 and 33. 15, but although hybridisation occurred to digested parasite DNA, identical fingerprints were obtained for each isolate. In a final attempt to identify sequence-specific polymorphic markers, intron regions from two genes, actin and tubulin, were amplified and sequenced in both laboratory and field isolates. This approach revealed a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were able to differentiate between some isolates of N. caninum and might serve as useful molecular markers. SNPs were found more frequently in the clinical field samples, suggesting that the diversity of N. caninum is greater than that represented by current laboratory isolates. Further genotyping of field samples will enable the genetic population structure of N. caninum to be determined to facilitate molecular epidemiological studies.
