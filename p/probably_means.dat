5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, {{there was nothing for}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{provision}} in the will of Robert Quigley King that mentions his Missouri farm or Grassland Farm, which <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> that he had given them outright during his life to his sons Ward and Leffler respectively. However, {{at the time of}} his father's death, Leffler had moved back to Springfield, leaving his son, Edwin Askam King in charge of Grassland Farm.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known form of {{the name}} is Crostorfin, recorded in 1128. This <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> 'Torfin's crossing'; in ancient times, much {{of the land in}} the area consisted of small lochs and marshes, with Corstorphine situated at an ideal crossing point. The identity of Torfin is not certainly known, but he was likely a local baron who commanded a stronghold by the crossing. The name is a Gaelicised version of the Norse name Thorfinnr, and was popular in Scotland around 1000.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the 185s {{having a}} higher {{capacity}} than two-car 158s, 185s frequently left passengers behind due to severe overcrowding at peak times. Transport for Greater Manchester stated in 2007 that projected passenger numbers would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> that [...] 8-car units {{would be needed}} by 2014.|$|R
25|$|The {{first choice}} to replace Tuda was Wilfrid, a {{particularly}} zealous partisan of the Roman cause. Because of the plague, {{there were not}} the requisite three bishops available to ordain him, so {{he had gone to}} the Frankish Kingdom of Neustria to seek ordination. This was on the initiative of Alfrid, sub-king of Deira, although presumably Oswiu knew and approved this action at the time. Bede tells us that Alfrid sought a bishop for himself and his own people. This <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> the people of Deira. According to Bede, Tuda had been succeeded as abbot of Lindisfarne by Eata, who had been elevated to the rank of bishop.|$|E
25|$|The name Wycombe {{appears to}} come from the river Wye and the old English word for a wooded valley, combe, but {{according}} to the Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names the name, which was first recorded in 799-802 as 'Wichama', {{is more likely to be}} Old English 'wic' and the plural of Old English 'ham', and <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> 'dwellings'; the name of the river was a late back-formation. Wycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.|$|E
500|$|The Roman {{name for}} the fort, Epiacum, is given in Ptolemy's Geography as the first town {{in the area of}} the Brigantes tribe of northeastern England. The name <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "the property, or estate of Eppius. 'Eppius' is a Romanised Celtic or British name, and he may have been a local leader of the tribe of Brigantes." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite the 185s {{having a}} higher {{capacity}} than two-car 158s, 185s frequently leave passengers behind due to severe overcrowding at peak times. Transport for Greater Manchester stated in 2007 that projected passenger numbers would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> that 100 - 125 mph 8-car units {{would be needed}} by 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names {{gives the}} {{derivation}} {{of the name}} Glentham as glente + hām, meaning either 'homestead frequented by birds of prey' or 'homestead at a lookout place'. Caenby is said to <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> 'farmstead or village of a man called Cāfna or Kafni'.|$|R
500|$|Although magi (Greek μαγοι) {{is usually}} {{translated}} as [...] "wise men," [...] {{in this context}} it <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "astronomer" [...] or [...] "astrologer". The involvement of astrologers {{in the story of}} the birth of Jesus was problematic for the early Church, because they condemned astrology as demonic; a widely cited explanation was that of Tertullian, who suggested that astrology was allowed 'only until the time of the Gospel'.|$|E
500|$|John McKinnell {{states that}} the name of Þorgerðr's father is {{probably}} a later addition used to explain {{the origins of the}} name of Hålogaland, and that [...] "Hǫlgabrúðr" [...] <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "bride of the (rulers of) Hålogaland" [...] and that Hǫrðabrúðr, similarly, may mean [...] "bride of the (rulers of) Hörðaland." [...] Hǫrðabrúðr as [...] "bride of the heathen shrines," [...] and hǫldabrúðr as either [...] "bride of the people of Holde" [...] or [...] "bride of noblemen." [...] McKinnell says that the variety of stories and names suggest that the tradition of Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr was wide spread, and that she was venerated in more than one area.|$|E
500|$|According to Nomura, [...] "death {{should be}} {{something}} sudden and unexpected, and Aerith's death seemed more natural and realistic." [...] He said: [...] "When I reflect on Final Fantasy VII, {{the fact that}} fans were so offended by her sudden death <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> that we were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character." [...] From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true; [...] "the world was expecting us {{to bring her back}} to life, as this is the classic convention." [...] A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that [...] "there are many meanings in Aerith's death and [...] could never happen." ...|$|E
60|$|What Dave had surmised was correct. Ward Porton {{had thought}} {{to get on a}} train that would stop at Barnett inside of the next ten minutes. Now, however, he {{realized}} that to go to the depot and hang around until the cars took their departure would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> capture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lookahead}} {{can also}} be helpful in deciding when to reduce a rule. The lookahead can help avoid reducing a specific rule if the lookahead is not valid, which would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> that the current state should be combined with the following instead of the previous state. That means that in the following example ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{doubtful}} many buccaneers got off {{with just a}} time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. A sentence such as [...] "fifty stripes on the back followed by a day of public display (or humiliation)" [...] would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> flogging and the pillory.|$|R
500|$|Ranulf {{worked to}} {{complete}} the cathedral which his predecessor, William de St-Calais, had begun; fortified Durham with a wall around Durham Castle, built Norham Castle to help defend the Tweed River; and endowed the collegiate church of Christchurch, Hampshire. He built or expanded other churches, including the one at Christchurch in Hampshire which he had endowed, and St. Martin's in Dover. The first stone bridge at Durham was completed by his instruction in 1120, the so-called Framwellgate Bridge, a bridge described as [...] "of wonderful workmanship." [...] He cleared and levelled the Palace Green in Durham between the castle and the cathedral. While the chroniclers mainly condemned Ranulf for his morals, his own cathedral chapter held him in high esteem because of his building activities and his defence {{of the rights of}} Durham. Although he usurped some of the income of the cathedral chapter, the money from those rights was used {{to complete the}} cathedral rebuilding, and later restored the income to the monks as well as increasing the endowment. At his death, the cathedral walls were complete up to [...] "the covering", which <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> the vault instead of the roof.|$|E
500|$|The name Maiden Castle is {{not unique}} to the site and occurs in several other places in Britain, such as Maiden Castle in Dorset, and <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> a [...] "fortification that looks impregnable" [...] or one that has never been taken in battle. Despite {{quarrying}} in the 17th century and 20th-century military exercises on the site, Maiden Castle survives well. Maiden Castle was excavated between 1932 and 1935 by W. J. Varley, who also undertook excavations at Eddisbury hill fort, as part of his investigation into the origin of Cheshire's hill forts. Further excavations were undertaken in 19801981. The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995, giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change. The environment of the hill fort is a mixture of heathland, heather, and bracken. The site is owned by the National Trust and is open to the public. Unrestricted access has led to problems such as erosion. Maiden Castle has been damaged by animal burrows and is designated as [...] "at high risk" [...] due to erosion caused by visitors and the spread of bracken. Five of Cheshire's seven hill forts have been assessed as being [...] "at high risk" [...] compared to 15% of North West England's Scheduled Monuments.|$|E
500|$|Æthelwulf's will has not survived, but Alfred's has and it {{provides}} some information about his father's intentions. [...] The kingdom was to be divided between the two oldest surviving sons, with Æthelbald getting Wessex and Æthelberht Kent and the south-east. The survivor of Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred was to inherit their father's bookland– his personal property {{as opposed to the}} royal lands which went with the kingship– and Abels and Yorke argue that this <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> that the survivor was to inherit the throne of Wessex as well. Other historians disagree. Nelson states that the provision regarding the personal property {{had nothing to do with}} the kingship, and Kirby comments: [...] "Such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife. With three older brothers, Alfred's chances of reaching adulthood would, one feels, have been minimal." [...] Æthelwulf's moveable wealth, such as gold and silver, was to be divided between [...] "children, nobles and the needs of the king's soul". For the latter, he left one tenth of his hereditary land to be set aside to feed the poor, and he ordered that three hundred mancuses be sent to Rome each year, one hundred to be spent on lighting the lamps in St Peter's at Easter, one hundred for the lights of St Paul's, and one hundred for the pope.|$|E
50|$|As the {{corporate}} limbo persisted into 1999, the band {{became more and}} more convinced that they wanted out of their major label contract. They opted to make their own full-length album independently and without consent from the label. The band members realized that this action would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> the death of Up There, Down Here, as Universal owned the rights to that recording.|$|R
40|$|Our work on {{the basis}} of {{selected}} regular bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) strengthens the assumption that the scatter of tilt angles of BMRs around Joy`s law is determined by the convective turbulence. Furthermore, regu-lar BMRs grouped by age do not show the phenomenon of toroidal relax-ation, which may <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> the disconnection of-loops {{from the bottom of the}} convection zone...|$|R
5000|$|Where {{the term}} [...] "object {{variable}}" [...] is used above, {{this means a}} variable which {{is an element of}} an object (i.e. an attribute), as opposed to a local variable (exists only within a function or block) or a global variable (nonexistent in LPC [...] - [...] if someone speaks of a global variable in reference to LPC, they <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> an object variable).|$|R
500|$|... "Crovan" [...] <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "white hand" [...] {{although}} {{the reason is}} unknown and his origins are also uncertain. Godred {{may have been a}} son or nephew of Imar mac Arailt, King of Dublin and by extension a descendant of Amlaíb Cuarán. He was a survivor of Harald Hardraade's defeat at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 and fled from there to Man. Little is then heard of him until he succeeded in taking the island from Fingal in 1079, possibly with the help of troops from the Western Isles. The ancestor of many of the succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles he also became King of Dublin, but no contemporary source refers either to him or any of his predecessors as [...] "King of Mann and the Isles" [...] as such. He was eventually ousted from Dublin by Muirchertach Ua Briain and fled to Islay, where he died in the plague of 1095. It is not clear the extent to which Ui Briain dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man, but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid and decisive response from Norway. A high level of political instability is suggested by the battle fought on the Isle of Man at Santwat in 1098. This was internal strife between the men of the north of the island under Jarl Óttar, and the southerners led by a man named MacManus or Macmaras.|$|E
500|$|Amenhotep was deified {{upon his}} death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir el-Medina. His mother, who lived {{at least one year}} longer than he did, was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany. As {{previously}} mentioned, the vast majority of Amenhotep's statuary {{comes in the form of}} a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped, he had three deific manifestations: [...] "Amenhotep of the Town," [...] "Amenhotep Beloved of Amun," [...] and [...] "Amenhotep of the Forecourt," [...] and was known as a god who produced oracles. Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el-Medina, and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod (or be caused to nod) the answer. He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year. During the first month, a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen, which <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> his idol was taken to Deir el-Medina. Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month, and then two more were held in the seventh month. The first was the [...] "spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep," [...] which probably commemorated the day of his death. The second, celebrated for four days at the very end of the month, was the [...] "great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town." [...] Later in Egyptian history, the seventh month was named after this festival, [...] "Phamenoth." [...] Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month, and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month, which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep's accession to the throne.|$|E
2500|$|Mars Barrex is attested by {{a single}} dedicatory {{inscription}} found at Carlisle, England. Barrex or Barrecis <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "Supreme One" [...] (Gaulish barro-, [...] "head").|$|E
5000|$|Names may {{be derived}} from the order of birth, as {{in the cases of}} Akkub and Jacob, whose names <b>{{probably}}</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "posthumous." [...] Jephthah implies [...] "first-born", as does Becher, while names like Manasseh, Nahum, and Nehemiah refer probably to children who have come {{to take the place of}} others that have died in childhood. The idea of relationship is expressed in Ahab, probably originally Ahiab (Jeremiah 29:21).|$|R
50|$|Recipients {{may have}} to {{interpret}} the abbreviated words {{depending on the context}} in which they are being used. For instance, should someone use ttyl, lol they may <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> talk to you later, lots of love as opposed to talk to you later, laugh out loud. In another instance, if someone were to use omg, lol they may perhaps mean oh my god, laugh out loud as opposed to oh my god, lots of love.|$|R
50|$|The Black Stars {{went into}} their next match versus Czech Republic knowing a loss would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> elimination. In a very {{entertaining}} match, Ghana managed a famous 2-0 win despite missing several clear-cut scoring chances {{as well as}} failing to convert a penalty shot. Third game pitted Dujković's team against the United States and they delivered once more, beating the Americans 2-1 and qualifying for the Round of 16 where Brazil awaited.|$|R
2500|$|Mars Albiorix {{appears in}} an {{inscription}} from modern-day Sablet, {{in the province}} of Gallia Narbonensis. Albiorix <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "King of the Land" [...] or [...] "King of the World", with the first element related to the geographical name Albion and Middle Welsh elfydd, [...] "world, land".|$|E
2500|$|The name 'Arnor' <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> [...] "Land of the King", from Sindarin ara- (high, kingly) + (n)dor (land). Arnor is the {{territory}} of Middle-earth associated with the High Kings {{of the line of}} Elendil, the kingship of which was restored at the crowning of Elessar (Aragorn) after the War of the Ring {{at the start of the}} Fourth Age.|$|E
2500|$|Richmont Castle {{was built}} {{near the village}} of East Harptree, Somerset, {{probably}} soon after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The name <b>probably</b> <b>means</b> either [...] "rich mountain" [...] or [...] "strong mountain". The castle was located on a steep spur of ground, over looking the Chew Valley, with two valleys, called coombes, dropping away {{on either side of the}} spur.|$|E
60|$|De Stancy readily agreed. The {{effect upon}} {{him of the}} {{information}} now acquired was to intensify his ardour tenfold, the stimulus being due to a perception that Somerset, {{with a little more}} knowledge, would hold a card which could be played with disastrous effect against himself--his relationship to Dare. Its disclosure to a lady of such Puritan antecedents as Paula's, would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> her immediate severance from himself as an unclean thing.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a big}} {{comprehensive}} scheme, of course; {{one which}} must be carried to its completion in defiance of King Louis. It was never good to incur the wrath of a Bourbon, and, unless {{the nation and the}} parliaments ranged themselves unequivocally on her side, it would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> the sudden ending of her own and her husband's career, the finality of all her dreams. But to this she hardly gave a thought.|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{negotiations}} between the EU and Mercosur countries to conclude {{a free trade agreement}} (FTA) have been overshadowed by the parallel WTO negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). Potentially, this agreement could have considerable impact on European agricultural markets. Aside from the outcome of the WTO talks, any change of doctrine within the EU in the direction of placing increased emphasis on bilateral agreements would <b>probably</b> <b>mean</b> that an EU–Mercosur FTA should be concluded before too long...|$|R
