40|$|Men {{convicted of}} sexual abuse against {{children}} are an important but understudied population. In this study, based upon lifetime police records, of the criminality of convicted <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers,</b> we undertake the first British comparative analysis of the criminality of intra- and extra-familial abusers. In a cohort of 374 convicted male <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers,</b> 50 % had convictions for ‘sex only’ crimes; 26 % for ‘sex and other’ offences; and 24 % for ‘sex, other and violent’ crimes. There were three ‘relationship-to-victim’ subgroups: ‘biological relatives’, consisting of fathers and other biological relatives (18 %); ‘non-biological relatives’ — cohabitees or stepfathers (10 %); and 72 % who were ‘extra-familial’ offenders, having no family relationship to the child. This atypical pattern of abusers indicates a filtering process, in which intra-familial abusers {{are less likely to}} be prosecuted than extra-familial offenders. The main findings were: (i) biological relatives were more often ‘sex only’ offenders, but averaged more sexual offences than the other groups; (ii) non-biological abusers has more ‘other’ criminal and convictions for violence, and were more similar to the extra-familial offenders than biologically related abusers; (iii) extra-familial abusers consisted of more ‘other’ criminal and violent offenders than the non-biological abusers; (iv) non-biological offenders, however, had a pattern of criminality more like the extra-familial group than the other intra-familial abusers. The violent men, often with long histories of both sexual and non-sexual offending, pose particular problems for the criminal justice and child protection services...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the child protection-forensic psychiatric interface could contribute to prevention of child homicide and suicide. Assailant rates in potential 'risk' groups (1986 - 95) and the suicide of assailants and male <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> (1995 - 6) were calculated, based upon an epidemiological analysis of police and official records, from within a population of 2. 4 million people. There were 27 murderers. Of the murders, 81 % were intra-familial. In the group of murderers 55 % were 'mentally ill', 27 % were 'child neglecters' and 18 % were 'violent offenders'. All extra-familial assailants were <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> (CSA). The homicide rate of 'mentally ill mothers' (MIM) was 10 per 100, 000 (pht) p. a. of those estimated to be at risk. The 'violent offenders' rate was 44 pht p. a.; 'neglecting' mothers rate, 83 pht p. a.; and violent 'multicriminal <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> abusers' (MCCSA) rate, 870 pht p. a. Half the 'mentally ill' murderers committed suicide, but none of the violent 'MCCSA' assailants. In the CSA cohort of 374, 3. 2 % of 'sex offences only' (SOO) abusers killed themselves.

This connectivity has also brought changes in crime patterns and fostered {{the development of}} cybercrime. From a criminological perspective, this work aims to explore the role of Per-Olof Wikströms Situational Action Theory in explaining cybercrime by including Syke and Matza’s neutralisation techniques in its formulation. The SAT-RI (SAT- Revised for the Internet) takes into consideration the interaction between cyber-crime propensity (based essentially in moral perceptions), the internet, neutralisation techniques (cognitive scripts used as protection against blame) and self-control. The theory was tested by using a mixed methods design that includes an online survey (N= 709) and case studies (N= 20) stemming from interviews with law enforcement agents. Once the data was analysed, it was demonstrated that individuals with low self-control tend to have higher cybercrime propensity and {{are more prone to}} justify their acts by using adequate neutralisations. In addition, there are differences in the perceptions of cybercriminals by law enforcement agents depending on whether they are fraudsters, <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers,</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> or hackers. The resulting theory can be useful in terms of prevention, as it can help design programmes that focus on the different stages of the cybercrime process (self-control, propensity or neutralisation).

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the lifetime criminality of men {{charged with a}} sexual offence against a child and to identify any heuristic typologies. Method: The police files of a 2 -year cohort of 462 men charged with a sexual offence against a minor (< 17) in two English counties were analyzed; 374 were convicted. The patterns of their convictions produced a typology based upon judicially substantiated parameters. Results: Half the guilty men had prior convictions for non-sexual crimes, including 24 % with convictions for violent offences. Three heuristic groups emerged: ''Sex-Only'' offenders (S. O., n = 186); ''Sex And Other'' offenders (S. A. O., n = 97); and ''Sex and Violent'' offenders (S. V., n = 91), averaging three sex convictions each. However, the S. A. O. and S. V. men had more non-sexual than sex convictions, averaging 5. 1 versus 10. 5, justifying the designation of ''multi-criminal'' <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers.</b> However, the patterns of these men's sexual offending did not differ, except that the S. O. men's victims were significantly more often intra-family, 36 %, 31 %, and 13 %, respectively; indicating {{that the majority of}} these men's victims were extra-familial (71 %). Significantly, 19 % of the convicted men had at least one ''not guilty'' verdict for a sex charge, as opposed to 4 % for non-sexual crimes. Conclusions: While the S. O. group appear to consist of traditional types of fixated and regressed offenders, in men charged with offences, they are atypical of most <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> since their victims are mainly extra-familial. These ''multi-criminal'' men present particular challenges for custodial and therapeutic settings, and the potential dangerousness of these offenders should not be underestimated. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Societies {{appear to}} be subject, every now and then, to periods of moral panic.... [I]ts nature is {{presented}} in a stylized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades are manned by editors, bishops, politicians and other right thinking people; socially accredited experts pronounce their diagnoses and solutions; ways of coping are evolved or (more often) restored to;... sometimes the panic passes over and is forgotten... at other times it has more serious and long-lasting repercussions and might produce {{such as those in}} legal and social policy or even in the way society conceives itself. In the fall of 1984, after a jury acquitted two parents she had accused of sexually molesting their children and before she was forced to drop charges against the twenty-one remaining defendants she had accused of <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> abuse related charges, the chief prosecutor in Jordan, Minnesota said that she was 2 ̆ 2 sick to death of things like the presumption of innocence. After the tragic mass murders at Columbine High School in 1999, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (2 ̆ 2 MADD 2 ̆ 2) issued a press release classifying the 2 ̆ 2 murders as 2 ̆ 7 insignificant 2 ̆ 7 compared to those killed in alcohol-related traffic accidents. What do these two announcements have in common? This Article suggests that each is but one manifestation of the pathology that exists regarding certain crimes and the reaction to them {{on the part of the}} public, the media, legislative bodies, law enforcement authorities, and ultimately members of the judicial system. For a long time, crimes such as these were either not treated with the seriousness they deserve (i. e. drunk driving) or the extent of their prevalence in society was significantly underestimated (i. e. <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> abuse). Fortunately, in ways this Article discusses, the previous undervaluation or under appreciation of these crimes was brought to the attention of different elements of American society, and people were educated about the nature of these crimes and the degree of harm they cause. As a result of this heightened attention, the public and particularly victims 2 ̆ 7 rights groups began to call for more action in preventing and punishing these crimes. Legislatures on both the state and federal levels responded to these calls with new laws designed to accomplish both goals. Prosecutors investigated these crimes with more urgency and charged and prosecuted them more strictly. Judges began to sentence individuals convicted of these offenses more harshly. In other words, each affected group in society took action in an appropriate way to deal with the dangers that <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> and drunk drivers posed. There came a point, however, when reaction turned into over-reaction and remedial measures became excessive. This Article examines some of that over-reaction, seeks to explain why it occurs with certain crimes, fleshes out the lessons to be learned from the overreactions, and offers suggestions on how to avoid recurrences of this type of social pathology. For the most part, this Article uses those crimes related to the serious problems that <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> and drunk drivers pose as illustrations of how crimes become hot crimes and then how such crimes are treated. Section II of this Article discusses the genesis of a hot crime, what factors {{appear to be}} needed for a crime to become hot, and how each factor contributes to the way in which such crimes are ultimately treated. Section III looks at the types of excesses that hot crimes breed. Section IV examines the kind of flaws in society 2 ̆ 7 s responses to hot crimes that breed these excesses, Section V discusses how the concept that has been referred to as moral panic explains the hot crimes phenomenon. Lastly, Section VI explores ways in which society, particularly law enforcement and legal institutions, can respond to serious crimes without the need to react with excessive and arguably unconstitutional measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{advancement of}} new technology, {{specifically in the}} area of internet technology, has led to an increase in concerns surrounding children and young people’s safety when online. The following thesis describes a study of protection and security on the internet from the perspective of children and young people and contributes and expands on the findings of my Masters Dissertation which examined parents’ perceptions of children at risk on the internet. The research focuses on young people’s perspectives about what risks they face and what would keep them safe and is set within literature on <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> <b>abusers</b> and internet grooming. The thesis is based on an online survey which gathered information about the behaviour and opinions of 859 children and young people living in Scotland. Findings were separated into four main topics: children and young people’s behaviour on the internet, children and young people’s perception of strangers both online and offline, children and young people’s opinion of education on internet safety and children and young people’s opinion of the government’s role in relation to their safety online. Respondents’ stated that they wanted to be protected when on the internet (whilst acknowledging their own responsibility when online), either by the government or through those responsible for the content of the internet. They also provided several suggestions on how schools and the government can do more to listen to their voices and improve internet safety education. There were a number of children and young people who reported that they disclosed personal information over the internet (their own and that of their friends and family) and that they were willing to meet people in the real environment whom they had been communicating with online: many respondents’ viewed internet ‘strangers’ as different from ‘strangers’ in the real environment. Vygotsky’s (1978) theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and Wood et al. ’s (1976) development of the concept of scaffolding, which has been developed in an educational rather than criminological context, were identified as offering some promise for explaining the behaviour of both the victims and the offender as other theories of sexual offending (either specific theories or explanations developed from general theories) are incapable of fully providing an explanation that will encompass grooming in general and online grooming in particular. It is argued that if these theories are applied to internet safety education they have the potential to empower children and young people and make grooming tactics and approaches less effective. The findings also indicated that more child and young people-oriented protection measures may be needed. Perceptions of protection and security on the internet were wide ranging but respondents were keen to provide possible solutions and examples of how to improve their safety when online. This would suggest that communicating with children and young people when developing policy, legislation, research and educational materials is the way forward if we wish to improve their safety and eliminate or reduce the dangers they face when using the internet...|$|R

It involves a segment of the local <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> industry that is directly connected to both an international and domestic tourist market. The increase of tourism has brought with it complications in that tourism is being used as a means for sex tourists to initiate contact with children. Aside from <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourists who are paedophiles, there are those who engage in the opportunistic exploitation of children while travelling on business or for other reasons. There are a number of social and economic factors leading to <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism and the effect is that child victims are exposed to immediate harm, irreversible damage and even death. As South Africa's tourism industry expands into one of the country’s top earners of foreign currency, it is unfortunate to note that its <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourist trade is also on the increase. Reports show that sex tours are as easily organised as wine route tours in Cape Town. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is prevalent in South Africa and has become more organised in recent years. A comprehensive response to the problem is essential to ensure that South Africa does not become a “safe haven” for <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourists. Effective laws at home and the extraterritorial application of these laws to prosecute South African nationals for crimes committed abroad are imperative. Significant steps are being taken both nationally and internationally to target <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism.

Chapters 1 and 2 evaluate sexual interest in <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders, exploring the attentional blink theories. Chapter 3 examines RSVP in <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders and offenders with no sexual offence history, showing <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders displaying enhanced attentional blink towards images of children. Chapter 4 examined released <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders who did not show the hypothesised attentional blink effect. Chapter 5 looked into RSVP responses of fathers with children under two, and shows an opposite pattern of response to <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders. Chapter 6 showed that RSVP, using male and female images, elicited heightened attentional blink in a normative sample of females, but not the male sample. Chapter 7 examined the RSVP using erotic images of males and females on heterosexual males and females with no significant effect. Chapter 8 tested {{the reliability and validity of}} the RSVP in a subsample using the procedure on two separate occasions, showing significant improvement from Session 1 to Session 2. This shows practice effect can influence performance on the RSVP. The main discussion evaluates the results in terms of implications for the utility of the RSVP.
