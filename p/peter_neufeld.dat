50|$|Circuit Judge King concurred in {{part and}} in {{judgment}} {{with the majority}} decision. While he agreed that the lower court's decision was incorrect, he also contended that Harvey's claim could properly be brought under § 1983. The judge stated {{that the act of}} providing Harvey access to evidence did not alone necessarily imply the invalidity of Harvey's conviction. King agrees with Harvey's attorney, <b>Peter</b> J. <b>Neufeld,</b> that the evidence could indeed inculpate Harvey and thus that § 1983 was a proper vehicle for bringing the action. However, King determined that since the material had been available to him at trial and since he had not been denied access to the legal system or evidence known to be exculpatory, Harvey did not have a legal claim to discover evidence under Brady v. Maryland. He stated that Harvey's claim was invalid not because he violated procedure, but because he could not prove that a state actor deprived him of a federally protected right.|$|R

50|$|Colman {{also worked}} {{extensively}} {{in the area of}} DNA research, calling for increased standards in its use as a forensic tool.

Colman frequently provided expert testimony in criminal cases on the veracity of DNA fingerprinting and quality control in criminology laboratories. In 1990, Colman and Neufeld summed up this work in an article in Scientific American, which was reprinted in numerous textbooks. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences released their own policy on rigor and oversight in forensic science two years later.|$|E

5000|$|The Canadian Rustic Pony was {{developed}} by Dr. <b>Peter</b> <b>Neufeld</b> of Manitoba, Canada. [...] Breeders developed the breed by crossing Heck horses from the Atlanta Zoo in Atlanta, Georgia with Arabian horse-Welsh pony crosses. On January 23, 1989, the Canadian Rustic Pony Association was formed, incorporated under the new Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act, also known as Bill C-67. Prior to this, since 1978, Canadian rustic ponies had been registered through a registry based in the United States, and as of September 1989, 72 ponies had been US-registered. These ponies were eligible to become double-registered under the Canadian and US registries, and many did so. No ponies were found outside of Manitoba and Saskatchewan as of September 1989, but this was expected to change as more breeders {{became aware of the}} new breed.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, <b>Peter</b> <b>Neufeld</b> and Barry Scheck {{founded the}} Innocence Project to assist convicted prisoners {{who could be}} proven {{innocent}} post-conviction through DNA testing. [...] To date, 343 people in the United States have been exonerated by DNA testing, including 20 who served time on death row. These people served an average of 14 years in prison before exoneration and release. The Innocence Project's full-time staff attorneys and Cardozo Law School clinic students provide direct representation or critical assistance {{in most of these}} cases. The Innocence Project states on its website that groundbreaking use of DNA technology to free innocent people has provided irrefutable proof that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events but instead arise from systemic defects. Now an independent nonprofit organization affiliated with Cardozo Law School, the Innocence Project's mission is to free innocent people who remain incarcerated and to bring substantive reform to the criminal justice system responsible for their unjust imprisonment. They get thousands of letters from wrongly convicted inmates every year.|$|E
5000|$|Alvarez {{was interviewed}} in a 2012 60 Minutes segment [...] "Chicago: The False Confession Capital", {{in which she}} defended police conduct in two cases {{involving}} false confessions which were vacated by the courts which issued certificates of innocence to the defendants. Despite the courts' actions {{and the lack of}} DNA evidence, Alvarez said in the interview, [...] "I don't know whether he committed the crime or not. There are still unanswered questions in both of these cases that I couldn't sit here and tell you today that they're all guilty or they're all innocent." [...] She admits that in one of the rape cases, they did not find any of the boys' DNA on the victim or {{in the basement of the}} house where the crime occurred. In the other case, that of the Dixmoor 5, the DNA found was matched to a convicted rapist. <b>Peter</b> <b>Neufeld,</b> of The Innocence Project says prosecutors rejected the new evidence and suggested necrophilia (having sex with a dead person) as a possible explanation for why a convicted rapist's DNA may have come in contact with the victim, to which Alvarez replied, [...] "It's possible. We have seen cases like that." ...|$|E
50|$|Jennifer Lee Barringer is an {{attorney}} known for defending music producer Phil Spector in his two murder trials and also making a joke of herself on CNN.

Ms. Barringer's other high-profile cases include the “New Jersey Turnpike Shooting Cases” with Barry Scheck, <b>Peter</b> <b>Neufeld,</b> Johnnie Cochran and Linda Kenney-Baden and former New Jersey Nets basketball star Jayson Williams. Most recently, Ms. Barringer worked as both a trial member and consultant with the Casey Anthony defense team and is also a regular commentator and legal analyst on Tru TV, Fox News, HLN, CBS and CNN. Ms. Barringer is often sought after for high-profile murder and rape cases due to her specialty in forensics which she honed while working on the Innocence Project and by participating in numerous cases {{with some of the most}} respected forensic experts in the world, including Dr. Michael Baden, Dr. Henry Lee, Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Werner Spitz, Jim Pex and Stuart James among many others. She is well versed in all areas of criminology, pathology, blood spatter pattern analysis, DNA interpretation and toxicology.
