40|$|A user's {{guide for}} the Air Traffic Complexity Measurement Environment (ACME) {{software}} is presented. The ACME consists of two major components, a complexity analysis tool and user interface. The Complexity Analysis Tool (CAT) analyzes complexity off-line, producing data files which may be examined interactively via the Complexity Data Analysis Tool (CDAT). The Complexity Analysis Tool is composed of three independently executing processes that communicate via PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) and Unix sockets. The Runtime Data Management and Control process (RUNDMC) extracts flight plan and track information from a SAR input file, and sends the information to GARP (Generate Aircraft Routes Process) and CAT (Complexity Analysis Task). GARP in turn generates aircraft trajectories, which are utilized by CAT to calculate sector complexity. CAT writes flight plan, track and complexity data to an output file, which can be examined interactively. The Complexity Data Analysis Tool (CDAT) provides an interactive graphic environment for examining the complexity data produced by the Complexity Analysis Tool (CAT). CDAT can also play back track data extracted from System Analysis Recording (SAR) tapes. The CDAT user interface consists of a <b>primary</b> <b>window,</b> a controls window, and miscellaneous pop-ups. Aircraft track and position data is displayed in the main viewing area of the <b>primary</b> <b>window.</b> The controls window contains miscellaneous control and display items. Complexity data is displayed in pop-up windows. CDAT plays back sector complexity and aircraft track and position data {{as a function of}} time. Controls are provided to start and stop playback, adjust the playback rate, and reposition the display to a specified time...|$|E

We used LEHR/PARA collimators (low-energy high-resolution/parallel) with hexagonal holes. The head radius was set to a constant distance of 24 cm. Two energy windows, primary and scatter, were recorded with the standard clinical settings. The <b>primary</b> <b>window</b> corresponding to the photopeak of 99 mTc and was set to 126.45 – 154.55 keV, and the scatter window was set to 114 – 126 keV.

CT was acquired right after SPECT, with a tube voltage of 120 kV. Slice thickness was 1.25 mm, and pixel spacing was 0.9765 × 0.9765 mm. SPECT reconstruction was performed with manufacturer’s iterative ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm that include attenuation, DEW scatter, and CDR correction.

40|$|If {{you have}} used the {{interactive}} interface for SAS ® you have most likely used the Display Manager. As it ships, the Display Manager is very powerful and yet fairly easy to use with a minimal learning curve for the new user. Because it is functional „right out of the box‟, most users do very little to customize the interface. This is a shame, because the Display Manager contains a great many hidden opportunities to make it even more powerful, even easier to use, and customized for your way of using the interface. The Display Manager builds a variety of windows, screens, and dialogue boxes to facilitate communication between SAS, the Operating System, and the user. For {{each of the five}} <b>primary</b> <b>windows</b> and extending to the dozens of secondary windows there are options that control the content, display, and level of interaction.

40|$|AbstractThe {{adaptive}} Huffman coding with {{a window}} of limited distinct symbols is proposed. The window buffer is used to store a specified number of distinct symbols most recently processed. The total number of symbols within the window may vary, but number of distinct symbols does not exceed a specified value. The adaptive Huffman tree is constructed based on the probability distribution of symbols within the window. Then, {{a variant of the}} proposed method is introduced. The proposed variant uses two windows. A small <b>primary</b> <b>window</b> buffer is used to store the most recently processed symbols. A comparatively large secondary window buffer is used to store more past processed symbols. The two separate Huffman tree are constructed based on the probabilities of symbols within the two windows. A symbol is encoded using first Huffman tree if it is found in the first window. Otherwise, the symbol is encoded using second Huffman tree if it is found in the second window. The first proposed technique comparatively offers better results than its counterpart for most of the file type. The performance of the second proposed technique is also close to the other techniques...|$|E

40|$|The Southern Ocean plays {{a pivotal}} role in climate change by exchanging heat and carbon, and {{provides}} the <b>primary</b> <b>window</b> for the global deep ocean to communicate with the atmosphere. There has been a widespread focus on explaining atmospheric CO 2 changes in terms of changes in wind forcing in the Southern Ocean. Here, we develop a dynamically-motivated metric, the residual upwelling, that measures the primary effect of Southern Ocean dynamics on atmospheric CO 2 on centennial to millennial timescales by determining the communication with the deep ocean. The metric encapsulates the combined, net effect of winds and air–sea buoyancy forcing on both the upper and lower overturning cells, which have been invoked as explaining atmospheric CO 2 changes for the present day and glacial-interglacial changes. The skill of the metric is assessed by employing suites of idealized ocean model experiments, including parameterized and explicitly simulated eddies, with online biogeochemistry and integrated for 10, 000 years to equilibrium. Increased residual upwelling drives elevated atmospheric CO 2 at a rate of typically 1 – 1. 5 parts per million/ 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 s^− 1 by enhancing the communication between the atmosphere and deep ocean. This metric can be used to interpret the longterm effect of Southern Ocean dynamics on the natural carbon cycle and atmospheric CO 2, alongside other metrics, such as involving the proportion of preformed nutrients and the extent of sea ice cover...|$|E
