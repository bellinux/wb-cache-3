Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from the USS Okinawa while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on the USS Vancouver, giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
25|$|Singing, or {{chanting}} {{as it is}} called, is an invariable {{accompaniment to}} working in cotton, {{and many of the}} screw-gangs have an endless collection of songs, rough and uncouth, both in words and melody, but answering well the purposes of making all pull together, and enlivening the heavy toil. The foreman is the chanty-man, who sings the song, the gang only joining in the chorus, which comes in {{at the end of every}} line, and at the end of which again comes the <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> the screw handles...|$|E

25|$|As the pennate {{muscle is}} activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> an angle. In pennate muscles, fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle}} to the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Force output is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the gear ratio of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on external load.|$|E
25|$|In the United States two photographers got {{involved}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in favor of people on the margins of society, Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine. For them the camera was an instrument of accusation against social injustice. In 1890 Riis documented the living conditions of the unemployed and homeless in New York ("How the Other Half Lives"). He was also interested in the fate of immigrants, many of whom lived in extreme poverty in the New York slums. Riis clearly takes sides for the people he photographed and appeals to the social conscience of society. In 1908 the National Child Labor Committee hired Hine, a sociology professor who advocated photography as an educational medium, to document child labor in American industry. In the early 20th century Hine would publish thousands of photographs designed to <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> the nation's heartstrings. Child Labor was widespread in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Hine equally drew attention to the situation of immigrants. The work of Riis and Hine had political influence. Riis' commitment to the people in the Mulberry Bend neighborhood led to its demolition. The building of schools and educational programs can also be attributed to Riis. Hine's work culminated in a law against child labor, the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, which was repealed shortly after the entry of the U.S. into the First World War.|$|E
500|$|Stage 18 was {{undoubtedly}} {{the most difficult}} in the Tour, incorporating three hors cat√©gorie climbs, including the Col du Galibier at the finish; as such, race organisers defined the stage as the race's queen stage. When Andy Schleck, who began the day two minutes and 36 seconds behind Voeckler, surged away from the race's top riders [...] from the finish and quickly {{made it to the}} morning breakaway, it seemed all but certain that he would become the new race leader. While Schleck easily won the stage, Voeckler followed Evans as the Australian made a strenuous <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> the end of the stage to limit his time losses. At the very end, Voeckler lost Evans' wheel and fell to fifth on the day, two minutes and 21 seconds behind Schleck. Visibly so spent that he could not sit upright on his bicycle after crossing the finish line, Voeckler had retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds. He said afterwards that while he had expected to lose the jersey earlier in the Tour, on this day all the team's efforts were put into retaining it. Post-race analyses called Voeckler a [...] "survivor" [...] and [...] "astonishing." ...|$|E

The reviewer called the album to be [...] "a refreshing change with its charming lyrics and teen outlook". [...] "AM to PM" [...] was said to hint at [...] "quite a lot of talent", and was praised for its [...] "slick lyrics, a fast pace, and a phat vibe". The reviewer also praised [...] "When You Look at Me", [...] "Get Away", and [...] "Got to Have You". Carmen Meyer of iafrica.com found the [...] "smooth, groovy and refreshing" [...] album to be filled [...] "with light-hearted and catchy tracks, which can be enjoyed either in a club, your car or even when chilling at home." [...] She commented on the album's tracks, which ranged from [...] "melodic and heart-rending ballads to funky dance beats that are bound to keep you moving".

2500|$|It is {{not known}} exactly how the moai were moved across the island. [...] Earlier {{researchers}} assumed that the process almost certainly required human energy, ropes, and possibly wooden sledges (sleds) and/or rollers, as well as leveled tracks across the island (the Easter Island roads). Another theory suggests that the moai were placed on top of logs and were rolled to their destinations. If that theory is correct it would take 50-150 people to move the moai. [...] The most recent study demonstrates from {{the evidence in the}} archaeological record that the statues were harnessed with ropes from two sides and made to [...] "walk" [...] by tilting them from side to side while pulling forward. They would also use a chant, whilst 'walking' the moai. Coordination and cohesion was essential, so they developed a chant in which the rhythm helped them <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> the precise moment necessary.|$|E

2500|$|As {{will be seen}} in the {{following}} discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. [...] Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to some [...] of drawbar pull for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. [...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, [...] "jerking a lung" [...] could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of automatic train brakes installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.|$|E
2500|$|Lee's new {{position}} represented a significant {{potential threat to}} Grant. By moving south of the river, Lee hoped that Grant would assume that he was retreating, leaving only a token force to prevent a crossing at Ox Ford. If Grant pursued, the pointed wedge of the inverted V would split his army. Lee could leave a force of about 7,000 on the western arm of the V to keep Warren and Wright pinned down, then launch an attack against Hancock on the eastern arm of the V, concentrating his force to achieve local superiority, about 36,000 Confederate to 20,000 Union. Warren and Wright could come to Hancock's support only by crossing over the North Anna twice, a time-consuming exercise. As Lee had achieved at Spotsylvania Court House (and Meade at Gettysburg), interior lines {{could be used as}} a force multiplier; unlike the [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] at Spotsylvania, however, this position had the advantage of a strong anchor at the apex (the bluffs above Ox Ford), dissuading any attack from that direction. Lee confided to a local physician, [...] "If I can get one more <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> , I will defeat him." ...|$|E
2500|$|While top {{stars at}} the studios such as Judy Garland, Betty Grable, and Shirley Temple {{took part in}} bond tours during the war, Williams was asked to take in {{hospital}} tours. At this point, Williams had achieved pin-up status {{because of the number}} of photographs of her in bathing suits. To prepare, Williams and her publicity assistant would listen to Bob Hope and Jack Benny's radio programs, retelling the funniest jokes while at the hospitals. Williams also invited GIs to dance with her on stage and take part in mock screen tests. The men would receive a card telling them their lines, and they would act out the scene in front of the other soldiers. These tests were always romantic scenes and included Williams begging the men , to which they were required to refuse... multiple times. When the men said the final, [...] "No", Williams would <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> her tear-away skirt and sweater leaving nothing but a gold lam√© swimsuit. The scenes would always end with the men giving in and kissing her after that stunt. Her hospital tours continued into the 1950s. A (forged) signed, waterproof portrait of Williams was circulated among men in the United States Navy for a [...] "capture the Esther" [...] competition. This competition continues to this day in the Royal Australian Navy, which holds in its archives an [...] "original" [...] forged signed portrait while maintaining a [...] "capturable" [...] image for use in the fleet.|$|E

2500|$|Michelle Burnham adopts {{the nineteenth}} century {{theories}} that Shakespeare's sonnets contain autobiographical information about him, in order to explore the novel Ulysses. [...] Through her examination into Joyce's use of the poems, the reader can discover the mindset of {{the nineteenth century}} Shakespeare reader. [...] Burnham affirms that critics of the past believed that Shakespeare was caught in a love triangle between a fair boy and dark woman in her article, [...] "'Dark Lady and Fair Man': The Love Triangle in Shakespeare's Sonnet and Ulysses". [...] Stephen Booth reinforces this argument by stating that in line 7 [...] "my saint" [...] "is [...] in the courtly love tradition, in which poets customarily spoke about their beloveds in the manner and language of... worshipers to, or about, saints". [...] Harvey Stanborough claims that Shakespeare's Sonnet 144 discusses not a bisexual relationship between the author and [...] "a man right fair" [...] and [...] "a woman coloured ill", but rather it reveals Shakespeare's internal conflict as an artist. [...] He proposes [...] "that it was actually addressed to a much broader, general audience and is an attempted explanation of his own artistic mind". [...] To him, the two loves in the sonnet embody two passions which <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> Shakespeare's mind in opposing directions: [...] "the speaker is explaining that he has two passions: a passion (desire) for comfort, and a passion (need) for despair". He uses a less edited version of the sonnet to assert that the first line of the poem makes a clear distinction between passions rather than lovers. [...] He uses [...] "Two loves I have, of Comfort and Despaire" [...] to show that the separation of the comma [...] "contend that the two loves he mentions are not people at all, but the two sides--light and dark--of his creative personality".|$|E
2500|$|Hushovd {{was again}} named as a pre-race {{favorite}} for the season's third monument, Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. Farrar and Haussler also rode this race, {{but they have}} not had the track record of successes in it that Hushovd has, considering that the Norwegian finished on the podium in both the 2009 and 2010 editions. The race was run aggressively, with nearly [...] covered, incidentally almost the exact distance to the first cobbled sector, in the first two hours of racing. After a flurry of attacks and counter-attacks on and around the Arenberg Trench, the race's most storied and difficult cobbled sector, 21 riders had opened up a gap of two and a half minutes on the race's main favorites, namely Hushovd and Fabian Cancellara. Garmin-Cerv√©lo had Vansummeren and Rasch in this group. Cancellara tried several times to get clear of the group of favorites, but succeeded only in having Hushovd, 's Alessandro Ballan, and Juan Antonio Flecha of [...] follow his wheel while contributing no work themselves. After a while, Cancellara gave up his efforts, deciding that it was not to his advantage to pull Hushovd, a superior sprinter, {{to the front of the}} race. At the Mons-en-P√©v√®le sector [...] from the finish, Vanmarcke and 's Tomas Vaitkus got clear of the Cancellara group for a time. When they were later brought back, Vanmarcke stayed on the front and did work to help pull the group of favorites nearer to the leaders out front. With [...] remaining, Vansummeren surged clear at the front of the race, and quickly took a time gap. Around that same time, Cancellara put in his most intensive pull. Only Hushovd and Ballan could follow, and the Swiss time trial ace very quickly caught every member of the early breakaway that was still out front, with the exception of Vansummeren. There was simply not enough road left to bring back the Belgian. He entered the Roubaix Velodrome alone and took the biggest win of his career 19 seconds ahead of a rapidly closing Cancellara in second. Hushovd finished eighth, fading slightly towards the finish. Vanmarcke held on for 20th despite taking a strong <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> the front of the favorites group. Only [...] also placed three finishers in the top 20. The win was only the second professional race Vansummeren had ever won, after a stage in the 2007 Tour de Pologne. He proposed marriage to his longtime girlfriend after the race ‚Äì she said yes. Vaughters praised Vansummeren's ride, finding it appropriate with the team's character that a rider who spends almost his entire career in the service of other riders would attain such a prestigious win. He stated that though Cancellara was clearly the strongest rider in the race, Garmin-Cerv√©lo had been the strongest team. He called it his proudest moment as a team boss and said that the result had fulfilled his personal goal of winning one monument race in 2011. Post-race analysis concurred that the result had redeemed the team for their lackluster showings earlier in the spring season.|$|E
