500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to <b>put</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} [...] "C", writing that {{it felt like}} [...] "a frantic attempt to raise a bunch of {{potential}} storylines for season two and an attempt to <b>put</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> place for the season finale". He criticized the show's lack of continuity, {{particularly with regard to}} the Jesse and Rachel storyline. Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack also observed the lack of continuity in the Jesse storyline, calling it [...] "slightly confusing" [...] and [...] "a little half-baked"; continuity errors in his storyline may have been the result of the change in episode broadcast order. He felt that the episode was [...] "a slight let down", noting: [...] "There wasn’t as much tension as I would have hoped going into the finale but there were still plenty of fun moments to enjoy." [...] James Poniewozik of Time attributed part of the episode's problems to it being [...] "an episode that could air easily out of order", explaining: [...] "Glee is a very serial show, after all, but this episode largely consisted of moments that felt dropped in and random, in a way that undermined even the good moments." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2016, a {{week before}} his film Julieta was to be {{released}} in Spain, Pedro and Agustín Almodóvar were listed in the leak of the Panama Papers from the database of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca; their names showing up on the incorporation documents of a company based in the British Virgin Islands between 1991 and 1994. As a result, Pedro cancelled scheduled press, interviews and photocalls he had made for the release of Julieta in Spain. Agustín released a statement in which he declared himself fully responsible, saying that he has always taken charge of financial matters while Pedro has been dedicated to the creative side and hoping that this would not tarnish his brother's reputation. He also stressed that the brothers have always abided by Spanish tax laws. [...] "On the legal front there are no worries", he explained. [...] "It's a reputation problem which I'm responsible for. I'm really sorry that Pedro has had to suffer the consequences. I have taken full responsibility for what has happened, not because I'm his brother or business partner, but because the responsibility is all mine. I hope that time will <b>put</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> its place. We are not under any tax inspection". The week after the release of Julieta, Pedro gave an interview in which he stated that he knew nothing about the shares as financial matters were handled by his brother, Agustín. However, he emphasised that his ignorance was not an excuse and took full responsibility. Agustín later admitted that he believed Julietas box office earnings in Spain suffered as a result, as the film reportedly had the worst opening of an Almodóvar film at the Spanish box office in 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Bonwick and {{his wife}} arrived at Hobart on 10 October 1841. He was a {{successful}} teacher in Hobart for eight years and published {{the first of his}} many school books Geography for the Use of Australian Youth in 1845. He went to Adelaide in 1850, and opened a private school. In 1852 {{made his way to the}} Victorian gold diggings after finding himself in debt. He did not find much gold, but his health benefited. He then went to Melbourne where he published [...] from October 1852 until its final edition in May 1853. [...] In 1852 he also published [...] He then established a successful boarding school at Kew now a suburb of Melbourne. He had already published several school books and pamphlets, when in 1856 he published his Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip, the first of his historical works. About this time he joined the Victorian government service as an inspector of denominational schools, and in 1857 made a tour of inspection through the western district of Victoria. He then made Ballarat his centre and worked there for about four years. During his journeys he suffered from sunstroke and a coaching accident, and became so ill that he had to retire from the service. He was given 18 months' leave of absence, but was unable to continue this work. His head had been injured in the accident. He was never able to ride a horse again, and he was always liable to have an attack of giddiness. He visited England in 1860 and then returned to Melbourne in July 1862 and opened a school in the suburb of St Kilda, which became very prosperous. He paid another visit to England with his wife, leaving the school in the hands of a son and a friend of his. They, however, mismanaged the school, and Bonwick was compelled to return and <b>put</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> order again. He was doing much writing, and in the ensuing years travelled in various parts of Australia, New Zealand and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse {{trying to get rid of}} a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to <b>put</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E
