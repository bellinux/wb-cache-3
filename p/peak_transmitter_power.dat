5000|$|A major {{advantage}} {{of the system is}} that it requires much less power to operate effectively. In a conventional radar, the radio signal has to travel to the target and back again. As each leg of the journey is subject to the inverse square law, the resulting radar equation contains a fourth-power dependence. In contrast, a forward-scatter radar signal always travels about the same total distance, from the transmitter to the receiver, modified only by the altitude of the target. This means it is dependent on a square of range, and thus delivers considerably more energy onto the receiver as the range increases. Also, unlike a conventional [...] "monostatic" [...] radar, the transmitter did not have to turn off to allow the receiver to listen for the signal. Since the total amount of energy received at the receiver is a function of both the peak power and the length of the pulse, using a continual signal means the same amount of energy will be deposited with dramatically lower <b>peak</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>power.</b> As a result, Lewis' system would require smaller sites and much less power than conventional radars like those in Pinetree.|$|E

This large peak power should allow a much greater number of wind determination during a fixed period of time than other meteor radar stations. The essential features of the range algorithm, two velocity algorithms, and the interferometer phase difference algorithm in use are described.

40|$|Located in {{a narrow}} canyon 15 km west of Boulder, Colorado, the Sunset pulsed Doppler radar was the first radar {{designed}} and constructed specifically as a VHF ST radar. The antenna system is a phased array of coaxial-colinear dopoles with computer-controlled phase shifters for each line of dipoles. It operates at a frequency of 40. 475 MHz and a wavelength of 7. 41 M. <b>Peak</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> is 100 kW. Aperture efficiency is 0. 58 and resistive loss is 0. 30 for its 3600 sq m area. The practical steering rate is 1 record/minute/position to any arbitrary antenna beam position.

40|$|The {{positive}} intrinsic negative (PIN) diode switch {{which is}} designed to protect the receiver from burnout or damage on transmission and channel the echo signal to the receiver on reception is outlined. The receiver must be protected firmly. A schematic diagram of a transformer rectifier (TR-ATR) switch for the Urbana Radar is shown. The T/R switch consists of a half wavelength coaxial cavity with tuning condenser and PIN diodes. Two UM 4300 PIN diodes were mounted between the inner and outer conductor. The dc biasing voltage required for the PIN diodes is supplied by a control circuit. On transmission, the PIN diodes are forward biased to about 0. 5 amperes. On reception, about 10 volts reverse voltage is applied to the diodes, which produces an initial reverse current to speed the recovery time. The T/R switch characteristics are estimated and the result of testing at different <b>peak</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>powers</b> from 410 kW to 1500 kW is shown...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} high-efficiency {{transmitter}} based on asymmetric multilevel outphasing (AMO). AMO transmitters improve their efficiency over LINC (linear amplification using nonlinear components) transmitters by switching the output envelopes {{of the power}} amplifiers among a discrete set of levels. This minimizes the occurrence of large outphasing angles, reducing the energy lost in the power combiner. We demonstrate this concept with a 2. 5 -GHz, 20 -dBm <b>peak</b> output <b>power</b> <b>transmitter</b> using 2 -level AMO designed in a 65 -nm CMOS process. To the authors' knowledge, this IC is the first integrated implementation of the AMO concept. At peak output power, the measured power-added efficiency is 27. 8 %. For a 16 -QAM signal with 6. 1 dB peak-to-average power ratio, the AMO prototype improves the average efficiency from 4. 7 % to 10. 0 % compared to the standard LINC system...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} transferring data with a fixed level of reliabilityover a discrete time channel whose characteristics vary with time, with a constraint on the average delay suffered by the data and a constraint on <b>peak</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>power.</b> We assume that the channel state is known to the transmitter {{at the beginning of}} each slot, and seek transmission policies that minimize the average power expended by the transmitter. Using a dynamic programming formulation coupled with a duality argument, we find that good transmission policies will in general take action in accordance with howmuch data is queued at the transmitter, as well as in accordance with the channel state. In particular, if the backlog is su#ciently large the transmitter should use the channel even if it is in a "bad" state, and if the backlog is sufficiently small the transmitter should only use the channel when it is in a "good" state. However, we find that the time scale of the variations in the channel relative the maximum tolerable average delay is a crucial factor influencing the qualitative features of the optimal transmission policy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we aim to adopt a {{propagation}} model for a less dense urban area in Lagos state by examining one of the popular empirical path loss models for mobile communication. Lee’s model was compared with measured path loss obtain from the field measurement at GSM frequency of 900 MHz. TEMS Investigation tool {{was used for the}} drive test. The measurements of the received signal strength were collected through drive test with the aid of an Ericson test mobile system (TEMS). This was conducted around six base station of a mobile communication network at 900 MHZ frequency band. The TEMS gives the received signal level at a spherical distance and the height of the mobile station is about 1. 5 m while the base station consists of heights of 30 m and 32 m. The width of the road is about 20 m. The <b>peak</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> is approximately 47 dBm for all base station. Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application was used to open log files which has been exported from TEMS and saved as dot txt. We accomplish the investigation in variation in path loss between the measured (values gotten from field) and modeled values through MATLAB graph which was plotted. The average value was calculated between measured path loss values and the modeled values on basis of lee’s model for a less dense urban area. It was found out from the MATLAB analysis that site 3107 - 4877 was the closest with an average measured and model path loss of 124. 9 dBm and 122. 4 dBm respectively. Overall, this paper concludes that the path loss modeling and investigation over a less dense terrain, justifies that the Lee’s model has a best fit with experimentally measured data...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design of the RF front end for use on the NeXtRAD radar system. The system is intended for research purposes to investigate potential target detection benefits to be derived from a multistatic, dual-band (X- and L-band), polarimetric radar architecture, particularly within dense clutter environments such as the maritime environment. By examining the high-level system requirements and objectives, requirement specifications for the RF front end were derived and a suitable architecture, making use of commercial off-the-shelf components, proposed. This architecture was modified in order to meet cost constraints - subsequently offering reduced levels of functionality but suitable for an initial build. Using this modified RF front end architecture, design verification and system analysis was conducted, both analytically and with the aid of SystemVue, in order to predict both the front end and overall radar detection performance. Once the front end design was found to be satisfactory, it was built and tested in a laboratory environment. Test results revealed a general improvement in performance when compared with the design predictions, yielding <b>peak</b> <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> levels in excess of 61 dBm at L-band, and 54 dBm at X-band. Some non-conformances were also identified, but these were as a result of component problems and not system design. Since the front end could not yet be integrated into the radar, performance modelling was repeated using the final lab test results. This indicated a negligible improvement in receiver single-pulse signal-to-noise ratio, but confirmed that the system performed as predicted. Based on the lab test results, it was concluded that the 'as-built' front end design closely matched the design goals and would be suitable for eventual integration into the first revision of the NeXtRAD system. It was, however, recommended that a concerted effort be made to secure funding to implement the original front end architecture in order to achieve the full system functionality originally desired...|$|E
