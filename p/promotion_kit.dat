The mix used for the single is disputed, as the Band had second thoughts about the work of initial engineer Todd Rundgren, and sent the tapes to be remixed by British engineer Glyn Johns. Most likely it was the Johns mixes used for both the album and the single.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Little {{is known}} about the content and quality of brief {{intervention}} kits specifically targeting SNAP risk factors (smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol misuse or physical inactivity) among Indigenous Australians. This paper reviews the type and quality of these kits. Methods: Brief intervention kits were primarily identified by contacting 74 health-related organisations in Australia between 1 February 2007 and 4 March 2007. Results: Ten brief intervention kits met inclusion criteria: four targeted smoking; three targeted alcohol; one targeted alcohol, smoking and other drugs; one targeted alcohol, other drugs and mental health; and one targeted all SNAP risk factors. Brief intervention kits were reviewed using criteria developed from clinical guidelines for SNAP risk factors and guidelines for evaluating health <b>promotion</b> resources. Three <b>kits</b> met all review criteria. Five kits were consistent with evidence-based guidelines, but lacked a training package, patient education materials and/or behavioural change strategies. All kits used images and language identifiable with Indigenous Australia, however, their cultural appropriateness for Indigenous Australians remains unclear. Conclusions and implications: The specific content of the missing components should be guided by the best-available evidence, such as established mechanisms for health care provider feedback to patients as a behaviour change strategy, as well as the needs and preferences of health care providers and patients...|$|R
