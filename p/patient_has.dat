5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, the <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were {{more prone to}} apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E

The rates of invasive candidiasis was 0 % in patients with score = 2 or 3, 17.6 % in patients with score = 4, and 50 % in patients with score = 5 (p < 0.0001).|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) tells John Doggett (Robert Patrick) that Reyes is braindead, a {{fact that}} Doggett refuses to believe. Preijers informs Doggett and Scully that, since Reyes was an organ donor, {{in a few days}} her life-support will be pulled and the {{hospital}} will harvest her remains. In the floating hospital, Reyes sees a woman (Tracey Ellis), standing in the hallway, whom Monica follows, but then the woman disappears. At that moment, Barreiro begins screaming and is engulfed in blue electricity before disappearing. In the real world, it is revealed that Barreiro, a fellow comatose <b>patient,</b> <b>has</b> had his life support removed by Preijers. Nearby stands the mystery woman that Reyes encountered: Audrey Pauley.|$|E

As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy (Lee Arenberg), and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job (since he is actually Sleepy). Emma and the others discover that John Doe went out into the woods.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|Acute life {{threatening}} presentations of thyroid disease are uncommon. The {{aim of this}} study was to review our experience of emergency thyroid surgery with regard to the incidence, management and outcome to this approach. Methods: Forty patients who underwent emergency thyroid surgery from December 1998 to December 2007 were prospectively accrued in this study. There were 30 female and 10 male patients. The mean age was 63. 8 years (range, 33 – 83 years). All <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> total thyroidectomy, except one <b>patient</b> who only <b>had</b> a right hemithyroidectomy for a dominant right multinodular goiter. Eight of the <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> been intubated before referring to our centre. Results: The mean weight of specimen was 219 g (range, 32 – 800 g). A histopathology report confirmed 16 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> multinodular goiters, eight <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> papillary thyroid carcinomas, seven <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> anaplastic cancers, four <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> follicular thyroid carcinomas, two <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> thyroid lymphoma, one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> medullary carcinoma, one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> sarcoma and one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> thyroid abscess. A total of 28 patients were discharged well postoperatively. Conclusion: Acute {{life threatening}} presentations of thyroid disease are uncommon. However, early recognition of these problems is crucial and may life saving. Emergency thyroidectomy is important to release the critically obstructed airways. Nonetheless it is associated with higher risk of surgery and complication rate then any elective thyroid surgery...|$|R
