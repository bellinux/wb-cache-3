5|$|The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), {{named after}} the Russian {{explorer}} Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It {{is also known as}} the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian <b>people</b> <b>know</b> it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people call it a kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia. There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that <b>people</b> <b>know</b> immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E

25|$|Empiricists {{argue all}} {{knowledge}} come from our senses but if senses are only relevant to our proximal world, how do <b>people</b> <b>know</b> the distal world? They argue {{it is through}} learning and that prior experience {{plays a crucial role}} in shaping our perceptual world. Association is a key function which here refers to linking one sensory experience to another.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions {{of how to}} fold a Froebel star {{date back}} to at least the 19th century. In Germany the name Fröbelstern has been the common name for this paper {{decoration}} since the 1960s. It is used as ornament on Christmas trees and wreaths, and to make garlands and mobiles. Froebel stars are very common in Germany, although few <b>people</b> <b>know</b> how to make them.|$|E
25|$|Buanne {{approached}} several producers {{with the}} idea of recording a collection of romantic Italian songs with an orchestra, which was his real ambition, forged by 5 years of shaping and developing his ideas as an independent artist. The objective behind recording that particular genre was, on one hand, to let <b>people</b> <b>know</b> that “Italian music is not just opera or classical”, and on the other hand, to honor his father.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{consciousness}} {{can refer to}} voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behaviour involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes {{take place in the}} cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviours are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of <b>people</b> <b>know</b> how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that <b>people</b> <b>know</b> more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E

25|$|Graph {{theory is}} also {{widely used in}} {{sociology}} as a way, for example, to measure actors' prestige or to explore rumor spreading, notably {{through the use of}} social network analysis software. Under the umbrella of social networks are many different types of graphs. Acquaintanceship and friendship graphs describe whether <b>people</b> <b>know</b> each other. Influence graphs model whether certain people can influence the behavior of others. Finally, collaboration graphs model whether two people work together in a particular way, such as acting in a movie together.|$|E
25|$|Other towns {{along the}} coast {{suffered}} similar fates as Choloma. In Armenta, roughly 400 families disappeared after a large landslide buried the town. However, the town is hardly known by {{people in the country}} and reports from the area were scarce. Another coastal town, Omoa (population of 2,500 to 3,000) was completely destroyed overnight on September19. All of the residents were assumed to have perished; however, like Armenta, few <b>people</b> <b>know</b> of the town and estimates of the fatalities in it ranged from 30 to 3,000.|$|E

Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.|$|E
