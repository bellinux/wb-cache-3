40|$|For a rapid {{preparation}} of solutions intended for analysis by {{inductively coupled plasma}} emission spectrometry or atomic absorption spectrometry, an automatic device called Plasmasol was developed. This apparatus used the property of nonwettability of glassy C to fuse the sample in an appropriate flux. The sample-flux mixture is placed in a composite crucible, then heated at high temperature, swirled until full dissolution is achieved, and then poured into a water-filled beaker. After acid addition, dissolution of the melt, and filling to the mark, the solution is ready for analysis. The analytical results obtained, either for oxide samples or for <b>prereduced</b> <b>iron</b> ores show that the solutions prepared with this device are undistinguished from those obtained by manual dissolutions done by acid digestion or by high temperature fusion. Preparation reproducibility and analytical tests illustrate the performance of Plasmasol...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} method, {{based on}} measuring the chemical reaction rate in solid phase, is, therefore, limited to such systems where reaction between nanocrystalline materials and a gas phase occurs. Additionally, {{assumptions of the}} model of reaction between nanocrystalline materials and a gas phase, where the surface chemical reaction rate is the rate limiting step, are used. As an {{example of such a}} reaction, nitriding (with ammonia) of the <b>prereduced</b> industrial <b>iron</b> catalysts for ammonia synthesis of different average crystallite sizes was used. To measure the reaction rate, the differential reactor equipped with systems for thermogravimetric measurements and analysis of the chemical composition of the gas phase was used. The crystallites mass and size distributions for the analyzed samples of catalyst were determined...|$|R
