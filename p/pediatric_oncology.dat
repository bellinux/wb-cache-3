5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major <b>pediatric</b> <b>oncology</b> cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E

500|$|The Sue storyline {{garnered}} many unfavorable reviews.

[...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown found the use of seriously ill children [...] "borderline offensive", and called Sue's suicide attempt [...] "in totally bad taste". Miriam Krule of NPR felt that Glee treated suicide too lightly, and in doing so sent a mixed message to its youth audience. Poniewozik wrote that Sue has become [...] "a burden on the show", and described her as [...] "a breakout character who's broken out of the constraints of recognizable character."
