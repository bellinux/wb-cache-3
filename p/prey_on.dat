5|$|Predator {{detection}} by {{the males}} becomes particularly important {{during the period}} when the infants are born. Raptors spend significantly more time near the squirrel monkey troops during this period, and <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> {{a significant number of}} the newborn infants. Other animals that <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> Central American squirrel monkey infants include toucans, tayras, opossums, coatis, snakes, and even spider monkeys.|$|E
5|$|Several {{birds and}} other predatory organisms <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> the black-headed sugar ant. Birds {{such as the}} black-faced woodswallow, rufous treecreeper, noisy miner, jacky winter and {{southern}} scrub robin <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> this species, {{as indicated by the}} fact that workers body parts have been found in the birds' stomach contents. Other predators of the black-headed sugar ant include the rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{has a few}} natural predators. Humans, mongooses, snake eagles, and genets {{commonly}} <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> this species of mamba. Hornbills and other snakes tend to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> juvenile green mambas.|$|E
50|$|When Barbary stags and gazelles became {{scarce in}} the Atlas Mountains, lions <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> herds of {{livestock}} that were rather carefully tended. They also <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> wild boar and red deer.|$|R

5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> elk. Coyote packs mostly <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E
5|$|Ants and {{termites}} may {{compete with}} each other for nesting space. In particular, ants that <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> termites usually {{have a negative impact on}} arboreal nesting species.|$|E
5|$|Ants <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> P. fimbriata while P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk ants, {{regarding}} them as poisonous or very unpleasant. P. fimbriata is also preyed upon by birds, frogs, and mantises.|$|E

5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} mainly <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they also}} <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian Monk Seal.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|Mud dauber wasps, which {{capture and}} paralyze spiders {{as a source}} of food for their larvae, have been shown to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> both male and female Z. sexpunctatus spiders.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E
5|$|The Old World flycatchers are a {{large family}} of small {{passerine}} birds. These are mainly small arboreal insectivores, many of which, as the name implies, take their <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> the wing.|$|E

50|$|They are {{vulnerable}} at exposed waterholes or in plantations {{where they are}} <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> by lanner falcons and black sparrowhawks respectively. In addition they are <b>preyed</b> <b>on</b> by reptiles, wild cats, jackals, genets, herons, storks, eagles and barn owls. Nests {{are vulnerable}} to birds, snakes and locally, grey squirrel.|$|R
5|$|Adult males vigorously defend territories near water; {{these areas}} provide {{suitable}} habitat for the larvae to develop, and for females to lay their eggs. Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites.|$|E
5|$|Andean {{cocks-of-the-rock}} face {{slightly larger}} predators than smaller songbirds. Predators {{are attracted to}} leks by the conspicuous behavior of the displaying males. The animals reported to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> adult cocks-of-the-rock including hawk-eagles, hawks, forest-falcons, jaguar, mountain lion, ocelot and the boa constrictor.|$|E
5|$|Flies in the Old World genus Bengalia (Calliphoridae) <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> ants and are kleptoparasites, {{snatching}} prey or brood {{from the}} mandibles of adult ants. Wingless and legless females of the Malaysian phorid fly (Vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea) {{live in the}} nests of ants of the genus Aenictus and are cared for by the ants.|$|E

5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|In the Philippines, P. labiata {{does not}} <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> ants, but is preyed {{on by the}} ants Oecophylla smaragdina and Odontomachus sp. (species uncertain), and a solitary Odontomachus has been seen attacking a P. labiata. In a test the ant Diacamma vagans usually killed single-handed a P. labiata.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends much}} of its time {{underwater}} in order to hunt, but returns to land to digest, rest, and reproduce. It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to <b>prey</b> <b>on</b> eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E
