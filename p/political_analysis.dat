40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study is to determine if <b>political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is of value for the political decision-maker and also how political risk can be identified and factored into political decision-making. Electricity supply in South Africa was used to test the assumptions and findings related to political risk and decision-making. <b>Political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> was also not used in the traditional way to determine economic, investment or business risk, but rather to determine if the methods underlying <b>political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> are of any value to political decision-makers in deciding policy and policy-actions. The value of this study lies in determining a systematic and representative body of information and practice on <b>political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> to serve as tool and guideline for political decision-making. Political risk is used in the context of political decision-making, based on informed decision-making with a sensitivity towards forecasting, anticipation and prioritising of decisions. Different approaches to political risk, focussing on effective systems functioning, early warning and traditional <b>political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> were selected. From this a framework for the analysis of policy decisions and actions related to electricity supply in South Africa was developed. The analysis determined that the negative consequences of flawed decisions can be prevented, or can at least be limited if informed decisions are taken, based on an understanding of possible future outcomes and the implications thereof. The study concludes that the analytical framework based on <b>political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is a valuable tool to assist political decision-makers. The flexible analytical framework developed in this study provides evidence of the value and use of <b>political</b> risk <b>analysis</b> as a tool to assist political decision-makers, that will also have value in policy relevant areas such as the provision of water, youth unemployment, development and education in South Africa.

25|$|Advocates of nonviolent action believe {{cooperation}} and consent are {{the roots of}} civil or political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens. On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and <b>political</b> <b>analysis.</b> Religious or ethically based nonviolence is {{sometimes referred to as}} principled, philosophical, or ethical nonviolence, while nonviolence based on <b>political</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is often referred to as}} tactical, strategic, or pragmatic nonviolent action.

25|$|Initially, McKinney kept a {{low profile}} upon her return to Congress. However, on July 22, 2005, {{the first anniversary of}} the release of the 9/11 Commission Report, McKinney held a {{briefing}} on Capitol Hill to address alleged outstanding issues regarding the 2001 attacks on the US. The day-long briefing featured family members of victims, scholars, former intelligence officers and others who critiqued the 9/11 Commission account of 9/11 and its recommendations. The four morning panels addressed flaws, omissions, and a lack of historical and <b>political</b> <b>analysis</b> in the commission's report. Three afternoon panels critiqued the commission's recommendations in the areas of foreign and domestic policy and intelligence reform. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial maintained that the purpose of the event was to discuss whether or not the Bush administration was involved in the 9/11 attacks, expressing surprise that McKinney was once again taking on the issue that was widely believed to have cost her House seat. The Journal-Constitution declined to publish McKinney's reply. The 9/11 Commission has sealed all the notes and transcripts of some 2,000 interviews, all the forensic evidence, and both classified and non-classified documents used in compiling its final report until January 2, 2009. McKinney's interest in 9/11 relates specifically to what she expresses as her opposition to excessive government secrecy, which she has challenged with numerous pieces of legislation.|$|E
25|$|José Sócrates {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of JSD (the youth branch of PSD – Portuguese Social Democratic Party) before {{changing}} his political affiliation and applying for membership in the PS – Portuguese Socialist Party. He has been a member of the Socialist Party since 1981. José Sócrates served as a technical engineer for the Covilhã City Council, and has been elected a member of the Portuguese Parliament since 1987, representing the Castelo Branco electoral district. While serving as the chairperson of the Castelo Branco Federation of the Socialist Party (1983–1996), he was elected to the Party's National Secretariat in 1991. José Sócrates was ousted by the Board of the Guarda Municipality in 1990 and 1991, after being warned several times because of poor quality of construction projects and lack of monitoring of the construction works. Sócrates was threatened with disciplinary action for wrongdoings in the technical direction of particular works of whose projects he was the author, but despite being ousted from this capacity, he was never penalized. In addition, as a Member of the Parliament, Sócrates was not allowed by law to work as a technical engineer between 1987 and 1991. From 1989 to 1996, he served as a member of the Covilhã Municipal Assembly. He served as spokesperson on environmental affairs for the Socialist Party from 1991 to 1995. In 1995, he entered government as secretary of state for Environment in the first government of António Guterres. Two years later, Sócrates became Minister for Youth and Sports and {{was one of the}} organizers of the EURO 2004 cup in Portugal. He became Minister for Environment in Guterres' second government in 1999. Following the elections of 2002 (won by José Manuel Durão Barroso), Sócrates became a member of the opposition in the Portuguese Parliament. Meanwhile, he also had a program of <b>political</b> <b>analysis,</b> hosted jointly with Pedro Santana Lopes on RTP. After the resignation of Ferro Rodrigues as party leader in 2004, he won a bid for the post of secretary-general against Manuel Alegre and João Soares, winning the vote of nearly 80% of party members on 24 September 2004. After the victory of his party in the 2005 Portuguese election, Sócrates was called on 24 February by president Jorge Sampaio to form a new government – the 17th Constitutional Government (after 1976). After the Portuguese legislative election of 2009, held on 27 September 2009, José Sócrates was elected for a second term as Prime Minister of Portugal. He was also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State as the Prime-Minister.|$|E
