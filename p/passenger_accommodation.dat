5|$|Antony Gibbs & Sons {{may have}} {{intended}} to employ Great Britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger {{service to the}} Australian gold fields following the discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851, but she found long-term employment on this route. For her new role she was given a third refit. Her <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E
5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume {{to offset the}} low profit margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery, tachometer, or centre stand. <b>Passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> was an optional extra, as was a spare wheel. Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E

25|$|A sister-ship LZ 121 Nordstern, {{similar to}} the {{lengthened}} Bodensee but with modified <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation,</b> was completed in 1920.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} units contained only <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation,</b> {{and formed}} {{the bulk of}} the fleet. They were unusual in that all four traction motors were mounted on one non-driving motor coach. Units consisted of two driving trailers, sandwiching the non-driving motor coach and an intermediate trailer.|$|E
25|$|The Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was a Dutch {{ocean liner}} built in 1925. An onboard fire {{destroyed}} her <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{before she was}} completed. In 1932, another fire damaged her so severely that she was sold for scrapping, only to catch fire again before she was scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Sirius {{was divided}} into three {{passenger}} classes for 70 passengers, with 24 First Class cabins, 22 cabins in the Second Class and 24 in the Third Class section of the ship. The <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> was located at the main deck, while the cargo holds were situated afore and abaft of the engine room.|$|E
50|$|In August 1959 {{the vessel}} was {{converted}} into a container ship. The <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodations</b> were removed and net tonnage increased. Hawaiian Citizen thus re-entered service in April 1960 as the first all-containerized vessel operating from the West Coast.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz Vito is a {{light van}} {{produced}} by Mercedes-Benz. It is available as a standard panel van for cargo (called Vito), or with <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodations</b> substituted for part {{or all of the}} load area (called V-Class or Viano).|$|R

25|$|The bilevel car (North American English) or {{double-decker}} train (British English) {{is a type}} of {{rail car}} that has two levels of <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation,</b> as opposed to one, increasing passenger capacity (in example cases of up to 57% per car). In some countries such vehicles are commonly referred to as dostos, derived from the German Doppelstockwagen.|$|E
25|$|Officers {{from the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{were able to}} reach the boat deck, but the impact caused {{extensive}} damage below decks, where collapsed overheads and wrecked ladders injured or trapped {{many of the men}} in one of the converted holds. One survivor states that officers got away in boats from Anselms stern without waiting to help their men.|$|E
25|$|The Larne-Stranraer steamer service {{continued}} to prosper. A new steamer, the Princess Maud, was delivered in May 1904. She {{was the first}} turbine steamer to operate {{on any of the}} cross-channel services on the Irish Sea. A further steamer arrived in 1912. The Princess Victoria was broadly similar to the Maud but with more powerful engines and improved <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation.</b>|$|E

25|$|SS (steamship) Talune {{was built}} by Ramage & Ferguson, of Leith, Scotland, for the Tasmanian Steam Navigation Company of Hobart, Tasmania, {{entering}} service with the company in 1890. It was of 2,087 tons, about 230 feet long, coal fired, and powered by a triple-expansion steam engine. It had <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> for up to 175 people and a crew of around 56.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, Hamburg Süd {{believed}} {{there would be}} a lucrative business in carrying German immigrants to South America and the first two ships were built for that purpose, <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> was single-class, with space for 1150 in cabins and 1350 in dormitories. In the event, the immigrant trade never materialized and the two ships were re-purposed as cruise ships, operating in Northern European waters, the Mediterranean and around South America.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} extra engines {{and the very}} {{different}} crew compartment, together with the removal of <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation,</b> the AB-20 and DB-70 had much in common: the thick centre section and high-mounted outer wings, twin fuselages carrying a long horizontal stabilizer, and twin fins and rudders. Both aircraft had conventional undercarriages with pairs of mainwheels widely separated on V-struts attached to the lower longerons of the centre section.|$|E

25|$|The {{new ships}} {{reflected}} the economics and travel {{patterns of the}} post-war world—they were not built exclusively as passenger liners, but also included cargo-carrying facilities. Their <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> were divided into just two classes, first and tourist, with the tourist class occupying {{the majority of the}} ship. The outer dimensions of the ships were defined by the Saint Lawrence Seaway, as they {{had to be able to}} navigate from the Atlantic Ocean up to Montreal.|$|E
25|$|Passenger sailings to Douglas are not {{currently}} {{on a regular}} timetable. Ferries were operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company from 1876 to 1961, and again periodically from 1971. However, {{in recent years the}} service has been restricted to once or twice per year. From 2004, Stena Line provided some <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodation</b> on its thrice daily service to Larne in Northern Ireland. However, Stena Line withdrew the service at the end of 2010.|$|E
25|$|In November 1939 Anselm was in Liverpool and {{was due to}} sail to Pará via for Lisbon. Because of war {{conditions}} she was {{to leave}} with Convoy OB 32G, which would then join Convoy OB 6.

25|$|While {{the outward}} {{appearance}} of the Collins Line ships {{has been described as}} imposing rather than elegant, the <b>passenger</b> <b>accommodations</b> provided a marked contrast.
