40|$|The {{availability}} of genome sequences from 16 anopheline species provides unprecedented opportunities {{to study the}} evolution of reproductive traits relevant for malaria transmission. In Anopheles gambiae, a likely candidate for sexual selection is male 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E). Sexual transfer of this steroid hormone {{as part of a}} mating plug dramatically changes female physiological processes intimately tied to vectorial capacity. By combining phenotypic studies with ancestral state reconstructions and phylogenetic analyses, we show that mating <b>plug</b> <b>transfer</b> and male 20 E synthesis are both derived characters that have coevolved in anophelines, driving the adaptation of a female 20 E-interacting protein that promotes oogenesis via mechanisms also favoring Plasmodium survival.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteochondral lesions are {{frequently}} seen in athletes after ankle injuries. At this time, osteochondral autologous transplantation (OATS, mosaicplasty) {{is the only}} surgical treatment that replaces the entire osteochondral unit in symptomatic lesions. PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical and radiological midterm to long-term outcome of ankles treated with knee-to-ankle mosaicplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Clinical evaluation consisted of patient satisfaction, pain evaluation (visual analog scale [VAS]), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle score, sports activity score, range of motion, the radiological evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) analysis of both the ankle and the knee joint. RESULTS: Twelve of 21 patients (mean age, 43 years; male, 8; female, 4) were available for latest follow-up (mean, 72 months). At follow-up, patients reported a satisfaction rate of good to excellent in 92 % (n = 11) and poor in 8 % (n = 1). The average VAS pain score was 3. 9 (preoperative, 5. 9; P =. 02), AOFAS ankle score significantly increased from 45. 9 to 80. 2 points (P >. 0001), sports activity score remained significantly decreased with 1. 25 (preinjury level, 2. 3; P =. 035), and ankle dorsiflexion was significantly reduced (P =. 003). Knee pain was reported in 6 patients (50 %). Radiologically, recurrent lesions were found in 10 of 10 cases (100 %) and some degree of cartilage degeneration and discontinuity of the subchondral bone plate in 100 %.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] some species, sperm is stored within the female reproductive tract for months to years, and yet remains viable to fertilize eggs and produce offspring. Female red-sided garter snakes store sperm for over seven months of winter dormancy. In previous work we demonstrated that these stored sperm account for an average of 25 % paternity of a litter when the female mates with a male at spring emergence. Here we tested whether last-male sperm precedence was prevalent when a female mates with two males during the spring. On average, paternity was shared equally among the first (P₁ proportion of paternity of the first male to mate) and second male (P₂) to mate in the spring, and stored sperm (P[subscript ss]), but the variance in paternity was high. Thus, last male sperm precedence may diminish when a female has more than two mates. Male size did not affect paternity, but as the interval between matings increased, P₁ increased at the expense of P[subscript ss]. Interestingly, as the second spring male’s copulation duration increased, P₁ also increased at the expense of P₂. This result suggests that female influence over sperm and/or copulatory <b>plug</b> <b>transfer</b> during matings may also affect which male fathers her offspring in response to coercive matings as we assisted females to mate for their second mating. Finally, all females were spring “virgins”, consequently sperm stored from autumn matings (and/or previous spring matings) remain competitive even when faced with two rivals in sperm competition and is likely the driver of the evolution of sperm longevity...|$|E

40|$|During FY 2001, {{tank farm}} {{operations}} at Hanford and the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{continued to be}} negatively impacted by the unintended formation of solids. At Hanford, the primary solids formation problem involves a series of plugged pipes and pumps during the saltwell pumping activities of the interim stabilization program. For example, transfers of tank S- 102 waste were suspended due to a plugged pipeline or a mechanical problem with the transfer pump. The replacement pump then failed within 2 weeks. In contrast, since full-scale waste remediation activities such as vitrification were initiated, the SRS has encountered {{a wider range of}} problems due to unwanted solids. The 2 H evaporator system was shut down because of the formation of aluminosilicate deposits with enriched uranium in the evaporator pot. While high concentrations of aluminum are expected in the tank waste due to previous canyon operations, the primary source of silicon is the recycle stream from the vitrifier. While solids formation can be expected when waste streams are combined, the formation of the aluminosilicate deposits required an elevated temperature within the evaporator. The shutdown of the 2 H evaporator led to a severe shortage of tank space. Therefore, the SRS tank farm was forced to transfer highly concentrated waste, which led to a <b>plugged</b> <b>transfer</b> pump in tank 32. For each of the proposed cesium removal technologies for the SRS, unwanted solids formation occurred during the large laboratory-scale tests prior to the final selection of the solvent extraction process. It can be expected that further problems will be encountered as more unit operations of the remediation effort are deployed and as more waste streams are combined. Since these problems have already led to costly schedule delays, the tank farm operators at both sites have identified the prevention of solids formation as a high-priority need. In response to this need, the Tank Focus Area has assembled a team of researchers of researchers from AEA Technology, Florida International University (FIU), Fluor Hanford, Mississippi State University (MSU), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) to evaluate various aspects of the waste preparation and transport chemistry. The majority of this effort was focused on saltcake dissolution and saltwell pumping. The results of the AEA Technology, FIU, and MSU studies of saltcake dissolution and slurry transfers for Hanford are discussed in detail in a companion report prepared by T. D. Welch in 2001 (ORNIJTM- 2001097). Staff members at Fluor Hanford have continued to conduct saltcake dissolution tests on actual tank waste (documented in reports prepared by D. L. Herting in 2000 and 2001). It should be noted that full-scale saltcake dissolution at Hanford is scheduled to begin in FY 2002.

To understand the role of selective forces underlying the evolution of these proteins in the A. gambiae complex, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of gene sequence and expression divergence {{on a pair of}} paralog genes called AgAcp 34 A- 1 and AgAcp 34 A- 2. These encode MAG-specific proteins which, based on homology with Drosophila, have been hypothesized {{to play a role in}} sperm viability and function. Results Genetic analysis of 6 species of the A. gambiae complex revealed the existence of a third paralog (68 - 78 % of identity), that we named AgAcp 34 A- 3. FISH assays showed that this gene maps in the same division (34 A) of chromosome- 3 R as the other two paralogs. In particular, immuno-fluorescence assays targeting the C-terminals of AgAcp 34 A- 2 and AgAcp 34 A- 3 revealed that these two proteins are localized in the posterior part of the MAG and concentrated at the apical portion of the mating <b>plug.</b> When <b>transferred</b> to females, this part of the plug lies in proximity to the duct connecting the spermatheca to the uterus, suggesting a potential role for these proteins in regulating sperm motility. AgAcp 34 A- 3 is more polymorphic than the other two paralogs, possibly because of relaxation of purifying selection. Since both unequal crossing-over and gene conversion likely homogenized the members of this gene family, the interpretation of the evolutionary patterns is not straightforward. Although several haplotypes of the three paralogs are shared by most A. gambiae s. l. species, some fixed species-specific replacements (mainly placed in the N- and C-terminal portions of the secreted peptides) were also observed, suggesting some lineage-specific adaptation.

40|$|Problems with {{pipeline}} plugs at Hanford {{have occurred}} throughout its tank farm system. Most cross-site transfer lines at Hanford {{are no longer}} functional due to these <b>plugs.</b> Waste <b>transfers</b> frequently led to partial line plugs, resulting in substantial amounts of water being added to the tank system {{in an attempt to}} free the lines. In response to these plugs, the Hanford tank farm developed waste acceptance criteria that a waste must pass before it can be transferred (Shekarriz et al., 1997). The criteria, which include physical properties such as viscosity, specific gravity, and percent solids, are based primarily on past operational experience. Unfortunately, the chemistry of the waste solutions {{was not included in the}} criteria even though the tank farm operators are fully aware of its importance. Pipeline plugs have also occurred during relatively short waste transfers at Hanford. In FY 2000, the effort to saltwell pump 50, 000 gal of filtered waste from tank U- 103 to tank SY- 102 was delayed for several weeks due to a plugged pipeline. Attempts to locate the plug(s) determined that it had occurred in the 02 -A flex and that other plugs were possible in each of the SY-farm flexes. Modifications such as larger flex jumpers and additional heat tracing were made to the <b>transfer</b> system. The <b>plug</b> was probably attributable to a reduction in the temperature of the waste in the pipeline. The waste in tank U- 103 was approximately 30 C prior to the transfer. During tests on actual waste from tank U- 103 (Herting, 1999), trisodium phosphate solids were observed at temperatures as high as 20 C after a 50 % dilution with water. Therefore, the following precautions (Herting, 1999) were recommended during the saltwell pumping of tank U- 103. First, the tank waste should not be heated prior to the transfer. Second, the waste should not be permitted to cool during the transfer. Third, the waste should be kept moving during the transfer. A previous Tanks Focus Area (TFA) study (Hunt et al., 1999) clearly demonstrated the need to maintain the temperature of the waste in this range. Even small reductions in the temperature of simulated wastes from 35 to 30 C and from 30 to 25 C led to high-viscosity solids that could easily plug a pipeline...|$|R

The feasibility study addresses issues of implementation, operation, and safety {{with a focus on}} strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls of the technology. The feasibility study was based on information acquired from TZN GmbH, a German company that developed and manufactures HPT systems for a wide-range of applications. Marketing partners of TZN for this technology are the German company Telerob and R. J. International, the U. S. representative of both companies. An HPT system is capable of fracturing brittle materials into 100 -microm particles using electrothermally-generated shock waves. Until now, the technology has been used only to separate glass, metal, ceramic, and plastic components. One primary application of the technology has been in foundries for removing ceramic molds from metal castings. Metals, except for those that are very brittle, are not impacted by the shock wave. The HPT system is highly effective in fracturing and mobilizing ceramic mold materials contained in the crevices of castings that are normally difficult to remove. The HPT system has also been shown to be effective in separating glass in windshields from their protective layers of plastic; concrete from reinforcing rods; ceramic, plastic, and metal materials in computer chips; and ceramic insulation from spark plugs and high-voltage insulators.

In this study we present results of leaching tests with 30 wt% MEA utilising real fly ash samples {{from a range of}} European coal-fired power plants. The effect of a number of parameters including CO 2 loading, temperature, pH, leaching time, solid/liquid ratio & organic heat stable salts have been investigated. These experiments show that the behaviour of the various compounds and elements is not uniform with different conditions. A strong correlation between reducing pH/increasing CO 2 loading and Fe, Cr & V levels is observed, but is not seen for other heavy metals. This impact of pH on metal solubility is striking and suggests that Fe, in particular, may be transported by the liquid system and stored as deposits in the stripper where increased pH reduces the solubility of Fe compounds. The presence of oxalate as a heat stable salt leads to the precipitation of calcium oxalate when calcium phosphate is leached out of the ash. This could result in deposits in areas such as the reboiler that may lead to <b>plugging,</b> reduced heat <b>transfer</b> efficiency and even corrosion issues. Solid/liquid ratio was also found to have some effect with lower solid/liquid ratios showing higher relative solubility for heavy metals. Temperature and leaching time were also investigated but only minor increases in metals content were observed by increasing either of these parameters. The results observed strongly suggest that the effects of particulate matter on the post-combustion capture process should not be ignored, particularly if levels are sufficient to lead to significant build up of ash in the solvent. Ash captured in the liquid has the potential to release significant amounts of Fe, Mg, Ca and PO 4 being a concern for the enhancement of solvent degradation processes...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{unmanned}} merchant vessels are possible, and researchers have claimed that larger autonomous vessels can be seen within 10 years. For oceangoing vessels, {{one of the biggest}} challenges is to get systems and machinery to work reliably for up to 4 weeks without maintenance. Therefore, a need to identify the systems that can be solely maintained in port, and those systems that will require redesign is present. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a procedure that determines what must be done to ensure that any physical asset continuous to do whatever its users wants it to do in its present operating context. The procedure is a thorough process that identifies critical failures for an asset in its operating context, and determines whether maintenance tasks can reduce the risk to an acceptable level. If no maintenance tasks are found to be applicable and effective in the operating context, the process requires one-time changes, such as redesign, modification or change of the item s operating context. For an oceangoing merchant vessel that is to be used in a new operating context, where no maintenance will be possible for up to four weeks, the procedure can be used to identify the critical failures and whether the risk can be reduced by means of maintenance, or if one-time changes are necessary. In this thesis, those critical failures that cannot be managed effectively by maintenance has been defined as barriers. This thesis establishes a step-by-step procedure for how to use RCM principles for identification of barriers. The procedure is considered to be a very useful tool for identifying and breaking barriers in design of unmanned engine rooms for merchant vessels. However, to effectively and successfully perform the procedure, a group consisting of an RCM facilitator well versed in RCM principles and experts with in-depth knowledge about the systems is strongly recommended. The procedure is used in a case study to identify barriers in a fuel oil system that uses HFO, as this is the most common fuel used today on oceangoing merchant vessels. The analysis has been performed on the fuel system under normal seagoing conditions, and the functional failure analysed is Supplies no fuel to the engine. As the RCM process only focuses on the maintenance, other procedures the crew may have such as opening and closing of hand-operated valves falls outside of the scope. Four barriers were identified in the analysis: plugging of the by-pass filter, plugging of the ME automatic backflush filter, <b>plugging</b> of the <b>transfer</b> pump filter and plugging of the flowmeter filter. These failure modes are identified as barriers because cleaning of the filters too often are required less than 4 weeks after the last cleaning. As the operating context states that maintenance cannot be performed at intervals less than 4 weeks, and the risk is considered to be unacceptable, the failures are considered to be barriers. The conclusion is therefore that one-time changes such as redesign, modification or change of operating context for the fuel system is necessary in order for an oceangoing merchant vessel to be able to sail without maintenance personnel with an acceptable risk. As the frequency of cleaning tasks are a direct function of the condition of the fuel, a one-time change that can be effective on all identified barriers is change of fuel. A comparison made with an FMECA analysis from a vessel running on diesel fuel indicate that this will have a significant effect...|$|R

Cytokines are generally secreted in small amounts, and are relatively unstable. Therefore, detection and measurement of cytokine local concentrations in a tissue extracellular matrix can be challenging. To investigate cytokines involved in cancer prevention by tumour-specific CD 4 + T cells, we have developed a strategy consisting of embedding subcutaneously injected tumour cells in a collagen gel (Matrigel) [1]. Matrigel is a soluble basement membrane isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swan (EHS) tumour [2]. This extract resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues. The Matrigel is liquid at 4 °C but when incubated at room temperature, the Matrigel proteins self-assemble forming a gel plug. In short, the Matrigel functions as an extracellular matrix in which infiltrating immune cells [3] and secreted cytokines can be analyzed at various time points after s. c. injections [1]. ### Reagents 1. Cold sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS 14040 - 117, Gibco) - Ice-cold liquid growth factor reduced Matrigel (356231, BD Biosciences) - RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (61870, Gibco) - Collagenase IV from Clostridium histolyticum (C 5138, Sigma-Aldrich) - Deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas (D 5025, Sigma-Aldrich) - 70 % Ethanol - Hypno/dormicum: hypnorm (Janssen Pharmaceutica) and midazolam (Alpharma) 7. 5 mg/kg. - Tryptan blue solution 0. 4 % (T 8154, Sigma-Aldrich) ### Equipment 1. 50 ml centrifuge tubes (430829, CORNING) - Scissors - Petri dish, TC dish 60 × 15 Nuncleon D SI (150326, NUNC) - Stainless steel sieve with screens for CD- 1, size 60 mesh (CD 1 - 1 KT, Sigma-Aldrich) - 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tubes (72. 690. 00. 1 SARSTEDT) - 2 ml syringe (2015 - 10, BD Biosciences) - 1 ml syringe (2015 - 07, BD Biosciences) - 0. 6 mm x 25 mm needle (2015 - 05, BD Biosciences) - Acrodisc 25 mm Syringe filter with 0. 45 µm HT + Tuffryn membrane (2012 - 05, PALL) - Centrifuge (HAERUS MULTIFUGE 3 SR+, THERMO SCIENTIFIC) - Count slide (87144, KOVA) - Pipettes - **Note**: Before use, Matrigel should be thawed slowly at a low heat level (e. g. overnight in the fridge at + 4 °C). Keep the Matrigel, the tumour cells and all the equipment cold (+ 4 °C). Remember that the Matrigel solution is liquid at + 4 °C but that it gels at room temperature. ### Procedure **Injection of Tumour Cells in Matrigel**: 1. Wash the cancer cells 1 X in sterile ice cold PBS. - Count cells. Adjust to a suitable concentration, e. g. 4 × 10 e 6 /ml. - Anesthetize the mice with hypno/dormicum intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. - Mix on ice 1125 µl Matrigel + 125 µl tumour cells (i. e. 10 X dilution). - Inject, subcutaneously, carefully 250 µl ice-cold tumour cell/Matrigel solution using a 1 ml syringe with a 0. 6 mm x 25 mm needle (This will give 10 e 5 cancer cells per Matrigel plug if the original concentration was 4 × 10 e 6 /ml). **Preparation of Matrigel samples for extracellular matrix cytokine detection and flow cytometry analysis**: - **Note**: During the whole procedure, keep samples on ice as much as possible. 1. Sacrifice the mice - From each mouse, dissect carefully the Matrigel <b>plug</b> and <b>transfer</b> it into a 50 ml tube with 1 ml cell medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0. 3 mg/ml DNase and 1 mg/ml collagenase IV. - Cut the Matrigel plug in small pieces using sterile scissors. - Put sample on ice. - Clean dissection equipment and scissors between each mouse. - Go back to step two until all Matrigel plugs are collected. - Place the tubes in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37 °C. - After 30 minutes, place the samples on ice and keep them on ice as much as possible. - Mesh the Matrigel samples through a stainless-steel sieve onto the lid of a 5 cm Petri dish, and transfer the solution with a pipette to a 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube. - Clean and burn mesh, using 70 % ethanol, between each Matrigel sample. - Centrifuge the tubes for 7 minutes 300 g. - Remove the supernatant with a pipette and transfer to a clean 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tube. - Prepare the cell-pellet for flow analysis. - Filter the supernatant through a 0. 45 µm filter. - Aliquot the samples in 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tubes (e. g. 50 µl per tube). Freeze immediately at - 70 ° C or below and keep samples frozen until analysis with ELISA or luminex technology. - **Note**: After incubation I *step 7 *, you will still observe some Matrigel clumps in the sample. These clumps are easily meshed through the stainless sieve. After meshing (*step 9 *) you will loose the rest of the Matrigel collagen fibers in centrifugation (*step 11 *) and filtering (*step 14 *). Cytokines in Matrigel extracellular matrix are diluted approximately five times in *step 2 * (1 ml RPMI + ~ 250 µl Matrigel plug). Final concentration is therefore found by multiplying observed concentration with 5. A starting volume of 1 ml RPMI + Matrigel plug will typically give 400 - 700 µl filtered supernatant. ### Timing - **Injections**: - 1 - 2 hours (for 24 Matrigel plugs) - **Collection of Matrigel plugs**: - usually takes 1 - 2 hours depending on the number of mice. Generally, you can expect to spend approximately 5 minutes on each mouse. - **Preparation of the Matrigel samples from water-bath to freezer**: - takes 2 - 3 hours depending on the number of samples. You can expect to use 3 - 4 minutes on meshing one sample + cleaning between each sample. ### Troubleshooting - **Air bubbles in the Matrigel**: - a) As Matrigel is a low viscosity liquid, you should be very careful when mixing it with your cells and injecting it in the mice. - b) Treating it to roughly may lead to air bubbles in the mixture. These air bubbles are very difficult to get rid of once inside the Matrigel solution in the syringe. Air bubbles in the syringe will give you an incorrect injection volume, and may cause the Matrigel to disintegrate once inside the mouse. - c) We have experienced that if you thaw the Matrigel overnight at 4 °C, it will be easier to handle. - **Clogging of the needle**: - a) If the Matrigel/cell mixture reaches room temperature while inside the syringe, it will clog your needle. Keep the syringe and needle on ice before use. - **Very low levels of cytokines**: - a) Cytokines are relatively unstable and generally have a short half-life. To prevent degradation of cytokines in your samples, keep samples on ice as much as possible during preparation. This reduces necrotic cell death and the subsequent release of proteases that may degrade the cytokines. - b) Aliquot the samples before freezing to avoid a reduction in the level of cytokines due to repeated freezing and thawing. - c) When samples are ready, freeze immediately at - 70 °C or below. ### References 1.
