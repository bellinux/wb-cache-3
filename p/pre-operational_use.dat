40|$|During {{the last}} years the world has seen many {{disasters}} in which {{a large amount of}} people have died due to limited efficiency of relief-operations, e. g. in Ethiopia and Rwanda. The aim of the European Commission sharecost project ENVIREF (www. enviref. org) is to demonstrate the <b>pre-operational</b> <b>use</b> of satellite remote sensing techniques for more efficient and cost-effective planning and management of refugee camps during the various stages, with special emphasis on environmental issues. The development of products and procedures are done in close co-operation with major relief organisations. Based on their requirements for geographic information various satellite sensors, including Landsat TM, SPOT XS, IRS- 1 D, Ikonos and ERS SAR, are evaluated for their applicability. War-affected countries having people on the run are often also exposed to a significant haze and cloud coverage, and as geographic data are needed rapidly satellite SAR imagery can be a valuable data source. Examples from both the resent rather short Kosovo conflict and several longer lasting settlements in the Eastern Nepal show that refugee settlements can be detected, and changes mapped using ERS SAR...|$|E
40|$|A {{modelling}} {{system for the}} Adriatic Sea has been built {{within the framework of}} the Mediterranean Forecasting System Pilot Project. The {{modelling system}} consists of a hierarchy of three numerical models (whole Mediterranean Sea, whole Adriatic Sea, Northern Adriatic Basin) coupled among each other by simple one-way, off-line nesting techniques, to downscale the larger scale flow field to highly resolved coastal scale fields. Numerical simulations have been carried out under climatological surface forcing. Simulations were aimed to assess the effectiveness of the nesting techniques and the skill of the system to reproduce known features of the Adriatic Sea circulation phenomenology (main circulation features, dense water formation,flow at the Otranto Strait and coastal circulation characteristics over the northern Adriatic shelf), in view of the <b>pre-operational</b> <b>use</b> of the modelling system. This paper describes the modelling system setup, and discusses the simulation results for the whole Adriatic Sea and its northern basin, comparing the simulations with the observed climatological circulation characteristics. Results obtained with the northern Adriatic model are also compared with the corresponding simulations obtained with the coarser resolution Adriatic model. Key words.

CAMOS collects the ARTAS system data and parameters needed to ensure the exchanges of surveillance data between the States implementing ARTAS and provides software enhancements to the commonly developed ARTAS System for functionality required by changes in the technical environment or common user needs.|$|R

Experimental data of EGNOS <b>pre-operational</b> service was <b>used</b> for some specific tests, aiming at identifying for instance the good reaction of the EGNOS check-set subsystem and the way pseudorange errors are translated into the user domain. From this analysis, a new technique for User Domain Integrity Assessment (UDIA) was developed. With the UDIA technique, the integrity is checked for all possible geometries from 4 to all satellites in view from a network of stations. When no MI is found (from a wide and sufficiently dense stations network), it can be assured {{that the system is}} safe, and it becomes the best experimental guarantee at the User Domain Level. If a NMI/MI appears from any geometry of satellites from the stations in the network, thence a search algorithm is applied to identify the satellite, or combinations of satellites, responsible of such NMI/MIs (i. e., their exclusion leads to the disappearance of the NMI/MIs). After identifying such satellites, the reaction of the EGNOS Check Set (CS) is evaluated by checking if they were set as DU or NM within a predefined time interval after the NMI/MI is detected.

40|$|International audienceOperational {{forecasting}} {{of ocean}} circulation and marine ecosystem fluctuations requires multi-parametric real-time measurements {{of physical and}} biochemical properties. The architecture {{of a system that}} is able to provide such measurements from the upper-thermocline layers of the Mediterranean Sea is described here. The system was developed for the needs of the Mediterranean Forecasting System and incorporates state-of-the-art sensors for optical and chemical measurements in the upper 100 m and physical measurements down to 500 m. Independent moorings that communicate via hydro-acoustic modems are hosting the sensors. The satellite data transfer and the large autonomy allow for the operation of the system in any open-ocean site. The system has been in <b>pre-operational</b> <b>use</b> in the Cretan Sea since January 2000. The results of this pilot phase indicate that multi-parametric real-time observations with the M 3 A system are feasible, if a consistent maintenance and re-calibration program is followed. The main limitations of the present configuration of M 3 A are related: (a) to bio-fouling that primarily affects the turbidity and secondarily affects the other optical sensors, and (b) to the limited throughput of the currently used satellite communication system.

40|$|The MyOcean marine core service, {{implementing}} the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) objectives, targets {{the provision of}} ocean state data from various platforms to assist, among other downscaled activities, {{the needs of the}} operational response to marine safety, particularly concerning oil spills. The MEDSLIK oil spill and trajectory prediction system makes use of the MyOcean regional and Cyprus Coastal Ocean Forecasting and Observing System (CYCOFOS) downscaled forecasting products for operational application in the Mediterranean and <b>pre-operational</b> <b>use</b> in the Black Sea. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) satellite remote-sensing images from European Space Agency (ESA) and European Maritime Safety Agency – CleanSeaNet (EMSA-CSN) provide the means for routine monitoring of the southern European seas for the detection of illegal oil discharges. MEDSLIK offers various ways, to be described in this paper, of coupling the Pan-European capacity for Ocean Monitoring and Forecasting (MyOcean) forecasting data with ASAR imageries to provide both forecasts and hindcasts for such remotely-observed oil slicks. The main concern will be the drift of the oil slick and also, {{in the case of the}} forecast mode, its diffusive spreading, although some attempt is also made to estimate the changes in the state of the oil. The successful link of the satellite-detected oil slicks with their operational predictions using the MyOcean products contributes to the operational response chain and the strengthening of maritime safety for accidental or illegal spills, in implementation of a Mediterranean decision support system for marine safety regarding oil spills...|$|E
