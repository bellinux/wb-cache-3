50|$|Two federal {{agencies}} have supported various weather modification research projects, {{which began in}} the early-1960s: The United States Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation; Department of the Interior) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA; Department of Commerce). Reclamation sponsored several cloud seeding research projects under the umbrella of Project Skywater from 1964 to 1988, and NOAA conducted the Atmospheric Modification Program from 1979 to 1993. The sponsored projects were carried out in several states and two countries (Thailand and Morocco), studying both winter and summer cloud seeding. From 1962 to 1988 Reclamation developed cloud seeding applied research to augment water supplies in the western US. The research focused on winter orographic seeding to enhance snowfall in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, and precipitation in coast ranges of southern California. In California Reclamation partnered with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) to sponsor the Serra Cooperative Pilot Project (SCPP), based in Auburn CA, to conduct seeding experiments in the central Sierra. The University of Nevada and Desert Research Institute provided cloud physics, physical chemistry, and other field support. The High Plains Cooperative Pilot Project (HIPLEX), focused on convective cloud seeding to increase rainfall during the growing season in Montana, Kansas, and Texas from 1974 to 1979. In 1979, the World Meteorological Organization, and other member-states led by the Government of Spain conducted a <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Enhancement</b> Project (PEP) in Spain, with inconclusive results due probably to location selection issues. Reclamation sponsored research at several universities including Colorado State University, Universities of Wyoming, Washington, UCLA, Utah, Chicago, NYU, Montana, Colorado and research teams at Stanford, Meteorology Research Inc., and Penn State University, and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, North Dakota, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, and Oklahoma. Cooperative efforts with state water resources agencies in California, Colorado, Montana, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Arizona assured that the applied research met state water management needs. The High Plains Cooperative Pilot Project also engaged in partnerships with NASA, Environment Canada, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). More recently, in cooperation with six western states, Reclamation sponsored a small cooperative research program called the Weather Damage Modification Program, from 2002-2006.|$|E

40|$|The nonadiabatic {{acceleration}} of plasma sheet ions during the expansion phase of substorms is examined {{by means of}} single-particle codes. It is shown that, in the near-earth plasma sheet, the gyration phase at substorm onset controls the net ion energization, as the gyro-period is locally comparable to the field variation time scale. This can yield a particularly significant decrease of the particle magnetic moment. It is accordingly argued that, via adiabatic invariant violation, the dipolarization of magnetospheric field lines can induce a 'de-trapping' of inner plasma sheet populations and, hence, give rise to short-lived <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancements</b> over the auroral zone. As this effect depends upon cyclotron frequency, {{it is expected to}} occur at distinct latitudes for different ion species.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{data-driven}} methodology {{to characterize the}} likelihood of orographic <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> using sequences of weather radar images and a digital elevation model (DEM). Geographical locations with topographic characteristics favorable to enforce repeatable and persistent orographic precipitation such as stationary cells, upslope rainfall enhancement, and repeated convective initiation are detected by analyzing the spatial distribution {{of a set of}} precipitation cells extracted from radar imagery. Topographic features such as terrain convexity and gradients computed from the DEM at multiple spatial scales as well as velocity fields estimated from sequences of weather radar images are used as explanatory factors to describe the occurrence of localized <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement.</b> The latter is represented as a binary process by defining a threshold on the number of cell occurrences at particular locations. Both two-class and one-class support vector machine classifiers are tested to separate the presumed orographic cells from the nonorographic ones in the space of contributing topographic and flow features. Site-based validation is carried out to estimate realistic generalization skills of the obtained spatial prediction models. Due to the high class separability, the decision function of the classifiers can be interpreted as a likelihood or susceptibility of orographic <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement.</b> The developed approach can serve as a basis for refining radar-based quantitative precipitation estimates and short-term forecasts or for generating stochastic precipitation ensembles conditioned on the local topography...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of evaluating models through paleoclimate simulations {{is becoming more}} recognized in efforts to improve climate projection. To evaluate an integrated Earth System Model, MIROC-ESM, we performed simulations in time-slice experiments for the mid-Holocene (6000 yr before present, 6 ka) and preindustrial (1850 AD, 0 ka) periods under the protocol of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 /Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project 3. We first give {{an overview of the}} simulated global climates by comparing with simulations using a previous version of the MIROC model (MIROC 3), which is an atmosphere–ocean coupled general circulation model. We then comprehensively discuss various aspects of climate change with 6 ka forcing and how the differences in the models can affect the results. We also discuss the representation of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> at 6 ka over northern Africa. The <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> at 6 ka over northern Africa according to MIROC-ESM does not differ greatly from that obtained with MIROC 3, which means that newly developed components such as dynamic vegetation and improvements in the atmospheric processes do not have significant impacts on the representation of the 6 ka monsoon change suggested by proxy records. Although there is no drastic difference between the African monsoon representations of the two models, there are small but significant differences in the <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> over the Sahara in early summer, which can be related to the representation of the sea surface temperature rather than the vegetation coupling in MIROC-ESM. Because the oceanic parts of the two models are identical, the difference in the sea surface temperature change is ultimately attributed to the difference in the atmospheric and/or land modules, and possibly the difference in the representation of low-level clouds...|$|E

40|$|The USCLI VAR {{working group}} on drought {{recently}} initiated a series of global climate model simulations forced with idealized SST anomaly patterns, designed to address a number of uncertainties regarding the impact of SST forcing {{and the role of}} land-atmosphere feedbacks on regional drought. Specific questions that the runs are designed to address include: What are the mechanisms that maintain drought across the seasonal cycle and from one year to the next? What {{is the role of the}} leading patterns of SST variability, and what are the physical mechanisms linking the remote SST forcing to regional drought, including the role of land-atmosphere coupling? The runs were carried out with five different atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM 5), and one coupled atmosphere-ocean model in which the model was continuously nudged to the imposed SST forcing. This paper provides an overview of the experiments and some initial results focusing on the responses to the leading patterns of annual mean SST variability consisting of a Pacific El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -like pattern, a pattern that resembles the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), and a global trend pattern. One of the key findings is that all the AGCMs produce broadly similar (though different in detail) precipitation responses to the Pacific forcing pattern, with a cold Pacific leading to reduced precipitation and a warm Pacific leading to enhanced precipitation over most of the United States. While the response to the Atlantic pattern is less robust, there is general agreement among the models that the largest precipitation response over the U. S. tends to occur when the two oceans have anomalies of opposite sign. That is, a cold Pacific and warm Atlantic tend to produce the largest precipitation reductions, whereas a warm Pacific and cold Atlantic tend to produce the greatest <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancements.</b> Further analysis of the response over the U. S. to the Pacific forcing highlights a number of noteworthy and to some extent unexpected results. These include a seasonal dependence of the precipitation response that is characterized by signal-to-noise ratios that peak in spring, and surface temperature signal-to-noise ratios that are both lower and show less agreement among the models than those found for the precipitation response. Another interesting result concerns what appears to be a substantially different character in the surface temperature response over the U. S. to the Pacific forcing by the only model examined here that was developed for use in numerical weather prediction. The response to the positive SST trend forcing pattern is an overall surface warming over the world's land areas with substantial regional variations that are in part reproduced in runs forced with a globally uniform SST trend forcing. The precipitation response to the trend forcing is weak in all the models...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the dependence of}} aerosol-precipitation interactions on environmental humidity in a mesoscale cloud ensemble (MCE) driven by deep convective clouds. It is found that increases in aerosol enhance evaporative cooling, which raises not only the intensity of vorticity and entrainment but also that of downdrafts and low-level convergence or gustiness. The increase in vorticity tends to suppress precipitation. The increase in low-level convergence tends to enhance precipitation by generating more secondary clouds in a muptiple-cloud system simulated here. At high humidity, the effect of increased vorticity on cloud-liquid mass and, thus, precipitation is outweighed by that of increased low-level convergence. This leads to aerosol-induced <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement.</b> When humidity lowers to mid humidity, the effect of aerosol on low-level convergence still dominates that on entrainment, leading to <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> with increased aerosol. With the lowest humidity in the current work, the effect of aerosol on entrainment dominates that on low-level convergence, leading to precipitation suppression with increased aerosol. Hence, there {{is not only a}} competition between the effect of evaporation on vorticity and that on low-level convergence but also the variation of the competition with humidity. This competition and variation are absent in a single-cloud system where the effect of low-level convergence on secondary clouds is absent. This exemplifies a difference in the mechanism which controls aerosol-precipitation interactions between a single cloud and a multiple-cloud system...|$|E

In contrast to previously documented IMPROVE- 2 cases, the 4 – 5 December event featured weaker cross-barrier winds (15 – 20 m s 1), weaker moist static stability (Nm 0. 006 s 1), and convective cells that preferentially intensified over Oregon’s modest coastal mountain range. These cells propagated eastward and became embedded within the larger orographic precipitation shield over the windward slopes of the Cascades. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (version 2. 2) at 1. 33 -km grid spacing was able to accurately replicate the observed evolution of the precipitation across western Oregon. As a result of the convective cell development, the <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> over the Coast Range (500 – 1000 m MSL) was nearly as large as that over the Cascades (1500 – 2000 m MSL). Simulations selectively eliminating the elevated coastal range and differential land–sea friction across the Pacific coast-line illustrate that both effects were important in triggering convection and in producing the observed coastal <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement.</b> A sensitivity run employing a smoothed representation of the Cascades illustrates that narrow ridges located on that barrier’s windward slope had a relatively small (5 %) impact on embedded convection and overall precipitation amounts there.

Under the water planning efforts in Texas, the regional water planning group identified a goal of limiting water use to an annual average of 1. 25 % of saturated thickness to preserve water availability for future generations. As {{a part of that}} effort, water management strategies that could be potentially implemented to reduce the rate of irrigation water use were identified and evaluated. The assessment of conservation strategies included the use of the ET network for irrigation scheduling, changes in crop variety, irrigation equipment improvements, changes in crop type, implementation of conservation tillage methods, <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement,</b> the conversion from irrigated to dryland farming, and brush control measures. While all of the strategies evaluated resulted in water savings, several have negative impacts on the economy of the region.

Aircraft data from the New England Winter Storms Experiment (NEWSEX) are used to examine the vertical structure of four New England coastal fronts. The aircraft made multiple passes at varying elevations through the coastal fronts. The observations were projected onto cross sections normal to the coastal fronts using frontal orientations determined from surface analyses and frontal velocities determined from a least-squares fit to multiple frontal penetrations. The frontal zones were found to be roughly 200 m wide, rising sharply from the ground to a height of 150 m to 400 m over distances of 0. 5 to 2. 5 km before leveling off and rising gradually toward the mountains. The underlying pools of cold air were similar in form and flow patterns to cold-air damming structures observed elsewhere along the East Coast. The coastal fronts formed the leading edges of the cold pools. Air on the warm side of the fronts was neutrally stratified, having been recently heated by the warm Gulf of Maine. This warm air attained vertical velocities of up to 2. 5 m s? 1 as it rose over the coastal fronts and accelerated toward the mountains, and evidence is found for direct <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancements</b> by this updraft. The coastal fronts possessed characteristics of atmospheric density currents, with a low-level inflow within the cold air toward the head and turbulent mixing behind the head. Because the fronts were quasi-stationary and were located in neutrally stratified environments, a direct comparison is made with theoretical predictions of inviscid density current behavior. The observed frontal velocities relative to the warm air were found to be within about 1 m s? 1 of the velocities predicted by inviscid density current theory.

On the other hand, a MM 5 -climate-mode-simulation driven with ERA- 40 reanalysis data provides information about the environmental meteorological conditions. After a short introduction into the basics of orographic <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> and into some simple linear models, the different station data are converted into a uniform temporal resolution of 6 hours. To estimate the relative contribution of different precipitation types, we distinguish between cold fronts, warm fronts, convection and a class carrying unclassified events. Convective precipitation in connection with fronts is attributed to the respective frontal class. Unclassified events predominantly consist of postfrontal upslope precipitation and quasi-stationary fronts. In addition, the wind direction at Alpine crest level (700 hPa) is considered. In a first step, the precipitation differences between the Alpine foreland and the northern Alps are analyzed. The investigation of the climatological importance of the 4 precipitation types in various regions shows that summertime convection and orographic lifting make the largest contribution to the precipitation gradient towards the Alps. Convective precipitation occurs predominantly in association with southwesterly flow and is more abundant in the Alps than in the adjacent forelands because convection is primarily triggered over the Alps. Orographic lifting is most active in case of northwesterly and northerly winds and intensifies both frontal and postfrontal precipitation. The climatological importance of orographic lifting is much larger in winter than in summer. A reversed precipitation gradient with systematically more precipitation in the foreland than in the Alps is found for fronts associated with a wind direction of exactly 270 ^∘. Under these circumstances, the wind blows parallel to the mountain range and lee effects related to upstream topography reduce the precipitation intensity in the Alps. The climatological precipitation maximum is shifted from westerly towards northerly winds when moving from west to east in the northern Alps. The second part of this work comprises {{an investigation of the}} climatological precipitation decrease from the northern Alps to the inner-Alpine valleys. The comparison between the precipitation distribution of 3 regions in the northern Alps and 3 regions in the central Alps shows that especially for cold fronts and unclassified events in connection with northwesterly or northerly flow, a distinctive precipitation surplus {{can be found in the}} northern Alps. For convective precipitation and southwesterly or westerly winds the inner-Alpine regions show high convective activity. For southerly wind directions the showers formed over the central Alps are advected towards the northern Alps, where they sometimes even intensify due to a convergence with the inflow from the Alpine foreland. There is a strong west-east precipitation gradient in the central Alps. The decreasing crest level of the northern Alps and the decreasing north-south-extension of the Alps together with the topographical structure of the valleys are the main reasons for the higher precipitation amounts in the eastern parts of the central Alps than in the western parts. Additionally, an investigation of the precipitation gradient in dependence on the temperature level is made. However, a classification of the precipitation events into 3 classes (snow line > 2500 m, 2500 m - 1000 m, < 1000 m) does not show any clear results. The next part investigates altitudinal precipitation differences in the Alps. The analysis is performed for four station pairs, consisting of a mountain station and a nearby valley station each. The climatological precipitation distribution shows that the mountain stations usually receive substantially more precipitation than the valley stations, especially for northwesterly and northerly ambient flow in 700 hPa. However, the differences are regionally variable and indicate a strong influence of the local topography. Moreover, <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> over mountains tends to be substantially more effective for low temperatures than for high temperatures. A more detailed investigation of some parameters affecting orographic <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> is conducted for stratiform precipitation events. The magnitude of orographic <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> markedly increases with the wind speed at 700 hPa. Moreover, <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> increases with the depth of the moist layer in the approaching flow. High resolution simulations with the MM 5 model are conducted for four climatologically representative precipitation events in the Zugspitze area. The first two wintertime cases are characterized by a strong northwesterly or northerly flow, associated with large precipitation differences between the mountain and the valley stations. For these cases the model validation shows good agreement with the observed precipitation patterns. The model results indicate a dominance of the classical seeder-feeder mechanism, with strong orographic lifting generating dense orographic clouds over the mountain ridges. The third precipitation event is also associated with a northerly flow, but in this case the low wind speeds do not cause enough orographical lifting so that the mountain-valley precipitation differences are rather small. The last case represents summertime precipitation events with northerly flow, a high snow line and almost no precipitation difference between the Zugspitze and the surrounding valley stations. The correlation between the model and the observations is not as good, because embedded convective cells are not reproduced in a deterministic sense in the MM 5. The dynamical and microphysical fields show that the snow line around the peak causes a local precipitation minimum at the Zugspitze. Because of different fall speeds of snow/graupel and rain there is a divergence of the hydrometeorological trajectories near the peak and therefore the precipitation maximum is shifted towards the lee...|$|E

40|$|Observed {{intensification}} of precipitation extremes, responsible for extensive societal impacts, are widely attributed to anthropogenic sources, which may include indirect effects of agricultural irrigation. However quantifying {{the effects of}} irrigation on far-downstream climate remains a challenge. We use three paired Community Earth System Model simulations to assess mechanisms of irrigation-induced precipitation trends and extremes in the conterminous US and {{the effect on the}} terrestrial carbon sink. Results suggest <b>precipitation</b> <b>enhancement</b> in the central US reduced drought conditions and increased regional carbon uptake, while further downstream, the heaviest precipitation events were more frequent and intense. Specifically, moisture advection from irrigation in the western U. S. and recycling of enhanced local convective precipitation produced very-heavy storm events that were 11 % more intense and occurred 23 % more frequently in the densely populated greater New York City region...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is proposed {{to explain the}} control of Io-related radio emissions by Jupiter's rotational phase. The model {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the radio emissions are generated by Birkeland currents flowing between Io and the Jovian ionosphere. Specifically, it is suggested that the precipitation of radiation-belt electrons within a certain range of Jovian longitudes produces a restricted region of enhanced ionization and correspondingly enhanced conductivity in Jupiter's ionosphere and that the Io-Jupiter Birkeland current and the associated radio emissions are dramatically increased when Io's flux tube encounters this sector of enhanced ionization in Jupiter's ionosphere. The magnitude of the current is found to be about 100, 000 A at most Jovian longitudes because of ionospheric resistance. It is estimated that within the favored longitudinal sector electron <b>precipitation</b> produces an <b>enhancement</b> of this current by one to three orders of magnitude. The model predictions are compared with observations made during the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys, and satisfactory agreement is obtained...|$|R
40|$|The Okinawa baiu (summer rainy season) {{starts in}} early May and ends in late June, {{preceding}} the baiu in mainland Japan by approximately 1 month. This study investigates the time {{evolution of the}} large-scale circulation associated with the Okinawa baiu using 10 -yr (1997 - 2006) climatologies of precipitation and meteorological fields, with particular focus on temperature advection at 500 hPa. The onset of the Okinawa baiu occurs in early May and is followed by an initial peak in precipitation during mid-May. The baiu rainband then moves southeastward, leading to a short break in baiu precipitation during late May. The rainband returns to Okinawa in early June, and a second peak in precipitation occurs during mid-June. The baiu rainband withdraws northward in late June. The mid-May precipitation peak is associated with warm advection at 500 hPa, mainly due to the meridional temperature gradient and the prevailing southerly winds. This warm advection coincides with upward motion near Okinawa; however, the warm advection is insufficient to explain the peak <b>precipitation</b> amount. <b>Enhancement</b> of <b>precipitation</b> by a transient disturbance probably contributes to the peak amount. The break period during late May coincides with the peak of South China Sea monsoon. Warm advection at 500 hPa strengthens again in June because of the strong zonal thermal contrast between the warm Tibetan Plateau and cold Pacific. This warm advection is able to adequately explain both the upward motion and precipitation. These {{results indicate that the}} large-scale meteorological characteristics are different during the first and second peaks...|$|R
40|$|COSMO Sky-Med (CSK) is an {{important}} programme of the Italian Space Agency aiming at supporting environmental monitoring and management of exogenous, endogenous and anthropogenic risks through X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) on board of 4 satellites forming a constellation. Most of typical SAR applications are focused on land or ocean observation. However, X-band SAR can be detect precipitation that results in a specific signature caused by the combination of attenuation of surface returns induced by <b>precipitation</b> and <b>enhancement</b> of backscattering determined by the hydrometeors in the SAR resolution volume. Within CSK programme, we conducted an intercomparison between the statistical properties of precipitation fields derived by CSK SARs and those derived by the CNR Polar 55 C (C-band) ground based weather radar located in Rome (Italy). This contribution presents main results of this research which was aimed at the robust characterisation of rainfall statistical properties across different scales by means of scale-invariance analysis and multifractal theory. The analysis was performed on a dataset of more two years of precipitation observations collected by the CNR Polar 55 C radar and rainfall fields derived from available images collected by the CSK satellites during intense rainfall events. Scale-invariance laws and multifractal properties were detected on the most intense rainfall events derived from the CNR Polar 55 C radar for spatial scales from 4 km to 64 km. The analysis on X-SAR retrieved rainfall fields, although based on few images, leaded to similar results and confirmed the existence of scale-invariance and multifractal properties for scales larger than 4 km. These outcomes encourage investigating SAR methodologies for future development of meteo-hydrological forecasting models based on multifractal theory...|$|R
