The study of the physical phenomenon consists in solving a <b>photothermic</b> coupled problem between light and nanowire. The numerical multiphysic model is used to study the variations of the temperature and the shape of the created bubble by illumination of the nanowire. The optimization process, including an adaptive remeshing scheme, is used to solve the problem through a finite element method. The study of the shape evolution of the bubble is made taking into account the physical and geometrical parameters of the nanowire.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{environmental}} {{studies have been}} dedicated to the correct management of industrial residues. The conventional clay ceramic productive sector became, in past decades, a growing alternative for these residues through their incorporation in products such as bricks and tiles. The firing temperatures for ceramic sintering usually transform the incorporated residue into an inert microstructural phase. In some cases, the residue may even improve the ceramic properties. However, during the firing stage, polluting gases might be emitted causing environmental impact. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present work was to evaluate the gases emitted during sintering of a clay ceramic incorporated with 10 and 20 wt % of elephant grass ashes. The emission was investigated for firing temperature in the interval from 250 to 1100 ºC and the gases analyzed by <b>photothermic</b> technique. The ash incorporation promoted {{a significant increase in the}} emission of greenhouse gases such as CO and CO 2...|$|E

40|$|In {{photovoltaic-thermal}} (PV/T) technology, the use {{of glass}} cover on the flat-plate hybrid solar collector is favorable to the <b>photothermic</b> process {{but not to the}} photovoltaic process. Because of the difference in the usefulness of electricity and thermal energy, there is often no straight forward answer on whether a glazed or unglazed collector system is more suitable for a specific application. This glazing issue was tackled in this paper from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. Based on experimental data and validated numerical models, a study of the appropriateness of glass cover on a thermosyphon-based water-heating PV/T system was carried out. The influences of six selected operating parameters were evaluated. From the first law point of view, a glazed PV/T system is found always suitable if we are to maximize the quantity of either the thermal or the overall energy output. From the exergy analysis point of view however, the increase of PV cell efficiency, packing factor, water mass to collector area ratio, and wind velocity are found favorable to go for an unglazed system, whereas the increase of on-site solar radiation and ambient temperature are favorable for a glazed system.

40|$|Solar collector/regenerator (C/R) using liquid {{desiccant}} combines solar <b>photothermic</b> {{transformation and}} regeneration of liquid desiccant together, effectively achieving the regeneration for solar energy-driven liquid desiccant cooling systems. In this paper {{a group of}} dimensionless heat and mass transfer equations describing the heat and mass transfer process in the solar C/R were obtained by introducing total temperature difference ([Delta]T 0) and dimensionless heat loss coefficient. For the sake of predicting the heat loss of air stream and simplifying calculation, the models of dimensionless air temperature ([theta]a) and equilibrium humidity ratio (YeL) along with the height of solar C/R were put forward. An analytical solution was formed by two differential equations on the dimensionless heat and mass transfer driving potentials and the heat and mass conservation equations. Compared with the numerical simulation results, the analytical results on the outlet parameters of solar C/R have great precision with different Lewis factor Le, total temperature difference [Delta]T 0 and air-to salt mass flow rate ratio ASMR. Simultaneously, the effects of above variables on the regeneration performance were analyzed. Lastly, by comparing with the experimental data, the analytical calculation results can agree well with the experimental results validating the analytical model is an ideal way for predicting {{the performance of the}} solar C/R.

40|$|Background: Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have many}} industrial applications; moreover, they are <b>photothermic</b> agents for clinical treatment of cancer. This study {{was provided to}} investigate the effects associated with different doses of applied gold nanoparticles by injection and contact procedures on the alterations of the serum levels and certain factors in male mice. Materials and Methods: 72 male mice were randomly assigned into two protocols in terms of touching and injection. The injection protocol was included of five groups: Sham, control, 25, 50, and 100 ppm. They received gold nanoparticles at 25, 50, and 100 ppm concentrations administered in form of 0. 3 ml/day {{for the period of}} 14 days and that of touching protocol were received 0. 2 ml/day gold nanoparticles. Blood sample of which was taken to measure the serum level of creatine kinase phosphate, fasting blood, creatinine, albumin, blood urea nitrogen and eventually, the kidney was dissected for the intent of pathological analysis. Results: The serum level of creatine kinase phosphate and fasting blood sugar at middle dose was significantly different (P 0 ≤ 0. 05) in touching protocol. In both protocols, the serum level of creatinine in high and medium doses showed a significant difference (P < 0. 05) associated with the treated group. In the touching method, in high and medium doses administered to the treated group, the alteration was significant (P ≤ 0. 05). In the both protocols, the serum level of albumin in high and medium doses of the treated group showed significant difference (P < 0. 05). Thus, the gold nanoparticles could result in undesirable effects upon kidney tissue. Conclusion: The result of this study indicated that the administration of gold nanoparticles by touching method was more effective on the serum levels of these factors than that of injection method...|$|E
