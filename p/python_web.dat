40|$|AbstractUnderstanding human {{motivations and}} actions related to {{environmental}} problems {{is central to}} modeling complex, human-natural systems. However, social science survey data on environmental issues are often presented in relatively static reports and figures and are not easily accessible for participatory deliberation. Federal data sharing mandates motivate innovative data visualization and sharing mechanisms. We developed an open-source, web-based Survey Data Viewer as a visual interface to explore quantitative social science survey data. We used the <b>Python</b> Django <b>web</b> framework and the D 3. js visualization library to create and deploy the tool. The Viewer was implemented using a water-related survey administered to a large, random sample of Utah adults in public venues. The Viewer allows users to visualize question responses based on demographic variables with percentages and mean response levels. We developed a standardized template for encoding survey data and metadata that permits the generalization of the tool to other similar surveys...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{addresses}} {{the planning and}} development of web framework and content management system. An analysis of the existing solutions described deficiencies was made and {{we came to a}} conclusion, based on these tests, that we will be using Django as the base framework for developing our system. To create our framework, we used some of the existing functionalities and we developed and included additional modules that allow us to extend and easily adapt to users requirements by simply adding new plugins. The framework was upgraded with a system for content managing, also known as CMS (Content Management System). Both the framework and the CMS are written in <b>Python</b> and <b>web</b> technologies such as HTML CSS, Javascript. The application serves as a data editing environment and enables us to create and edit the appearance of a website. Usability and functionality were tested and presented with a practical solution for editing web content of Faculty of Computer and Information Science website...|$|R
50|$|The primary motive behind Grok is to {{make the}} Zope Toolkit {{technology}} more accessible and easier to use for newcomers and, at the same time, speed up application development, in accordance with the agile programming paradigm.To achieve this, Grok uses convention-over-configuration instead of using an explicit XML based configuration language (ZCML) as Zope Toolkit and BlueBream do. Grok uses Python code for component configuration, and has many implicit defaults and conventions. Grok is similar in feel to other <b>Python</b> <b>Web</b> frameworks such as TurboGears, Pylons and Django.|$|E

The reasons {{given for the}} switch were wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility. The <b>Python</b> <b>web</b> framework that former Reddit employee Swartz developed to run the site, web.py, is now available as an open-source project.

50|$|In 2011 InfoWorld ranked web2py highest {{among the}} top six <b>Python</b> <b>web</b> {{frameworks}} , awarded web2py the Bossie award 2011 for best open source application development software. In 2012 web2py won the technology {{of the year award}} with the following motivation Web2py installs everything you need—even a Python interpreter—for building a Python-based Web application. Its creator's mission to build an easy-to-use framework extends throughout. Web2py's database abstraction layer allows you to manipulate a variety of databases without having to write any SQL. Once you've defined your database tables, Web2py will automatically build an administration interface for your app. In fact, Web2py's combination console and dashboard is where all your application development activities take place—even editing your application files. Finally, Web2py lets you embed Python code into your Web page's HTML, so you don't have to learn a new template language. With all its built-in assistance, Web2py is as painless as it gets.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of efficient tools for allosteric ligand binding site identification in potential drug targets {{is an important}} step for computational drug design. Ligand binding specificity analysis (LIBSA) is one of the protocols that utilizes filtering algorithms to assess the propensity of a site on a target structure or structures to bind a ligand. However, LIBSA requires expert skills to be properly executed. Thus, a Web interface, LBPI (Ligand Binding Pocket Identification) has been developed using Django, a <b>Python</b> based <b>web</b> framework. A <b>Python</b> Wrapper has also been developed to streamline pre-existing algorithms of LIBSA. The Wrapper helps in the preparation of files, execution of individual programs and generation of appropriate results. LBPI provides an ideal platform for making complex binding site identification protocols readily available for non-expert users to submit jobs and monitor the results. The goal of LBPI is to integrate available algorithms in a systematic way and make it easily available for both experts and non-experts...|$|R
