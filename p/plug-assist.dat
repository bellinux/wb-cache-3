5000|$|In {{the case}} of thermoforming, a plastic film or sheet is unwound from the reel and guided though a {{pre-heating}} station on the blister line. The temperature of the pre-heating plates (upper and lower plates) is such that the plastic will soften and become pliable. The warm plastic will then arrive in a forming station where a large pressure (4 to 8 bar) will form the blister cavity into a negative mold. The mold is cooled such that the plastic becomes rigid again and maintains its shape when removed from the mold. In case of difficult shapes, the warm film will be physically pushed down partially into the cavity by a [...] "plug-assist" [...] feature. <b>Plug-assist</b> results in a blister cavity with more uniform wall distribution and is typically used when the cavity size and shape is larger than a small tablets and capsules.|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{processing}} {{for production}} {{of all forms}} of polymeric articles has found a great place in chemical industries. A nonlinear viscoelastic rheological model is implemented for developing the process model. This model describes deformation process of a sheet in thermoforming process. Because of relaxation pause after <b>plug-assist</b> stage and also implementation of two stage thermoforming process have minor wall-thickness variation and consequently minor warpage and better mechanical properties of thermoformed articles. For model validation, a quantitative relation between stress and technical parameters of <b>plug-assist</b> thermoforming is determined by comparison of theoretical and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Plug {{temperature}} {{is a key}} parameter affecting the thickness distribution of thermoplastic components made by plug assist thermoforming. For a specified pair of plug and plastic sheet, the variation in plug temperature can alter the coefficient of friction (COF) between the pair. We show here how the temperature dependence of COF influences {{the nature and extent}} of biaxial stretching of the sheet and consequently the thickness distribution of the thermoformed component. In the present study, high impact polystyrene (HIPS) sheets were thermoformed into axisymmetric cups using a <b>plug-assist</b> process in which the aluminum plug temperature (T-plug) was varied from ambient to above the glass transition temperature of HIPS (similar to 100 degrees C). Biaxial strain maps on the surfaces of the formed cups were measured and quantified using Grid Strain Analysis (GSA). Thickness distributions of the cups were also measured. Temperature dependent COF between HIPS and aluminum was determined independently using a rotational rheometer. The measured COF was low for T 100 degrees C, a significant reduction in the magnitude of slip is expected. Here the sheet is gripped at the clamp and by the plug during forming which causes reduced biaxial stretching of the base and increased uniaxial stretching of the walls of the cup. Simulations of <b>plug-assist</b> thermoforming using a temperature dependent COF showed qualitative agreement with the GSA data thereby supporting our inferences...|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} common method of high-volume, {{continuous}} thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (<b>Plug-assists</b> are typically used in addition to vacuum {{in the case of}} taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web, or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.|$|R

40|$|Wide {{applications}} of thermoforming {{are due to}} its high performance, simplicity, compactness and relatively low-cost equipment. These issues {{make it possible to}} produce complex, large-scale configurations and free form shapes of products. The fundamental defects inherent to the thermoforming technology are wall-thickness variation and warpage of the products due to inadequate thermal processing and frozen-in stresses during production of polymer. A nonlinear viscoelastic rheological model is implemented for developing the process model. This model describes deformation process of a sheet in thermoforming process. The results shown in our work not only leads {{to the understanding of the}} cause of these problems, but also enables us to formulate calculation of parameters that affect warpage and wall-thickness variation of polymeric sheets during <b>plug-assist</b> vacuum thermoforming. The gained experimental results confirm our presented model...|$|E
