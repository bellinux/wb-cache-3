5|$|The X-ray {{spectroscopy}} done by Henry Moseley in 1914 {{showed a}} direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge.

5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} <b>place</b> <b>within</b> the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space.

Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E

5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his <b>place</b> <b>within</b> the Christian world.|$|E
5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took <b>place</b> <b>within</b> a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, MTD 1, {{which is}} dated at 13.0 – 14.2  kyr cal BP, can be <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> {{a phase of}} {{decreasing}} δ 18 O values (Fig.  7). The onset of the termination of the last glacial cycle has been dated at ~ 16.5  kyr BP in the Intermediate Pacific (Stern and Lisiecki 2014). Thus, MTD 1 can be <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> Marine Isotope Stage 1 (MIS 1) (Fig.  7). The decreasing trend in δ 18 O values above MTD 1 (from 4.7 to 3.2 ‰) correlates with the trend in δ 18 O values of the Intermediate Pacific (Stern and Lisiecki 2014). Thus, MTD 1 can be <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> the warming trend of MIS 1 (increases in temperature and sea level), and it occurred ~ 2000 – 3000  years after the onset of MIS 1. Similarly, MTDs 2 and 6 can be <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> the warming trends of MIS 9 and 21, respectively. MTD 5 can be <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> the phase of decreasing δ 18 O values of MIS 13, while MTDs 3 and 4 are also <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> an interglacial (MIS 11), albeit not within the transition to heavier δ 18 O values. Although uncertainties of around 10, 000 – 20, 000  years exist, the dating of C 0018 A provides a better constraint on {{the timing of the}} MTD. Furthermore, the use of the isotope stratigraphy illustrates that the MTDs are all <b>placed</b> <b>within</b> odd-numbered marine isotope stages, thus raising the possibility of a climatic influence on the preconditioning of MTD-related slope failures.|$|R

5|$|In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some {{of their}} lost {{popularity}} {{in one of the}} closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's <b>place</b> <b>within</b> Confederation.|$|E
5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took <b>place</b> <b>within</b> the party.

The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E

5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs.

Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or osmosis.
