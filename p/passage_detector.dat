40|$|Real-time {{traffic control}} {{policies}} often need to estimate queue lengths. Since the large installed base of computerized traffic control systems relies {{almost exclusively on}} a [generally sparse] system of loop detectors, estimation of queue length on an approach to a signalized intersection must depend upon "point" measures obtained from a detector. This paper describes a queue length estimation algorithm designed for use with a highly-responsive real-time signal control system. The algorithm requires only a single <b>passage</b> <b>detector,</b> set back from the stop-bar; it utilizes detector counts and occupancy, the kinematic properties of vehicles traveling on a signalized approach {{and knowledge of the}} [varying] signal state. This algorithm was designed to support the new RT/IMPOST on-line real-time control policy which is designed to responsively adjust signal timing to provide optimized service in congested (i. e. oversaturated) traffic environments.

40|$|AbstractAs {{incident}} detection {{on a typical}} busy urban road link or intersection still demands more efficient algorithms, this paper introduces a methodology {{that can be used}} to characterize the various traffic patterns (incident or no incident) using typical link <b>passage</b> <b>detectors.</b> Offline urban incident scenarios are generated using a microscopic simulation model assuming varying traffic link flows, signal green phase and cycle times, link lengths. Similar scenarios are also generated for non-incident cases. Three detectors were assumed on each link to extract traffic measures. Comparative numerical statistical analyses were conducted to identify the traffic measures (such as the average speed and flow) that are likely to be affected by the incidents. And further analysis was conducted to quantify the most probable thresholds to be used in the proposed urban {{incident detection}} model. The proposed model is validated using simulation data. The performance of the proposed model is assessed using dynamic performance indicators such as the success rate of detecting an incident at a specific cycle time, and the false alarm rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} results (done in Phase II) {{demonstrated that}} the SZM strategy was generally beneficial. However, they also revealed that freeway performance degraded by reducing the ramp delays. Therefore, it is desired to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} current SZM control. There are two objectives in this study. One objective is to improve the control logic of current SZM strategy. This is accomplished through an estimation algorithm for the refined minimum release rate. The simulation results indicate that the improved SZM strategy is very effective in postponing and decreasing freeway congestion while resulting in smoother freeway traffic flow compared to the SZM strategy. The second objective of this project is to improve the current queue size estimation. Depending on the counting error of queue and <b>passage</b> <b>detectors,</b> freeway ramps are classified into three different categories, and different methods are applied respectively for improved queue size estimation. The surveillance video data were recorded and used to verify the improvement of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the proposed methods can greatly improve the accuracy of queue size estimation compared with the current methodology. Also, the proposed method was evaluated by the micro-simulation. The simulation results indicate the performance of freeway mainline is significantly improved. And the total system performance is better than the original SZM control. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R

5000|$|The {{sophistication and}} extent of a ramp {{metering}} system {{should be based on}} the amount of improvement desired, existing traffic conditions, installation costs, and the continuing resource requirements that are necessary to operate and maintain the system effectively. The simplest form of control is a fixed time operation. It performs the basic functions of breaking up platoons into single-vehicle entries and setting an upper limit on the flow rates that enter the freeway. Presence and <b>passage</b> <b>detectors</b> may be installed on the ramp to actuate and terminate the metering cycles, but the metering rate is based on average traffic conditions at a particular ramp at a particular time. This type of operation provides the benefits associated with accident reductions, but is not as effective in regulating freeway volumes because there is no input about mainline traffic. Pre-timed control can be implemented on any number of ramps, and is often implemented as an initial operating strategy until individual ramps can be incorporated into a traffic responsive system. The next level of control, traffic responsive, establishes metering rates based on actual freeway conditions. The local traffic responsive approach utilizes detectors and a micro-processor to determine the mainline flow in the immediate vicinity of the ramp and the ramp demand to select an appropriate metering rate. Traffic responsive control also permits ramp metering to be used to help manage demand when incidents occur on the freeway, i.e. reduce the metering rate at ramps upstream of the incident and increase the rate at ramps downstream. System-wide control is a form of traffic responsive control but operates on the basis of total freeway conditions. Centralized computer controlled systems can handle numerous ramps in a traffic responsive scheme and feature multiple control programs and overrides. Control strategies can also be distributed among individual ramps. A significant feature of system control is interconnection that permits the metering rate at any ramp to be influenced by conditions at other locations. Denver showed that this type of control has significant benefits when properly applied.â€™ ...|$|R

40|$|Calibration {{sources for}} the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, such as the ^Cf {{spontaneous}} fission source, may produce 7 -rays {{with a wide range}} of energies. There is a possibility that the ^Cf source will be stored in the deck area above the detector, either directly overhead or off to one side. In either case, it is necessary to know the number of high-energy 7 -rays reaching the DgO from the source, since such photons may disintegrate deuterons (neutral-current background) or produce Compton-scattered electrons (charged-current and elastic-scattering backgrounds). A spectrum (1) of the 7 -rays produced by ^Cfis shown in Figure 1, and a table of the 7 -ray production rates used in later calculations is given in Appendix A. Analytical calculations of the attenuations of 7 -rays produced by a source at the top of the neck of the detector were performed by David Buchan (2) using the detector geometry shown in Figure 2. Only 7 -rays of integral initial energies from 1 to 8 MeV were considered. These calculations were repeated with the air in the neck of the detector replaced by a vacuum to verify that this would be an acceptable approximation in a Monte Carlo simulation. The results of both sets of computations appear in Appendix B. Such analytical calculations yield only the number of 7 -rays of the original energy which survive the <b>passage</b> through the <b>detector.</b> Their results do not include lowerenergy photons which arise from the interactions of the high-energy 7 -rays with the detector materials. To obtain more complete results, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed using the EGS 4 (Electron-Gamma Ray-Shower, version 4) code (3). The geometry chosen to represent the detector is depicted in Figure 3. Gamma-ray showers with integral initial energies were started at the top of the neck of the detector. The original intention was to histogram all 7 -rays with energies greater than or equal to 2 MeV crossing the boundary of the DsO. However, because of the large distances involved, very few 7 -rays survived the <b>passage</b> through the <b>detector.</b> Ln order to cut down on the required computer time, several spherical histogramming shells, concentric with the acrylic vessel, were placed between the vacuum-filled neck and the DaO, and the-^-rc<-...|$|R

By improving the parameter to the extent and incorporating them into the optimization process the output response improved tremendously. The output response is well elaborated {{with the help of the}} minimum BER, Q factor and the various plotting process which practically insists the improvement in the output. employed.

40|$|Dissociative and non-dissociative {{electron}} attachment processes are investigated via electron transfer in collisions between velocity selected Rydberg atoms and target molecules. Measurements of the velocity {{distribution of the}} reaction products and of the decay of product negative ions during <b>passage</b> to the <b>detector</b> provide information about the energetics of the interactions and about the lifetime of the intermediate negative ion formed. Collisions with CBrCl 3 result in a dissociative process producing Br- and Cl- as products. Br- production occurs through two reaction channels. The intermediate negative ion dissociates immediately in one channel, but the second channel involves a long-lived intermediate having a lifetime of âˆ¼ 5 ps. A single reaction channel produces Cl -, but it is uncertain if the process is immediate or if it occurs after a few vibrational periods of the intermediate ion. Non-dissociative {{electron attachment}} occurs with C 7 F 14 and with C 6 F 6.

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{describe}} and evaluate IT support in dementia care {{from the perspectives of}} staff and relatives. More specifically, it was to examine staff membersâ€™ satisfaction with work, life satisfaction and sense of coherence before and after increased IT support, to describe staff membersâ€™ opinions and perceptions of IT support during the process of implementation, to describe relativesâ€™ opinions of IT support and to compare relativesâ€™ perceptions of their irritations with care and life satisfaction before and after increased IT support. In addition, three questionnaires were further developed and tested among staff working in elderly care, and then used in the staff evaluation. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with baseline assessments and follow-ups and experimental and control groups was used in two studies to investigate the outcomes of IT support. A descriptive design was used to study staff views on IT support, and a correlative design was used in the methodological study. Participants were 33 staff members and 22 relatives in the evaluation, 14 staff members in the descriptive study and 299 staff members in the methodological study. Data collection methods were questionnaires and group interviews. The IT support consisted of passive <b>passage</b> alarms, fall <b>detectors,</b> sensor-activated night-time illumination of the lavatory, movement detectors, email communication, an Internet website and additional computers. Findings and conclusions: Staff job satisfaction and perceived quality of care increased in the experimental group. The relatives were generally positive about the IT support, and the experimental group showed a decrease in practical/logistical irritations. Staff described â€˜moving from fear of losing control to perceived increase in control and securityâ€™ and â€˜constant struggling with insufficient/deficient systemsâ€™. Conclusions are that IT support can be a resource in dementia care as perceived by caregivers if IT support is incorporated into the care system...|$|R
