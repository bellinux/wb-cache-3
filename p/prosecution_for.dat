5|$|Following the war, Pickett feared <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> his {{execution}} of deserters and temporarily fled to Canada. He returned to Virginia in 1866, {{where he died}} at age 50 in 1875. Legend says that after the war he remained bitter and dwelt extensively upon {{the loss of his}} men at Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises {{himself with}} a beard and monocle and assumes a new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1970. Called The Pendulum Years, its subtitle, Britain and the Sixties, summed up its subject. In 22 self-contained chapters, Levin considered various aspects of British life during the decade. Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson – dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin – and {{institutions such as the}} monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events examined in the book were the 1968 student riots and the <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{some local}} {{officials}} encourage vagrants {{to move away}} instead of arresting them.

5|$|Morales' {{government}} also introduced measures to tackle Bolivia's endemic corruption; in 2007, {{he used a}} presidential decree to create the Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight Against Corruption. However, critics highlighted that MAS members were rarely prosecuted for the crime, the main exception being YPFB head Santos Ramírez, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment for corruption in 2008. Conversely, a 2009 law that permitted the retroactive <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> corruption led to legal cases being brought against a number of opposition politicians for alleged corruption in the pre-Morales period; many fled abroad to avoid standing trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982. Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29. Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched.|$|E

5|$|On 15 April 1945, the Nazi {{governor}} (Reichskommissar) of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, {{offered to}} open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease {{the suffering of the}} civilian population. Smith and Strong, representing SHAEF, along with Major General Ivan Susloparov representing the Soviet Union, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld representing the Dutch government, and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group, met with Seyss-Inquart in the Dutch village of Achterveld on 30 April. After threatening Seyss-Inquart with <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the suffering Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country, and he opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands, to the First Canadian Army, that did follow on the 5th of May.|$|E
5|$|The Tippett family {{originated}} in Cornwall. Michael Tippett's grandfather, George Tippett, left the county in 1854 {{to make his}} fortune in London through property speculation and other business schemes. A flamboyant character, he had a strong tenor voice that was a popular feature at Christian revivalist meetings. In later life his business enterprises faltered, leading to debts, <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> fraud, and a term of imprisonment. His son Henry, born in 1858, was Michael's father. A lawyer by training, he was successful in business and was independently wealthy {{by the time of}} his marriage in April 1903. Unusually for his background and upbringing, Henry Tippett was a progressive liberal and a religious sceptic.|$|E
5|$|The {{ban on the}} NSDAP {{was lifted}} in early 1928, {{in time for the}} Reichstag elections, held on 20 May. Results were poor, with the NSDAP losing nearly 100,000 voters and earning only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they {{attained}} only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of twelve NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag. This gave him immunity from <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß. The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in Der Angriff {{over the course of the}} previous year.|$|E

5|$|The carnival's backstory {{begins at}} the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a Russian aristocrat from Minsk and officer in the Tsar's army, became aware of his Avataric powers. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two {{children}} to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in Lemberg in 1914, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped circus bear feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose an arm and both legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Bačka and Baranja lasted until 1944. Fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate {{peace with the}} Allies, Hitler launched Operation Margarethe I on 15 March 1944, and ordered German troops to occupy Hungary. In the meantime, some of those that had escaped <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> the 1942 massacres had joined various German military and police organisations. Feketehalmy-Czeydner had become the highest-ranking foreign officer in the Allgemeine SS, being promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer (lieutenant general). Grassy became a SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS (major general) and was appointed to command the 25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Hunyadi (1st Hungarian), and Zöldi joined the Gestapo. The case against them was re-opened after the German occupation, and in this second trial they were all found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed {{it off with a}} humorous comment.|$|E

5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from <b>prosecution</b> <b>for</b> any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E
