5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a <b>pheromone</b> to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation <b>pheromone.</b> The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. <b>Pheromone</b> traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. <b>Pheromone</b> traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using <b>pheromone</b> traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|Some beetles have {{intricate}} mating behaviour. <b>Pheromone</b> {{communication is}} often important in locating a mate.|$|E
50|$|Sex <b>pheromones</b> are <b>pheromones</b> {{released}} by an organism to attract an individual {{of the opposite}} sex, encourage them to mate with them, or perform some other function closely related with sexual reproduction.Sex <b>pheromones</b> specifically focus on indicating females for breeding, attracting the opposite sex, and conveying information on their species, age, sex and genotype after emitted by males. Volatile <b>pheromones</b> are characterized as sex <b>pheromones</b> or defensive <b>pheromones</b> and usually form a specific odor and are focused on alarm sensitivity. Non-volatile <b>pheromones,</b> or cuticular contact <b>pheromones,</b> are {{more closely related to}} social insects as they are usually detected by direct contact with chemoreceptors on specific parts of insects (i.e. antennae, feet).|$|R
50|$|Chemicals {{are often}} emitted from the bees via the cephalic labial gland, called <b>pheromones.</b> B. lapidarius <b>pheromones</b> are {{believed}} to be “precopulatory signals”, or are used in an attempt to attract mates. These secreted signals are species-specific. These <b>pheromones</b> are often copied by cuckoo species, described in further detail in the parasite subsection. Queen red-tailed bumblebees also appear to secrete <b>pheromones.</b> Functionally, these <b>pheromones</b> appear to inhibit ovarian development in worker bees. Although it is still unclear what the true function of the queen’s <b>pheromones</b> are, the <b>pheromones</b> that are secreted are chemically quite different than those of the workers.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{certainly}} not all insect <b>pheromones</b> have been discovered, many are known {{and many more}} are discovered every year. Some sites curate large lists of insect <b>pheromones.</b> [...] <b>Pheromones</b> are frequently used to monitor and control lepidopteran and coleopteran species, with many available commercially. Some insects for which <b>pheromones</b> are available include: ...|$|R
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating <b>pheromone.</b> If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a <b>pheromone.</b> The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a <b>pheromone</b> detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any <b>pheromone</b> produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|Alan Tudyk had {{the idea}} for an episode about a planet that is always day on one side, and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of <b>pheromone</b> on himself and the crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased {{back to the ship}} by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to {{domesticate}} the dogs.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} {{disputes}} about the {{mechanisms by which}} <b>pheromones</b> function, {{there is evidence that}} <b>pheromones</b> do affect humans. Despite this evidence, it has not been conclusively shown that humans have functional <b>pheromones.</b> Those experiments suggesting that certain <b>pheromones</b> {{have a positive effect on}} humans are countered by others indicating they have no effect whatsoever.|$|R
25|$|Gynes {{and other}} female wasps have mate {{recognition}} signals, or <b>pheromones,</b> within their venom, thorax and heads. This causes males to {{be attracted to}} them. The <b>pheromones</b> within the venom {{seem to be very}} strong compared to <b>pheromones</b> from the thorax and head. These <b>pheromones</b> are often spread all over the body during grooming, further increasing the females' attractiveness to males.|$|R
50|$|Cat <b>pheromones</b> are <b>pheromones</b> {{that are}} used by cats and other felids for cat communication.|$|R
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down <b>pheromone</b> trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, <b>pheromone,</b> plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a <b>pheromone</b> that mimics the sex {{attractant}} of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
25|$|After the {{discovery}} of <b>pheromones</b> in 1959, alarm <b>pheromones</b> were first described in 1968 in ants and earthworms, and 4 years later also found in mammals, both mice and rats. Over {{the next two decades}} identification and characterization of these <b>pheromones</b> proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals, including fish, {{but it was not until}} 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm <b>pheromones</b> was gleaned.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pheromones</b> {{are also}} {{utilized}} by bee and wasp species. Some <b>pheromones</b> {{can also be}} used to suppress the sexual behavior of other individuals allowing for a reproductive monopoly - the wasp R. marginata uses this. With regard to the Bombus hyperboreus species, males, otherwise known as drones, patrol circuits of scent marks (<b>pheromones)</b> to find queens. In paraticular, <b>pheromones</b> for the Bombus hyperboreus, include octadecenol, 2,3-dihydro-6-transfarnesol, citronellol, and geranylcitronellol.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Dendroctonus brevicomis was {{attracted}} to a mixture of the Ipsparaconfusus <b>pheromones,</b> ipsenol, cis-verbenol, and ipsdienol at 10 - 9 g each/#l but was not attracted to these <b>pheromones</b> at higher and lower release rates. L paraconfusus was not attracted to the D. brevicomis <b>pheromones</b> exo-brevicomin, frontalin, and myrcene at any release rate tested. Increased release rates of a mixture of the three <b>pheromones</b> of L paraconfusus inhibited the attraction of D. brevicomis to its synthetic <b>pheromones.</b> A mixture of ipsenol + ipsdienol or cis-verbenol alone failed to cause inhibition indicating {{that at least two}} of the L paraconfusus <b>pheromones</b> are required to inhibit the response of D. brevicomis. The <b>pheromones</b> of D. brevicomis did not inhibit the attraction of L paraconfusus to its pheromones; however, verbenone was a potent inhibitor.

5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female <b>pheromone</b> and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive <b>pheromone</b> blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a <b>pheromone.</b> The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|The life {{habits of}} Ypresiomyrma {{would have been}} {{similar to that of}} extant Myrmeciinae ants. Colonies nested in the soil or in trees, making them an {{arboreal}} nesting species. Workers were most likely solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto low vegetation and trees while preying on arthropods or consuming nectar. Workers most likely did not recruit or lead nestmates to food sources, nor did workers lay down <b>pheromone</b> trails. Ypresiomyrma ants most likely used their large eyes to find prey and for navigational purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>pheromones</b> of click beetles was {{started with the}} {{objective}} of applying similar methods in IPM strategies for the control of wireworms, based on the similar experience gained from the widely used moth <b>pheromones.</b> A brief overview is presented on the identification of click beetle <b>pheromones,</b> new questions arising in the categorization of these <b>pheromones</b> into sex or aggregation <b>pheromones,</b> options for the development of female-targeted lures, and application perspectives. The implementation of IPM strategies against wireworms, the larvae of click beetles (Coleoptera, Elateridae), has been very difficult because of the time- and energyconsuming detection and development of monitoring methods. It was reasonable to believe that—similar to Lepidoptera—if <b>pheromones</b> of click beetles became known, they could assist in the development of simple and easy-to-use tools and methods for this purpose. The present article reviews the results of research on <b>pheromones</b> and other attractants of click beetles...|$|R
50|$|Salamanders also exhibit sexual {{roles of}} <b>pheromones</b> and their {{interactions}} with hormones where males of salamanders of the Plethodontidae family deliver <b>pheromones</b> through their chin gland {{in order to increase}} the female receptivity and mate choice (Rajchard, 2005). This pheromonal activity is said to be just as effective as the conspecific <b>pheromones</b> associated with moths and their receptivity to the <b>pheromones</b> released. Not only is female receptivity increased but male courtship success is also increased as in terrestrial salamanders where the <b>pheromones</b> are received by the accessory olfactory system, known for detecting <b>pheromones</b> (Rajchard, 2005). Salamanders can also distinguish between chemical cues of their own and of their surroundings therefore they are able to differentiate between mates and creatures within their environment (Waldman, 2004).|$|R
40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{aggregation}} <b>pheromones</b> {{has been}} reported for hundreds of nonsocial arthropod species, the evolutionary ecological aspects of this behavior have received little attention. Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on {{costs and benefits of}} aggregation <b>pheromones</b> are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation <b>pheromones</b> are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation <b>pheromones,</b> and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation <b>pheromones.</b> We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation <b>pheromones</b> with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of <b>pheromones</b> can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.

5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the <b>pheromone</b> molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests {{is a cause}} for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave <b>pheromone</b> trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for <b>pheromone</b> production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
50|$|Humans fear <b>pheromones</b> {{because we}} believe we have gone above the basic {{secretion}} of chemicals in our communication. However, {{there are signs that}} point to humans relying on <b>pheromones</b> as well as our most technological forms of communication. Thomas shows <b>pheromones</b> in the animal world with examples of moths and fish. He then goes on to explain what impact <b>pheromones</b> in humans could have on the future such as in the perfume industry and finding histocompatible donors.|$|R

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay <b>pheromone</b> trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down <b>pheromone</b> trails.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual <b>pheromone</b> wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pheromones</b> are species-specific {{chemical}} cues. When released, <b>pheromones</b> can strongly {{influence the}} behavior and physiology of other organisms of the same species. Because <b>pheromones</b> are largely species-specific, and because they often elicit strong behavioral responses, scientists and managers have used <b>pheromones</b> to lure and trap an array of species. This method has been particularly exploited in insect populations. This method {{has been used to}} capture and control species such as sugarcane weevils, gypsy moths, invasive oriental fruit flies, bark beetles, and Carpophilus spp.|$|R
40|$|Overexpression of the UAS-tra {{transgene}} in Drosophila melanogaster females led to {{the complete}} elimination of their cuticular <b>pheromones.</b> According to current models of Drosophila behavior, these flies should induce no courtship. In fact, they are still attractive to conspecific males. Three classes of stimuli are shown to induce courtship, with different effects on male behavior: (i) known <b>pheromones</b> produced by control females, (ii) stimuli produced by living control and transgenic flies, and (iii) as-yet-undetermined <b>pheromones</b> present on both control and transgenic flies. Only the latter class of <b>pheromones</b> are required for mating. They appear to represent a layer of ancestral attractive substances present in D. melanogaster and its sibling species; known cuticular <b>pheromones</b> modulate this attractivity positively or negatively. The absence of inhibitory <b>pheromones</b> leads {{to high levels of}} interspecific mating, suggesting an important role for these cuticular hydrocarbons in isolation between species...|$|R
50|$|House mice also rely on <b>pheromones</b> {{for social}} communication, {{some of which}} are {{produced}} by the preputial glands of both sexes.
