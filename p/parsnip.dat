5|$|Despite {{the slight}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} two, wild <b>parsnip</b> is the same taxon as the cultivated version, and the two readily cross-pollinate. <b>Parsnip</b> has a chromosome number of 2n=22.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild <b>parsnip</b> (Pastinaca sativa), and water <b>parsnip</b> (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water <b>parsnip</b> and water hemlock include the water <b>parsnip</b> having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water <b>parsnip</b> lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water <b>parsnip</b> has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parsnip</b> {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some {{lepidopteran}} species, including the <b>parsnip</b> swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the common swift moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the <b>parsnip</b> moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>parsnips</b> has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in <b>parsnips</b> is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of <b>parsnips</b> {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|R

5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, <b>parsnip</b> yellow fleck virus, <b>parsnip</b> leafcurl virus, <b>parsnip</b> mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of {{the areas of the}} leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of ochre mosaic spots, and crinkling of the leaves in infected plants.|$|E
5|$|A typical 100-g <b>parsnip</b> {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most <b>parsnip</b> cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The <b>parsnip</b> {{is rich in}} vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E
5|$|The toxic {{properties}} of <b>parsnip</b> extracts {{are resistant to}} heating, or a storage period of several months. Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where their skin is exposed. Polyynes {{can be found in}} Apiaceae vegetables such as <b>parsnip,</b> and they show cytotoxic activities.|$|E

5|$|Other species {{names such}} as Cicuta bolanderi, Cicuta californica, and Cicuta curtissii are older names now {{recognized}} to be varieties of the widespread, morphologically variable Cicuta maculata. Cicuta maculata is now recognized to have four varieties: var. maculata, var. augustifolia, var. victorinii, and var. bolanderi. Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that C.bulbifera and C.virosa are monophyletic, while C.douglasii may not be. It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species. Other common names for the genus in general include poison <b>parsnip,</b> beaver poison, wild carrot, wild <b>parsnip,</b> and false parsley.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{radishes}} can {{be categorized}} into four main types according to the seasons when they are grown {{and a variety of}} shapes lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow radishes, with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a <b>parsnip.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{parsnips}} {{were believed}} to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they are fed to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Chinese <b>parsnip</b> is used as an herbal medicine ingredient.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to find the}} determination of achenes wild and cultivated forms of carrot plant (Daucus carota) and cultural forms of wild <b>parsnips</b> (Pastinaca sativa) out. Collection of achenes was performed at the habitat Sedlec near Mikulov, collection of cultivars was carried out on experimental fields in Lednice in the years 2013 and 2015. Analytical germination tests were made in germinating cupboards in the laboratory of a seed company. It has been found that achenes cultural types of carrots and <b>parsnips</b> are due to growing conditions significantly higher germination. Furthermore, the comparing the years 2013 and 2015 revealed a high probability of adaptability landraces <b>parsnips</b> and carrots to abiotic stress (drought and high temperatures) ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Parsnip</b> {{leaves are}} {{sometimes}} tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} surfaces of the leaves. The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means.|$|E
5|$|The wild <b>parsnip</b> {{from which}} the modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. <b>Parsnip</b> seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
5|$|While {{the root}} of the <b>parsnip</b> is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the <b>parsnip</b> contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E

5|$|The <b>parsnip</b> {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related <b>parsnip.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>parsnip</b> (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E

5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water <b>parsnip</b> (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
25|$|The river {{had been}} {{partially}} explored by John Finlay, {{a colleague of}} Alexander Mackenzie, in 1797. In 1793, Mackenzie had ascended the Peace River {{to the point where}} it is formed by the Finlay flowing from the north, and the <b>Parsnip</b> River from the south. Mackenzie had taken the <b>Parsnip,</b> and from there completed a complicated route to the Pacific Ocean. It is thought that Finlay may have decided to probe the northern branch of the Peace in order to determine if it afforded a better route to the Pacific than the one taken by Mackenzie. Nonetheless, it would appear from the information Black had that Finlay had only made it as far as the Ingenika River, about 130km north of the Finlay River's confluence with the <b>Parsnip</b> (where the Peace begins).|$|E
