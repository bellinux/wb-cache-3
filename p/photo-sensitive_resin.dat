40|$|Direct laser {{writing is}} a {{powerful}} nonlinear fabrication technique that provides high intensities in the focal plane of a sample to engineer multidimensional structures with submicron feature sizes. Dielectrically and optically anisotropic soft matter {{is of particular interest}} when considering a host medium in which exotic topological characteristics may be generated. In this manuscript, we adopt a novel approach for direct laser writing of polymeric structures, whereby the <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>resin</b> is liquid crystalline (LC) and aligned within electrically addressable LC devices. We show that the laser written polymer structures retain the optical properties of the liquid crystal resin at the point of laser exposure. Thus, birefringent polymer structures can be written, with the orientation of the optic axis tuned during fabrication through switching the liquid crystal with an applied electric field. This gives the potential to create complex spatial variations of the polymer refractive index on a micron scale. Furthermore, we present a range of structures for controlling the liquid crystal alignment in devices, including two-dimensional arrays of polymer pillars, a polymer checkerboard that creates a controllable disclination network, and 3 -dimensional helical polymer ribbons and knots. This work introduces a new degree of freedom for the direct laser writing of advanced photonic materials as well as offering significant advances for the control of soft matter...|$|E
30|$|The {{choice of}} <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>resins</b> {{available}} in commercial markets is limited, and most resins are toxic to cells.|$|R
30|$|Nonetheless, {{the use of}} {{photo-sensitive}} {{material is}} primarily considered a limitation of this process. Another disadvantage {{of this process is}} associated with the shrinkage of the polymer due to polymerisation. Toxicity such as skin irritation and cytotoxicity caused by <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>resins</b> also appears to be a major problem. Most recently, resins based on vinyl esters, an alternative resin that possesses better biocompatibility in vivo, have been explored (Heller et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} are intensively investigated {{due to their}} wide range of {{physical and chemical properties}} which result in a large variety of applications. From an industrial point of view, emphasis has not only to be on materials performance and on control of their properties, but also on cost reduction either for the materials, the processes, or for both. Materials are searched for which enable different processing technologies, feature sizes and shapes as well as an integration up to a centimeter scale. The combination of low-cost materials with tunable material parameters such as low optical absorption, tunable refractive index, good processability as well as high chemical, thermal and mechanical stability, is very attractive for integrated optical applications. A particular class of low-cost nanoscale materials which fulfills these requirements is the class of inorganic-organic hybrid polymers (ORMOCERÂ®s 1) which are synthesized by catalytically controlled hy drolysis/ polycondensation reactions, resulting in storage-stable, <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>resins.</b> The material properties, for example refractive index or optical absorption, can be widely varied by choice of alkoxysilane precursors or synthesis conditions such as catalysts or solvents. In addition, the material properties can also be significantly influenced by the technological processing conditions. For example, the degree of organic cross-linking can be adjusted by variation of UV initiator kind and concentration, or by various exposure doses. This, consequently, is directly correlated to the refractive index. The impact of processing conditions on the refractive index was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy and refractive index measurements. The refractive indices are correlated to the material's degree of organic cross-linking, and application examples will be given...|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} {{graphic representation}} of the projected teeth movements, created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided {{to the doctor and}} patient for approval or modification before aligners are manufactured. The aligners are modeled using CAD-CAM (computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the aligners are built in layers using a <b>photo-sensitive</b> liquid <b>resin</b> that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The aligners are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the aligner's position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. More attachments can make the aligners less aesthetically pleasing. Reproximation, (also called interproximal reduction or IPR and colloquially, filing or drilling), is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit.|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} of 3 D printing is conquering {{the world and}} awakens the interest of many users in the most varying of applications. New formulation approaches for <b>photo-sensitive</b> thiol-ene <b>resins</b> in combination with various printing technologies, like stereolithography (SLA), projection based printing/digital light processing (DLP) or two-photon polymerization (TPP) are presented. Thiol-ene polymerizations are known for its fast and quantitative reaction and to form highly homogeneous polymer networks. As the resins are locally and temporally photo-curable the polymerization type is very promising for 3 D-printing. By using suitable wavelengths, photoinitiator-free fabrication is feasible for single- and two photon induced polymerization. In this paper divinyl ethers of polyethylene glycols in combination with star-shaped tetrathiols were used to design a simple test-system for photo-curable thiol-ene resins. In order to control and improve curing depth and lateral resolution in 3 D-polymerization processes, either additives in chemical formulation or process parameters can be changed. The achieved curing depth and resolution limits depend on the applied fabrication method. While two-/multiphoton induced lithography offers the possibility of micron- to sub-micron resolution it lacks in built-up speed. Hence single- photon polymerization is a fast alternative with optimization potential in sub- 10 -micron resolution. Absorber- and initiator free compositions were developed {{in order to avoid}} aging, yellowing and toxicity of resulting products. They can be cured with UV-laser radiation below 300 nm. The development at Fraunhofer ILT is focusing on new applications in the field of medical products and implants, technical products with respect to mechanical properties or optical properties of 3 D-printed objects. Recent process results with model system (polyethylene glycol divinylether/Pentaerithrytol tetrakis (3 -mercaptopropionat), Raman measurements of polymer conversion and surface modifications using bifunctional crosslinkers are presented with advantages, drawbacks and a general outlook...|$|R
