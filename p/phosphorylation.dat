5|$|Oxidative <b>phosphorylation</b> (or OXPHOS in short) is the {{metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative <b>phosphorylation.</b> This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{released}} by oxidative <b>phosphorylation</b> is high, compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation. Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative <b>phosphorylation</b> of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.|$|E
5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative <b>phosphorylation</b> is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative <b>phosphorylation</b> can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E

25|$|During the {{transcription}} cycle, the CTD {{of the large}} subunit of RNAP II is reversibly phosphorylated. RNAP II containing unphosphorylated CTD is recruited to the promoter, whereas the hyperphosphorylated CTD form is involved in active transcription. <b>Phosphorylation</b> occurs at two sites within the heptapeptide repeat, at Serine 5 and Serine 2.

25|$|Protein <b>phosphorylation</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in {{biological}} functions and controls nearly every cellular process, including metabolism, gene transcription and translation, cell-cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement, protein-protein interactions, protein stability, cell movement, and apoptosis. These processes depend on the highly regulated and opposing actions of PKs and PPs, through changes in the <b>phosphorylation</b> of key proteins.

25|$|The CTD {{consists}} of repetitions of an amino acid motif, YSPTSPS, of which Serines and Threonines can be phosphorylated.

40|$|The {{induction}} of M {{phase in}} eukaryotic cell cycles requires robust activation of Cdc 2 /cyclin B by Cdc 25, which itself is robustly activated by serine/threonine <b>phosphorylations.</b> Although multiple protein kinases that directly activate Cdc 25 C have been identified, whether {{the combination of}} different primary <b>phosphorylations</b> of Cdc 25 C is sufficient to fully activate Cdc 25 C has not been determined.

In this study, we demonstrate that this missing kinase is RSK 2, which phosphorylates three sites in Cdc 25 C and also partially activates Cdc 25 C. However, the <b>phosphorylations</b> catalyzed by MAPK, Cdc 2, and RSK 2 fail to fully activate Cdc 25 C, suggesting that additional biochemical events are required to fully activate this key cell cycle regulator...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of Kangxianling Decoction (KXLD), a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA and <b>phosphorylations</b> of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and p 38 in renal tissue of rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Methods: Eighteen male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham-operated group, untreated group and KXLD-treated group. A rat model of renal interstitial fibrosis was established by UUO. Rats with UUO were sacrificed after intragastric administration of KXLD for 14 days, and the parameters such as serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and hydroxyproline in the kidney of rats in 3 groups were analyzed. The expression of HGF mRNA in kidney tissue was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expressions of c-Met protein, ERK 1 / 2 protein, p 38 protein and the <b>phosphorylations</b> of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 were determined by Western blotting method. Results: The levels of SCr, BUN and hydroxyproline in the untreated group were significantly increased as compared {{with those in the}} sham-operated group (P< 0. 05). The expression of HGF mRNA in the untreated group was significantly down-regulated. The expression of c-Met protein and the <b>phosphorylations</b> of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 in the kidney tissue of rats with UUO in the untreated group were significantly up-regulated. After intervention with KXLD, the <b>phosphorylations</b> of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 were all significantly inhibited except for c-Met expression. The HGF mRNA was increased in KXLD-treated group. Conclusion: KXLD can decrease the level of collagen in the obstructed kidney of rats with UUO and alleviate the renal interstitial fibrosis in rats with UUO through enhancing the HGF mRNA expression and inhibiting the <b>phosphorylations</b> of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38...|$|R

25|$|Activity {{of these}} HDACs can be {{affected}} by <b>phosphorylation.</b> An increased amount of <b>phosphorylation</b> (hyperphosphorylation) leads to increased deacetylase activity, but degrades complex formation between HDACs 1 and 2 and between HDAC1 and mSin3A/YY1. A lower than normal amount of <b>phosphorylation</b> (hypophosphorylation) leads to {{a decrease in the}} amount of deacetylase activity, but increases the amount of complex formation. Mutation studies found that major <b>phosphorylation</b> happens at residues Ser421 and Ser423. Indeed, when these residues were mutated, a drastic reduction was seen in the amount of deacetylation activity. This difference in the state of <b>phosphorylation</b> is a way of keeping an optimal level of <b>phosphorylation</b> to ensure there is no over or under expression of deacetylation. HDACs 1 and 2 have been found only exclusively in the nucleus. In HDAC1 knockout (KO) mice, mice were found to die during embryogenesis and showed a drastic reduction in the production but increased expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors (CDKIs) p21 and p27. Not even upregulation of the other Class I HDACs could compensate for the loss of HDAC1. This inability to recover from HDAC1 KO leads researchers to believe that there are both functional uniqueness to each HDAC as well as regulatory cross-talk between factors.|$|E

40|$|The same {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} (RTK) can mediate strikingly different biological responses in a fibroblast {{as opposed to a}} neuron. We have compared the rapidly induced tyrosine <b>phosphorylations</b> mediated by various RTKs in both NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and in the PC 12 neuronal precursor cell line and found that each RTK induces a distinct pattern of protein tyrosine <b>phosphorylations</b> in the two cell types. These findings are consistent with a model in which various cell types present a given RTK with different menus of signal transduction components, allowing the same RTK to elicit fundamentally distinct biological responses. Although there are obvious overlaps in the tyrosine <b>phosphorylations</b> induced by different RTKs in the same cell, there are also clear differences. The attempt to dissect these differences revealed that the kinase inhibitors K- 252 a and staurosporine inhibit RTK autophosphorylation and thus the biological consequences of receptor/ligand interaction. These inhibitors displayed substantially greater specificity for a subset of RTKs (including the neurotrophin receptors) than for other RTKs and acted as remarkably selective blockers of neurotrophin action in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells.

We performed an unbiased quantitative analysis of early SAH-induced <b>phosphorylations</b> in cerebral arteries and evaluated identified signaling components as targets for prevention of delayed vasculopathy and ischemia. Labeled phosphopeptides from rat cerebral arteries were quantified by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Selected SAH-induced <b>phosphorylations</b> were validated by immunoblotting and monitored over a 24 -hour time course post SAH. Moreover, inhibition of key phosphoproteins was performed.

In this study we demonstrated that proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs) was enhanced on hydrogels with high stiffness (HSG, 21. 5 kPa) in comparison to those with low stiffness (LSG, 1. 72 kPa). ECs on HSG showed markedly prominent stress fibers and a higher RhoA activity than ECs on LSG. Blockade of RhoA attenuated stress fiber formation and proliferation of ECs on HSG, but {{had little effect on}} ECs on LSG; enhancement of RhoA had opposite effects. The <b>phosphorylations</b> of Src and Vav 2, which are positive RhoA upstream effectors, were higher in ECs on HSG.

The inhibition of SEPT 9 increased RhoA activation, Src/Vav 2 <b>phosphorylations,</b> and EC proliferation on LSG, but showed minor effects on ECs on HSG. We further demonstrated that the inactivation of integrin avb 3 caused an increase of SEPT 9 expression in ECs on HSG to attenuate Src/Vav 2 <b>phosphorylations</b> and inhibit RhoA-dependent EC proliferation.
