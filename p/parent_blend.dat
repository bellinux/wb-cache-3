40|$|This article {{offers a}} sociological {{analysis}} of how different lower-middle income families engage with Australian government health policies and promotion campaigns {{aimed at reducing}} the risk of lifestyle disease (eat well, be active). Bringing together sociological literature across the domains of leisure, family, health and risk we identify tensions between the purposes of health promotion and purposive family leisure. Findings are presented from a qualitative study conducted with 21 adults and children in four families (nuclear, same-sex, single <b>parent,</b> <b>blended)</b> which identify discursive constructions of family leisure time, health and risk. Three key themes were identified within the family leisure repertories that included, tensions between purposive health and leisure goals, the importance of emotional relationships and the calculation of risk and benefit. The effect of class, gender and sexuality was also evident in different family constructions of leisure meanings, opportunity and ability to respond to the individualised responsibility inherent in healthy lifestyle policy. Our critical engagement with healthy lifestyle discourses opens up a range of issues for leisure research, policy and provision that embraces a more complex understanding of the social forces shaping family wellbeing.

40|$|Purpose The authors {{note the}} growing {{significance}} of different family {{types in the}} West and explore {{the relationship between the}} complexity of family relationships typified in single <b>parent,</b> <b>blended</b> and intact families and the involvement of children in purchase decisions. Originality Whilst social trends indicate that the composition of the family will continue to change, little research has been conducted on the impact of changing family structures on consumption behaviour. Methodology The quantitative research is a development based on earlier qualitative research on the three family types and large scale piloting of the questionnaire. Sampling A random sample of mothers with children aged 10 - 16 were contacted from the TNS Postal Access Panel. Questionnaires were only used where there were responses from both the mother and child. 524 fully completed questionnaires were used for the analysis. Findings The analysis supports the idea that where familial relationships are simpler such as in single parent homes (fewer relationships) then the involvement of the child is greater and in more complex relationships such as in blended homes (where there are step-parents and step children present) a child’s involvement may be less marked. Exceptions to the “rule” are discussed as are the theoretical and practical implications...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT) If {{there is}} a single song in which nations, governments, human rights organizations, communities, and <b>parents</b> harmoniously <b>blend</b> their voices, it is that being literate is {{valuable}} and valued. Being literate entails one's access to and interaction with text in one’s environment (Harris & Hodges, 1995). However, in developing countries, print is hard to come by due to several factors. What is of significance, though, is that despite the absence of readily available print environments that are prevalent in the developed world, one still sees highly literate persons emerging from poor developing countries. This study sought to investigate how those who become literate achieve literacy despite growing up in places where print is not readily available. It was a search for factors that supported and enabled the participants to become literate persons. This investigation searched for an answer to the umbrella question: What are the conditions that promote literacy development in a print-limited environment? In order to answer this question, six postgraduate degree holding Malawian teacher educators were interviewed.

Five sample books from each era {{were randomly selected from}} the collection of children's literature books from one major university, two colleges, and three public libraries, and each book was examined for content and illustrations. Data on how the family was portrayed were compared to establish trends. The results indicate that over this period of time, the family has moved from a traditional lifestyle to a variety of lifestyles. The types of families portrayed in the literature include divorce or single <b>parent</b> homes, <b>blended</b> families, ethnic families, same-sex families, and extended families. Some issues families are facing include AIDS (cause and effect), inner-city housing, and death of a family member or friend.

It is clear by now to all sociologists that in the western society children’s birth and care are less and less jointed to the concept of “one father, one mother, and one hearth”. Today we make children by ourselves, or by two (but not always a man and a woman), or even by three or four, if adding to the intentional parents also the donors’ and/or the surrogate mothers’ participations, or if considering adoptive children conceived by others, but only parented by the intentional <b>parents,</b> etc. Among <b>blended</b> families, co-parented families, single mothers parenting their children with help from some friends, or sisters, or mothers, or grandparents of theirs, the arrangements of families, and of children’s attachments, are just unlimited.

60|$|Independently of fertility, the {{character}} of the offspring from a cross has sometimes been thought to afford evidence whether the parent-forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties; but after carefully studying the evidence, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that no general rules of this kind can be trusted. Thus with mankind the offspring of distinct races resemble in all respects the offspring of true species and of varieties. This is shewn, for instance, by the manner in which {{the character}}s of both <b>parents</b> are <b>blended,</b> and by one form absorbing another through repeated crosses. In this latter case the progeny both of crossed species and varieties retain for a long period a tendency to revert to their ancestors, especially to that one which is prepotent in transmission. When any character has suddenly appeared in a race or species as the result of a single act of variation, as is general with monstrosities,[295] and this race is crossed with another not thus characterised, the characters in question do not commonly appear in a blended condition in the young, but are transmitted to them either perfectly developed or not at all. As with the crossed races of man cases of this kind rarely or never occur, this may be used as an argument against the view suggested by some ethnologists, namely that certain characters, for instance the blackness of the negro, first appeared as a sudden variation or sport. Had this occurred, it is probable that mulattoes would often have been born, either completely black or completely white.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} contributions. First, {{it adds to}} the growing {{literature}} describing correlations between children's educational outcomes and family structure. Although popular discussions focus on the distinction between two parent families and single parent families, McLanahan and Sandefur [1994] show that outcomes for stepchildren are {{essentially the same as}} outcomes for children in single parent families. McLanahan and Sandefur describe their results as showing that the crucial distinction is between children who were reared by both biological parents and children who were not. This description is misleading. This paper shows that outcomes for stepchildren in blended families are essentially the same as outcomes for their half-siblings who are the biological children of both parents. We conclude that, as a description of the data, the crucial distinction is between children who grow up in what the Census Bureau calls "traditional nuclear families" and children who grow up in other family structures (i. e., single <b>parent</b> families; <b>blended</b> families). The second contribution is to clarify the meaning of the question, "What is the effect of family structure on outcomes for children?" Interpreted literally, questions about family structure ask about the effect of one endogenous variable on another. The paper argues for reformulating the family structure question by specifying an explicit counterfactual, and that policy-relevant counterfactuals are most interesting. As an example, the paper proposes considering the effect of reducing the "marriage penalties" in the tax system, penalties that make the earned-income tax credit (EITC) essentially unavailable to two-earner couples. This explicit counterfactual focuses attention on the effects of removing the marriage penalt [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} reported diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) -phenyl copolymer is modified by adding methoxy or octyloxy side chains on the phenyl spacer. The influence of these alkoxy substitutions on the physical, opto-electronic properties, and photovoltaic performance were investigated.

Surprisingly, methoxy substitution on the benzene spacer resulted in higher melting and crystallization temperatures in the synthesized oligomers. This trend is not observed in the polymers, where the improved interactions are most likely counteracted by the larger conformational possibilities in the polymer chain upon alkoxy substitution. The best photovoltaic performance was obtained for the <b>parent</b> polymer: fullerene <b>blends</b> whereas the modifications on the other two polymers result in reduced open-circuit voltage and varying current densities under similar processing conditions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Utilizing a {{qualitative}} approach, exit {{interviews were conducted}} with eight foster mothers who participated in a parent education program called Listening to Children (LTC). LTC is unique in that it mirrors the strengths of predominant models of parent education but is based on a unique set of philosophical and methodological underpinnings that <b>blend</b> <b>parent</b> education and parent support groups. Analysis of the interviews yielded insight into what participants learned during the H 20 intervention, how it affected their foster parenting, whether the LTC program was unique, and if so, in what ways. Results suggest that foster parent education programs can lead to an increased sense of social support and improved parenting skills, particularly in areas related to handling children's misbehavior and improving listening skills. Results also suggest that the structure and content of LTC render it unique among foster parent training programs and that its unique components, if implemented in other training models, might enhance the success and benefit of those programs as well. Although the sample was quite small, the information gleaned has important implications for practice in that it provides much needed and scarcely available feedback about what is necessary to make foster parent training a viable means through which to improve the fostering experience for both parents and children.

40|$|The {{reactivity}} and micro-structure {{of three}} coals and two cokes used in {{iron and steel}} manufacture have been studied {{by a variety of}} techniques, including gas sorption analysis, thermal analysis and microscopy. Changes in surface areas and porosities of the coals and cokes during combustion have been determined by a gravimetric nitrogen sorption technique at 77 K. The cokes and coals have been studied by thermal analysis under isothermal and dynamic conditions in different gas atmospheres. Rates of reaction have been correlated with surface area changes. Attempts have been made to calculate activation energies from Kissinger plots of DTA data. Microstructural changes in the cokes and coals during carbon burn-off have been investigated by electron microscopy. Relative porosities have been estimated by image analysis. Mechanical strengths of the cokes have been measured and correlated with porosity data. Selected metals in the carbons have been determined by flame photometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The composition of residual mineral matter (ash) has been investigated by X-ray diffraction. The chemical compositions of the coal distillates have been characterised by ir/uv spectrosopy, NMR spectroscopy and by GC-MS techniques. Calorific values of the carbons have been determined. Results are discussed in relation to previous work and to applications 1 n blast furnace practice. In coal combustion the surface areas increase during the initial stages of carbon burn-off, reaching maximum at about 50 % burn-off before decreasing. The increases are considerably higher at 400 ° and 500 ° C than at 300 ° C for all three coals. Hysteresis data from the sorption isotherms show that the coals develop full ranges of mesa-porosity and some micro-porosity during burn-off at the higher temperatures. However, the coal oxidation is only slightly accelerated, since most of the new surface is located in the micro- and meso- pores where access to atmospheric oxygen is restricted by slow diffusion, so that the earlier stages of oxidation are approximately linear with time. This improves our knowledge of current empirical industrial carbon solution tests. There is comparatively little change in surface during the coking of the Coals at 1000 ° C and only restricted sintering of the coal ashes at 300 - 500 ° C. In the combustion of the cokes in carbon dioxide at 1000 ° C the maxima in surface areas occur within 25 % burn-off. However, one of the cokes shows a second maximum at later stages of burn-off, ascribed to the European component in the <b>parent</b> coal <b>blend.</b> This gives a more uniform rate of burn-off which is advantageous industrially.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Seven winter wheats were {{evaluated}} for plant height, {{the components of}} yield and yield in a diallel cross at Pendleton, Oregon and Lind, Washington. An additional parent {{was added to the}} diallel cross at Pullman, Washington. Two levels of nitrogen and five replications were utilized at each of the locations. Ten seeds of each F₁ or <b>parent</b> were <b>blended</b> with 200 seeds of WA 4303 and seeded in a ten foot row. This was done in order to simulate a solid seeding with the limited amount of F₁ seed. The data were analyzed by using Griffing's diallel analysis, Method 4, Model 1. The morphological traits measured were: heading date, kernels per spike, spikelets per spike, kernels per spikelet, weight per 1000 kernels, kernels per plant, spikes per plant and yield per plant. In an effort to obtain an unbiased combining ability estimate, a blend method of seeding (F₁'s mixed with a short semidwarf WA 4303) was used in order to simulate solid seedings. A comparison between the solid and blend seedings indicated, however, that WA 4303 did not exert the same influence on all hybrids. The estimate obtained should be less bias than those results obtained from other investigations where space or hill plantings were utilized. Significant general combining ability estimates were associated with all measured traits within the six environments, except for kernels per plant (high fertility) at one location. Specific combining ability estimates were significant for all traits at one location. Only part of the measured traits exhibited significant specific combining ability effects at the other two locations. Under the environments where specific combining ability estimates were significant they were larger than those for general combining ability for most traits. The lines utilized in this study were previously {{selected on the basis of}} their yielding ability. Therefore, the additive portion of the total genetic variance had already been maximized. The high specific combining ability estimates were attributed to this previous selection for additive gene action in addition to the nonadditive gene action which resulted from crossing of the selected lines. Heterosis and heterobeltiosis were exhibited by some hybrids for all measured traits and within all six environments. Heterosis and specific combining ability estimates were not always in close agreement which could result in some confusion in determining which crosses would perform best in a specific environment. These data would indicate that specific combining ability is a valid estimate of the total amount of nonadditive genetic variance present but in addition the additive genetic variance and the multiplicative action of the components are important and contribute to heterosis. The influence of the environmental-genotypic interaction as measured across locations was greater for specific combining ability estimates than that for the estimates of general combining ability for all traits measured. This suggests that the nonadditive genetic variance is more susceptible to changes in environmental conditions than is the additive portion of the total genetic variance...|$|R
