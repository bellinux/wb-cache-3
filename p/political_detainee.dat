5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Burger's Daughter came when Gordimer {{was waiting to}} visit a <b>political</b> <b>detainee</b> in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, {{the daughter of an}} activist she knew. She wondered what this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother.

On 11 September, police loaded him into the back of a Land Rover, naked and manacled, and drove him [...] to the hospital. There, Biko died alone in a cell on 12 September 1977. According to an autopsy, an [...] "extensive brain injury" [...] had caused [...] "centralisation of the blood circulation to such an extent that there had been intravasal blood coagulation, acute kidney failure, and uremia". He was the twenty-first person to die in a South African prison in twelve months, and the forty-sixth <b>political</b> <b>detainee</b> to die during interrogation since the government introduced laws permitting imprisonment without trial in 1963.|$|E
