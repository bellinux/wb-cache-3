5|$|Dominica sent a {{delegation}} of eight people, including two athletes, to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Its appearance in Beijing marked the fourth time {{a delegation}} from Dominica participated in an Olympic games since its debut at the 1996 Olympic games, one of its smallest delegations in its history and the first Dominican delegation that did not include female athletes. Chris Lloyd ran for Dominica in the men's 200meters and Erison Hurtault participated in the men's 400meters. Neither advanced past the qualification rounds. Lloyd was also supposed {{to compete in the}} men's 400meters, but did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Track coach Jérôme Romain was the country's flag bearer at the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojević and Đurađ Branković. Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but not against the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, {{refused to accept the}} offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|At around 01:30 on Monday, February 10, 1930, {{approximately}} 40 troops {{belonging to}} the 2ndBattalion of the Fourth Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois stationed at Yên Bái, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDD, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The rebels had intended to split into three groups: the first group was to infiltrate the infantry, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support among Vietnamese troops; the second, supported by the VNQDD civilians, was {{to break into the}} post headquarters; and the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The French were caught off guard; five were killed and three seriously wounded. The mutineers isolated a few more French officers from their men, even managing to raise the VNQDD flag above one of the buildings. About two hours later, however, it became apparent that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, and the remaining 550 Vietnamese soldiers helped quell the rebellion rather than <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the Garde indigène town post and could not convince the frightened townspeople to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a French Indochinese counterattack scattered the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Yên Bái.|$|E

25|$|Priestley claimed {{throughout}} his life that politics did not interest him {{and that he did}} not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> What appeared to others as political arguments were for Priestley always, at their root, religious arguments. Many of what we would call Priestley's political writings were aimed at supporting the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, a political issue that had its foundation in religion.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the strike}} did not meet with {{unanimous}} approval. Marginal Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP) threw its weight behind the strike, but right wing National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN) was opposed to it. Crucially, Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) declined to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> so despite KPP support, the strike did not spread to the cities, as SL hoped. Notheless some worker strikes did occur during that period. Even within SL not all activists were convinced {{it was a good}} idea; it was supported by Wincenty Witos and Stanisław Mikołajczyk, but criticized by Maciej Rataj.|$|E

25|$|Scotland is {{also home}} to the oldest {{organised}} rugby union league in the world, the Border League, which was formed in 1901. The Border League does not take part in the pyramid structure of the National League, but all its clubs <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (and thus the Border League is now effectively a supplementary competition). Two small 'independent' leagues remain outside the system, the Highland Alliance League and the Grampian Alliance League but they have only four clubs between them (the remaining membership being second XVs of clubs in the League Championship) and are not likely to remain in existence for much longer.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of {{children}} go from house to house of their neighborhood and sing to neighbors. This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian children be korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E
25|$|Almost 20 years later, Satin re-releases the band's first album, which charts {{even higher}} than it did originally. A {{television}} documentary is soon in the works, exploring {{the mystery of the}} band's second album, which had disappeared from the vaults of Satin Records the day after Eddie's disappearance. All of the original Cruisers are set to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> except Eddie and Wendell Newton, who had died of an overdose in August 1963 at age 37. The others are now living ordinary lives: Sal Amato fronts a Cruisers tribute band. Ridgeway is a high school English teacher in Vineland. Doc works as a radio disc jockey in Asbury Park. Joann is a stage choreographer in Wildwood, and Hopkins works in an Atlantic City casino.|$|E

25|$|Russian {{authorities}} {{tried to}} blame the pogrom on the local Polish population in order to stir up the hatred between two ethnic groups (both of which generally opposed the Tsar). However Jewish survivors of the violence reported that the local Polish population had in fact sheltered many Jews during the pogrom and did not <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Apolinary Hartglas, a Polish Jewish leader and later {{a member of the}} Polish Sejm, together with Ze'ev Jabotinsky, managed to obtain secret documents issued by Szeremietiev which showed that the pogrom had been organized well in advance by Russian authorities who had actually transported Russian railroad workers from deep within Russia to participate. A commission set up by the Duma charged with investigating the pogrom came to similar conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Trick-or-treating {{typically}} happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, {{although some}} municipalities choose other dates. Homeowners wishing to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others {{might be more}} participative and would even ask an effort from the children {{in order to provide}} them with candy. In more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums. Although people decorate their homes for Halloween, when homes would like to participate in handing out candy, a porch light is usually left on to signify that a home is handing out candy.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{as soon as}} {{he settled}} in New York, Hillquit was drawn into East Side Jewish radical circles. He was then a small (5'4"), {{slightly}} built, frail adolescent with dark hair, dark oval-shaped eyes, and a gentle charming manner. He was immediately attracted to other young Jewish immigrants, mostly former students, now shop workers, who considered themselves intellectuals — a new radical intelligentsia... For the most part their radicalism was rooted in their experiences in the European socialist and anarchist movements. But emigration and economic hardships in the United States also contributed to their further radicalization. As foreigners in America they were situated far enough outside the society to observe its failings. As frustrated but literate people, they were ambitious enough to <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The young intellectuals were interested in finding alternatives to their present circumstances; their solution was to transform them.|$|E

500|$|The {{national}} team continues to lack FIFA recognition.
