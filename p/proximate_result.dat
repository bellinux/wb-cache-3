40|$|Efforts {{to explain}} when {{and why the}} state can legitimately impose retributive {{punishment}} on an actor who inadvertently creates an unjustified risk of causing death (and death results) typically rely on one of two theories. The prior-choice theory claims that retributive punishment for inadvertent lethal risk-creation is justified {{if and only if}} the actor 2 ̆ 7 s inadvertence or ignorance was a but-for and <b>proximate</b> <b>result</b> of a prior culpable choice. The hypothetical-choice theory claims that retributive punishment for inadvertent lethal risk-creation is justified if and only if the actor would have chosen to take the risk if he had been aware of it, even though he was not in fact aware of it. I argue that neither of these theories satisfactorily identifies when and why retributive punishment is warranted for inadvertent lethal risk-creation. Instead, I propose that an actor who creates a risk of causing death but who was unaware of that risk can fairly be subject to retributive punishment if he was either non-willfully ignorant or self-deceived, and if such ignorance or self-deception was due to the causal influence of a desire he should have controlled. The culpability of such an actor consists, not in any prior actual choice to do wrong, nor in any imagined hypothetical choice to do wrong, but in the culpable failure to exercise doxastic self-control: control over one 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs...|$|E
40|$|The {{clear and}} present danger test has been used for almost a century to {{determine}} the speech the government may restrain. This test assumes that at some point speech transforms into an act and at that moment the speech becomes punishable. Under the {{clear and present}} danger test, the First Amendment does not protect speech that is an incitement to imminent lawless action. Professor Dow suggests that the {{clear and present danger}} test protects too little speech. He posits that speech should be protected unless the following three conditions are met: (1) the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s specific intent in uttering the words was to cause an unlawful injury, (2) the injury in fact occurred as a <b>proximate</b> <b>result</b> of the speech, and (3) the speaker, through his or her speech, overwhelmed the will of the listener. Professor Dow 2 ̆ 7 s proposed test is based upon the belief that the listener has a will {{of his or her own}} and thus may choose whether to act on the words he or she heard. This test springs from the understanding that the Free Speech Clause recognizes that evil words do not always lead to evil acts. The proposed test would allow the punishment only of the most culpable speakers, those who overwhelm the will of the listener and in essence force the listener to act as the speaker desire...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScLab {{conducted}} {{proximate analysis}} of coal bearing rock units calculates the weight percentage of ash, moisture, fixed carbon and volatile matter {{through a series}} of combustion steps. The data obtained is quintessential in establishing the coal rank {{and in the case of}} coal bed methane the gas-in-place estimates. In this study 105 proximate analysis samples, from 7 drilled wells, are taken from the south-eastern Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The pseudo proximate analysis, the method proposed in this thesis, calculates the lab <b>proximate</b> analysis <b>results</b> using the neutron, density and gamma ray wireline logs. The uniqueness of the method lies in the fact that no cut off values are needed for the wireline logs, nor are the results of the lab proximate analysis required for calibration. An in depth study of the relationship between the wireline logs and proximate analysis is conducted using a principle component analysis and the results tested using a combination of statistical techniques to determine the significance of the relationship. It is shown that the density and neutron logs model the proportion of ash and volatile matter in the rock matrix, respectively, with a high degree of accuracy. The multiple regression analysis shows that percentages fixed carbon and moisture components of the rock matrix correlate poorly to the proposed well logs, thus most error lies in the determination of these two components. It is statistically proven that the pseudo <b>proximate</b> analysis <b>results</b> are significantly different to the lab measured proximate analysis. This implies that the proposed pseudo proximate analysis method is unable to accurately determine the components of a coal bearing rock matrix using the density, neutron and gamma ray wireline logs.
