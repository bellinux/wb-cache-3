40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} in nonlinear optics {{have led to}} the discovery of a new class of ultrashort pulse, the `optical similariton'. Optical similaritons arise when the interaction of nonlinearity, dispersion and gain in a high-power fibre amplifier causes the shape of an arbitrary input pulse to converge asymptotically to a pulse whose shape is self-similar. In comparison with optical solitons, which rely on a delicate balance of nonlinearity and anomalous dispersion and which can become unstable with increasing intensity, similaritons are more robust at high pulse powers. The simplicity and widespread availability of the components needed to build a self-similar amplifier capable of producing optical similaritons provides a convenient experimental platform to explore the fundamental nature of dynamical self-similarity. Here, we provide an overview of self-similar pulse propagation and scaling in optical fibre amplifiers, and their use in the development of high-power ultrafast optical sources, pulse synthesis and all-optical <b>pulse</b> <b>regeneration...</b>|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} of fiber-optic communication systems is looking to convert from the current electro-optical network to the potentially faster and more efficient all-optical network. This conversion requires simple and effective functional devices to perform all-optical data processing, switching, <b>pulse</b> <b>regeneration</b> and compression. In this dessertation, I will show the designs of several key functional units based on the ultra-fast nonlinear effects in highly nonlinear optical fibers and semiconductor waveguides such as quantum dot (QD) semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA). This dissertation includes the small-signal study of the four-wave mixing (FWM) process in quantum dot SOA, the design and performance analysis of all-optical XOR, AND, NOT, NAND Boolean logic gates operating at 250 Gb/s or higher based on two different schemes: (1) the cross gain and phase modulation (XGM and XPM) in quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers and (2) the two-photon absorption (TPA) effect in bulk semiconductor optical amplifiers. Designs of optical pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) generators based on both schemes are included and simulations of 250 Gb/s PRBS generations are shown. An effective optical pulse compressor is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The compressor utilizes a highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber (PCF) -based nonlinear optical loop minor (NOLM) in a ring structure to realize multi-step compression.

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} {{in the production of}} high‐peak power laser <b>pulses</b> by <b>regeneration</b> switching. Organic dyes have been used as saturable filters for both the ruby (cyanine dyes) and neodymium (a polymethine dye) to produce single high‐power spikes. The cyanine dye, in suitable concentration and path length, {{can also be used to}} produce a long train of slightly enhanced (gain about 10) regular Q‐switched spikes from the ruby laser, but the neodymium laser can apparently only be operated in the single‐pike mode. This paper reports the discovery of saturable filter action in a common dye, rose bengal, a derivative of fluorescein, which permits the production of an extremely regular sequence of enhanced spikes from the neodymium laser. Unlike the previous dyes, the transition corresponding to the saturable absorption occurs between two excited states, not between the ground state and an excited state. The population of the lower excited state is achieved by optical pumping of the dye solution, and, by varying the intensity of the pumping flash lamp, the optical density of the filter may be altered thus changing the spacing between light spikes as well as their height...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} and kinetic {{parameters for}} NO adsorption in a clinoptilolite-rich natural zeolitic material from Turkey were determined using the concentration pulse chromatography method. Under the experimental conditions (carrier gas velocities and adsorption temperatures) the micropore diffusion resistance {{was found to}} be the mass transfer controlling step. Matching the first moment of the response peaks to the mathematical model the Henry's Law constants and heat of adsorption at zero loading were determined. The axial dispersion, external film, macropore and micropore diffusion coefficients, and activation energy for diffusion of NO in the micropores were calculated from the analysis of the second moments of the response peaks. For successive NO <b>pulses</b> without <b>regeneration</b> between the <b>pulses,</b> the retention times of the response peaks decreased and peak areas increased with the injection number indicating irreversible adsorption. The reversibly adsorbed NO could be desorbed by purging with an inert gas at the adsorption pressure and temperature. Temperature programmed desorption profile obtained by heating the NO saturated adsorbent to 400 °C under inert flow revealed presence of multiple irreversibly adsorbed species in NZ with different thermal stabilities. Desorption of these species was not achieved during the heating up to 400 °C which makes the natural zeolitic materıal suitable for NO storage rather than for cyclic adsorptive separation processes.

The time courses of methylation and synthesis of tRNA during rat liver regeneration have been compared in an in vivo radioisotopic study, using 6 -orotic acid- 14 C and 3 H-methyl-L-methionine as precursors in double label <b>pulses.</b> Liver <b>regeneration</b> is a synchronized system in which biochemical events of the cell cycle are separable. Transfer RNA methylation increase precedes by several hours tRNA synthesis during regeneration, although the curves overlap. A ratio of the relative rate of methylation to the relative rate of synthesis has been made; that curve positively correlates with {{the rise and fall of}} protein synthesis during regeneration. It is clear that methylation and synthesis of tRNA are only weakly coupled; changing methyl content of the tRNA "pool" resulting from differential tRNA methylase and polymerase activities may regulate the rate of protein synthesis in the cell cycle at the translational level. The "pool sizes" of uridine monophosphate (UMP) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) were measured indirectly; UMP and SAM were isolated from perchloric acid supernatants and their specific activities were computed. Differential changes in radioactivity available to tRNA methylases and polymerases are not a source of artifact. That is, the control of both the synthesis and methylation of tRNA is at the enzyme level in vivo, rather than at some enzymatic step prior to those enzymatic reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of slow (subliminal) and fast (superluminal) light {{has attracted a}} great deal of attention over recent years because of potential applications in optical data storage, optical switching, quantum data processing and <b>pulse</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Slow and fast light can be achieved in materials that have very large normal or anomalous dispersion. In this thesis, methods that can be used to generate subliminal and superluminal light, especially the spectral hole-burning technique are reviewed and applied in the experiments. The experimental studies conducted are based on transient and persistent spectral hole-burning and the solid state materials emerald (Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈:Cr³⁺), ruby (Al₂O₃:Cr³⁺) and NaMgAl(oxalate) ₃. 9 H₂O:Cr(III) containing chromium(III) ions were used to burn spectral holes in to the so called R 1 -line within the temperature range of 1. 5 to 8 K. Spectral holes in the absorption spectrum of a crystal can generate strongly frequency-dependent dispersion that in turn results in slow and fast light. Conventional spectroscopy was applied to characterize the systems and then laser spectroscopy was applied to conduct hole-burning in the R 1 -line. Steeper normal or anomalous dispersion results in larger delay or advancement of the light pulse propagating through the crystal. Therefore, the homogeneous width of the sample was controlled by external magnetic fields. A magnetic field reduces the spectral hole width compared to zero field by reducing the electronic spin-flip rates and hence fluctuations of the local fields. Magnetic fields up to 4. 5 T were applied in these studies. The linear filter theory was applied to rationalise the observed slow/fast light phenomena based on spectral holes. However, experiments in strong magnetic fields (4 - 5 T) revealed that in the coherent limit the linear filter theory fails because of coherent transients such as Rabi oscillations, free-induction decay and self-induced transparency (SIT). Switching between slow and fast light was obtained by transient hole-burning, which was reported for the first time. These results could pave the way to applications such as all optical switches. In addition, light could be delayed by action of light in low magnetic fields, which in turn can be used as a spectroscopic method to determine spectral hole widths as a function of time, i. e. spectral diffusion. Moreover, re-investigation of the phenomenon of self-induced transparency (SIT) lead to the observation of the longest pulse delay so far by SIT...|$|E
40|$|The Kerr {{nonlinearity}} in {{optical fibres}} tends to generate signal distortion in dispersion-managed fibre-optic communication systems. Within a wavelength channel, the resulting intrachannel effects are timing jitter, i. e., random temporal shifting {{of the signal}} pulses, amplitude jitter, and generation of noise pulses in empty bit slots, referred to as ghost pulses. An investigation of these effects is carried out using both a variational and a perturbation analysis of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. This allows the nonlinear interaction to be described analytically and numerical simulations are presented that support and extend the obtained results. The interaction range, i. e., the number of bit slots over which the nonlinear interaction is significant, is an important concept when designing and interpreting system simulations. Analytical and numerical results are given which allow a priori estimations valid for realistic systems. The growth rate of the nonlinear distortion has been examined in order to investigate the possibilities for suppressing the nonlinear interaction. Methods for counteracting the nonlinear effects are proposed, and special emphasis {{is given to the}} suppressive effects obtained from phase shifting of consecutive signal <b>pulses.</b> All-optical <b>regeneration</b> is discussed as an alternative method of reducing the signal distortion and in particular two types of regenerators are studied.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{resilience}} of southeastern Norwegian old-growth Picea abies forest floor vegetation to experimental disturbance. Five treatments, differing in depth of removal of vegetation and soil layers and making up a gradient in disturbance severity, and three controls, were replicated 10 times. The experiment was analyzed {{with respect to the}} full species composition before and for seven years after treatment. The soil-buried propagule bank and local, environmental conditionswere recorded before treatment. Total cover of vascular plants and bryophytes and lichens increased slowly after treatmentand was still below pre-disturbance levels after seven years. The rate of succession, measured as change in floristic dissimilarity between recordings made in successive years, declined with time for all treatments. The magnitude of vegetationchange was strongly influenced, by disturbance severity. DCAordination revealed a main gradient in species composition from undisturbed forest floor to severely disturbed vegetationthree years after disturbance, while in the fourth year, thedirection of vegetation change turned in the direction of pre-disturbance positions. The turning point represented the maximum abundance of pioneer species (e. g., Luzula pilosa and Pohlia nutans) relative to dominant species before the disturbance (e. g., Dicranum majus and Hylocomium splendens). The return to pre-disturbance positions from the fourth year was, however, slow and will probably take 5 - 25 more years to be completed if current trends continue. DCA ordination revealed twoadditional, interpretable, gradients in vegetation; one related to <b>pulses</b> of <b>regeneration</b> from the soil-buried propagulebanks the other represented a gradient in pre-disturbance environmental conditions.

40|$|There are two {{dominant}} {{mechanisms for}} {{development of a new}} tree layer and subsequent canopy recruitment after major canopy mortality events. First, regeneration may develop from a pulse of new post-disturbance recruitment. Alternatively, regeneration can be from the existing seedling bank that survived the canopy mortality event. The timing and extent of post-disturbance recruitment from seed and the relative importance of the existing seedling bank is poorly understood in MPB-disturbed forests. The recruitment of post-MPB seedlings is a function of seed-source availability, seedbed substrate, overstory structure, and time since MPB attack. In the northern interior, post-MPB recruitment was sparse in stands impacted by beetle 3 - 10 years earlier. Subalpine fir comprised the majority of the post-MPB recruitment. It increased with local parent tree basal area and increased strongly with proximity to a major seed source, resulting in a patchy distribution. Lodgepole pine post-MPB recruitment was limited by overstory shading; pine regeneration decreased as the total overstory basal area increased. Spruce regeneration was similarly limited by total overstory basal area. Seedbed substrates were dominated by undisturbed moss layers and changed little (in the 3 - 10 yr post-MPB attacked stands). There was a weak trend to increased regeneration in older stands (7 - 10 years). Based on destructive sampling and stand reconstruction, regeneration post-beetle attack in the Flathead was often, but not always, delayed by 5 - 10 years. In most stands, this was followed by a strong <b>pulse</b> of <b>regeneration</b> for about 10 years. Twenty years after the outbreak there was an abrupt decrease in recruitment. In 2007, densities of post-beetle regeneration in all but 2 of the 22 stands were adequate for stocking.

Investigations were devoted to determine the temperature threshold allowing for catalyst reactivation under different CH 4 containing atmospheres. Under lean combustion conditions {{in the presence of}} excess O- 2, partial regeneration took place only above 750 degrees C after decomposition of stable sulphate species adsorbed on the support. Short CH 4 -reducing, O- 2 -free pulses led to partial catalyst reactivation already at 550 degrees C and to practically complete regeneration at 600 degrees C. Also in this case reactivation was associated with SO 2 release due to the decomposition of stable support sulphates likely promoted by CH 4 activation onto the reduced metallic Pd surface. Rich combustion pulses with CH 4 /O- 2 = 2 were equally effective to CH 4 -reducing <b>pulses</b> in catalyst <b>regeneration.</b> These results suggest that a regeneration strategy based on periodical natural gas pulses fed to the catalyst by a by-pass line might be efficient in limiting the effects of S-poisoning of palladium catalysts for the abatement of CH 4 emissions from natural gas engine...|$|R
30|$|Aspen age {{structure}} plots had a 10 m fixed radius. Within the plots, we cored the two aspen stems {{with the greatest}} diameter at breast height (dbh). Trees were cored at < 0.3 m core height until the pith was present in one sample at the plot. In a post-stand-replacing fire aspen stand, sampling two stems per plots at multiple plots within a patch {{has been shown to}} be sufficient to determine stand age (Margolis et al. 2007). This is because of the immediate asexual regeneration response of aspen following aboveground stem mortality, which creates a distinct recruitment pulse and a single-tiered, even-aged stand (Barnes 1966, Patton and Avant 1970). In upper montane seral aspen stands, subsequent regeneration is relatively rare and the dominant post-fire cohort is easily identified as the stems with largest dbh (Margolis et al. 2007). A more intensive sampling design would be necessary to fully describe a multi-cohort {{age structure}}, but this was not our goal. Post-fire quaking aspen regeneration can grow up to 1 m in the first year of growth (Jones 1975); thus, < 0.3 m core height seems adequate to capture the first year of the aspen <b>regeneration</b> <b>pulse</b> (Margolis et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Neurons {{communicate}} with other cells via axons and dendrites, slender membrane extensions that contain pre- or post-synaptic specializations. If a neuron is damaged by injury or disease, it may regenerate. Cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence {{the ability of}} a neuron to regenerate and restore function. Recently, the nematode C. elegans has emerged as an excellent model organism to identify genes and signaling pathways that influence the regeneration of neurons 1 - 6. The main way to initiate neuronal regeneration in C. elegans is laser-mediated cutting, or axotomy. During axotomy, a fluorescently-labeled neuronal process is severed using high-energy <b>pulses.</b> Initially, neuronal <b>regeneration</b> in C. elegans was examined using an amplified femtosecond laser 5. However, subsequent regeneration studies have shown that a conventional pulsed laser can be used to accurately sever neurons in vivo and elicit a similar regenerative response 1, 3, 7.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} detailed {{effects to}} retinal cells and, in particular, neurons following laser photocoagulation using a conventional 532 nm Nd:YAG continuous wave (CW) laser. Furthermore, {{to determine whether}} a novel 3 ns <b>pulse</b> laser (retinal <b>regeneration</b> therapy; 2 RT) could specifically ablate retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells without causing collateral damage to other retinal cells. METHODS: Adult Dark Agouti (DA) rats were separated into four groups: control, CW laser (12. 7 J/cm 2 /pulse, 100 ms pulse duration), or 3 ns pulse 2 RT laser at one of two energy settings (“High,” 2 RT-H, 163 mJ/cm 2 /pulse; “Low,” 2 RT-L, 109 mJ/cm 2 /pulse). Animals were treated and killed after 6 hours to 7 days, and retina/RPE was analyzed by histologic assessment, Western blot, polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Both lasers caused focal loss of RPE cells with no destruction of Bruch's membrane; RPE cells were present at lesion sites again within 7 days of treatments. CW and 2 RT-H treatments caused extensive and moderate damage, respectively, to the outer retina. There were no obvious effects to horizontal, amacrine, or ganglion cells, as defined by immunolabeling, but an activation of PKCα within bipolar cells was noted. There was little discernible damage to any cells other than the RPE with the 2 RT-L treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional laser photocoagulation caused death of RPE cells with associated widespread damage to the outer retina but little influence on the inner retina. The novel 3 ns 2 RT laser, however, was able to selectively kill RPE cells without causing collateral damage to photoreceptors.

40|$|Climate {{shifts and}} {{resource}} exploitation in Rocky Mountain forests have caused profound changes in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) {{structure and function}} since Euro-American settlement. It therefore seems likely that commensurate shifts in dependent epiphytes would follow major ecological transitions. In the current study, we merge several lines of inquiry to investigate historical changes using lichens as bioindicators of forest structure, air quality, and community composition. Though lichens are well known for their sensitivity to air borne pollutants, recent utilization in the monitoring realm has lead to novel uses as indicators of biodiversity and stand composition. A landscape- level investigation in northern Utah and southern Idaho, USA, was implemented to track contemporary and long-term impacts of humans on aspen forests and their dependent macrolichens. We use historical sources, climate data, fire records, and passive ammonia sensors alongside forest and lichen monitoring techniques to gain further insight into aspen and epiphytic lichen community change over the past 150 years. Our research shows that historic drought conditions correlated closely with <b>pulses</b> of aspen <b>regeneration</b> during this period. Aspen initiation was closely aligned with large-scale resource impacts of the late 19 th century. During the 20 th century a moist climate pattern generally favored shade-tolerant conifers. Additionally, results from nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination indicate a primary successional gradient in determining lichen communities, but also revealed a significant gradient of more recent impacts from nitrogen loading originating from local ammonia (NH 3) sources. While advancing succession generally favors lichen diversity, {{our findings suggest that}} medium-distance transport (10 - 50 km) of local air pollutants is already contributing to altered lichen communities. Overall, there are strong ties between landscape-level disturbance history and present aspen-dependent species assemblages.

The capacity of hybrid vehicle batteries will be relatively small, they will typically operate over a restricted range of states-of-charge, and they may seldom if ever be fully recharged.

New test methods {{have been developed for}} use in characterizing battery performance and life for hybrid vehicle use. The procedures described in this paper were developed from the requirements of the government-industry cooperative Partnership for A New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program; however, they are expected to have broad application to the testing of energy storage devices for hybrid vehicles.

The relationship between the PNGV energy storage requirements and these tests is described so that application of the test methods can be made to other hybrid vehicle performance requirements as well.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Patterns {{of western}} hemlock {{regeneration}} were studied {{in relation to}} forest structural development and environment in the Oregon Coast Range. Density of western hemlock seedlings was examined across the climatic gradient from cool, moist coastal areas to the seasonally hot and dry Willamette Valley Margin. Seedling densities were most strongly related to stand-level variables including stand age, frequency and abundance of overstory western hemlock trees, abundance of coarse woody debris, decreasing shrub cover, and increasing overstory conifer cover. Significant regional climate and topographic variables included mean annual temperature, precipitation and elevation. Dispersal distances between western hemlock seedlings and potential parents were characterized by measuring distances between seedlings and potential parents. Cone production in western hemlock trees by size class was estimated in four late successional Coast Range stands. Dispersal distances were most commonly short - generally within 10 meters of the nearest potential parent tree. Cone production was related to diameter and crown position, with larger codominant and dominant trees producing more cones than smaller trees. Dynamics and age structure of western hemlock in late successional forests was {{described in terms of}} age and size distributions, rooting patterns, and growth rates of western hemlock seedlings, saplings, and trees across the climatic gradient and related to stand level factors in six late successional forests. Time between initial and subsequent western hemlock <b>regeneration</b> <b>pulses</b> varied between 40 - 70 years. These patterns were observed in all stands. Striking differences in substrate colonization patterns were observed between seedlings and trees and at climatic extremes. Seedlings were predominantly observed on decaying wood while trees were generally observed on forest floor substrates. An exception to this pattern occurred in near-coastal sites where western hemlock of all size classes were found almost entirely on decaying wood substrates. Growth rates across size classes were also calculated and related to regional and stand-level variables. Highest growth rates occurred in low elevation coastal sites, in stands containing the highest levels of coarse woody debris, and the highest level of canopy gaps.

Within the reserve, old Pinus sylvestris trees grow on fertile soils in a mixed deciduous forest (oak-lime-hornbeam forest Tilio-Carpinetum) with a very rich and dense field layer. This study will explore the features of P. sylvestris trees and if this earlysuccessional species is able to regenerate and establish under such habitat conditions as present today. On three such Tilio-Carpinetum typicum study areas (in total 230 ha) 723 P. sylvestris trees were inventoried and mapped during transect walks over site type gradients. Mean tree density for all sites was low with 3, 1 /ha. 70 % of alive trees had a DBH of 46 - 89 cm (μ= 64, 5) and 50 % of alive trees were ≥ 30 m in height. 85 % of all trees were estimated to be ≥ 100 - 250 years old, none alive tree younger than 50 years. Fire scarred were 18, 4 % of all Scots pines recorded, half of those additionally modified by chipping for wood splints, beehive caves or axe cutting by people (CMTs). These marks are undoubtedly signs of past anthropogenic utilization impact on appearance and history of the studied forest stands. At least 52 pine trees were multiple fire-scarred, with a range of 2 - 10 fire events counted. Maximum height for open fire scars was 320 cm. There was no single P. sylvestris seedling or sapling found during the regeneration inventories in June 2010. Not even where better light conditions or soil disturbances with a reduced field layer coverage occurred. Due to similarities to Scots pine in its ecology Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) was included in the macro-scale regeneration inventory: seedling/sapling density ranged between sites from 1 to 89, 1 oak individuals/ha. In the micro-scale regeneration inventory, Acer platanoides, followed by Tilia cordata, Fraxinus excelsior and Carpinus betulus seedlings was the tree species with the highest frequency. In the sapling stage instead, the dominant abundance of Norway maple was followed by hornbeam and Ulmus spp. In sum 28 dead Scots pines were cored for age determination: the oldest tree on the study sites germinated in 1637, 1642 and 1728 respectively. Overall about 15 irrregular <b>regeneration</b> <b>pulses</b> could be detected from the samples for the time period 1637 - 1852. A share of 33 % of all estimated germination dates falls within a 15 -year interval, stretching from 1767 to 1782. Longer fire-free periods, e. g. after a likely fire in 1777, allowed Scots pine to recruit and to be resistant enough to survive following fires, as those dated from scars during the 19 th century, namely in 1822, 1833, 1851 and 1861. Fire could serve as one hypothetic explanation (besides eutrophication) for the appearance of P. sylvestris in richer habitats in BNP, formerly promoted by people in the region due to traditional forest utilization. The diminishing influence of man in BNP may cause the depression in regeneration of short lived pioneers and climax, light demanding tree species like Pedunculate oak and Scots pine...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{regulations on}} automotive emissions {{have resulted in}} the need for improved pollution control technology. To reduce mobile emissions, researchers have investigated alternatives such as lean-bum engines and fuel cells. This work is focused on the synthesis, characterization and testing of novel metal oxide nanocomposites to facilitate the utilization of these technologies. In lean-bum engines, the use of adsorbents to remove NOx faces two major challenges: (1) excess hydrocarbon and CO emissions during fuel-rich <b>pulses</b> for adsorbent <b>regeneration,</b> and (2) reduced NOx adsorption efficiencies due to competitive adsorption of SO 2 in the gas stream. To provide for the low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons and CO under a reducing atmosphere, CeO 2, a well-known oxygen storage material, was modified through secondary metal oxide doping to improve thermal stability and oxygen accessibility. 20 at% substitution of Pr, Sc and Zr in CeO 2 successfully promoted microstructural stability, with Ceo. 8 Zro 0. 202 - retaining grain size of 30 nm even after calcination at 10000 C. At high doping levels, Zr improved grain size stability further, but ZrO 2 phase segregation was noted in CelxZrxO 2. 8 with x > 0. 2. TPR experiments under 2. 5 % H 2 in He showed that Ceo 8 Pr 0. 202 - provided superior low-temperature reduction and overall reducibility amongst Ce 0. 8 M 0. 2026 - materials. Moreover, CelxPrxO 2 - 8 showed increased reducibility with increasing x, achieving a maximum weight loss of 4. 8 % at x = 1. 0. CO oxidation studies over Ceo. 8 M 0. 202 - 8 identified Sc and Zr doping with the lowest CO light-off temperatures (247 ⁰C and 264 ⁰C, respectively). (cont.) For CelPrxO 2 - and CelxZrxO 2 -, low levels of doping resulted in the highest CO oxidation activity; light-off was successfully achieved at 264 ⁰C and 252 ⁰C for x = 0. 4 and 0. 1, respectively. Metal oxide-based materials were developed to selectively adsorb SO 2 during fuel-lean conditions and desorb SO 2 during fuel-rich conditions, thereby preventing the SO 2 poisoning of the NOX adsorbent. Of various simple and mixed metal oxides, the Cr 203 -CuO system was found to provide SO 2 adsorption under oxidizing conditions at 400 ⁰C, and SO 2 evolution under reducing conditions below 350 ⁰C. The CuCr 20 O 4 phase present at the optimal Cr 20 O 3 -CuO composition gave rise to improved low-temperature CO activity, which facilitated SO 2 desorption. With increased CuO content, both adsorption capacity and regenerability were increased. Through the introduction of dopants, phase-pure CuCr 2 yCoyO 4 was obtained to allow for SO 2 desorption below 300 Ê»C, which corresponded well with increased CO 2 evolution. By introducing excess CuO onto CuCr 1. 9 Co 0. 1 O 4 via various synthesis routes, improved SO 2 sorption characteristics were attained. In pulse adsorption/desorption studies, the CuO/ CuCr. 9 Co 0. 104 materials and CuO/CuCr 204 also demonstrated excellent capacity and superior regenerability relative to the conventional CuO/A 1203 adsorbent. For on-board H 2 production for fuel cells, the removal of H 2 S is paramount to avoiding poisoning of the H 2 separation membrane and the fuel cell.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{and compares}} the autecology of two coexisting wet forest trees. It demonstrates temporal, spatial and biological differentiation of the reproduction, regeneration and growth characteristics which allow these taxa to coexist in superficially similar environments. The distributions {{of the species}} and the environmental correlates of the communities in which they exist are compared and contrasted. The climatic range of P. aspleniifolius is greater than A. biglandulosum but this {{may be attributed to}} the greater vagility of P. asplennfolius allowing it to occupy areas that are dimatically susceptible to repeated disturbance by fire. It is determined that both are most important in poorly structured and diverse rainforest communities which are often associated with low fertility substrates. The physiological basis for this correlation was tested experimentally and by field measurements. A. biglandulosum performed best under add conditions while P. aspleniifolius was relatively insensitive to fertility. These responses are manifest in the absence of both species from the most fertile sites which support floristically simple tall Nothofagus cunninghamii dominated forests. The preference of A. biglandulosum for acid sites and the insensitivity of P. aspleniifolius allow these species {{to take advantage of the}} decline in the performance of the important canopy dominant, Nothofagus cunninghamii, and hence increase their abundance on such sites. Other than possible exclusion from pure Nothofagus cunninghamii forest their geographic range and phytosociological associations are not limited by edaphic conditions. Field performance of both A. biglandulosum and P. aspleniifolius does, however, reflect the physiological growth response measured under experimental conditions. The photosynthetic responses of A. biglandulosum and P. aspleniifolius were investigated in the contrasting micro-environments of the canopy, a gap and the understorey of a rainforest in Tasmania. Measurements were made using a portable infra-red gas analyser. Both species displayed the highest light saturation levels at the canopy but both produced the highest rates of photosynthesis in the gap environment. Diffuse light on cloudy days was important in the understorey environment. The rate of photosynthesis was affected considerably by low levels of stomatal conductance two days after rain. The results indicate that both species are "sun" plants and that their dependance upon high levels of light to maintain competitive growth rates would influence their regeneration opportunities and may induce competition for sites. The phenological and demographic strategies of both species were compared. The timing of foliar and sexual development of Phyllocladus asplenhfolius and Anodopetalum biglandulosum were recorded at Mt Field in Tasmania. Seed production, seed predation, germination and survival were monitored in different regions of Tasmania. The wind dispersed A. biglandulosum suffered an extremely high level of fruit predation by a moth and by birds. The resultant low seed production is reflected in the poor seed regeneration in this species. The timing of pollen release and female cone development in P. asplenhfolius indicates that outcrossing between populations is likely. Outcrossing may provide the species with a high degree of genetic fitness but may not necessarily explain its wide ecological amplitude as this situation contrasts with the poorly dispersed and possibly genetically limited A. biglandulosum which also has a broad ecological range. P. asplenhfolius produced spatially variable amounts of seed and is a mast seeder. The number of germinants two springs after seed fall reflected the variation in annual seed production and suggests that <b>pulses</b> in <b>regeneration</b> are likely although soilstored seed and immigrant seed may offset this effect. The consequences of the phenological differentiation on regeneration opportunities was explored. The contrasting strategies required different approaches, as A. biglandulosum dependsiargely upon vegetative regeneration and proliferation while P. asplenhfolius is an obligate seed regenerator. A growth-form/disturbance typology of A. biglandulosum based on data from 48 sites was produced. A multivariate data set from each site summarizes a stands' growth-form as stem types, densities and diameters. A canonical correlation indicates a significant relationship between the growth-form data set and community floristics. The basic architecture associated with a particular forest is modified by proliferation in response to exogenic disturbances, such as fire and heavy snow-falls, or as a result of community processes such as crown senescence and tree-fall. This study aimed to determine the range of the P. asplenhfolius regeneration niche in terms of differential microsite occupation, population structure and dispersion pattern at 52 forest sites. The distribution and sizes of stems were mapped on belt transects to within 0. 5 m, and the microsites of seedlings and saplings were recorded. A variety of population structures exist and are related to community floristics and structure. Community variation provides different microsite opportunities. P. asplenhfolius showed a preference for elevated sites, including logs, buttresses and old stump mounds. Aggregation of seedlings is common and determined by microsite distribution and dispersal characteristics. It is concluded that niche differentiation between P. aspleniifolius and A. biglandulosum is demonstrated in edaphic responses and reproductive biology, and niche overlap is evident in their use of the light environment. Although their coexistence is theoretically dependent upon niche differentiation, stochastic events producing opportunities for regeneration appear to be more important and therefore the results conform with the theory of non-equilibrium coexistence of species. The broad and common phytosociological associations may reflect Tertiary species extinctions which have produced an environment of low competition with few specialists. The extant species experience niche broadening via more opportunities for regeneration and hence greater levels of coexistence which are expressed as low beta diversity in Tasmanian wet forests...|$|R
