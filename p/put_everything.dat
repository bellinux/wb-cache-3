5|$|Alan Grant {{returned}} for a second outing to write Curse, about a grave digger who unleashed a 150-year-old curse onto Smallville, and Clark's attempt to <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> back the way it was. In Temptation, Clark used red kryptonite to try and impress Lana and Chloe after they become infatuated with a new, French foreign exchange student. Aspect released their final novel on March 1, 2004; written by Devin K. Grayson, City chronicled Clark and Lex's trip to Metropolis. While in the city, the pair got caught between the Japanese mafia and a secret agent who believed he has found an alien. In Little, Brown Young Readers' final novel, written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, Sparks featured Clark trying to save Chloe after she was exposed to a kryptonite fireworks display that makes her the desire of every man. For one of the men, when the desire wears off he decides that he really does want Chloe and kidnaps her.|$|E

25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
25|$|Since {{very early}} on, the {{publishing}} duties and design duties {{had actually been}} split, with the Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB) handling all of the product design, while TFG had published, and indicated {{what they wanted to}} produce. The end of TFG <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> under one house again, and ADB, Inc. spent some time picking up the pieces of nearly three years without SFB. The first order of business, in fact, was to reprint Basic Set and Advanced Missions which had been out of stock for about three years at this point. While they were at it, all the errata and questions were evaluated, and many sections of the rules were re-written {{in an effort to make}} the game clearer. These editions featured new cover colors and a '1999' legend at the bottom of the cover to show when they were printed.|$|E
25|$|The {{policies}} of the Díaz government caused resentment not only among the Yaquis, but also throughout the country. One of the preludes to the Mexican Revolution was the 1906 Cananea miner's strike. Approximately 2,000 strikers sought negotiations with American mine owner William Greene, {{but he refused to}} meet with them. The strike quickly turned violent when the miners tried {{to take control of the}} mine and gunfire was exchanged. Greene requested help from federal troops, but when it was obvious they could not arrive in time, he appealed to the governments of Arizona and Sonora to allow Arizona volunteers to assist him. This increased the scale of the violence. When Mexican federal troops arrived two days later, they <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> to a brutal end, with the suspected leaders of the strike executed. The heavy-handed way in which Díaz had handled the strike made resentment against Diaz grow, with more strikes beginning in other areas.|$|E

25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

500|$|Hershiser {{had ended}} Padres catcher Benito Santiago's 34-game hitting streak {{the year before}} and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to Tony Gwynn, [...] "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too hard. You {{have to give the}} man credit. He didn't give me one decent pitch to hit all night. He <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> right where he wanted it to go." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 1996, Madonna {{travelled}} to Buenos Aires {{to research}} Eva's life, {{and met with}} several people who had known her before her death. During filming, she fell sick many times due to the intense emotional effort required, and midway through production, she discovered she was pregnant. Her daughter Lourdes was born on October 14, 1996. Madonna published a diary of the film shoot in Vanity Fair. She said of the experience, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time...

500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough she had hoped for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] because she had a tendency to oversing or tried to <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when he heard her sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he really was a mentor of mine. He taught me that less is more." ...|$|E

The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it... I just tried to <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> I could into it, and I'm real proud of it.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{pointed out}} that Martha was not stripping, just pole dancing. Gordon took pole dancing lessons {{for a period of}} a few weeks funded by Channel Seven, and found the {{experience}} embarrassing and physically challenging. She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that [...] "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're looking at me – it's like having your mates seeing you half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> into it." [...] Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what she really wants from life.|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} the episode {{originated}} from an idea that executive producer and series creator Chris Carter had about a pyramid scheme involving body parts. Writer Jeff Vlaming combined two additional concepts that he had developed; the first involved a lottery {{in a small town}} and the other concerned corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. When the initial script for [...] "Hell Money" [...] was submitted, Carter merged the three stories into one. Entertainment Weekly later noted that [...] "the twisted grotesquery of this story makes you think it must be based on a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original.

Shortly before the trials, he went the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado to train at altitude. [...] "I'm better mentally than I've ever been," [...] Tarwater said of his preparation. [...] "Physically I'm stronger than four years ago." [...] He entered the Trials as the number two seed in the 200-meter butterfly and was widely expected to make the U.S. Olympic team as the second qualifier behind Phelps. [...] "For {{the last two years}} I have completely <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> in my life aside to try to make [...] dream come true," [...] he told a reporter. He also entered the trials as the fourth seed in the 100-meter butterfly and qualified for the 100- and 200-meter freestyle.|$|E
500|$|Cooper and {{his family}} share a close bond. Two years {{after the death of}} his father from lung cancer in 2011, he {{relocated}} to Los Angeles with his mother. He says that during his father's diagnosis: [...] "I was in a very lucky position because I was able to <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> on hold in all aspects of my life and completely focus on taking care of him." [...] He has described the process of his treatment as [...] "just simply overwhelming, incredibly stressful, complex and all consuming." [...] The actor has since supported organizations that help fight cancer. In June 2014, Cooper joined the board of directors for the charity Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a non-profit organization that serves people coping with cancer. In April 2016, he participated in the launch of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy that works for cancer patients. He served as an executive producer for Stand Up to Cancer's Fifth Biennial Telecast, a primetime fundraising special that aired in September.|$|E
500|$|In 1741, the Austrian {{authorities}} informed Maria Theresa that Bohemian populace {{would prefer}} Charles Albert {{to her as}} sovereign. Maria Theresa, desperate and burdened by pregnancy, wrote plaintively to her sister: [...] "I don't know if a town will remain to me for my delivery." [...] She bitterly vowed to spare nothing and no one to defend her kingdom when she wrote to the Bohemian chancellor, Count Philip Kinsky: [...] "My mind is made up. We must <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> at stake to save Bohemia." [...] On 26October, the Elector of Bavaria captured Prague and declared himself King of Bohemia. Maria Theresa, then in Hungary, wept on learning {{of the loss of}} Bohemia. Charles Albert was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor on 24January 1742. The Archduchess, who regarded the election as a catastrophe, caught her enemies unprepared by insisting on a winter campaign; the same day he was elected emperor, Austrian troops under Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller captured Munich, Charles Albert's capital.|$|E
