40|$|Membranous {{nephropathy}} (MN) is {{a leading}} cause of adult nephrotic syndrome but lacks adequate treatment. Different extracts of Angelica sinensis (AS) and one of its active compounds, ferulic acid (FA), were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects in a MN mouse model. The MN model was grouped into three subgroups: no treatment (N-T), treatment at induction of MN (Pre-T), and treatment after full-blown MN (<b>Post-T).</b> The results showed that the methanol (ME) layer of AS extract exhibited a therapeutic effect on MN-induced proteinuria. The ME layer-enriched compound, FA, improved the hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and proteinuria in both Pre-T and <b>Post-T</b> groups. Ferulic acid also reduced the formation of oxidative protein products and increased the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes in groups Pre-T and <b>Post-T.</b> Regarding angiogenesis factors, the antiangiogenic factors in renal glomeruli were increased in group N-T, but, after FA treatment, only one of the antiangiogenic factors, thrombospondin- 1, showed a significant decrease. Furthermore, the expression of Th 2 predominant showed significant decrease in both Pre-T and <b>Post-T</b> groups when compared to that of N-T group. In summary, FA retarded the progression of MN, and the mechanisms involved the regulation of oxidative stresses, angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, and attenuation of Th 2 response...|$|R

We investigated the role of trastuzumab on brain metastasis (BM) in HER 2 -positive breast cancer patients. From 1999 to 2006, 251 patients were treated with palliative chemotherapy for HER 2 -positive metastatic breast cancer at Samsung Medical Center. The medical records of these patients were analysed to study the effects of trastuzumab on BM prevalence and outcomes. Patients were grouped according to trastuzumab therapy: pre-T (no trastuzumab therapy) vs <b>post-T</b> (trastuzumab therapy). The development of BM between the two treatment groups was significantly different (37. 8 % for <b>post-T</b> vs 25. 0 % for pre-T, P= 0. 028). Patients who had received trastuzumab had longer times to BM compared with patients who were not treated with trastuzumab (median 15 months for <b>post-T</b> group vs 10 months for pre-T group, P= 0. 035). Time to death (TTD) from BM was significantly longer in the <b>post-T</b> group than in the pre-T group (median 14. 9 vs 4. 0 months, P= 0. 0005).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} red blood cell transfusion in patients with SIRS/sepsis who presented hemoglobin levels under 9. 0 g/dL at intensive care unit admission, using two parameters of organ perfusion: mixed venous oxygen saturation and serum lactate levels. METHODS: All patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} with SIRS/sepsis, as defined by Consensus Conference in 1992, and hemoglobin levels under 9. 0 g/dL were included. Hemoglobin levels, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and lactate levels were collected before red blood cell transfusion (pre-T) and up to 1 hour after transfusion (<b>post-T).</b> These variables were analyzed through a paired t test, and results were considered significant if P <. 05. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (17 male, 12 female) with ages of 61. 9 ± 15. 1 (mean ± SD) years (range, 21 - 85 years) and a mean APACHE II score of 12. 5 ± 3. 75 (7 - 21) were transfused with a mean of 1. 41 packed red cell units. A significant increase in hemoglobin levels was reached by blood transfusion, from 8. 14 ± 0. 64 g/dL (pre-T) to 9. 4 ± 0. 33 g/dL (<b>post-T),</b> with P <. 001. However, this was not accompanied by a significant change in lactate levels, from 1. 87 ± 1. 22 mmol/l (pre-T) to 1. 56 ± 0. 28 mmol/l (<b>post-T),</b> with P =. 28, or in mixed venous oxygen saturation, from 64. 3 ± 8. 52 % (pre-T) to 67. 4 ± 6. 74 % (<b>post-T),</b> with P =. 13. The results were similar even in patients with hemoglobin levels under 8. 0 g/dL (n = 9). These results suggest that red blood cell transfusions, in spite of leading to a significant increase in hemoglobin levels, are not associated with an improvement in tissue oxygenation in patients with SIRS/sepsis and hemoglobin levels < 9 g/dL...|$|R

The immunogenicity of the P 2, P 30, and P 2 P 30 T-cell epitopes of tetanus toxin and whole tetanus toxoid (TT) was evaluated by in vitro proliferation assay of lymphocytes from men with no history of tetanus vaccination who were enrolled in a malaria prophylaxis trial. The enhancement of immune response by tetanus vaccination (Td) and possible antagonism by the antimalarial drugs, was measured by pre- and <b>post-Td</b> comparisons within and between immunized prophylaxis groups (primaquine, chloroquine, placebo) and a nonimmunized control group. Constructs demonstrated low immunogenicity relative to TT in all groups. Relative to both control and its own baseline, the immunized primaquine prophylaxis group was distinct in demonstrating significantly increased proliferation against all three subunits and at both high (30 microg ml(- 1)) and low (3 microg ml(- 1)) concentrations. Immunization elicited significantly increased proliferation responses by placebo and chloroquine prophylaxis groups against only the P 2 P 30 construct. Despite these significant <b>post-Td</b> changes, a low concentration of TT 0. 1 microg ml(- 1)) stimulated proliferation 7 - 10 times over that induced by the greatest concentration of the constructs...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the determination of}} the effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, mass, luminosity and age of 27 young early-type stars, most of them in the age range 1 - 10 Myr, and three -suspected- hot companions of <b>post-T</b> Tauri stars belonging to the Lindroos binary sample. Most of these objects show IR excesses in their spectral energy distributions, which are indicative of the presence of disks. The work is relevant in the fields of stellar physics, physics of disks and formation of planetary systems. Spectral energy distributions and mid-resolution spectra were used to estimate the effective temperature. The comparison of the profiles of the Balmer lines with synthetic profiles provides the value of the stellar gravity. High-resolution optical observations and synthetic spectra are used to estimate the metallicity, [M/H]. Once these three parameters are known for each star, evolutionary tracks and isochrones provide estimations of the mass, luminosity, age and distance (or upper limits in some cases). The method is original {{in the sense that it}} is distance-independent, i. e. the estimation of the stellar parameters does not require, as it happens in other works, the knowledge of the distance to the object.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients often express strong {{preferences}} for {{the forms of}} treatment available for their disease. Incorporating these preferences into the process of treatment decision-making might improve patients' adherence to treatment, contributing to better outcomes. We describe the methodology used in a study aiming to assess treatment outcomes when patients' {{preferences for}} treatment are closely matched to recommended treatments. Method Participants included patients with moderate and severe psoriasis attending outpatient dermatology clinics at the University Medical Centre Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Germany. A self-administered online survey used conjoint analysis to measure participants' preferences for psoriasis treatment options at the initial study visit. Physicians' treatment recommendations were abstracted from each participant's medical records. The Preference Matching Index (PMI), a measure of concordance between the participant's preferences for treatment and the physician's recommended treatment, was determined for each participant at t 1 (initial study visit). A clinical outcome measure, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and two participant-derived outcomes assessing treatment satisfaction and health related quality of life were employed at t 1, t 2 (twelve weeks <b>post-t</b> 1) and t 3 (twelve weeks <b>post-t</b> 2). Change in outcomes was assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The association between participants' PMI scores at t 1 and outcomes at t 2 and t 3 was evaluated using multivariate regressions analysis. Discussion We describe methods for capturing concordance between patients' treatment preferences and recommended treatment and for assessing its association with specific treatment outcomes. The methods are intended to promote the incorporation of patients' preferences in treatment decision-making, enhance treatment satisfaction, and improve treatment effectiveness through greater adherence. </p...|$|R
