We estimate the model using pool-level mortgage termination data for Freddie Mac <b>Participation</b> <b>Certificates,</b> and find {{that the effect of}} the house price factor on the results is both statistically and economically significant. Out-of-sample estimates of MBS prices produce option adjusted spreads of between 5 and 25 basis points, well within quoted values for these securities...|$|R
