It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European <b>public</b> <b>opinion.</b> In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> and gave the Community idea positive support.|$|E

40|$|Through the {{formation}} process of Chinese Internet <b>public</b> <b>opinions,</b> {{the influence of}} central government-oriented opinion leaders has been growing since 2012. These opinion leaders who are trained by the government shoulder the significant tasks of guiding the <b>public</b> <b>opinions</b> for the government. It {{is important for the}} research on Chinese Internet <b>public</b> <b>opinions</b> formation mechanism by analyzing the actions of these opinion leaders and their action mechanism, as well as the critical review {{of the role of the}} Internet in public communication. This study points out that the “Issue explanation frameworks” and “Information diffusion mechanism” are the important factors of the composition of opinion leadership. Then, taking the central party committee’s official mouthpiece “@People’s Daily” as an example, this study focuses on analyzing its opinion-leadership strategies in terms of “Issue explanation frameworks”, and analyzing its action mechanism in {{the formation}} process of Internet <b>public</b> <b>opinions</b> regarding “Information diffusion mechanism”, with content analysis and social network analysis theories...|$|R

5|$|In January 1937 Heydrich {{directed}} the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> and report back their findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, arrests, and interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over <b>public</b> <b>opinion.</b> In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler's proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich intensified {{the pressure on}} Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna stressing the common Germanic blood of the two countries. In the Anschluss on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E

The netizen behaviors {{are characterized by}} observation, imitation and learning, which well fits the hypothesis of bounded rationality in evolutionary games. In this paper, we define the “netizen acceptance degree” in cases of some social hot topics as the payoff in factor games, and build the evolutionary equation of <b>public</b> <b>opinions,</b> which is the infectious diseases diffusion model with changing population size. After that, we apply the theoretical model to the evolutionary course of pubic opinions in a real Internet emergency case, i. e., the “ 10. 24 Self-sacrifice Event” in China. The effects of Internet information supervision and control measures for social affairs on the evolutionary course of <b>public</b> <b>opinions</b> are discussed based on results of numerical simulation...|$|R

An improved -means algorithm for hotspot discovery in internet <b>public</b> <b>opinions</b> is presented based on the analysis of existing defects and calculation principle of original -means algorithm. First, some new methods are designed to preprocess website texts, select and express the characteristics of website texts, and define the similarity between two website texts, respectively. Second, clustering principle and the method of initial classification centers selection are analyzed and improved in order to overcome the limitations of original -means algorithm. Finally, the experimental results verify that the improved algorithm can improve the clustering stability and classification accuracy of hotspot discovery in internet <b>public</b> <b>opinions</b> when used in practice...|$|R

5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.|$|E
