5000|$|<b>Proligestone</b> (Delvosteron): A progestogen/antigonadotropin. Used in {{veterinary}} medicine only. Used to treat hypersexuality in dogs and cats. Most {{commonly used to}} control estrus in dogs and cats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Proligestone</b> ( [...] , [...] ) (brand names Corvinan, Delvosteron), {{also known}} as 14α,17α-propylidenedioxyprogesterone or as 14α,17α-dihydroxyprogesterone cyclic acetal with propionaldehyde, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group which was first described in 1968 and is marketed for use in veterinary medicine {{in a number of}} countries, including Argentina, Czechoslovakia, France, and the Netherlands. It is the C14α,17α cyclic ketal of 14α,17α-dihydroxyprogesterone.|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of prolonged spring oestrus in mares, {{which is often}} associated with multifollicular ovaries (MFO), are described {{in the context of the}} need to produce foals early in the year. The results obtained, in terms of pregnancy and time of ovulation, after the intramuscular administration of a single standard 15 -ml (1500 mg) dose of proligestonea are described and compared with data available for allyl trenbolone, b, which is given orally, and with accepted data for non-medicated mares. It is concluded that <b>proligestone</b> may be useful in treating MFO and that its use may even aid conception. This latter observation is worthy of further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{researchers}} {{analyzed the}} possibility to stop the estrous in bitches through the hormonal treatment. For this reason, during 2007 - 2009 sixteen bitches of different ages and breeds being in anestrous period were selected from clinics of Tirana district excluding bitches with health problems. For every case, the appearance of estrous cycle is determined through anamnesis, clinical examination and vaginal cytology. As a hormonal treatment for stopping cycling <b>Proligestone</b> (Covinan ®, Intervet) was used. The bitches were treated with injection in doses 20 mg kg• 1 or 0. 1 mL kg• 1 weigh SC. The statistical {{analysis of the data}} shows that the estrus appears 190 ± 14 days after the last treatment. Collateral effects were found after the last application of the hormonal treatment. The systemic application of the hormonal sub-stances for the prevention of the estrus results to be efficient, however other risk factors should be additionally considered...|$|E
40|$|Progestagens {{can be used}} {{to control}} the estrus of bitches and cats for {{contraceptive}} purposes. This implies the occurrence of both reproductive and non-reproductive side effects. However, other contraceptive methods such as surgical sterilization are alternatives of equal value. To investigate this matter, a survey about the use of progestagens in small animal practices was sent to 120 Flemish veterinarians, 80 of whom responded. The results show that surgical sterilization is recommended by 98 % of the veterinarians when owners require heat control of their animal. Nevertheless, the use of progestagens remains popular, with 71 % of the practices using them with dogs and 58 % using them with cats. The injectable formulations of medroxyprogesterone acetate and <b>proligestone</b> are mostly used in bitches, while the oral administration of megestrolacetate is most commonly used in cats. Increased appetite and body weight, neoplasia of the mammary gland and cystic endometrial hyperplasia/pyometra complex were the side effects most commonly noticed by veterinarians in both species...|$|E
40|$|A case of fibroepithelial {{hyperplasia}} of the {{mammary gland}} in {{the cat is}} reported. A seven-month-old female cat was presented for diffuse enlargement {{of all of the}} mammary glands. The cat was treated with <b>proligestone</b> (Covinan®) for the suppression of estrus. Four weeks later all 8 mammary glands were asymmetrically enlarged. There was ulceration of one gland. Sonographic imaging of the affected mammary glands showed homogeneous and granular structures. The patient was treated with subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg aglépristone (Alizine®) on days 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21. Within six weeks the mammary glands had completely regressed. No side effects were observed. It is the first case of fully documented feline mammary fibroepithelial hyperplasia and its treatment in the Czech Republic. Queen, progestin, antiprogestin, progesteron Feline mammary fibroepithelial hyperplasia is a growth disturbance of cats characterised by rapid, non-neoplastic proliferation of ductal epithelium and stroma of the mammary gland resulting in enlargement of one, several or all of the mammary glands (Allen 1973). Other terms for the same condition can by found in literature, including feline mammary hypertrophy, feline mammary fibroadenomatosis and fibroadenoma (Nimmo an...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{central to}} {{this study is that}} the implementation of a canine breeding and parasite control program in Aboriginal communities results in a reduction in the reservoir of zoonotic parasites within communities. The effect of the parasite and breeding control program on the health status of dogs as well as the population characteristics of dogs in communities was also investigated. The study was conducted in 17 Aboriginal communities of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, divided into three regions according to cultural and geographical attributes. All dogs from each community were permanently identified using a microchip system. Owners of dogs were asked the usual location of their animals, the origins of their dogs and the whereabouts of any missing animals at subsequent visits. Every three months dogs were treated with 200 ygikg iverrnectin (a potent endo- and ecto-parasiticide) subcutaneously and adult female dogs were treated with an injectable contraceptive (10 - 30 mgkg <b>proligestone)</b> at the request of their owners. At the time of treatment, dogs were assessed for ecto-parasites and photographs taken for later comparison and diagnosis of alopecic skin conditions. Faecal and blood samples were collected every three to six months and skin scrapings were collected from dogs that were refractory to treatment. The samples were used to determine internal parasite prevalence (using formal ethyl acetate sedimentation), blood parameters (for anaemia status) and evidence of scabies or Demodex infestation. A pilot study at one group of communities, involving weekly assessment of dogs after one iverrnectin treatment, showed that the treatment was effective in reducing the prevalence of scabies (as determined by clinical evaluation), hookworm and ticks. The treatment resulted in improvement in animal health as evidenced by a {{reduction in the number of}} dogs with anaemia. The long-term use of the ivermectin treatments at the other communities showed that over a period of three years, the prevalence of scabies and hookworm had reduced at most areas. The initial scabies prevalence varied from 17 to 52...|$|E
