5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms. His personal 12-point platform <b>prioritized</b> direct democracy, fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms. In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate. His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: “Prioritizing in Health Care – A {{challenge}} of the Welfare State?” It is a common fact that all resources are restricted. Health welfare {{becomes more and more}} expensive, due to better medication, new technology and administration. There is a need for <b>prioritizing,</b> but who has the responsibility, and how should it be done? In this report, you will read about where the <b>prioritizing</b> takes place in Denmark in different levels, and how <b>prioritizing</b> through economical evaluations afflict the social differences in the welfare state. In Great Britain and Norway the solution have been to collect all the different parts of involved in <b>prioritizing,</b> in one national prioritizing-council. Not only due to economical reasons, but also because of democratic difficulties in relation to <b>prioritizing</b> without informing the citizens about how it is done, and who is doing it. We have performed interviews with a medical doctor and a health economist to help us answer our questions and to use their knowledge and experience in our analysis. We have concluded that the <b>prioritizing</b> could be threatening the social equality, and therefore also threatening the welfare state as we know it. We have also concluded {{that a lot of people}} see a national council not only as a good idea, but also as a solution to the problems involved with <b>prioritizing</b> as of today...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of initiating a site-wide ergonomics evaluation process is <b>prioritizing</b> jobs to be analyzed. While injury data is important, other factors such as worker discomfort and physical exertion requirements, should be considered.

The approach described integrates the four sources using a decision matrix to <b>prioritize</b> jobs for ergonomics analysis...|$|R
5|$|Education was <b>prioritized</b> {{under the}} Ravalomanana {{administration}} (2002–09), {{and is currently}} free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13. The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level. During Ravalomanana's first term, thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, {{and tens of thousands}} of new primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.|$|E
5|$|Estudiantes, {{a modest}} {{neighborhood}} club and {{a relatively minor}} team in Argentina, had an unusual style that <b>prioritized</b> athletic preparation and achieving results at all costs. Led by coach Osvaldo Zubeldía and a team built around figures such as Carlos Bilardo, Oscar Malbernat and Juan Ramón Verón, {{went on to become}} the first ever tricampeon of the competition. The pincharratas won their first title in 1968 by defeating Palmeiras. They successfully defended the title in 1969 and 1970 against Nacional and Peñarol, respectively. Although Peñarol was the first club to win three titles, Estudiantes were the first to win three consecutive titles.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid {{troops in}} Palestine. On {{his way back}} to Aleppo, Salih {{captured}} a string of towns and fortresses, namely Ba'albak west of Damascus, Hims and Rafaniyya in central Syria, Sidon on the Mediterranean coast and Hisn Ibn Akkar in the hinterland of Tripoli. These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely <b>prioritized</b> control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and who feared that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It <b>prioritized</b> games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E

However, when forward Adam Pineault left Boston College {{to play in the}} Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, a scholarship was made available and York decided to keep Schneider on the roster.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who <b>prioritized</b> economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process of finding a {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in a marginal branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. If {{a new class of}} locomotives was to be built, it would have to satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started investigating whether any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the train weight to increase to , but the train had the steps for the voltage regulator and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be <b>prioritized</b> for branch lines.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team <b>prioritized</b> the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, DSHD {{initiated}} traffic {{surveys and}} studies to inform plans {{to construct a}} four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the DoverDelmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC <b>prioritized</b> completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, {{only a small portion}} of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{planning}} of the segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg considered 13 different initial route proposals. However, no analysis for possible rights-of-way south of Tønsberg or north of Barkåker were considered. In September 1999, the government presented their proposal for National Transport Plan 2002–11, which included three segments on the Vestfold Line: Holm–Nykirke, Barkåker–Tønsberg and Farriseidet–Porsgrunn. When Parliament passed {{the plan in}} February 2001, the Barkåker–Tønsberg segment was <b>prioritized</b> second on the Vestfold Line, after a new passing loop at Nykirke. National Transport Plan 2002–11 proposed that construction start in 2005, but by November 2002, the National Rail Administration delayed the plans, following investment cuts by Bondevik's Second Cabinet. In response, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that she was considering financing the project as a public–private partnership paid through a surcharge on tickets fares.|$|E
5|$|Monolith Soft {{was founded}} by Tetsuya Takahashi, a {{developer}} who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, {{he and his wife}} Kaori Tanaka (also known as Soraya Saga) would {{contribute to the development of}} multiple titles including entries in the Final Fantasy series. Following their work on Final Fantasy VI, Takahashi and Tanaka created a proposal for Final Fantasy VII; while deemed to dark for the Final Fantasy series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled Xenogears. Takahashi's ambition and drive prompted Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with Tanaka. Following the release of Xenogears, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square's business approach at the time, which <b>prioritized</b> their major intellectual properties including Final Fantasy. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects or continue his planned Xenogears series.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 2002, SAS {{announced}} that all handling services operated by Braathens {{would be taken}} over by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be <b>prioritized</b> in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case ended in the courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees, those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their seniority. The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying the employees their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in favor of the employees.|$|E
