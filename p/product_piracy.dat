We employ a game-theoretic model of duopoly competition. One firm offers a high-quality product facing quality-related costs. An imitator views the product and produces an imitation using a low-cost production method as 3 D printing. Our results indicate that copy protection by the high-quality firm yields a higher quality than under patent protection. However, the chosen quality level of the high-quality firm is highest in duopoly without protection. Optimal patent protection crucially depends on the underlying objective function. It is only socially optimal if the regulatory authority maximises GDP...|$|E

This will indeed be true, if hardware prices are fixed and the market is completely covered. With endogenous prices, however, price reactions to enabling of <b>product</b> <b>piracy</b> will offset the increase in market shares and copy protection will be set at the highest possible level.

In the absence of piracy, the monopolist has no incentive to differentiate its <b>products.</b> With <b>piracy</b> the monopolist might instead produce more than one quality, hence differentiation arises as the optimal strategy. This is because the producer wants to divert consumers from the pirated good to the original one.

Fashion and IT industries are affected negatively by consumers’supportive attitude towards piracy and counterfeits. Many luxury branded companies havetheir exclusive brand names stolen by counterfeits producers. Likewise producers ofcomputer software, music, and movies {{are affected by}} individuals who download/streamtheir items for free. Consumers’ attitudes towards counterfeiting and piracy are importantto examine as to understand their acceptance and rejection towards counterfeits and piracy. The purpose of this thesis is to examine consumers’ attitudes towards counterfeits andpiracy. What is accepted and rejected by consumers? To answer the research questions, aqualitative method is used. The data is collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 consumers of both/either counterfeits and piracy. The study is performed in Skåne(Scania), Sweden, mainly in Malmö, Perstorp and Kristianstad. We implemented the Theory of Reasoned Action, Theory of Moral Reasoning, ConsumerTheory and different attitudes for analysing the empirical presentation. The result of thestudy showed that the interviewees had a more accepting attitude towards piracy while themajority {{of them had a}} rejecting attitude towards counterfeits. Due to the fact thatcomputer and IT have {{become a part of the}} everyday life for many individuals. However,the interviewees who buy counterfeits consume the items while they are on vacationabroad since the supply of counterfeits in the Swedish market is not very big. When itcame to <b>piracy</b> and counterfeited <b>products,</b> the age of the interviewees did matter to someextent. Also, price was one important element why consumers are interested in counterfeitsor download piracy.

40|$|In recent years, {{product and}} brand piracy has {{significantly}} gained importance and risen to a worldwide mass phenomenon. According to an {{estimation of the}} OECD, the total annual business volume of counterfeiting and piracy worldwide exceeds several hundred billion Euros. Companies affected are not only burdened by commercial losses such as lost sales volume and lower sales prices, but also by decreasing brand value and company reputation, lower licence revenues and finally, by costs for counteractions against <b>product</b> <b>piracy.</b> Consequently, companies are gradually facing {{up to the challenge}} and taking action. Besides legal measures, an increasing number of firms is also willing to implement strategic and technical measures into their organisations respectively products. This development is in line with the results of a recent survey conducted by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, in which the highest success rates in the battle against <b>product</b> <b>piracy</b> were attributed to non-legal, i. e. strategic and technical actions. Nevertheless, the potential of these approaches is so far only being exploited to a limited extent. This is mainly due to lacking knowledge regarding the functionality and benefits of technical know-how protection mechanisms. Focusing on this issue, the paper introduces a new TRIZ-based methodology, the so called <b>Product</b> <b>Piracy</b> Conflict Matrix (PPC Matrix). The methodology has been designed to help companies to overcome a typical conflict, when it comes to developing non-legal protection schemes and implementing them into a running business: on the one hand, a burdened company quests for powerful protection strategies for its products or brand. On the other hand, the implementation of these strategies must not require excessive modifications to the considered product respectively the products value chain. For instance, a common demand from a companys point of view is that general product functionalities must not be noticeably affected by the implemented protection feature. In other cases, lightweight constraints or after sales service requirements for convenient maintainability have to be considered. Due to such restrictions, companies are often facing a deadlock situation when trying to implement protective measures against <b>product</b> <b>piracy.</b> The PPC Matrix methodically resembles the well-established TRIZ Contradiction Matrix and is also based on Neemanns work (2007), who recently introduced a new approach for product-based imitation protection including a set of technical, strategic, organisational and legal instruments.

40|$|We analyze how {{cases of}} {{unauthorized}} reproduction of a company's technology (‘product piracy’) influence the subsequent intellectual property (IP) protection strategy of around 200 German manufacturing companies. Specifically, we examine whether <b>product</b> <b>piracy</b> induces a stronger use of formal IP strategies or whether {{a shift to}} informal protection mechanisms occurs. Using propensity score matching, we compare companies with similar characteristics (e. g. prior IP strategy, business activities, industry affiliation, etc.). We find that imitation incidences induce a stronger use of formal protection rights, whereas for informal protection, we detect {{no significant differences between}} the copied companies and the control group. We are able to further distinguish this effect according to firm size and detect that it especially plays out for large firms. These insights raise the question whether large companies should reconsider their further focus on filing additional patents and take the strengths of the alternative protection mechanisms stronger into account. For small firms, our findings raise the concern of a restriction in scope of potential strategic response toward <b>product</b> <b>piracy.</b> On a policy level, the general and further pushed disadvantage for small- and medium-sized companies in the patent system generally calls for a policy initiative, which addresses this problem by addressing their resource constraints...|$|E

The employment opportunities in this industry, as well as its investments in research and technology are also significant. These investments are not without risk – in the highly competitive industry of video game production the chance of a video game being a commercial failure outweighs the chances of its success. Internet piracy of video game software has also undergone explosive growth and represents a significant problem for the entertainment software industry.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{identify}} and obtain structural results {{from two different}} issues that are motivated by new electronic commerce services and technologies. We study all problems from the consumer switching cost perspective. ^ Analyzing protection strategies for online software distribution {{is the subject of}} the first study. We consider a market that has two software producers, one of which protects its software while the other does not. Economic models are used to analyze different scenarios, and the result shows that when the software protection environment is fast improving, software firms should not protect their software <b>products,</b> since <b>piracy</b> can help them to lock in customers now and make higher profit in the near future. However, if the protection environment does not improve enough or even gets worse, firms that do not protect their software {{will not be able to}} benefit from the customers locked-in by pirate software, and they will be better-off protecting their software products. ^ The second part of the thesis addresses a new mobile electronic commerce model called Bar Code Shopping (BCS). By using BCS, a consumer can get price information from his or her mobile device by just scanning the Universal Product Code (UPC) on the product. Economic models are presented to analyze market segmentation and store 2 ̆ 7 s optimal pricing strategies when consumer switching costs are present.

40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the risk}} of intellectual property (IP) infringements by competitors from abroad and in particular whether this risk is higher for international innovating firms. We distinguish three different types of IP infringements from abroad: the usage of firms' technical inventions, <b>product</b> <b>piracy</b> and copying of corporate names and designs. Our analysis rests on the German data from the Europe-wide Community Innovation Survey (CIS). We use a unique data set of about 900 observations which are retrieved from two survey waves. While the earlier wave contains information about international and domestic innovation activities the later wave reports IP infringements. In a second analysis, the likelihood of infringements from innovation host countries and no innovation host countries abroad is examined. Before the empirical analysis, an explorative study {{has been carried out}} in China with interviews of German firms with innovation activities in China and with a legal advisor for small and medium sized German enterprises. The results show that firms with international R&D activities are increasing their chances to lose technological knowledge to their local competitors abroad. R&D activities in countries with weak intellectual property rights increase the risk for all types of infringement. Infringements by competitors from the host country are driven by the production of innovations in this country. Export intensity is the major driver of infringements from no innovation host countries. R&D activities in China and North America also increase {{the risk of}} an infringement. However, firms that innovate only in their home country experience significantly more <b>product</b> <b>piracy</b> cases than internationally innovating firms...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCorporate {{negative}} externalities occur when corporations place {{some of the}} costs of their profit-seeking activity onto society. This paper suggests that the current global problem of intellectual property crime is such an externality, and that it has not been recognised as such because corporations present <b>product</b> counterfeiting and <b>piracy</b> as crimes which reduce their revenue, rather than as predictable side effects of corporate production and merchandising, including branding activity, which have considerable socially deleterious consequences. It is argued that corporate actors are responsible for the socially harmful effects of the global counterfeiting problem in the following respects. Branding, advertising, and other corporate activities drive the market for goods which have a fashion value over and above their use value. While corporations 'create' this desire, they cannot prevent it being applied to the desire for fake or replica goods. Outsourcing of corporate production activities to developing countries to take advantage of cheap manufacturing and labour costs presents considerable opportunities to producers in those countries to copy and distribute the goods in an unauthorised way. Serious measures are not taken against product counterfeiters by rights-holding corporations, since market expediency dictates that the costs of counterfeiting are not so adverse to corporations to incentivise them to change their business methods. Counterfeit and pirated goods cause a range of social harms above and beyond the spuriously-costed financial damage corporate rights-holders suggest they suffer - these include the health and safety issues created by some fake goods, and the creation and maintenance of highly profitable organised crime activity in international markets for fake goods...|$|R

Among the viral gene {{products}} are the smallest proteins known to form functional K(+) channels. To determine if these viral K(+) channels are the <b>product</b> of molecular <b>piracy</b> from their hosts, {{we compared the}} sequences of the K(+) channel pore modules from seven phycodnaviruses to the K(+) channels from Chlorella variabilis and Ectocarpus siliculosus, whose genomes have recently been sequenced. C. variabilis is the host {{for two of the}} viruses PBCV- 1 and NY- 2 A and E. siliculosus is the host for the virus EsV- 1. Systematic phylogenetic analyses consistently indicate that the viral K(+) channels are not related to any lineage of the host channel homologs and that they are more closely related to each other than to their host homologs. A consensus sequence of the viral channels resembles a protein of unknown function from a proteobacterium. However, the bacterial protein lacks the consensus motif of all K(+) channels and it does not form a functional channel in yeast, suggesting that the viral channels did not come from a proteobacterium. Collectively, our results indicate that the viruses did not acquire their K(+) channel-encoding genes from their current algal hosts by gene transfer; thus alternative explanations are required. One possibility is that the viral genes arose from ancient organisms, which served as their hosts before the viruses developed their current host specificity. Alternatively the viral proteins could be the origin of K(+) channels in algae and perhaps even all cellular organisms...|$|R

This paper suggests that the current global problem of intellectual property crime is such an externality, and that it has not been recognised as such because corporations present <b>product</b> counterfeiting and <b>piracy</b> as crimes which reduce their revenue, rather than as predictable side effects of corporate production and merchandising, including branding activity, which have considerable socially deleterious consequences. It is argued that corporate actors are responsible for the socially harmful effects of the global counterfeiting problem in the following respects. Branding, advertising, and other corporate activities drive the market for goods which have a fashion value over and above their use value. While corporations ‘create’ this desire, they cannot prevent it being applied to the desire for fake or replica goods. Outsourcing of corporate production activities to developing countries to take advantage of cheap manufacturing and labour costs presents considerable opportunities to producers in those countries to copy and distribute the goods in an unauthorised way. Serious measures are not taken against product counterfeiters by rights-holding corporations, since market expediency dictates that the costs of counterfeiting are not so adverse to corporations to incentivise them to change their business methods. Counterfeit and pirated goods cause a range of social harms above and beyond the spuriously-costed financial damage corporate rights-holders suggest they suffer - these include the health and safety issues created by some fake goods, and the creation and maintenance of highly profitable organised crime activity in international markets for fake goods. This paper arose out of research undertaken for an overview of global trends in faking published as the chapter ‘Fakes’, in Brookman, Maguire, Pierpoint and Bennett (eds), Handbook on Crime (Willan, 2010). There is some overlap between the two texts. The core argument of this paper – of IPC as externality - appears here for the first time. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeveloping {{complex systems}} with the Systems Engineering {{approach}} requires a close collaboration between engineers. Today, this collaboration is often globalized and performed beyond enterprise boundaries. In order {{to maximize the}} engineering outcome and manageability, {{it is necessary to}} share and transfer engineering knowledge and intellectual property in a digital form. Knowledge is valuable and easy to copy hence it is often subject to intended theft or loss. This leads to substantial economic damages worldwide due to <b>product</b> <b>piracy</b> and plagiarism. The goal conflict between a wide availability of knowledge to system engineers and a secure management and usage of intellectual property is still unsolved. Legal and organizational measures, such as nondisclosure agreements and facility surveillance, are insufficient to solve the problem alone. Therefore industrial companies demand for new measures that effectively protect their intellectual property. This paper presents an analysis of current technical approaches that are applicable on securing knowledge in collaborative Systems Engineering. It shows that all approaches do not sufficiently cover the industry's knowledge security requirements. Hence a new knowledge security concept is introduced. It covers the specific requirements and constraints in the Systems Engineering context and provides a knowledge security improvement over the current technical approaches...|$|E
