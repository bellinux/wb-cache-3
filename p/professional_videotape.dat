40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{interactions between}} health providers and patients, using Semin and Fiedler 2 ̆ 7 s linguistic category model. In Study 1 the linguistic category model {{was used to}} examine perceptions of the levels of linguistic intergroup bias in descriptions of conversations with health professionals in hospitals. Results indicated a favourable linguistic bias toward health professionals in satisfactory conversations but low levels of linguistic intergroup bias in unsatisfactory conversations. In Study 2, the language of patients and health <b>professionals</b> in <b>videotaped</b> interactions was examined for levels of linguistic intergroup bias. Interpersonally salient interactions showed less linguistic intergroup bias than did intergroup ones. Results also indicate that health professionals have high levels of control in all types of medical encounters with patients. Nevertheless, the extent to which patients are able to interact with health professionals as individuals, rather than only as professionals is a key determinant of satisfaction with the interaction...|$|R
40|$|Oesophageal atresia is {{a common}} {{congenital}} anomaly, embracing a clinically heterogeneous group of patients concerning seriousness of the medical condition, additional malformations and complications. Increased risk for psychosocial problems among children with oesophageal atresia has been reported. However, {{this has not been}} studied with valid and reliable methods among infants and adolescents. This thesis explores physical problems, mental health, mother-infant interaction and other psychosocial factors in children with oesophageal atresia. The material on which the thesis is based comprised children operated during the neonatal period at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet in Oslo, Norway, in 1999 - 2002 and 1986 - 1990. These two populations were studied by age 13 months (infants) and 13 years (adolescents). The assessments were based on self-reports, interviews, <b>professional</b> observations and <b>videotaped</b> interactions. The results illuminate concerns related to emotional problems in children with oesophageal atresia, and may help clinicians to identify children at risk...|$|R

To develop a needs assessment tool {{for use with}} advanced cancer patients and caregivers, to prompt early intervation. A convenience sample of 103 health <b>professionals</b> viewed three <b>videotaped</b> consultations involving a simulated patient, his/her caregiver and a health professional, completed the Palliative Care Needs Assessment Tool (PC-NAT) and provided feedback on clarity, content and acceptability of the PC-NAT. Face and content validity, acceptability and feasibility of the PC-NAT were confirmed. Kappa scores indicated adequate inter-rater reliability {{for the majority of}} domains; the patient spirituality domain and the caregiver physical and family and relationship domains had low reliability. The PC-NAT can be used by health professionals with a range of clinical expertise to identify individuals' needs, thereby enabling early intervention. Further psychometric testing and an evaluation {{to assess the impact of}} the systematic use of the PC-NAT on quality of life, unmet needs and service utilisation of patients and caregivers are underway...|$|R
40|$|Forty-one health <b>professional</b> {{students}} were <b>videotaped</b> during three consecutive conditions: a 5 -min {{wait for a}} tardy interviewer, the structured interview for determining the Type A behavior pattern, and a 5 -min relaxation period. Afterward, subjects were classified as Type A or B based on audiotapes of the interview. The total amount of activity and the frequency or duration of Type A behaviors were compared between Type A and Type B subjects. In all three experimental conditions, Type A subjects moved their arms more than Type B subjects. During both the waiting and the relaxation periods, Type A subjects sat still less and spent more time exploring than did Type B subjects. During the interview, Type A subjects gestured more frequently than Type B subjects. Nonverbal behaviors correctly identified behavior pattern in 71 % of the subjects. The addition of nonverbal behaviors improved the discrimination of behavior pattern above that obtained from verbal behavior alone. The greater activity, restlessness, exploratory behavior, and gestures of Type A persons {{are consistent with the}} two major etiologies proposed for the Type A behavior pattern...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} ways of arguing in one culture {{are different from those}} in another culture within the context of negotiation. Specifically, this study compares the argument styles of negotiators from two cultures: The Japanese and the American. A negotiation in which Japanese and American business <b>professionals</b> role-played was <b>videotaped,</b> transcribed and analyzed as a case study. As a result of the argument analysis, two main differences are observed in the characteristics of Japanese and American argument styles. First, the American negotiator states his main point {{at the beginning of his}} argument while his Japanese counterpart explains the background information at the beginning. Second, the American negotiator solves the issues one by one by making a different argument for each issue, while his Japanese counterpart tends to attack the negotiation issues as a whole and repeats the same argument. From these observations, the article indicates that there are culturally distinctive ways of arguing and suggests that cultural differences in argument styles are fruitful areas for future intercultural negotiation study...|$|R
40|$|Young Americans grow up {{an ocean}} away from Europe, and most never leave their native land. They {{do not have}} the natural {{understanding}} for different cultures that comes from geographical proximity, and in particular they know little about the plight of Russia today or such European concerns as the arrival of the Euro or the dangerous conflagrations in the Balkan. In our rapidly globalizing society it is an important responsibility of teachers to break into this ignorance. I have designed and taught at the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, USA, a prototypical course, unique in the world, in which a full year in secondary school is devoted to the history of Russia and Europe since the Second World War. The course opens with a retrospective study of Marxism-Leninism, Stalin and the Second World War. Then chronological and thematic studies {{of the history of the}} area since 1945, on the one hand, is balanced by almost daily analysis of international current events on the other hand. College-level textbooks, newspapers, <b>professional</b> journals, many <b>videotapes</b> and discussions with visiting experts round out the course. This paper concludes with a detailed description of those instructional materials that have proved the most beneficial and successful...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the role of voice, text and body language in message decoding by native Italian speakers. To the purpose, a script based on a real life situation - the discovery of a partner’s affair - was written. Non <b>professional</b> actors were <b>videotaped</b> while reciting the story in a neutral environment. No props, no costumes were indeed used to indicate environments and characters. The collected corpus of speech was segmented into syllables, then the syllables of the original dialogue were replaced with number sequences. The actors read the new dialogue based on numbers without phrasing, inflection, and intonation, but pausing according to the silences marked in the text. The numeric dialogue was segmented into syllables and then, through the transplantation technique, the prosodic features of the original dialogue were transferred to the dialogue based on number. After that, three tests were administered to three groups of native Italian subjects. One group listened only to the numeric text with the prosody transplanted from the original dialogue, another watched the silent video of the performance, the last group listened to the original dialogue. After each phase subjects were administered a questionnaire intended to test the comprehension of the story in terms of setting, participants and emotions. The results of the three tests have showed that each communication channel gives a specific contribution to the message decoding. From the ‘voice’ component, it is possible to understand the kind of relationship between participants and to define their emotions with greater accuracy. Setting, participants, and actions were understood through the video, by means of body language. The ‘text’ component contributes providing details regarding the names of participants, the specific kind of place where the story takes place and the marriage relationship between the man and the betrayed woman...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how therapists' use of humor in psychotherapy would affect subjects' ratings of those therapists. Short excerpts illustrating different levels of humor were developed by having four <b>professional</b> therapists view <b>videotapes</b> of actual therapy sessions and rate the therapists on amount of humor used. Interjudge agreement was obtained on six excerpts. These six included two excerpts in which the therapists were judged to have used no humor, two in which the therapists were judged to have used a slight amount of humor and two in which the therapists were judged to have used a moderate amount of humor. These six excerpts were then viewed and rated by 72 subjects on the dimensions of empathy, respect, warmth, genuineness, concreteness and self-disclosure. It was found that significant differences existed between all three humor groups on the condition of respect. The group judged to have used no humor was rated superior to the two groups using humor in amount to respect shown by the therapists to the clients. When the two groups judged to have used humor were compared, the group in which the therapists used more humor was rated significantly lower than the group judged to have used a slight amount of humor. It was concluded that subjects' ratings on the condition of respect decreased as greater amounts of humor were introduced by the therapists. Significant differences were not found between humor groups on the conditions of empathy, warmth, genuineness, concreteness and self-disclosure. However, the pattern observed in the subjects' ratings on the conditions of empathy and warmth suggested that the ratings given to therapists decreased as amount of humor increased. The results on the conditions of genuineness and concreteness were inconclusive. On the condition of self-disclosure, the pattern observed in the ratings suggested that a direct relationship existed between amount of humor and ratings received...|$|R
