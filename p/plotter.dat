5|$|Gunpowder <b>Plotter</b> Guy Fawkes {{is remembered}} during the {{carnival}} season, including a grand illuminated procession through Bridgwater town centre, which culminates in the Squibbing.. Bridgwater, being staunchly Protestant {{at the time}} of the plot celebrated the thwarting of the conspiracy with particular enthusiasm.|$|E
50|$|Electrostatic <b>plotters</b> used a dry toner {{transfer}} process {{similar to}} that in many photocopiers. They were faster than pen <b>plotters</b> and were available in large formats, suitable for reproducing engineering drawings. The quality of image was often not as good as contemporary pen <b>plotters.</b> Electrostatic <b>plotters</b> were made in both flat-bed and drum types.|$|R
5000|$|Pen <b>plotters</b> {{typically}} process vector images. Inkjet based <b>plotters</b> can adequately reproduce all four.|$|R
5000|$|Electrostatic <b>plotters</b> {{were known}} {{in the early days}} of {{computer}} graphics; by 1967, several manufacturers commercially supplied electrostatic <b>plotters.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the 1950s more {{dangerous}} criminal elements {{took advantage of}} Galveston's lax law enforcement {{and the absence of}} the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK <b>plotter</b> David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} morning, the loyalist forces had collapsed. Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup <b>plotter</b> Đôn promised them safe passage out of the country. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E
5|$|James Ferguson—known as the Sheriff, {{reflecting}} the post he held, recognised by the Society of Advocates—bought the Pitfour estate after selling {{the lands of}} Badifurrow. He had inherited Badifurrow after demanding that his uncle Robert Ferguson should appear in court if he wished to contest the inheritance. Robert, nicknamed the <b>Plotter,</b> was in hiding to avoid charges of treachery, and after his non-appearance in court James Ferguson's inheritance was confirmed in mid-June 1700. At that time the estate contained only a small country house.|$|E
50|$|As use of <b>plotters</b> has waned, the large-format {{printers}} {{that have}} largely replaced them {{have come to}} be called <b>plotters</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Pen <b>plotters</b> became {{obsolete}} {{with the}} adoption of ink-jet printers, and processors fast enough to rasterize complex images. Houston Instrument and other manufacturers would follow with similar <b>plotters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pen-based <b>plotters</b> were an {{alternate}} printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based <b>plotters</b> rely on {{contact with the}} paper (but not impact, per se) and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images. Since the pens output continuous lines, {{they were able to}} produce technical drawings of higher resolution than was achievable with dot-matrix technology. [...] Some <b>plotters</b> used roll-fed paper, and therefore had minimal restriction {{on the size of the}} output in one dimension. These <b>plotters</b> were capable of producing quite sizable drawings.|$|R
5|$|The {{reception}} of The Desert Fox in Britain was enthusiastic: the book went through eight editions in a year. Young's biography was another {{step in the}} development of the Rommel myth, with Rommel emerging as an active, if not a leading, <b>plotter.</b> Speidel contributed as well, starting, from the early 1950s, to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, thus boosting Speidel's suitability for a future role in the new military force of the Federal Republic, the Bundeswehr, and then in NATO.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{figures in}} the new Parliament {{included}} Lord Melville, a Rye House <b>Plotter</b> who joined William's court in 1683 and the Earl of Stair, {{a former member of}} James VII's administration. In 1689 Melville became Secretary of State over Scotland, with Stair appointed Lord Advocate. The first session ended in a stalemate between Crown and Parliament over the abolition of Episcopacy and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body used by the Scottish Crown to control legislation. Parliament refused to approve taxes or accept nominations for legal officers, closing the law courts. William retaliated by withholding Royal Assent which prevented the implementation of Parliamentary legislation.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator <b>plotter</b> and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5000|$|It {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of <b>plotters</b> (both drum and flat-bed), digitizers, thermal transfer color printers, thermal <b>plotters</b> (InfoWorld June 13, 1994 p. 40) and other graphic input/output devices.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Plotters</b> School is {{also said}} to have existed {{in one of the}} local houses and the trainee <b>plotters</b> are {{believed}} to have used bicycles and megaphones as teaching aids.|$|R
50|$|Houston Instruments {{was another}} {{manufacturer}} of pen <b>plotters.</b> They used the DMPL plotting control language. They competed with Hewlett Packard <b>plotters</b> {{such as the}} HP 7470.They were purchased by Summagraphics.|$|R
5|$|Elections in 1936 were {{won by a}} {{grouping}} of left-wing parties united as the Popular Front. The right began to conspire {{as to how to}} best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it. The government was weak, and Azaña led a minority government. Pacification and reconciliation would have been a huge task. Acts of violence and reprisals spiralled. In April, parliament replaced Zamora with Azaña as president. However, Azaña was increasingly isolated from everyday politics; his replacement, Casares Quiroga, was weak. This was a watershed event which inspired conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics. CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army <b>plotter</b> Emilio Mola. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil-Robles as the right's leading spokesman in Parliament. Prieto did his best to avoid revolution, promoting a series of public works and civil order reforms, including parts of the military and civil guard. Communists quickly took over the ranks of socialist organisations, scaring the middle classes. Several generals decided that the government had to be replaced if the dissolution of Spain was to be prevented. They held professional politicians in contempt.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, an {{underground}} Jewish resistance organisation was formed at Treblinka {{with the goal}} of seizing control of the camp and escaping to freedom. The planned revolt was preceded by a long period of secret preparations. The clandestine unit was first organised by a former Jewish captain of the Polish Army, Dr. Julian Chorążycki, who was described by fellow <b>plotter</b> Samuel Rajzman as noble and essential to the action. His organising committee included Zelomir Bloch (leadership), Rudolf Masaryk, Marceli Galewski, Samuel Rajzman, Dr. Irena Lewkowska ("Irka", from the sick bay for the Hiwis), Leon Haberman, Hershl (Henry) Sperling from Częstochowa, and several others. Chorążycki (who treated the German patients) killed himself with poison on 19 April 1943 when faced with imminent capture, so that the Germans could not discover the plot by torturing him. The next leader was another former Polish Army officer, Dr. Berek Lajcher, who arrived on 1 May. Born in Częstochowa, he had practised medicine in Wyszków and was expelled by the Nazis to Wegrów in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting <b>plotter.</b> On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E
50|$|On 13 February 1976, coup <b>plotters,</b> led by Army Col. Dimka, marked him, Murtala {{and other}} senior {{military}} personnel for assassination. Murtala was {{killed during the}} attempted coup, but Obasanjo escaped death. The low profile security policy adopted by Murtala had allowed the <b>plotters</b> easy access to their targets. The coup was foiled because the <b>plotters</b> missed Obasanjo and General Theophilus Danjuma, chief of army staff and de facto number three man in the country. The <b>plotters</b> failed to monopolize communications, although {{they were able to}} take over the radio station to announce the coup attempt.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>plotters</b> {{could shoot}} Hitler during {{dinner in the}} mess. This option was also {{abandoned}} {{for many of the}} <b>plotters</b> abhorred the idea of shooting an unarmed man and would not go along.|$|R

25|$|Hasso von Boehmer, German Lieutenant Colonel on the General Staff and 20 July <b>plotter,</b> {{temporarily}} {{detained in}} the camp's clinic in 1944 due to illness. He was {{then moved to}} Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Its {{facilities}} included CNC machines, Master CAM licensed {{copies of}} Ansys 6.4, I-ideas AutoCAD-2004 in the CAD/CAM laboratory setup, etc. The CAD/CAM aided lab had 25 systems connected with True colour Resolution monitors of 21inches, Digital <b>Plotter,</b> Scanner.|$|E
50|$|Some Hewlett-Packard pen <b>plotters</b> had two-axis pen {{carriers}} and stationery paper (plot size was limited). However, the moving-paper H-P <b>plotters</b> had grit wheels (akin to machine-shop grinding wheels) which, {{on the first}} pass, indented the paper surface, and collectively maintained registration.|$|R
50|$|Vector {{graphics}} printing {{was left}} to special-purpose devices, called <b>plotters.</b> Almost all <b>plotters</b> did share a common command language, HPGL, but were of limited use for anything other than printing graphics. In addition, they tended to be expensive and slow, and thus rare.|$|R
50|$|Laser {{printers}} {{combine the}} best features of both printers and <b>plotters.</b> Like <b>plotters,</b> laser printers offer high quality line art, and like dot-matrix printers, {{they are able}} to generate pages of text and raster graphics. Unlike either printers or <b>plotters,</b> however, a laser printer makes it possible to position high-quality graphics and text on the same page. PostScript made it possible to fully exploit these characteristics, by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer.|$|R
25|$|PCB milling uses {{a two or}} three-axis {{mechanical}} milling system to mill away the copper foil from the substrate. A PCB milling machine (referred to as a 'PCB Prototyper') operates {{in a similar way}} to a <b>plotter,</b> receiving commands from the host software that control the position of the milling head in the x, y, and (if relevant) z axis.|$|E
25|$|Abacha's {{military}} career is distinguished by {{a string of}} successful coups. He is by some records the most successful coup <b>plotter</b> {{in the history of}} Nigeria's military. Abacha, then a 2nd Lieutenant with the 3rd Battalion in Kaduna, took part in the July 1966 Nigerian counter-coup from the conceptual stage. He may have been a participant in the Lagos or Abeokuta phases of the coup the previous January as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{his memoirs}} Pinochet {{said that he}} was the leading <b>plotter</b> of the coup and had used his {{position}} as commander-in-chief of the Army to coordinate a far-reaching scheme with the other two branches of the military and the national police. In later years, however, high military officials from the time have said that Pinochet reluctantly became involved only {{a few days before the}} coup was scheduled to occur, and followed the lead of the other branches (especially the Navy, under Merino) as they executed the coup.|$|E
50|$|Pen <b>plotters</b> print {{by moving}} a pen or other {{instrument}} {{across the surface}} of a piece of paper. This means that <b>plotters</b> are vector graphics devices, rather than raster graphics as with other printers. Pen <b>plotters</b> can draw complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently creating a solid region of color, but can hatch an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.|$|R
50|$|HP-GL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language; often {{written as}} HPGL) is a printer control {{language}} created by Hewlett-Packard (HP). HP-GL {{was the primary}} printer control language used by HP <b>plotters.</b> It later became a standard for almost all <b>plotters.</b> Hewlett-Packard's printers also usually support HP-GL/2 in addition to PCL.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-to-late 2000s {{artists and}} hackers began to rediscover pen <b>plotters</b> as quirky, {{customizable}} output devices. The {{quality of the}} lines produced by pens on paper {{is quite different from}} other digital output techniques. Even 30-year-old pen <b>plotters</b> typically still function reliably, and many were available for less than $100 on auction and resale websites. While support for driving pen <b>plotters</b> directly or saving files as HPGL has disappeared from most commercial graphics applications, several contemporary software packages make working with HPGL on modern operating systems possible.|$|R
