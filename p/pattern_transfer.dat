Then the mold, which has predefined topological patterns, is brought into contact with the sample and they are pressed together under certain pressure. When heated up above the glass transition temperature of the polymer, the pattern on the mold is pressed into the softened polymer film. After being cooled down, the mold is separated from the sample and the pattern resist is left on the substrate. A <b>pattern</b> <b>transfer</b> process (reactive ion etching, normally) can be used to transfer the pattern in the resist to the underneath substrate.|$|E

Nano-contact printing is an alternative solution which relies on the specificity of DNA to direct molecules into precise patterns. This study attempts to find the limitations of nano-contact printing through the printing of oligonucleotide monolayers. Eight <b>pattern</b> <b>transfers</b> were made with one master copy and the oligonucleotide surface coverage was analyzed using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The oligonucleotide surface coverage on the master increased slightly, while the surface coverage on the <b>pattern</b> <b>transfers</b> decreased. One {{possible explanation for the}} trends is that the decrease in contact between master and secondary substrate is due to both the accumulation of dirt and the wear and tear of' the master. By improving the contact between master and secondary substrate, the printing method can be expanded from printing monolayers to high resolution patterns. by Angela Tong. Thesis (S. B.)
