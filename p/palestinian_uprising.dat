On April 25, Time Magazine reported that many Middle East leaders had condemned the hijacking because it had shifted focus away from the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against Israel that had commenced a few months earlier. It also frustrated already tense relations between Iran and the PLO. The Kuwait government believed the hijacking to be the work of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shi'ite group based in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|On 26 September 2002, {{after an}} Israeli airstrike wounded Mohammed Deif, {{the leader of}} Hamas's {{principal}} armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Jabari became the commander and operational head of the military wing {{at the height of}} the Second Intifada (the armed <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against Israel from 2000–2007). However, Deif remains its official head. According to Hamas political leader Ayman Taha, since Jabari took over the al-Qassam Brigades' day-to-day operations, Hamas's armed wing became increasingly professional. During the course of the Intifada, he directed several attacks against Israel, including suicide bombings, that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians and soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In December 1987, the First Intifada began. The First Intifada was a mass <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against Israeli {{rule in the}} Palestinian territories. The {{rebellion}} {{began in}} the Jabalia refugee camp and quickly spread throughout Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinian actions ranged from civil disobedience to violence. In addition to general strikes, boycotts on Israeli products, graffiti and barricades, Palestinian demonstrations that included stone-throwing by youths against the Israel Defense Forces brought the Intifada international attention. The Israeli army's heavy handed response to the demonstrations, with live ammunition, beatings and mass arrests, brought international condemnation. The PLO, which until then had never been recognised as {{the leaders of the}} Palestinian people by Israel, was invited to peace negotiations the following year, after it recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} the British {{military}} and security formula in Palestine was the smooth establishment of the Jewish national home with minimum costs of lives and money. However, this British pro-Zionist policy created a continuous security problem, {{and opened the door}} to all possibilities of <b>Palestinian</b> revolts and <b>uprisings</b> of both national and religious nature. The British were very active in disarming the Arabs and adopted stringent measures to crush their uprisings and revolts. But, they {{turned a blind eye to}} the Jewish arms smuggling and Jewish military organizations, especially, the Hagana, which later became the backbone of the Israeli Army. During <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> of 1920, 1921 and 1929 against the Zionists, most of the Palestinian casualties were inflicted by the British forces despite the fact that the Palestinians avoided attacking the British. The British-Zionist cooperation reached its peak during the Palestinian revolt of 1936 - 1939, and took different forms, including allowing the Jews to establish a military force of twenty two thousand men under the pretext of protecting the Jewish community...|$|R

25|$|He rose to {{national}} prominence for {{his pursuit of}} civil rights of Muslim-Americans and raising awareness of the Palestinian plight. Al-Arian criticized the peace process led by Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and advocated support for the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> against Israeli occupation during the 1980s and early 1990s. On October 20, 1988, Al-Arian established the Islamic Concern Project, which included a committee devoted to raising charity for Palestine. In 1990–91, his continued involvement in promoting dialogue between the West and Middle East {{led to the creation}} of World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), which served as a think tank that promoted public policy initiatives. WISE and University of South Florida formally agreed to cooperate on March 11, 1992. WISE published journals, supported graduate student education, and held seminars between American and Middle Eastern scholars.|$|R
25|$|The Israeli {{response}} to the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> was harsh. The IDF killed many Palestinians {{at the beginning of}} the Intifada, the majority killed during demonstrations and riots. Since initially a high proportion of those killed were civilians and youths, Yitzhak Rabin adopted a fallback policy of 'might, power and beatings'. Israel used mass arrests of Palestinians, engaged in collective punishments like closing down West Bank universities for most years of the uprising, and West Bank schools for a total of 12 months. Round-the-clock curfews were imposed over 1600 times in just the first year. Communities were cut off from supplies of water, electricity and fuel. At any one time, 25,000 Palestinians would be confined to their homes. Trees were uprooted on Palestinians farms, and agricultural produce blocked from being sold. In the first year over 1,000 Palestinians had their homes either demolished or blocked up. Settlers also engaged in private attacks on Palestinians. Palestinian refusals to pay taxes were met with confiscations of property and licenses, new car taxes, and heavy fines for any family whose members had been identified as stone-throwers.|$|E

40|$|This volume {{analyzes}} {{the conduct of}} the Israel Defence Forces' (IDF) counter-insurgency operations during the two major <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> (1987 - 1993 and 2000 - 2005) in the Territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It employs primary and secondary resources to produce a comprehensive analysis on whether or not the IDF has been able to adapt its conventional conduct of warfare to the realities of the Israeli-Palestinian low-intensity conflict and achieve any sort of victory over the Palestinian insurgents. Sergio Catignani provides new insights into how conventional armies struggle with contemporary insurgency by looking in particular at the strategic, operational, tactical and ethical dilemmas of the IDF over the last two decades. By examining {{the way in which the}} IDF and the Israeli security doctrine were formed and developed over time, he explores the extent to which Israeli security assumptions, civil-military relations, the organizational culture, command and control structure, and conduct of the IDF have affected its adaptation to the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian low-intensity conflict. Israeli Counter-Insurgency and the Intifadas will be of much interest to students of low-intensity conflict and counter-insurgency, the Israeli army, the Middle Eastern conflict and strategic studies in general...|$|R

2500|$|The First Intifada or First Palestinian Intifada [...] (also known {{simply as}} the intifada or intifadah) was a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against the Israeli {{occupation}} of the West Bank and Gaza.

2500|$|The Second Intifada, also [...] {{known as}} the Al-Aqsa Intifada ( [...] Intifādat El-Aqtzah), was the second <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprising</b> against Israel – a period of {{intensified}} Israeli–Palestinian violence.

40|$|From the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>uprisings</b> to the Arab Spring, {{politics}} in the Middle East is often spectacularly represented by the visual images of (male) youths battling state forces in the street. This article seeks an examination of political and cultural change in the region {{from a different perspective}} by asking how the everyday lives of young(er) people – boys and girls alike – are implicated in such transformation. In doing so, this article seeks to highlight how young people act as agents of change not only in ‘The Street’, but also in the more mundane and intimate spaces of alleyways, doorsteps and homes. Through an examination of the everyday mobility of Palestinian girls and boys in a West Bank refugee camp, this article demonstrates how questions over access to space in the camp are central to the lives of young people, as well as to broader political struggles in Palestine and the region. Girls living in Balata Camp often see restrictions to their access to space as being the result of both internal Palestinian social inequality as well as the overarching geography of occupation and displacement. Girls often advocate for greater access to space in the camp by making appeals to both the Palestinian national struggle as well as Islamic ethics of gender equality and justice. By arguing that healthy girls and boys are better able to grow and resist occupation with new and spacious places of play in the camp, these young people mark a significant departure from the politics of older generations who have steadfastly avoided outward improvements to the camp out of a desire to maintain their refugee identity and right of return. Beyond their advocacy for greater access to space, girls in Balata also use a variety of embodied tactics and strategies to evade, resist and make do with the spatial restrictions imposed upon them. Counterintuitively, many girls use their spatial restriction to their advantage by using their time at home to study. Many hope that their academic achievement will enhance both their upward and lateral mobility later in life. In contrast, although boys are viewed as having the privilege of greater mobility in the camp, many boys complain that they have no quiet places to study and that the streets they play in are often violent and crowded. With mounting family obligations and dismal employment prospects, many boys see little hope in achieving a better life through education. By looking at how girls and boys negotiate access to everyday space, this article demonstrates how children’s lives are implicated in the broader politics of public space and gender in the Middle East...|$|R
2500|$|In June 1985, Israel withdrew most of {{its troops}} from Lebanon, leaving a {{residual}} Israeli force and an Israeli-supported militia in southern Lebanon as a [...] "security zone" [...] and buffer against attacks on its northern territory. Since then, IDF fought for many years against the Shia organization Hezbollah, which became a growing threat to Israel. By July 1985, Israel's inflation, buttressed by complex index linking of salaries, had reached 480% per annum and was {{the highest in the}} world. Peres introduced emergency control of prices and cut government expenditure successfully bringing inflation under control. The currency (known as the old Israeli shekel) was replaced and renamed the Israeli new shekel at a rate of 1,000 old shkalim = 1 new shekel. In October 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunis. Growing Israeli settlement and continuing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, led to the first <b>Palestinian</b> Intifada (<b>uprising)</b> in 1987, which lasted until the Madrid Conference of 1991, despite Israeli attempts to suppress it. Human rights abuses by Israeli troops led a group of Israelis to form B'Tselem, an organization devoted to improving awareness and compliance with human rights requirements in Israel.|$|R

40|$|In {{explaining}} suicide bombing, rational-choice theorists such as Robert A. Pape {{argue that}} non-state insurgent organizations resort to suicide bombing {{as a way}} of dislodging an occupying state army from land the insurgents view as their homeland. However, suicide bombings during the second <b>Palestinian</b> intifada (<b>uprising),</b> from 2000 to 2004, complicate this view of suicide bombing, in which insurgents in nationalist organizations recruit, train and deploy suicide bombers in pursuit of political concessions. This is so as suicide bombings were carried out in greatly increased numbers during the second intifada, with insurgents often being approached by would-be suicide bombers, who demanded to be sent on “missions. ” In this thesis I seek to understand why Palestinian support for suicide bombings directed at civilians surged upwards after the second intifada had erupted, in contrast to earlier periods. A primary tool used to answer this question is ethnography (using existing interviews and biographical information compiled by previous researchers and journalists), which looks for answers from the participants themselves, usually through interviews of bombers’ friends and family members, and insurgents. In fact, many of the interviewees cited in this thesis concur that many suicide bombings were embarked upon and public support for them spiked upwards because of anger at Israeli security actions, especially the use of live ammunition on demonstrators. Biographical information on suicide bombers also supports this hypothesis. I also look at the role played by the generational conflict between the older generation of Palestinian secular nationalists and the younger generation of religious-nationalists, namely Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, in driving the violence of the suicide bombing phenomenon. This approach can provide a corrective to rational-choice theories, as it provides access to a greater level of participant-centered detail. ...|$|R
50|$|In December 1981, the Israeli Knesset {{voted to}} extend Israeli law {{to the part}} of the Golan Heights over which Israel {{retained}} control. The UN Security Council subsequently passed a resolution calling on Israel to rescind this measure. Syria participated in the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid in October 1991. Negotiations were conducted intermittently through the 1990s, and came very close to succeeding. However, the parties were unable to come to an agreement due to President Bill Clinton's failure to consult with the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad during the negotiating process, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's backtracking {{on the issue of the}} northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee and Syria's nonnegotiable demand that Israel withdraw to the positions it held on 4 June 1967 (which meant Israel would relinquish its claim to territory occupied by the Syrians in the early 1950s in contravention to the 1949 Armistice Agreement—including the north-eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee). A major stumbling-block was that in response to Israel's demand that the entire Golan from the Jordan River to the outskirts of Damascus be demilitarized the Syrians demanded that Israel demilitarize all its territory to a similar distance from the new border. This was not acceptable to Israel as it would have effectively left all of northern Israel between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea (more than a quarter of Israel), including the entire length of Israel's border with Lebanon, completely defenceless. The peace negotiations collapsed following the outbreak of the second <b>Palestinian</b> (Intifada) <b>uprising</b> in September 2000, though Syria continues to call for a comprehensive settlement based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace formula adopted at the 1991 Madrid conference.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, implementation, and lessons from {{a case study}} in transforming two university classrooms into what we call an international “peace incubator. ” In the besieged Gaza Strip, opportunities for normalization of relations with Israel are almost non-existent, and there is very limited desire or personal capacity among the student population of Gaza to do the work of peace-building. A semester-long videoconference class linking IUPUI and Gaza University students sought to address this deficit by developing a model for building ties of friendship and cooperation. West Bank peace activist Juliano Mer Khamis once spoke of a coming Third <b>Palestinian</b> Intifada (or <b>uprising)</b> that would be mounted through art, music, poetry and film. Inspired by his dedication to long term peacebuilding, we set about opening a channel of communication through our classroom experiment to allow the students to see beyond the negative stereotypes and allow friendship and understanding to flourish. Our experiment was designed to not only promote trust between US and Palestinian faculty and students, but to also creatively endorse Mer Khamis’ strategy for peace-building, and giving voice to those struggling to be heard...|$|R
