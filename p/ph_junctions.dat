Substantially lower peaks were obtained with 0. 19 mol L− 1 formic acid when compared to 0. 019 and 0. 0019 mol L− 1 concentrations, which was confirmed by computer simulation studies to be due to the inadequate movement of the pH boundary for stacking.

40|$|This study {{describes}} various {{strategies to}} improve the sensitivity of carbohydrate analysis in capillary electrophoresis (CE). The use of pH stacking is investigated in conjunction with 5 -aminofluorescein as a derivatisation agent for the sensitive analysis of simple sugars such as glucose, lactose and maltotriose by CE. The derivatisation agent was {{selected on the basis}} of its extremely high molar absorptivity, its compatibility with a 488 nm light-emitting diode (LED) and the fact that it has two ionisable groups making it compatible with on-line stacking using a dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction.</b> The influence of both acetic and formic acids were investigated with regard to both derivatisation efficiency and the ability to stack using a dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction.</b> Superior sensitivity and resolution was obtained in formic acid over acetic acid. Simulation studies combined with experimental data showed the separation with the best resolution and greatest sensitivity when the carbohydrates were derivatised with the 95 mM formic acid. Using this method efficiencies of 150, 000 plates and detection limits at 8. 5 x 10 ⁻⁸ M for mono-, di- and tri-saccharides were achieved. The current system demonstrates a 515 times improvement factoring sensitivity when compared to using a normal deuterium (D₂) lamp, and 16 times improvement over other systems using lightemitting diodes (LEDs). A novel fluorescent tag, 0 - 2 -[aminoethyl]fluorescein, was developed for the separation of sugars by CE with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection using an argon ion laser. The tag was synthesised using three consecutive steps namely: esterification, alkylation and hydrolysis, specifically designed to offer a flexible way in which to make an assortment of fluorescent tags from cheap and readily available starting reagents (typically less than 1 per g of fluorescent tag). 0 - 2 -[Aminoethyl]fluorescein was equipped with a spacer group to lower steric effects between the fluorescein backbone and the reducing end of the carbohydrate which were anticipated {{to improve the}} reactivity of the tag. Fluorescence studies of the novel tag revealed a quantum yield (QY) of 0. 24, when using fluorescein as a standard. Kinetic studies were also conducted to compare and assess the performance of aromatic and aliphatic amines using the novel tag and two commercial fluorescent fluorescein motifs where the aromatic amine derivative demonstrated better labelling performance. The separation performance of all the tags was also benchmarked using a range of corn syrup oligosaccharides. The application of the novel tag to a set of oligosaccharides produced a baseline separation of seven different sugar units, with 1 nM detection limit for maltoheptaose. A CE method was designed with on-line concentration which can be translated directly to a microchip format allowing preconcentration via dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction.</b> Optimisation of the separation selectivity yielded best separations using a 170 mM ammonium borate buffer at pH 8. 60 in an acrylamide coated capillary. When using the current system via LIP, limits of detection (LODs) as low as 0. 13 nM for maltose were obtained, which were 10 times lower than could be achieved without on-line concentration. In order to implement this system in a glass/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchip, the low pH sample was introduced into the microchannels via a cathodic pH independent electro-osmotic flow (EOF) generated using a polyelectrolyte multilayer coating. Microchip separations of maltose, glucose, galactose and allose with dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction,</b> were achieved within 120 s, with the limit of detection (LOD) of maltose using a light-emitting diode induced fluorescence (LEDIF) detection system being 790 nM.

40|$|A dual {{stacking}} mechanism based on transient isotachophoresis (TITP) and induced <b>pH</b> <b>junction</b> focusing is demonstrated {{as a means}} to increase the concentration sensitivity in capillary electrophoresis of highly saline samples. When stacking was carried out with an unbuffered saline sample of fluorescein between two zones of low mobility background electrolyte at high pH under an electric field of reverse polarity, two transient peaks at both boundaries of the sample zone were observed. One peak at the rear boundary could be inferred as a transient isotachophoretic stacked zone. Through computer simulations of an unbuffered sample with a high concentration of sodium chloride, we showed that the fast moving zones of sodium and chloride ions induced pH changes at both boundaries to satisfy the electroneutrality condition and that the peak at the front boundary was due to the induced <b>pH</b> <b>junction.</b> To verify the pH changes, an indicator, thymol blue, was added to an NaCl solution and the color changes under an electric field were observed. The proposed mechanism was supported by observing the dual stacking procedure for an unbuffered sample of 4 -nitrophenol and measuring additional sensitivity enhancements by dual stacking for ten weakly acidic compounds. For the ten analytes including nucleoside phosphates, every dual stacking of an unbuffered sample exhibited an additional enhancement up to 86 % larger than that of usual transient isotachophoresis of the corresponding buffered sample without loss of separation efficiency and reproducibility. Therefore, {{it would be useful to}} skip over buffering in sample preparation for TITP, contrary to the general recommendation. close 212...|$|R

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{has shown}} to be highly suitable {{for the analysis of}} polar and ionogenic compounds in biomedical and pharmaceutical samples. Separation with CE is based on the charge-to-size ratio of analytes. The application of CE for bioanalysis may be hindered by its relatively low sensitivity. Two sample preconcentration techniques have been applied in this thesis, a dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction</b> and an in-capillary solid phase extraction column. In-capillary analyte stacking via dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction</b> was investigated with underivatised phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) as model amino acids. Samples were mixed with acidic background electrolyte prior to injection. A plug of ammonium hydroxide solution was injected before the sample to produce a <b>pH</b> <b>junction.</b> Zwitterionic amino acids have opposing charges in the respecting solvents and will thus get opposing mobilities. The amino acids stack at the interface between the solvents. LODs for Phe and Tyr in urine were 0. 054 and 0. 019 μM for a sample injection volume of 10 % of the capillary. Another technique for preconcentration of analytes employs an in-line frit-free solid-phase extraction (SPE) column. A 2 mm * 150 µm column was packed with mixed-mode sorbent for the preconcentration of the test compounds 2 -ethylidene- 1, 5 -dimethyl- 3, 3 -diphenylpirrolidine (EDDP), dihydrocodeine and codeine. The sorbent had a particle diameter of more than 50 µm and was retained between a short inlet capillary and a separation capillary (50 µm id). The injected sample volume was 60 µL (i. e., 30 capillary volumes). Using MS-detection, LODs were 0. 22 pg/mL for EDDP, 2. 1 pg/mL for dihydrocodeine and 24 pg/mL for codeine. For the analysis of opioid peptides, a similair SPE-column was packed with a C 18 sorbent. The column size was 4 mm * 150 µm, and the injected sample volume was 12 µL. Using SPE-CE-MS, the LODs varied between 0. 5 and 1. 0 ng/mL which represent an enhancement of two orders of magnitude when compared with CE-MS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples spiked with the opioid peptides were analyzed, and the opioid peptides could be detected down to 1. 0 ng/mL. In 2008, oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) present in certain lots of heparin was identified as the toxic contaminant responsible for severe side effects following intravenous heparin administration. A preliminary CE method published by the US Food and Drugs Administration showed only partial separation of the OSCS contaminant from heparin. In this thesis an improved CE method is described. Enhancement of the OSCS–heparin separation was achieved by using high concentrations of Tris phosphate (pH 3. 0) as background electrolyte. Good separations of OSCS, heparin and DS are obtained within 17 min. The method permits OSCS and DS determination in heparin down to the 0. 05 % and 0. 5 % (w/w) level, respectively. The CE method was further optimized to achieve shorter analysis times. Using a much shorter capillary, separation of OSCS, heparin and DS was obtained within 7 min. Detection limits for OSCS and DS were well below 0. 5 mg/mL. Further reduction of analysis time could be achieved by employing an effective capillary length of 10 cm, providing full separation within 4 min...|$|R

40|$|Advances in mass {{spectrometry}} and capillary-format separation {{continue to improve}} the sensitivity of protein analysis. Of equal importance is the miniaturization of sample pretreatment such as enrichment and proteolysis. In a previous report (Nesbitt et al., Electrophoresis, 2008, 29, 466 - 474), nanoliter-volume protein enrichment, tryptic digestion, and partial separation was demonstrated in capillary electrophoresis followed by MALDI mass spectral analysis. A discontinuous buffer system, consisting of ammonium (pH 10) and acetate (pH 4), was {{used to create a}} <b>pH</b> <b>junction</b> inside the capillary, trapping a protein with a neutral isoelectric point, myoglobin (pI 7. 2). Moreover, co-enrichment of myoglobin with trypsin led to an in-capillary digestion. In this paper, the ability of this discontinuous buffer system to perform similar in-capillary sample pretreatment on proteins with moderately acidic and basic pI was studied and reported. Lentil lectin (pI 8. 6) and a multi-phosphorylated protein, beta-casein (pI 5. 1), were selected as model proteins. In addition to the previously shown tryptic digestion, proteolysis with endoproteinase Asp-N was also performed. Digestion of these acidic and basic pI proteins produced a few peptides with extreme pI values lying outside the trapping range of the discontinuous buffer. An alteration in the peptide trapping procedure was made to accommodate these analytes. Offline MALDI mass spectral analysis confirmed the presence of the expected peptides. The presented miniaturized sample pretreatment methodology was proven to be applicable on proteins with a moderately wide range of pI. Flexibility in the choice of protease was also evident...|$|R

A conventional reference electrode can also be bulky and fragile. A too large volume constrained by a classical reference electrode also precludes the miniaturization of the ISFET electrode, a mandatory feature for some biological or in vivo clinical analyses (disposable mini-catheter pH probe).

40|$|Novel on-line {{methods are}} {{presented}} for the extraction, preconcentration {{and analysis of}} zwitterionic biomolecules using sol-gel-coated columns coupled to a conventional UV/visible detector. The presented approaches do not require any additional modification of the commercially available standard CE instrument. Extraction, stacking, and focusing techniques {{were used in the}} preconcentration procedures. The positively charged sol-gel coatings were created using N-octadecyldimethyl[3 -(trimethoxysilyl) proply]ammonium chloride (C 18 -TMS) in the coating sol solutions. Due to the presence of a positively charged quaternary ammonium moiety in C 18 -TMS, the resulting sol-gel coating carried a positive charge. The negatively charged sol-gel coatings were due to the presence of sulfonate groups, which was formed from the oxidation of thiol groups in precursor mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) by hydrogen peroxide. Besides MPTMS, tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and n-octadecyltriethoxysilane (C 18 -TEOS) were also used to prepare the sol solution for the creation of the negatively charged coatings. For extraction, the pH of the samples was properly adjusted to impart a net charge opposite to the sol-gel coatings. When a long plug of the sample was passed through the sol-gel-coated capillary, extraction was achieved via electrostatic interaction between the charged sol-gel coating and the charged sample molecules. The extracted analytes were then desorbed and focused via local pH change and stacking. The local pH change was accomplished by passing buffer solutions with proper pH values, while a dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction</b> between the sample solution and the background electrolyte was utilized to facilitate solute focusing. The developed methods showed excellent extraction and preconcentration effects on both positively and negatively charged sol-gel-coated columns. On-line preconcentration and analysis results obtained on the sol-gel coated columns were compared with those obtained on an uncoated fused silica capillary of identical dimensions using conventional sample injections. The described procedure provided a 150 000 -fold enrichment effect for alanine on the positively charged sol-gel-coated column. On the negatively charged sol-gel-coated column, the presented sample preconcentration technique provided a sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) on the order of 3 x 103 for myoglobin, and 7 x 103 for asparagines. The developed methods provided acceptable repeatability in terms of both peak height and migration time...|$|R

Calcium is widely reported to uncouple {{gap junction}}, and we observed this alteration on exposure to Ca++ down to 10 (- 4) M concentration.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the study of {{sweeping}} {{as one of the}} most important sample preconcentration techniques in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). The work includes the study of the fundamentals of sweeping as well as the application in the pharmaceutical field. The thesis is divided into four main parts. In the first part of the thesis, the processes involved in sweeping under homogeneous and under inhomogeneous electric field conditions are theoretically discussed. These processes include stacking or destacking of micelles when entering the sample zone, sweeping of analytes by the stacked or destacked micelles, and destacking or stacking of the swept analyte zone. A new robust and reliable method for the assessment of the sweeping efficiency is developed based on recording the peak height dependent on the injected sample volume. The values obtained via this method agree well with theoretically predicted ones. The results obtained show that the sweeping efficiency for neutral analytes is independent of the electric conductivity of the sample matrix. It is also shown that under specific conditions unexpectedly high enrichment factors are obtained which are attributed to the focusing of neutral analytes by micellar transient isotachophoresis. In the second part of the thesis, we extend our developed method for the assessment of sweeping efficiency to the general case, in which the distribution coefficient and the electric conductivity is varied in the sample and BGE compartments. It is shown that in the general case – in contrast to the classical description of sweeping – the obtainable enrichment factor is not only dependent on the retention factor of the analyte in the sample zone but also dependent on the retention factor in the BGE. An additional focusing/defocusing step is confirmed and the term “Retention factor gradient effect (RFGE) ” is introduced. The validity of the derived equation is confirmed experimentally and theoretically under variation of the organic solvent content (in the sample and/or the BGE), the type of organic solvent (in the sample and/or the BGE), the electric conductivity (in the sample), the pH (in the sample), and the concentration of surfactant (in the BGE). In the third part of the thesis, the processes involved in sweeping in cyclodextrin-modified micellar electrokinetic chromatography (CD-MEKC) are theoretically discussed with a special focus on dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction</b> and adsorption of the analyte onto the capillary wall. Ethylparaben (pharmaceutical preservative) as an example of acidic analytes and desloratadine (antihistaminic drug) as an example of basic analytes are investigated using different types of ß-cyclodextrins. The presence of RFGE as an additional focusing/defocusing effect in sweeping-CD-MEKC is confirmed under the conditions of different content of cyclodextrin and different pH between the sample and the BGE. Desloratadine shows an unexpectedly low enrichment factor compared to the less hydrophobic ethylparaben. This unexpected behavior is ascribed to the strong adsorption of the protonated species of this drug onto the inner capillary wall in the sample zone that significantly counteracts the sweeping process. This effect is confirmed by the improvement in the enrichment factor achieved by the addition of a dynamic coating agent to the sample solution. In the fourth part of the thesis, a CD-MEKC method is developed for the simultaneous determination of the antihistaminic drugs loratadine and desloratadine (the major metabolite and an impurity of loratadine). The tendency of these drugs, as hydrophobic basic analytes, to be adsorbed onto the inner capillary wall and the difficulty to separate them due to the extremely high retention factors make the present study challenging. The use of a low pH sample solution overcome problems associated with the low solubility of the studied analytes in aqueous solution while having advantages with regard to online focusing. In addition, the use of a basic BGE and the presence of cyclodextrin reduce the adsorption of these analytes in the separation compartment. The separation is achieved in less than 7 min using a BGE consisting of 10 mmol L- 1 sodium borate buffer, pH 9. 30 containing 40 mmol L- 1 SDS and 20 mmol L- 1 hydroxypropyl-β-CD while the sample solution is composed of 10 mmol L- 1 phosphoric acid, pH 2. 15. All validation parameters are thoroughly investigated. The developed method is successfully applied to the analysis of the studied drugs in tablets and in spiked human urine. Moreover, desloratadine is detected at the stated pharmacopeial limit (0. 1 %) as an impurity in loratadine bulk powder. The obtained results are compared with those of the official liquid chromatographic method and are found in a good agreement...|$|R

From the effective electrophoretic mobility data, it is shown that the degree of complexation is close to one even at very low tetraborate concentration (2. 5 mmol L- 1). Insufficient resolution of the studied nucleosides using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) as a standing alone technique (in the presence of tetraborate buffer as a background electrolyte (BGE)) necessitates using alternative approaches which are: (i) another CE mode or (ii) buffer additives that can provide a different separation selectivity to permit the complete separation of the studied analytes. Following the first approach, a micellar electrokinetic chromatographic method (MEKC) is developed for the separation of urinary nucleosides in their ionic form using the ionic liquid-type surfactant 1 -tetradecyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bromide (C 14 MImBr) as a cationic surfactant in the presence of tetrahydroxyborate. A complete separation of these hydrophilic metabolites is realized using a low concentration of C 14 MImBr (20 mmol L- 1) in the BGE (5 mmol L- 1 tetraborate, pH 9. 38). Fundamental aspects underlying the separation of urinary nucleosides using C 14 MImBr are studied including the mode of interaction of these compounds with C 14 MImBr and regulation of the retention factors with respect to the oppositely charged PSP. It is proven that the negatively charged complexed nucleosides interact mainly with the C 14 MImBr micelles by electrostatic interaction, while hydrophobic interaction can be considered to be negligible. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the retention factors are increased with decreasing borate concentration and increasing pH of the BGE. Employing the conditions that maximize the interaction between the nucleosides and the C 14 MImBr micelles (quantified via the associated equilibrium constants), a fully optimized and validated MEKC method combined with different on-line enrichment techniques is successfully developed for the identification and quantification of nucleosides in urine samples. It is shown that “pseudostationary ion-exchanger” sweeping is the major contributor to the overall enrichment process. However, due to the low retention factors encountered for the nucleosides adenosine (Ado) and cytidine (Cyd), C 14 MImBr cannot be effectively employed for the sweeping of these analytes. In addition, these two nucleosides comigrate with urinary matrix constituents. As an alternative, SDS is investigated for the analysis of Ado and Cyd as positively charged species (under acidic pH conditions) together with “pseudostationary ion-exchanger” sweeping as on-line enrichment principle, which is applied successfully to the analysis of the two nucleosides in urine samples. Moreover, it is established that with a BGE containing the combination of an alkyl/aryl boronate and C 14 MImBr, the retention factors of all the studied nucleosides are significantly increased. The shift in the retention factors to higher values is attributed to the additional hydrophobic interaction sites introduced by the alkyl/aryl group of the boronate that forms a complex with the cis-diol group of the nucleoside. It is shown that these optimization strategies result in validated methods, which permit the successful analysis of the studied nucleosides in urine samples with limits of detection in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 2 mg L- 1. Following the second approach, 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2 -HP-β-CD) is used as buffer additive in the presence of tetraborate buffer, which permits the modification of the separation selectivity and enables a complete separation of the investigated nucleosides via CZE. Taking advantage of the high complex formation constant between the nucleosides and tetrahydroxyborate and employing 2 -HP-β-CD as selectivity-tuning additive, a highly sensitive CZE method is developed based on a highly efficient on-line focusing procedure comprising three steps, which are dynamic <b>pH</b> <b>junction,</b> borate sweeping, and large volume sample stacking (LVSS). Limits of detection as low as 10 - 40 μg L− 1 are achieved. The proposed method is validated according to ICH guidelines and is successfully applied to the analysis of the nucleosides under investigation in blank and spiked urine samples. The outcomes of the second approach are successfully transferred to the analysis of selected α-aminocephalosporins in surface water samples. Together {{with the use of a}} highly sensitive detection method such as laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, CZE with LVSS-sweeping is applied successfully to the analysis of cefalexin and cefadroxil in spiked Lahn water samples reaching limits of detection as low as 5 - 8 ng L- 1...|$|R

Skirtinguose žmogaus organizmo audiniuose atrastas 21 koneksino (Cx) tipas. Tam tikros ligos yra susijusios su Cx mutacijomis. PJ kanalų savybes įtakoja jungties įtampa, viduląstelinis pH (pHi), viduląstelinė dvivalenčių katijonų koncentracija ([Ca 2 +]i, [Mg 2 +]i), fosforinimas, įvairios cheminės medžiagos. Disertacinio darbo metu pirmą kartą parodėme, kad plačiai naudojamų skirtingų grupių PJ slopiklių, tokių kaip alkanolių, forano, meflokvino, veikimas priklauso nuo pHi ir Cx tipo. Iškėlėme ir eksperimentiškai patikrinome hipotezę, kad tam tikri PJ slopikliai veikia, sudarydami vandenilinius ryšius su Cx 45 baltymo histidinais. Ištyrėme Cx 36, Cx 40, Cx 43, Cx 45 ir Cx 47 PJ kanalų laidumo priklausomybę nuo pHi. Nustatėme [Mg 2 +]i įtaką Cx 43 ir Cx 45 PJ kanalų laidumui bei Cx 36 PJ kanalų laidumo priklausomybei nuo pHi, kas iki šiol nebuvo tirta. Cx 45 ir Cx 36 mutantinių baltymų tyrimai suteikė naujų žinių apie šių baltymų amino rūgštis, kurios gali būti reikšmingos PJ kanalų laidumo reguliavimui viduląsteliniu <b>pH.</b> Gap <b>junctions</b> (GJ) are {{intercellular}} channels, {{which provide}} a direct pathway for electrical and metabolic cell-to-cell communication. GJ {{play an important}} role in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and coordination. The family of connexin (Cx) genes consists of 21 members in the human genome, and a variety of diseases is associated with Cx mutations. Electrical conductance (gj) of gap junctions is regulated by transjunctional voltage, intracellular pH (pHi), intracellular divalent cation concentration ([Ca 2 +]i and [Mg 2 +]i), phosphorylation and different chemical compounds. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that the potency of widely used GJ inhibitors such as alkanols, forane and mefloquine in GJ channel uncoupling is pHi- and Cx type-dependent. This type of modulation may occur through the formation of hydrogen bonds between uncouplers and histidines of Cx 45 protein. We determined gj-pHi dependence of Cx 36, Cx 40, Cx 43, Cx 45 and Cx 47 GJ channels, and evaluated the influence of [Mg 2 +]i on the conductance of Cx 43 and Cx 45 GJs and on the sensitivity of Cx 36 GJs to pHi.
