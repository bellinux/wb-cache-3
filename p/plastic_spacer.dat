40|$|BACKGROUND—Inhalation therapy using a {{pressured}} {{metered dose inhaler}} (pMDI) and {{a spacer}} is frequently used {{in the treatment of}} airway disease in children. Several laboratory studies found a clear negative influence of electrostatic charge (ESC) on <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> on the delivery of aerosol.  AIMS—To investigate whether ESC on <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> could diminish bronchodilating responses to salbutamol.  METHODS—Ninety asthmatic children (aged 4 - 8 years) were randomised into three groups: metal Nebuchamber, plastic Volumatic, and plastic Aerochamber. The bronchodilating response was measured by the change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) after 100 µg and 400 µg salbutamol. Within the Volumatic and Aerochamber groups, a crossover comparison was made between electrostatic and non-electrostatic spacers.  RESULTS—We found no significant effect of ESC on the bronchodilating response to salbutamol with any of the doses in the Aerochamber and Volumatic groups. For the <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers,</b> the mean difference of the change in PEF after 100 µg salbutamol between non-electrostatic and electrostatic spacers was only + 1. 7 % (95 % CI − 1. 3 % to 4. 7 %). After 400 µg salbutamol this was + 1. 9 % (95 % CI − 1. 4 % to 5. 1 %). A comparable efficacy was found for the Nebuchamber, the Aerochamber, and Volumatic with respect to the change in PEF after 100 and 400 µg salbutamol.  CONCLUSION—This study showed no negative influence of ESC on <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> with regard to clinical efficacy of a β 2 agonist (salbutamol) in children with asthma.

A single 1. 5 mm expanded <b>plastic</b> <b>spacer</b> (S 1. 5) produced a maximum power density (973 ± 26 mWm - 2) that was similar to that of an MFC with the cathode exposed directly to air (no spacer). However, a very thin spacer (1. 3 mm) reduced power by 33 %. Completely covering the air cathode with a solid plate did not eliminate power generation, indicating oxygen leakage into the reactor. The S 1. 5 spacer slightly increased columbic efficiencies (from 20 % to 24 %) as a result of reduced oxygen transfer into the system.

40|$|Pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDI) {{are widely}} used {{together}} with spacers {{for the treatment of}} asthma in children. However, the variability of daily medication dose for pMDI/spacer combinations is not known. Electrostatic charge is a potential source of dose variability. Metal spacers have no static charge. This study assessed and compared within-subject variability of aerosol delivery of metal and plastic spacers. This was a randomized, crossover study in children with stable asthma aged 1 - 4 (group I, n= 17) and 5 - 8 (group II, n= 16) yrs. In both groups the amount of drug delivered to the mouth by a metal spacer (Nebuchamber) and one of two plastic (polycarbonate) spacers, i. e. Babyhaler in group I and Volumatic in group II was measured. The metal and plastic spacers were tested at home in a randomized order for 7 days each, using budesonide (200 microg b. i. d.). Aerosol was collected on a filter positioned between spacer and facemask or mouth. Budesonide on the filter was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mean filter dose for each child (mean+/-SD) during the 7 days was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} nominal dose. Within-subject variability was expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). Mean filter dose in group I was 41. 7 +/- 10. 1 % for Nebuchamber and 26. 0 +/- 4. 0 % for Babyhaler (p< 0. 001). Mean filter dose in group II was 50. 2 +/- 9. 2 % for Nebuchamber and 19. 4 +/- 7. 2 % for Volumatic (p< 0. 001). Mean CV in group I was 34 % for Nebuchamber and 37 % for Babyhaler (p= 0. 44). Mean CV in group II was 23 % for Nebuchamber and 34 % for Volumatic (p= 0. 003). There was substantial within-subject dose variability in aerosol delivery in children using a pMDI/spacer at home.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} influences of electrostatic charge, flow, delay, and multiple actuations on the in vitro delivery of salbutamol generated by a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) from small volume spacers used in infants. METHODS: Ten actuations from a salbutamol pMDI were drawn at different flow rates after either single or multiple actuations, with or without delay, through either static or reduced static spacers. An ionic detergent was used to reduce the charge of <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> (Babyhaler, Babyspacer, Aerochamber, Nebuhaler). Electrostatic charge was measured using an electrometer. A multistage liquid impinger {{was used to determine}} the particle size distribution of the output of the pMDI through the spacers. RESULTS: Electrostatic charge on the surface of <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> had the greatest influence on delivery, causing a decrease in drug delivery. Reducing charge by coating the surface with ionic detergent resulted in an increase of 46. 5 - 71. 1 % (p < 0. 001) in small (< 6. 8 microns) particle delivery from small volume <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers.</b> Lower flow, delay, and multiple actuations resulted in decreased delivery from static spacers. Lower flow resulted in a decrease of 15 % in small (< 9. 6 microns) particle delivery. Delay and multiple actuations resulted in a decrease of 40. 7 % and 76. 0 %, respectively, in small (< 6. 8 microns) particle delivery. The influences of lower flow, delay, and multiple actuations were greatly reduced or even eliminated by reducing charge. However, multiple actuations still resulted in a significant decreased delivery (p < 0. 05). The reduced static Nebuhaler had a higher delivery than all small volume spacers. CONCLUSIONS: Electrostatic charge has a major influence on the delivery of salbutamol from small volume spacers. Using a metal spacer or ionic detergent coating of <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> resulted in no or reduced charge and hence in improved delivery. Lower flow, delay, and multiple actuations played a major part only in static spacers...|$|R

While the orientation of the mesh spacer, which holds the air gap apart, was found to have no substantial effect on the permeate production rate, the surface's hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity did result in different rates. The hydrophobic surface exhibited fewer droplets bridging the gap, more spherical droplets, and better droplet shedding.

In an open randomized crossover study in 25 wheezy infants aged 5 - 26 months, a metal spacer (Nebuchamber 1), a detergent coated (DC) and a non-detergent coated (nonDC) <b>plastic</b> <b>spacer</b> (Babyhaler 1) were tested at home for 7 days each. Budeso-nide (200 mg b. i. d.) was administered via a Nebuchamber or fluticasone (125 mg b. i. d.) via a Babyhaler. Aerosol was trapped in filters, positioned between the spacer and face mask. Cooperation was scored on diary cards. Electrostatic charge (ESC) of the spacers was measured. Evaluations of the administration technique were made from video recordings. Median (range) dose delivery of the filters expressed as per cent (%) of nominal dose, was 34 % (3 ± 59), 23 % (1 ± 49), and 41 % (12 ± 55) for the Nebuchamber, nonDC-Babyhaler, and DC-Babyhaler respectively. Considerable dose variability was found, median (range) within-subject dose variability, expressed as coefficient of variation, for the Nebuchamber (49 % (15 ± 249)) was significantly higher when compared with both nonDC- (36 % (12 ± 325)) and DC-Babyhalers (27 % (10 ± 122)), for which dose variabilities were similar. Detergent coating was effective to reduce electrostatic charge, and to increase dose delivery, but had no effect on dose variability.

40|$|The task of {{this study}} was to examine post exodontia {{dynamics}} that lead to the use of an equine dental spacer on cheek teeth. Research involved the conceptualization of a spacer, which should negate a variety of undesirable consequences resulting from tooth removal. The application of the spacer should be non traumatic and easy for the practitioner to handle as well as economically feasible for the owner. Additionally, the newly designed spacers were to be tested on the patient. The cited literature is extensive and provided detailed information, for example, on how to approach the sedated standing patient, which can be manipulated in the mouth for a longer period of time. Information on cheek tooth replacement was limited and almost no practical solutions for the treatment of pathological consequences of a cheek tooth gap without general anaesthesia were found. Moreover, indications of long term effects in the dentition after cheek tooth removal appeared to be incomplete and the potential of specific tooth replacement was not discussed. Dentition radiographs of 70 patients (42 were studied clinically within this paper) and 4 sculls served to examine whether teeth move after exodontia, which teeth move, where teeth move, reason for movement, the rate of speed at which teeth move, and lastly the width of movement. Additionally, the factors influencing movement and the pathologies created by these movements were investigated. Radial calculations on the skulls, the radiographs and the clinical examinations which included dental gap impressions revealed that in all cases studied (P 2, P 3, M 1, M 2; n = 66) the teeth adjacent to the gap tipped quickly in the first few months, while later the rate of tipping declined. The tipping process terminated when teeth met and led to pathological conditions in all patients of the study. According to the requirements, dental spacers were constructed from horse teeth, urethane plugs and from metal. The spacers were tested on skulls, slaughter heads, and patients. While initially spacers had to be therapeutically effective, practicable, easy and gently to use as well as cost effective, demands on the spacer evolved to be additionally applicable for tipping correction, stable to anchor, usable on the standing patient and medically unobjectionable. Moreover the evolution of the final spacer design necessitated the use of a Dremel tool for application, whereas the prior designs were applied with adhesive, intraoral steel pins, and activated with a custom made long handled wrench. The use of the Dremel tool as a drill in the last design was to bore holes in the adjacent teeth to apply the spacer. The spacer was inserted into the holes by spring-loaded nipples and then activated by adjusting a threaded mechanism to the correct gap width. Thereby, the idea of a fast and easy adaptable <b>plastic</b> <b>spacer</b> which can be pressed in the tooth gap had to be renounced. With most models it was difficult to insert the spacer into the maxilla without causing trauma to the soft tissues. Although model 13 b (adjusting screw without tooth pieces, base piece and side piece; passive fixation through spring-loaded nipples, which snap into tooth borings) could not be tested due to the lack of an appropriate dental drill, preliminary results indicated that only this model may meet all criteria for a dental spacer...|$|E

This study investigates the effect caused by <b>plastic</b> and cementitious <b>spacers,</b> and steel wire chairs combined with different aggregate sizes, curing and conditioning regimes on the transport properties, microstructure and chloride-induced corrosion of concrete structures. Concrete cylindrical samples were prepared with 25 and 50 mm high plastic, steel and cementitious spacers. Samples were then cured, conditioned and tested for oxygen diffusivity, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity and chloride diffusivity. Selected samples were pressure impregnated with fluorescent epoxy to study the extent and spatial distribution of epoxy intrusion. The interfacial zone between the spacer and concrete was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscope in the backscattered electron (BSE) mode. The ingress of chloride, particularly near the interface between spacers and concrete matrix was studied using micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF). The effect of <b>plastic</b> and cementitious <b>spacers</b> on chloride- induced corrosion via capillary rise and cyclic wetting/drying was investigated using small reinforced concrete beams. The feasibility of improving the bond between spacer and concrete by increasing surface roughness of <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> was also investigated. Results show that concrete samples containing <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> consistently gave the least resistance to transport and the highest epoxy penetration followed by samples with cementitious spacers, and then steel spacers. The control samples (samples without spacers) had the highest resistance to transport in all cases. The epoxy penetration occurred mainly through the spacer-concrete interface. The microstructure of the spacer-concrete interface showed significantly lower cement content and higher porosity compared to 'bulk paste' farther away form the interface. Higher penetration of chloride ions was detected along spacer-concrete interface compared to the control sample or the bulk paste farther away. It is evident that spacers initiate early corrosion and this may reduce the service-life of reinforced concrete structures. The implications of these findings on durability of concrete structures are discussed. Several recommendations to improve the bond at the interface between spacer and concrete are presented.

The procedure prolonged the half life (t 1 / 2) of the aerosol in the Nebuhaler from nine to 32 seconds. A normal cleaning procedure reduced the aerosol t 1 / 2 back to baseline. The t 1 / 2 of the aerosol in the metal spacer was 27 seconds and independent {{of the use of}} p-MDI. In vitro the maximum dose of budesonide from a p-MDI, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} nominal dose, was 56 % from the non-electrostatic spacer, 61 % from the Nebuhaler, 45 % from the Babyhaler, and 30 % from the AeroChamber. In 124 children, age 6 months to 6 years, suspected to have asthma the non-electrostatic spacer delivered a mean total dose of budesonide aerosol of 39 % of the nominal dose, which was significantly higher than the Babyhaler (28 %), the Nebuhaler (21 %), and the AeroChamber (19 %). These differences were most pronounced in children younger than 4 years. The improved dose delivery from the small volume non-electrostatic spacer is probably related to the non-electrostatic spacer material and the valves which assured unidirectional airflow from the spacer without adding any dead space in the inspiratory channel. The non-electro-static spacer should improve the cost effectiveness of aerosol treatment and, as the counteracting effects of proming and recharging of the plastic from cleaning are avoided, should deliver a more reliable dose...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{single-stage}} {{membrane distillation}} (MD) configuration, known as conductive gap membrane distillation (CGMD), {{has been suggested}} by numerical modeling results to achieve up to two times higher energy efficiencies than conventional air gap MD systems. CGMD consists of an MD module with a high thermal conductivity material in the gap region between the membrane and condensing plate, increasing the effective thermal conductivity of the gap.

The potential for further improvements in GOR and issues associated with studying MD efficiency at a laboratory bench scale are also discussed.

50|$|When the {{concrete}} is {{poured into the}} form, a small gap is created {{between it and the}} plastic. Plastic has a coefficient of thermal expansion and contraction 10 to 15 times that of concrete, and when subjected to temperature variations, the plastic continues to expand and contract at that higher coefficient. At high temperatures, plastic can even melt. The result is a separation between the spacers and the poured concrete, creating a free passage for corrosive agents to reach the steel reinforcement from the exterior of {{the concrete}} product. This will cause the steel - and eventually the concrete - to corrode. If steam curing is applied to the concrete, the heat in the curing process causes the plastic to expand while the concrete is relatively fresh and weak. After reaching the maximum curing temperature and volume expansion of the plastic, the temperature is held at this level until the concrete reaches the desired strength. After curing, the subsequent lower temperatures cause the plastic to contract, and a gap remains at the interface between the plastic and concrete. <b>Plastic</b> <b>spacers</b> are also subject to corrosion when they come into contact with chlorides and chemicals, where concrete has a much higher resistance.|$|R
40|$|This Standard Reference Material is for {{determining}} the length scales within medical computed tomography (CT). This reference device consists of solid polytetrafluoride ethylene balls separated by precision <b>plastic</b> <b>spacers.</b> The central positions of the distances between the balls are certified with an uncertainty of 0. 15 mm. The distances are traceable to the International System of Units (SI). The entire package may {{be held in the}} palm of the hand and contains only common, inert materials. All of the materials are selected to be within the range of radiodensity (measured in Hounsfield units in medical CT) that is found in the human body. Yet there is high contrast between the parts, so a simple threshold procedure may be used {{to determine the extent of}} each ball in a CT reconstruction. Moreover, each ball is held symmetrically, so the fixture will have little influence on the position of the centers of the balls as measured in the CT. A typical experiment may search for distortions within the CT field. For example, the ratio of the length scales in the transverse to longitudinal directions may be found. Differences in the length scale from the isocenter of the CT to the edge of the field may also be investigated.
