5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was extremely expensive. <b>Prices</b> <b>could</b> be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a report}} by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), {{agricultural}} technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, IFPRI found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> be reduced by almost half.|$|E
25|$|However, as the {{adoption}} of electric cars, such as the French Renault Fluence Z.E., over internal combustion engine vehicles increases, reducing fossil fuel dependence, France's comparatively cheap peak and off peak electricity <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> act as a strong customer incentive that may spur the speed of {{the adoption}} of electric vehicles, essentially turning the current perceived glut of relatively cheap fission-electricity into an asset, as demand for electric vehicle recharging stations becomes more and more commonplace.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the law began to operate, Congress {{resolved}} that the chief of any bureau of the navy department should be at liberty to reject the offers {{of those who had}} failed as principals or sureties on previous contracts to furnish naval supplies.

25|$|In {{the third}} week of November, Gazprom CEO Miller {{announced}} that if no agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} year, <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> rise significantly higher than what was currently being proposed. A few days later Prime Minister Putin warned that if there was any interference with transit gas, supplies to Ukraine would be cut off. These warnings were repeated throughout December, with additional warnings that disruptions to European supplies could result. The European Commission did not attempt to intervene, but the Energy Charter Secretariat issued a statement on December 23 which recalled the principle of uninterrupted transit. This was seen as a reminder to Ukraine of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty, which it has signed and, unlike Russia, ratified.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consumers}} {{are concerned that}} yield management could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and neural networks that determine airline ticket <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of socio-economic information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, even if those neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using yield management are able to employ this level of price discrimination because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known {{at the time of}} purchase.|$|E
25|$|Solow {{also was}} the first to develop a growth model with {{different}} vintages of capital. The idea behind Solow's vintage capital growth model is that new capital is more valuable than old (vintage) capital because new capital is produced through known technology. Within the confines of Solow's model, this known technology is assumed to be constantly improving. Consequently, the products of this technology (the new capital) are expected to be more productive as well as more valuable. The idea lay dormant for some time perhaps because Dale W. Jorgenson (1966) argued that it was observationally equivalent with disembodied technological progress, as advanced earlier in Solow (1957). It was successfully pushed forward in subsequent research by Jeremy Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz and Per Krusell (1997), who argued that the secular decline in capital goods <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> be used to measure embodied technological progress. They labeled the notion investment-specific technological progress. Solow (2001) approved. Both Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, Jr. subsequently developed alternatives to Solow's neo-classical growth model.|$|E

2500|$|Mises {{argued in}} a 1920 essay [...] "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth" [...] that the pricing systems in socialist economies were {{necessarily}} deficient because if government owned {{the means of}} production, then no <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not [...] "objects of exchange", unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would {{not know how to}} allocate the available resources efficiently. [...] This led him to write [...] "that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis led Richard Posner, a prominent judge, University of Chicago law professor, and innovator {{in the field}} of Law and Economics, to back away from the hypothesis and express some degree of belief in Keynesian economics. Posner accused some of his Chicago School colleagues of being [...] "asleep at the switch", saying that [...] "the movement to deregulate the financial industry went too far by exaggerating the resilience—the self healing powers—of laissez-faire capitalism." [...] Others, such as Fama, said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis and that the markets were a casualty of the recession, not the cause of it. Despite this, Fama has conceded that [...] "poorly informed investors could theoretically lead the market astray" [...] and that stock <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> become [...] "somewhat irrational" [...] as a result.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, {{two years}} after {{appearing}} in America, Mattel's Hot Wheels entered the U.K. model car market. Their low-friction axles and bright paint schemes gave new play value and appeal. Dinky and other British brands rushed to catch up, usually unsuccessfully. Each manufacturer responded with {{its own version of}} Hot Wheels innovations – Dinky's name was [...] "Speedwheels" [...] (Force 1988, p.8). The company continued to make innovative models, with all four doors opening (a first in British toy cars), retractable radio aerials (another first), new metallic paints, and jeweled headlights (pretty, but not very realistic). Such features, however, were expensive to manufacture and toy <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> only be kept low if the quantity was high, and in the face of Mattel's creation, Dinky faced an uphill battle.|$|E
2500|$|A large {{factor in}} the lower supply growth of {{petroleum}} has been that oil's historically high ratio of Energy Returned on Energy Invested is in significant decline. [...] Petroleum is a limited resource, and the remaining accessible reserves are consumed more rapidly each year. Remaining reserves are increasingly difficult to extract and therefore more expensive. Eventually, reserves will only be economically feasible to extract at extremely high prices. Even if total oil supply does not decline, increasing numbers of experts believe the easily accessible sources of light sweet crude are almost exhausted {{and in the future}} the world will depend on more-expensive unconventional oil reserves and heavy crude oil, as well as renewable energy sources. It is thought by many, including energy economists such as Matthew Simmons, that <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> continue to rise indefinitely until a new market equilibrium is reached at which point supply satisfies worldwide demand.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2008, as {{prices fell}} below $60 a barrel, the IEA warned that falling <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> lead to both {{a lack of}} {{investment}} in new sources of oil and a fall in production of more-expensive unconventional reserves such as the oil sands of Canada. The IEA's chief economist warned, [...] "Oil supplies {{in the future will}} come more and more from smaller and more-difficult fields," [...] meaning that future production requires more investment every year. A lack of new investment in such projects, which had already been observed, could eventually cause new and more-severe supply issues than had been experienced in the early 2000s according to the IEA. Because the sharpest production declines had been seen in developed countries, the IEA warned that the greatest growth in production was expected to come from smaller projects in OPEC states, raising their world production share from 44% in 2008 to a projected 51% in 2030. The IEA also pointed out that demand from the developed world may have also peaked, so that future demand growth was likely to come from developing nations such as China, contributing 43%, and India and the Middle East, each about 20%.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{classical}} Ricardian economists, solving the transformation problem was an essential prerequisite for a credible theory of prices – a theory that would genuinely explain {{the relationship between the}} different variables determining prices, and the effects of changes in those variables. The theory of economic value was the foundation for the theory of prices, because <b>prices</b> <b>could</b> not be understood and explained without assumptions about economic value. Hence, a version of the transformation problem already existed in Ricardian economics, before it existed in Marxian economics, and, according to Marx, Ricardo's inability to solve it, directly contributed to the break-up of the Ricardian school, and to the demise of the labour theory of value. Thus, the subsequent debate centered on whether Marx had really solved a fundamental problem of {{the classical}} labour theory of value which Ricardian economics had failed to solve, so far, or whether there was an alternative (Ricardian) solution preferable to Marx's. Prof. Anwar Shaikh states that, among economists, this issue divided supporters of the labor theory of product-value for more than a century. What made the 20th century debate especially complicated and confusing was that Ricardo's theory and Marx's theory were often mixed up with each other; it was often unclear or controversial, what the exact differences between them were. In criticizing and reworking Ricardian theory, Marx had kept some of its ideas, but also altered the whole theoretical frame of reference, creating a new social and economic ontology. Some Marxians, like Chris Arthur, aim to reconstruct Marx's dialectical transformation argument in order to cleanse it from all [...] "Ricardian residues" [...] – the suggestion being, that Marx himself had never completely freed himself from Ricardianism in the economic manuscripts which he did not publish himself.|$|E
