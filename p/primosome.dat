Initially the complex formed by PriA, PriB, and PriC binds to DNA. Then the DnaB-DnaC helicase complex attaches along with DnaT. This structure {{is referred to as}} the pre-primosome. Finally, DnaG will bind to the pre-primosome forming a complete <b>primosome.</b> The <b>primosome</b> attaches 1-10 RNA nucleotides to the single stranded DNA creating a DNA-RNA hybrid. This sequence of RNA is used as a primer to initiate DNA polymerase III. The RNA bases are ultimately replaced with DNA bases by RNase H nuclease (eukaryotes) or DNA polymerase I nuclease (prokaryotes). DNA Ligase then acts to join the two ends together.|$|E

The [...] "replication restart" [...] <b>primosome,</b> defined in Escherichia coli, {{is involved in the}} reactivation of arrested replication forks. Binding of the PriA protein to forked DNA triggers its assembly. PriA is conserved in bacteria, but its primosomal partners are not. In Bacillus subtilis, genetic analysis has revealed three primosomal proteins, DnaB, DnaD, and DnaI, that have no obvious homologues in E. coli. They are involved in <b>primosome</b> function both at arrested replication forks and at the chromosomal origin. Our biochemical analysis of the DnaB and DnaD proteins unravels their role in <b>primosome</b> assembly. They are both multimeric and bind individually to DNA. Furthermore, DnaD stimulates DnaB binding activities. DnaD alone and the DnaD/DnaB pair interact specifically with PriA of B. subtilis on several DNA substrates. This suggests that the nucleoprotein assembly is sequential in the PriA, DnaD, DnaB order. The preferred DNA substrate mimics an arrested DNA replication fork with unreplicated lagging strand, structurally identical to a product of recombinational repair of a stalled replication fork.|$|E

Ten to 20 monomers of the replication initiator protein DnaA bind to the 9 mer repeats, and the DNA coils around this protein complex forming a protein core.

It is understood that H protein resides {{in this area}} but experimental evidence has not verified its exact location. Once inside the host bacterium, replication of the + ssDNA genome proceeds via negative sense DNA intermediate. This is done as the phage genome supercoils and the secondary structure formed by such supercoiling attracts a <b>primosome</b> protein complex. This translocates once around the genome and synthesizes a -ssDNA from the positive original genome. +ssDNA genomes to package into viruses are created from this by a rolling circle mechanism. This is the mechanism by which the double stranded supercoiled genome is nicked on the negative strand by a virus-encoded A protein, also attracting a bacterial DNA Polymerase {{to the site of}} cleavage. DNAP will use the negative strand as a template to make positive sense DNA. As it translocates around the genome it displaces the outer strand of already-synthesised DNA, which is immediately coated by ssBP proteins. The A protein will cleave the complete genome every time it recognises the origin sequence.|$|E

40|$|Replication of {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) DNA, {{a model for}} {{eukaryotic}} chromosomal replication, can be reconstituted in vitro using the viral helicase (large tumor antigen, or Tag) and purified human proteins. Tag interacts physically with two cellular proteins, replication protein A and DNA polymerase α-primase (pol-prim), constituting the viral <b>primosome.</b> Like the well characterized primosomes of phages T 7 and T 4, this trio of proteins coordinates parental DNA unwinding with primer synthesis to initiate the leading strand at the viral origin and each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand template. We recently determined {{the structure of a}} previously unrecognized pol-prim domain (p 68 N) that docks on Tag, identified the p 68 N surface that contacts Tag, and demonstrated its vital role in <b>primosome</b> function.

A charge reverse substitution in Tag disrupted both p 68 N-binding and <b>primosome</b> activity but did not affect docking with other pol-prim subunits. Unexpectedly, the substitution also disrupted Tag ATPase and helicase activity, suggesting a potential link between p 68 N docking and ATPase activity. To assess this possibility, we examined the <b>primosome</b> activity of Tag with a single residue substitution in the Walker B motif.

This site, designated ssiA, {{is located on the}} lagging strand template, approximately 150 bp downstream from the replication origin. ssiA priming activity requires the DnaE primase, the DnaC replication fork helicase, as well as the products of the dnaB, dnaD and dnaI genes of B. subtilis, but not the RNA polymerase. The primase and the replication fork helicase requirements indicate that ssiA is a <b>primosome</b> assembly site. Interestingly, the pAM beta 1 lagging strand synthesis is inefficient when any of the proteins involved in ssiA activity is mutated, but occurs efficiently in the absence of ssiA.

40|$|Synthesis of a {{complementary}} strand {{to match the}} single-stranded, circular, viral (+) DNA strand of phage phi X 174 creates a parental duplex circle (replicative form, RF). This synthesis is initiated by the assembly and action of a priming system, called the <b>primosome</b> [Arai, K. & Kornberg, A (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 69 - 73; Arai, K., Low, R.

The assembly of the protein complexes within the forked DNA responsible for reloading the replicative DnaB helicase anywhere on the chromosome for genome duplication requires the coordination of transient biomolecular interactions. Over the last decade, investigations on the structure and mechanism of these nucleoproteins have provided considerable insight into <b>primosome</b> assembly.

40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} α-primase (pol-prim) plays {{a central}} role in DNA replication in higher eukaryotes, initiating synthesis on both leading and lagging strand single-stranded DNA templates. Pol-prim consists of a primase heterodimer that synthesizes RNA primers, a DNA polymerase that extends them, and a fourth subunit, p 68 (also termed B-subunit), that is thought to regulate the complex. Although significant knowledge about single-subunit primases of prokaryotes has accumulated, the functions and regulation of pol-prim remain poorly understood. In the SV 40 replication model, the p 68 subunit is required for <b>primosome</b> activity and binds directly to the hexameric viral helicase T antigen, suggesting a functional link between T antigen-p 68 interaction and <b>primosome</b> activity. To explore this link, we first mapped the interacting regions of the two proteins and discovered a previously unrecognized N-terminal globular domain of p 68 (p 68 N) that physically interacts with the T antigen helicase domain. NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the solution structure of p 68 N and map its interface with the T antigen helicase domain. Structure-guided mutagenesis of p 68 residues in the interface diminished T antigen-p 68 interaction, confirming the interaction site. SV 40 <b>primosome</b> activity of corresponding pol-prim mutants decreased in proportion to the reduction in p 68 N-T antigen affinity, confirming that p 68 -T antigen interaction is vital for <b>primosome</b> function.

In the model system for simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA replication in vitro, synthesis of RNA primers at the origin of replication requires only the viral tumor (T) antigen, replication protein A (RPA), pol-prim, and topoisomerase I. On RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), T antigen alone mediates priming by pol-prim, constituting a relatively simple <b>primosome.</b> T-antigen activities proposed to participate in its <b>primosome</b> function include DNA helicase and protein-protein interactions with RPA and pol-prim. To test the role of these activities of T antigen in mediating priming by pol-prim, three replication-defective T antigens with mutations in the ATPase or helicase domain have been characterized. All three mutant proteins interacted physically and functionally with RPA and pol-prim and bound ssDNA, and two of them displayed some helicase activity. However, only one of these, 5030, mediated primer synthesis and elongation by pol-prim on RPA-coated ssDNA.

Assembly of the bacteriophage T 4 <b>primosome</b> on individual molecules of ssDNA or forked DNA (fDNA) has been studied by using FRET microscopy. On either DNA substrate, an ordered process of assembly begins with tight 1 : 1 binding of ssDNA-binding protein (gp 32) and helicase-loading protein (gp 59) to the DNA. Magnesium adenosine 5 ′-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (MgATPγS) mediates the weak binding of helicase (gp 41) to DNA coated with gp 32 and gp 59, whereas MgATP induces gp 32 and gp 59 to dissociate, leaving gp 41 bound to the DNA.

The introduction of a plasmid carrying the priA 300 allele, which encodes a mutant PriA protein capable of catalyzing the assembly of an active <b>primosome</b> but which is missing the n'-pas-dependent ATPase, helicase, and translocase activities associated with PriA, alleviates the defects of priA::kan mutants in homologous recombination, double-strand break repair, and inducible stable DNA replication. Furthermore, spa- 47, which was isolated as a suppressor of the broth sensitivity of priA::kan mutants, suppresses the Rec- and mitomycin C sensitivity phenotypes of priA::kan mutants. The spa- 47 suppressor mutation maps within or very near dnaC.

First, primase generates an RNA primer through three steps: initiation, consisting of dinucleotide synthesis from two nucleotide triphosphates; elongation, resulting in dinucleotide extension; and termination, owing to primase inhibition by a mature 9 -mer primer. Then Polα, which works equally well on DNA:RNA and DNA:DNA double helices, intramolecularly catches the template primed by a 9 mer RNA and extends the primer with dNTPs. All <b>primosome</b> transactions are highly coordinated by autoregulation through the alternating activation/inhibition of the catalytic centers. This coordination is {{mediated by the}} small C-terminal domain of the primase accessory subunit, which forms a tight complex with the template:primer, shuttles between the primase and DNA polymerase active sites, and determines their access to the substrate...|$|E
40|$|The {{lagging strand}} DNA {{synthesis}} of the Escherichia coli bacterial chromosome and plasmids {{is thought to be}} initiated by the mobile promotor, the <b>primosome.</b> This <b>primosome</b> is assembled at a specific site on single-stranded DNA. This process is initiated by the interaction of one of the at least seven components, the n' protein, with this site. Indeed n' protein activator sites are found in the plasmids Col E 1 and pBR 322. To investigate the in vivo function of these n' protein sites, deletion derivates of pBR 322 were constructed in which the n' protein sites are removed. The deletion plasmids show no change in stability and only threefold reduction in copy number compared to pBR 322. Using a transduction system for single-stranded plasmid DNA it was shown that no other specific initiation signals for lagging strand DNA synthesis were present in the deletion plasmids. It was concluded that the n' protein activator sites in pBR 322 are not essential for its DNA replication in viv...|$|E
40|$|Studies of recombination-dependent {{replication}} (RDR) in the T 4 {{system have}} revealed the critical roles played by mediator proteins in the timely and productive loading of specific enzymes onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) during phage RDR processes. The T 4 recombination mediator protein, uvsY, {{is necessary for}} the proper assembly of the T 4 presynaptic filament (uvsX recombinase cooperatively bound to ssDNA), leading to the recombination-primed initiation of leading strand DNA synthesis. In the lagging strand synthesis component of RDR, replication mediator protein gp 59 is required for the assembly of gp 41, the DNA helicase component of the T 4 <b>primosome,</b> onto lagging strand ssDNA. Together, uvsY and gp 59 mediate the productive coupling of homologous recombination events to the initiation of T 4 RDR. UvsY promotes presynaptic filament formation on 3 ′ ssDNA-tailed chromosomes, the physiological primers for T 4 RDR, and recent results suggest that uvsY also may serve as a coupling factor between presynapsis and the nucleolytic resection of double-stranded DNA ends. Other results indicate that uvsY stabilizes uvsX bound to the invading strand, effectively preventing <b>primosome</b> assembly there. Instead, gp 59 directs <b>primosome</b> assembly to the displaced strand of the D loop/replication fork. This partitioning mechanism enforced by the T 4 recombination/replication mediator proteins guards against antirecombination activity of the helicase component and ensures that recombination intermediates formed by uvsX/uvsY will efficiently be converted into semiconservative DNA replication forks. Although the major mode of T 4 RDR is semiconservative, we present biochemical evidence that a conservative “bubble migration” mode of RDR could play a role in lesion bypass by the T 4 replication machinery...|$|E
40|$|Structure of a helicase–helicase loader complex reveals {{insights}} into the mechanism of bacterial <b>primosome</b> assembly Bin Liu 1, 2, William K. Eliason 1, 2 & Thomas A. Steitz 1, 2, 3 During the assembly of the bacterial loader-dependent <b>primosome,</b> helicase loader proteins bind to the hexameric helicase ring, deliver it onto the oriC DNA and then dissociate from the complex. Here, to provide {{a better understanding of}} this key process, we report the crystal structure of the B 570 -kDa prepriming complex between the Bacillus subtilis loader protein and the Bacillus stearothermophilus helicase, as well as the helicase-binding domain of primase with a molar ratio of 6 : 6 : 3 at 7. 5 Å resolution. The overall architecture of the complex exhibits a three-layered ring conformation. Moreover, the structure combined with the proposed model suggests that the shift from the ‘open-ring ’ to the ‘open-spiral ’ and then the ‘closed-spiral ’ state of the helicase ring due to the binding of single-stranded DNA may be the cause of the loader release...|$|E
40|$|Reactivation of {{repaired}} DNA replication forks {{is essential}} for complete duplication of bacterial genomes. However, not all bacteria encode homologs of the well-studied Escherichia coli DNA replication restart <b>primosome</b> proteins, suggesting {{that there might be}} distinct mechanistic differences among DNA replication restart pathways in diverse bacteria. Since reactivation of repaired DNA replication forks requires coordinated DNA and protein binding by DNA replication restart <b>primosome</b> proteins, we determined the crystal structure of Neisseria gonorrhoeae PriB at 2. 7 Å resolution and investigated its ability to physically interact with DNA and PriA helicase. Comparison of the crystal structures of PriB from N. gonorrhoeae and E. coli reveals a well-conserved homodimeric structure consisting of two oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding (OB) folds. In spite of their overall structural similarity, there is significant species variation in the type and distribution of surface amino acid residues. This correlates with striking differences in the affinity with which each PriB homolog binds single-stranded DNA and PriA helicase. These results provide evidence that mechanisms of DNA replication restart are not identical across diverse species and that these pathways have likely become specialized {{to meet the needs of}} individual organisms...|$|E

The survival of ultraviolet-irradiated phage and the frequency of genetic recombination are reduced by rrh. In addition, rrh diminishes the production of concatemeric DNA.
