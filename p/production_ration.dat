40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the use of}} two U-series nuclides – 231 Pa and 230 Th – as proxies for studying ocean circulation. A total of six water-column profiles of 231 Pa, 230 Th, and 232 Th have been measured from two regions of the southwestern Indian Ocean: the Madagascar and Mascarene Basins; and the southeastern continental margin of South Africa. Measurement by MC-ICP-MS of 10 litre water samples is possible for samples with as little as 4 and 2 fg of 231 Pa and 230 Th and yields typical uncertainties of 6 % and 14 % respectively. These profiles show that the scavenging and advection histories of water masses can affect their 231 Pa concentration, with distinct variations superimposed on a general increase in concentration with depth due to reversible scavenging. A 1 D particle scavenging model is used to show that sedimentary (231 Paxs / 230 Thxs) 0 is most representative of the (231 Pa/ 230 Th) of the bottom most water mass at any one locality, although in turn this water mass (231 Pa/ 230 Th) will be dependent not only on its advection and scavenging history but also the 231 Pa and 230 Th concentrations of the overlying water masses during advection. Acknowledgment that sedimentary (231 Paxs / 230 Thxs) 0 is “set” by the bottommost water mass is important for interpretation of scenarios where changes in depth of circulation, as well as circulation strength, may have occurred. A record of sedimentary (231 Paxs / 230 Thxs) 0 has been recovered from a 6 m Kasten core from the Mascarene Basin covering the past 140 ka, in order to reconstruct flow of AABW into the basin. The (231 Paxs / 230 Thxs) 0 measured is below the <b>production</b> <b>ration</b> of 0. 093 and shows no significant variation. This indicates that (231 Paxs / 230 Thxs) 0 is sensitive to changes in particle productivity and circulation at this location and {{that there has been}} little or no change in either environmental variable over the last full interglacial-glacial cycle. This finding is in contrast to other ocean basins, particularly the North Atlantic, where large changes in circulation are observed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Foram utilizadas 700 codornas japonesas, com 61 dias de idade, distribuídas em 70 unidades experimentais de dez aves. O delineamento foi inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 5 × 2, composto de cinco níveis de Pd (0, 15; 0, 25; 0, 35; 0, 45 e 0, 55 %) e dois de Ca (2, 5 e 3, 2 %), com sete repetições por tratamento. As dietas experimentais foram isoprotéicas (20, 0 % PB), isocalóricas (2. 900 kcal EM/kg) e isoaminoacídicas. Os níveis de Pd influenciaram de forma quadrática a altura e o diâmetro médio dos ovos, o teor de Ca na casca e a porcentagem de Ca (2, 5 % Ca) e P (3, 2 %Ca) nos ossos. Houve melhora linear na produção de ovos comercializáveis e na porcentagem de P nos ossos (menor nível da Ca testado) até os níveis de 0, 31 e 0, 51 % de Pd, respectivamente, na dieta. Com o aumento dos níveis de Pd na dieta, a conversão alimentar por dúzia de ovos piorou de forma linear e a porcentagem e o peso de gema reduziram até os níveis 0, 40 e 0, 25 % de Pd, respectivamente, na dieta. O peso, a porcentagem e a espessura de casca, o peso específico, o teor de Ca na casca e a porcentagem de Ca nos ossos foram influenciados pelos níveis de Ca na dieta. Não houve influência dos níveis de Ca e Pd sobre a produção de ovos, o consumo de ração, a massa de ovos, a conversão alimentar por massa de ovos, a viabilidade, o peso médio final das aves e a porcentagem e o peso de albúmen nos ovos. Níveis dietéticos de 2, 5 e 0, 31 % de Pd são suficientes para proporcionar bom desempenho produtivo e para manutenção satisfatória da qualidade dos ovos e do perfil nutricional do tecido ósseo de codornas japonesas durante a fase inicial de postura. An {{experiment was}} conducted with the objective to verify the effect of different levels of available phosphorus (aP) and of calcium (Ca) in the diet on the performance, the quality of eggs and the nutritional status of the bone tissue of japanese quails during the initial laying phase. A total of 700 japanese quails, with 61 days of age, distributed in 70 experimental units with 10 birds each were used. A completely randomized experimental design was use, in a 5 × 2 factorial arrangement with five levels of aP (0. 15; 0. 25; 0. 35; 0. 45 e 0, 55 %) and two levels of Ca (2. 5 e 3. 2 %), with seven replicates per treatments. The experimental diets were isoprotéicas (20. 0 % CP), isocalóricas (2. 900 kcal ME/kg) and isoaminoacids. The levels of aP influenced by a quadratic form, the height and the average diameter of the eggs, the Ca egg shell content and percentage of Ca (2. 5 % Ca) and P (3. 2 % Ca) in the bones. There was a linear improvement for the commercial egg production and percentage of P in the bones (lower level of tested Ca), up {{to the level of}} 0. 31 % and of 0. 51 % P, respectively, in the diet. As aP levels increased in the diet, the conversion for dozen of eggs linearly decreased and the percentage and yolk weight reduced up to the levels of 0. 40 and 0. 25 % of aP, respectively, in the diet. The shell weight, percentage and thickness, specific weight, shell Ca content and percentage of Ca in the bones were influenced by the Ca levels in the diet.

40|$|On {{comparing}} the weight increases {{of the two}} groups of sheep it will be noticed that the mean increases are reasonably equal there being only a difference of 0. 11 kg. in favour of the sulphur fed group which is altogether insignificant. When allowance is made for the difference in food intake it is found that this adjustment does not make an appreciable reduction in the variance and that the adjusted difference of 2. 2 kg. in favour of the control group remains quite insignificant. In short, it may be said that the conclusion is justified that a daily dose of 5 grms. of flowers of sulphur is without effect on the bodyweight, food consumption and wool production of sheep. It seems necessary, however, to review briefly the work on sulphur feeding to sheep that has been published from this Institute in order to state the final conclusions clearly. Steyn's investigations (1931, 1932, 1934 and 1935) were undertaken, as stated by him, to determine the quantity of sulphur that could be administered to young and full-grown sheep with safety over prolonged periods. Obviously, the body weights of the sheep could be registered with advantage and this was done accordingly. Furthermore, the sheep had to be shorn {{in the course of the}} experiment, and hence, the weights of the wool produced were recorded. It is abundantly clear from Steyn's publication (1934) that he fully realizes the unsuitability of his material to determine the nutritional value of sulphur when, naturally, increase in body weight, food consumption, effect on production, etc., are important considerations and if this information had been required his experiments would have been planned differently so as to ensure the registration of these observations for the collection of suitable data for justifiable and definite conclusions. At best, therefore, it can be said that the results of Steyn's original experiment (1931, 1932) seemed to suggest that sulphur when administered to mature sheep at. the rate of 5 grms. once, twice or three times weekly, over prolonged periods stimulates increase in body weight and wool yield. In a subsequent experiment (Steyn 1935) 5 grms. of sulphur were administered daily to immature sheep without detrimental effect on body weight and on the wool production of the animals. As a matter of fact the differences in body weight and in the weights of the wool produced are significantly in favour of the sulphur fed animals. All the sheep were fed ad lib. as one group, which excludes a consideration of more efficient food utilization or increased food consumption of the sulphur fed when compared with the controls. Again, therefore, it can be said that this investigation suggested that sulphur feeding to sheep affects their body weights and wool production beneficially. What is, however, quite definite about this work is that sulphur administered in the doses stated did not affect the animals detrimentally. Working upon the indications of Steyn's original experiments (1931, 1932) du Toit et al (1935) carried out an investigation with sheep to determine the nutritional value of sulphur. Five grms. of sulphur were dosed to each animal in a group of sheep daily while another group was kept as controls. The experiment was planned to satisfy the requirements of a feeding trial. The body weights of the sheep were registered periodically, a productive ration was fed to the individual sheep in separate feeding boxes and the food consumption of the individual animals was recorded. The animals were kept on the basal ration for twelve months pre-experimental period after which the sulphur was administered to the one group for a further twelve months. Both groups were of course still kept on the basal ration for the second period of twelve months. Wool was collected from all the animals in both groups, analysed and reported on by van Wyk, Botha and Bekker (1935). In view of the entire absence of any significant difference in body weight, food consumption and wool production of the sulphur fed group when compared with the control group the conclusion appears to be justified that a daily dose of 5 grms. sulphur did not affect the sheep significantly, when they were given a <b>production</b> <b>ration.</b> The above experiment with sheep on a limited food intake obviously excludes a consideration of increased food consumption which might be an effect of sulphur feeding and hence the investigation reported on in the present paper under conditions of ad libitum feeding was undertaken. Again the experiment was planned, primarily with the object of determining the nutritional value of sulphur and fulfils the demands of a feeding trial. As in the previous work no beneficial effect of sulphur feeding could be determined, nor was the food intake of the sulphur fed group significantly affected. The main result of the Onderstepoort experiments on the effect of administering sulphur to sheep, could therefore be summarized as follows: Five grms. of sulphur will be given per os to sheep over prolonged periods without detrimental effects. The body weight, food consumption and wool production are apparently not significantly affected by the sulphur administered to the sheep.

That they can survive, and more often than not do survive, is due to both the experience and skill of Australian farmers and the agricultural research that serves them so well. A recent book that provides Australian cattle and sheep raisers with information to help them overcome feeding problems during periods of drought should be of equal practical interest in other arid parts of the world. It is Drought feeding strategies theory and practice and the book's opening comment essentially summarises the contents: The key to efficient drought feeding is to balance feeds by supplementing nutrients to meet the animal's needs. And the author, Dr R A Leng, draws on his wealth of experience as Professor of Biochemistry and Director of the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of New England to explain how different feeding strategies are necessary, depending on the purpose and level of <b>production.</b> <b>Rations</b> are based on pastures, crop residues and agroindustrial by-products. All of the latter are readily available in Australia and many are available in other countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. All the examples are based on data available from the literature and on research. A chapter is included on digestion, absorption and utilisation of the components of different feeds in the ruminant digestive system. This helps explain the feeding problems described and the solutions recommended. Some of the solutions will need modification to suit differing situations in other countries but overall the subject is of practical interest in many ACP countries. Leng, R A. 1987.

40|$|Purpose: {{the aim of}} {{the work}} is to {{substantiate}} methodological approaches to create the most important component of strategic planning – its regulatory framework. The relevance of the chosen topic of this article {{is due to the fact}} that in modern conditions, strategic planning is an important tool for ensuring sustainable development and increasing the competitiveness of the domestic economy. It allows you to identify the most important and priority areas of activity, distribute and ensure the effective use of available limited labor, material and, most importantly, financial resources. Today, domestic strategic planning has a number of significant shortcomings, the main one of which, in our opinion, is the lack of reliable initial information for forecasting and analytical calculations. Methods: the methodological basis is the dialectical method of scientific cognition, the systemic and institutional approach to building an effective information base of strategic planning. In the course of research of the current state and level of industrial rationing, methods of analysis and synthesis, comparisons and analogies were used. As a methodological basis of this article, regulatory legal documents were used in the field of strategic planning in Russia, as well as methodological documents that previously operated in the USSR on the regulation of resource consumption. Results: the result of the work are the goals, tasks and requirements for the strategic planning base proposed by the author. The relationship of <b>production</b> <b>rationing</b> with the basic principles of strategic planning is shown - balance and consistency in priorities, goals, objectives, activities, resources and timing; The effectiveness of methods and methods for achieving goals with the least expenditure of resources used. The possibility of the existence of a standardization of labor costs, the consumption of material and production resources, regardless of the form of ownership of the means of production and methods of price regulation, is proved. Conclusions and Relevance: сurrently, direct borrowing of foreign methodological approaches to strategic planning seems to be sufficiently problematic, since they do not take into account (and cannot take into account) the specific realities and mentality of the Russian economy. Therefore, Russia needs to create its own system of state strategic planning, as a methodical basis for the development of a regulatory framework which can be based on the approach proposed in the work.  </p...|$|R

40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} pricing {{problem for a}} class of {{products}} with stable consumption patterns (e. g., household items, staple foods). Consumers may stock up the product at current prices for future consumption, but they incur inventory holding costs. We model this situation as a dynamic game over an infinite time horizon: in each period, the seller sets a price, and each consumer chooses how many units to buy. We develop a solution methodology based on rational expectations. By endowing each player with beliefs, we decouple the dynamic game into individual dynamic programs for each player. We solve for the rational expectations equilibrium, where all players make optimal dynamic decisions given correct beliefs about others 2 ̆ 7 behavior. In equilibrium, the seller may either charge a constant fixed price or offer periodic price promotions at predictable time intervals. We show that promotions are useful when frequent shoppers {{are willing to pay}} more for the product than are occasional shoppers. We also develop several model extensions to study the impact of consumer stockpiling on the seller 2 ̆ 7 s inventory, <b>production,</b> and <b>rationing</b> strategies...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>production</b> {{and inventory}} <b>rationing</b> {{of a product}} to fulfill multiple demand classes in a make-to-stock production system with a failure-prone machine. Demand that cannot be satisfied immediately is lost and incurs a lost sales cost, which differs from class to class. We find that the optimal control policies under both the expected total discounted cost criterion and the average cost criterion have similar structural properties. Specifically, the optimal production policy is the base-stock policy and the optimal inventory allocation policy is the threshold control policy with machine-state-dependent threshold levels. Finally, we provide numerical examples to show the importance of taking machine failures into consideration {{and the effectiveness of}} the optimal control policy.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} production control and stock rationing in a make-to-stock production system with lost sales, multiple servers –parallel production channels [...] , and several customer classes. We assume independent stationary Poisson demand streams and exponential service times. At decision epochs, {{in conjunction with the}} stock allocation decision, the control specifies whether {{to increase the number of}} operational servers or not. Previously placed production orders cannot be cancelled. We model the system as an M /M /s make-to-stock queue and characterize properties of the optimal cost function, and of the optimal <b>production</b> and <b>rationing</b> policies. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy, and the optimal rationing policy is of threshold type. Furthermore, we prove that the rationing levels are nonincreasing in the number of operational channels. We also show that the optimal ordering policy transforms into a bang-bang type policy when we relax the model by allowing order cancellations. Another model with partial order-cancellation flexibility is provided to fill the gap between the no-flexibility and the full-flexibility models. We quantify the additional gain that the optimal policy provides over the –suboptimal — base-stock policy proposed in the literature, along with the value of the flexibility to cancel production orders...|$|R
40|$|In dairy farming, {{monitoring}} {{tools are}} developing rapidly {{and the possibility}} of combining available data to generate additional information raises new questions. The high throughput body weight is a new and frequent phenotype on dairy farms. Feed intake monitoring in dairy cows remains largely absent, even though it is useful for herd management. The purpose of this work was to predict the dynamics of dry matter intake with a model using live weight, milk <b>production</b> and <b>ration</b> characteristics. This model {{is based on the assumption}} that changes in body weight are closely related to dry matter intake through two components: short-term changes in digestive content related to ingestion and long-term changes in body reserves, which are linked to the cumulative energy balance of the cow since calving. The energy balance results from the difference between the energy inputs from the ingested quantities and the energy requirements related to milk production. The model was tested in a trial with 65 cows receiving the same complete ration during the first 18 weeks of lactation. Observed individual intake was predicted well by the model, with average weekly errors of 2. 3 kg, although the daily errors are still high (SD = 3. 31 kg). Intake prediction during the first month of lactation showed a systematic bias and further investigation will be necessary to understand this bias and correct it...|$|R

The branching ratio for elastic events is equal to 0. 883 ± 0. 008. Eight events are unambiguously attributed to the reaction π+p→π+pγ. Cross sections for the various reactions are given. The elastic angular distribution has been determined up to cos θ = + 0. 975 and shows evidence for S, P, D waves in good agreement with the results obtained in other experiments. For the one-pion <b>production</b> reactions, the <b>ration</b> of π 0 production to π 0 production is found equal to 4. 1 ± 0. 8. This result and the corresponding distributions for momentum and angle of the secondaries are compared with the predictions of the isobaric models. © 1965.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the stock rationing {{problem of a}} single-item, make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales. When demand is Poisson and processing time has an Erlang distribution, we show that a single-state variable called work storage level can be employed to completely capture the information regarding inventory level {{and the status of}} current <b>production.</b> The optimal <b>rationing</b> policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone critical work storage levels. For each demand class, there exists a work storage level at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher-priority demands. The optimal production policy can also be characterized by a critical work storage level. Our numerical examples indicate that a critical stock level policy, which ignores information on the status of current production, performs very well.

Rumen fluid was collected before the morning meal from 8 gestating goats (Boer×Saanen, body weight 3 ± 2. 3 kg). GP was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation. Ruminal fermentation parameters such as 96 h partitioning factor (PF 96), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy (ME), short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and metabolizable energy (ME) were also estimated. Inclusion of DCP linearly increased (P< 0. 01) cumulative gas production at 24, 48, and 96 h after inoculation, as well as asymptotic gas <b>production</b> (b). <b>Rations</b> at 30 % and 10 % DCP had the highest values of gas production, whereas control and 20 % DCP presented the same values (quadratic effect P< 0. 01). Lag phase (L) decreased linearly (P< 0. 001) with DCP addition. IVDMD and IVOMD increased linearly (P< 0. 01) with the inclusion of DCP in rations. The ration at 30 % DCP (DCP 30) had the greatest value of ME and SCFA, but no differences were observed in the PF 96 among treatments.

40|$|In recent years, many {{manufacturing}} companies have started exploring innovative revenue management technologies {{in an effort}} to improve their operations and ultimately their bottom lines. Methods such as differentiating customers based on their sensitivity to price and delays are employed by firms to increase their profits. These developments call for models that have the potential to radically improve supply chain efficiencies {{in much the same way}} that revenue management has changed the airline industry. In this dissertation, we study revenue management models where customers can be separated into different classes depending on their sensitivity to price, lead time, and service. Specifically, we focus on identifying effective models to coordinate production, inventory and admission controls in face of multiple classes of demand and time- varying parameters. We start with a single-class-customer problem with both backlogged and discretionary sales. Demand may be fulfilled no later than N periods with price discounts if the inventory is not available. If profitable, demand may be rejected even if the inventory is still available. (cont.) For this problem we analyze the structure of the optimal policy and show that it is characterized by three state-independent control parameters: the produce-up-to level (S), the reserve-up-to level (R), and the backlog-up-to level (B). At the beginning of each period, the manufacturer will produce to bring the inventory level up to S or to the maximum capacity; during the period, s/he will set aside R units of inventory for the next period, and satisfy some customers with the remaining inventory, if expected future profit is higher; otherwise, s/he will satisfy customers with the inventory and backlog up to B units of demands. Then, we analyze a single-product, two-class-customer model in which demanding (high priority) customers would like to receive products immediately, while other customers are willing to wait in order to pay lower prices. For this model, we provide a heuristic policy characterized by three threshold levels: S, R, B. (cont.) In this policy, during each period, the manufacturer will set aside R units of inventory for the next period, and satisfy some high priority customers with the remaining inventory, if expected future profit is higher; otherwise, s/he will satisfy as many of the high priority customers as possible and backlog up to B units of lower priority customers. Finally, we examine <b>production,</b> <b>rationing,</b> and admission control policies in manufacturing systems with both make-to-stock(MTS) and make-to-order(MTO) products. Two models are analyzed. In the first model, which is motivated by the automobile industry, the make-to-stock product has higher priority than the make-to-order product. In the second model, which is motivated by the PC industry, the manufacturer gives higher priority to the make-to-order product over the make-to-stock product. We characterize the optimal production and order admission policies with linear threshold levels. We also extend those results to problems where low-priority backorders can be canceled by the manufacturer, as well as to problems with multiple types of make-to-order products. by Tieming Liu.
