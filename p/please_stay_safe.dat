This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a school based safety skills programme - The <b>Stay</b> <b>Safe</b> Programme - in facilitating the disclosure of sexual abuse among sexually victimized children and adolescents in Dublin. Method. A cohort of 145 children who had participated in the <b>Stay</b> <b>Safe</b> Programme prior to their referral to a sexual abuse assessment unit were compared with a cohort of 443 children who had not participated in the prevention programme on a range of disclosure related variables abstracted from case notes. Results. More <b>Stay</b> <b>Safe</b> participants, particularly female adolescents, made disclosures of suspected sexual abuse than non-participants.
