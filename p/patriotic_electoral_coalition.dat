50|$|In the {{parliamentary}} election 1933 the main campaign issues were the differing attitudes towards {{democracy and the}} rule of law between the <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Electoral</b> Alliance (National <b>Coalition</b> Party and Patriotic People's Movement) and the Legality Front (Social Democrats, Agrarian League, Swedish People's Party and Progressives). The <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Electoral</b> Alliance favoured continuing the search for suspected Communists - the Communist Party and its affiliated organisations in the spirit of the Lapua Movement. The Legality Front did not want to spend any significant time on searching suspected Communists, but rather wanted to concentrate on keeping the far-right in check. The Legality Front won the elections, but the Agrarian League lost a part of its support.|$|R

50|$|The DKP {{was founded}} in August 1990 as the legal {{successor}} of the <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>Coalition</b> (HVK), however the party tried to distance itself from the predecessor organization. The DKP considered itself as a Christian socialist centre-left party with social democratic values. The party also placed great emphasis on the enforcement of freedom of the press, while supported the emergence of private farms but rejected the Independent Smallholders' Party's proposal on re-privatization. The first leader of the party was lawyer Zoltán Új, he was replaced by Sándor Forrai on 18 May 1991. Forrai died in office on 27 April 1992, he was succeeded by István György. In February 1993, Mihály Hesz and his supporters left the party to re-establish the HVK, however {{the court did not}} recognise that step. Hesz was excluded from the DKP officially.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1985 {{return to}} democracy, Brazilian {{politicians}} {{have resorted to}} vote-pooling arrangements to elect representatives. A puzzle thus presents itself: What drives parties to join these electoral cartels? The dissertation unraveled the incentives party elites have to participate in coalitions under a presidencialist system of government. I also investigated the effect of <b>electoral</b> <b>coalitions</b> on congressional representation. I applied a model of binary outcomes and relied on standard deviations to assess the ideological homogeneity/heterogeneity of <b>electoral</b> <b>coalitions.</b> I also calculated the Index of Disproportionality to measure the gaps between the proportion of votes and seats received by all parties in Brazil with and without <b>electoral</b> <b>coalitions.</b> Finally, I assessed {{the effects of the}} electoral formula on proportionality. An unexpected exogenous factor resulted crucial in explaining proportional <b>electoral</b> <b>coalition</b> building: The district 2 ̆ 7 s majoritarian election for governor. In each district, political actors often synchronize coalition partners to maximize winning results while minimizing electoral efforts. ...|$|R
