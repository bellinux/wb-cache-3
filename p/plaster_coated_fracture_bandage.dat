Most of the naturalistic statues are found with their <b>plaster</b> <b>coat,</b> while the less preserved the coat is, the more idealized the work appears.|$|R

40|$|Journal articleThis paper {{addresses}} <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> in hard brittle coatings {{subjected to}} combined normal and tangential loads through a finite element based methodology. The coating is modelled as an elastic layer perfectly bonded to an elastic substrate with a pre-microcrack, assumed to initiate at the contact trailing edge {{due to high}} tensile stress. The predicted {{results are consistent with}} previously published <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> results. The model predicts a significant effect of coating thickness on crack propagation for coatings with large elastic mismatch and the final propagated crack profile is predicted to depend on friction coefficient, <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness and sliding displacement.

40|$|The {{fracture}} of water ballast tank (WBT) coatings due to thermal stresses is widely recognised as an issue. Upon <b>coating</b> <b>fracture,</b> rapid corrosion of the tanker steel structure will occur, leading to expensive structure repairs or even tanker scrapping. In this project, the fracture behaviour of two experimental WBT coatings, {{referred to as}} A and B, in the forms of free film and substrated coatings was investigated. Static tensile tests and fatigue tests of the substrated coatings were performed. A finite element model of coating cracking was developed. Thermal stress and J-integral of surface cracking defects in substrated coatings were calculated using the model, in which the effects of defect size, coating thickness, and thermal strain on <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> were investigated. For the first time, fracture mechanics was used to explain WBT <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> behaviour. The J-integral of surface defects was used to predict the onset strain of coating cracking under mechanical strains in laboratory and under thermal strains in service. A theoretical comparison between the cracking drive forces in terms of J - integrals in WBT coatings under thermal strains and mechanical strains was performed...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of microhardness, fracture toughness and residual stress {{of an air}} plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coating system under thermal cycles was investigated by a modified Vickers indentation instrument coupled with three kinds of indentation models. The results show that fracture toughness on the top coating surface after thermal cycles changes from 0. 64 to 3. 67 MPa•m 1 / 2, and the corresponding residual stress near the indented region varies from – 36. 8 to – 243 MPa. For the interface region of coating and bond <b>coat,</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness in the coating close to interface ranges from 0. 11 to 0. 81 MPa•m 1 / 2, and residual stress varies from – 5 to – 30 MPa, which are consistent with available data.

40|$|A {{series of}} coating/substrate systems with typical {{automotive}} finishes as coatings were loaded in fourpoint bending. The coatings in these specimens usually failed by multiple cracking; we recorded {{the density of}} coating cracks {{as a function of}} bending strain. These experimental results were fit to a new fracture mechanics theory of coating failure that predicts the next coating crack forms when the energy released by that fracture event exceeds the toughness of the coating. This fitting procedure led to experimental result for <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness. We found that coating toughness continually dropped as the coatings were baked for longer times. There was also a profound substrate e#ect which means that <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness must be regarded as an in situ toughness property.

40|$|Studies {{dealing with}} {{fracture}} flow at Yucca Mountain have generally assumed that any water flowing {{down in a}} fracture will be absorbed by the porous matrix. However, a thin lining of low permeability material on the fracture walls may significantly impede imbibition into the matrix of unsaturated tuff. In this research, imbibition was measured across the fracture surfaces in the laboratory. Samples were collected from surface outcrops of Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring members of the Paintbrush tuff near Yucca Mountain. Sorptivity, a convenient measure of imbibition, was used to investigate the changes in hydraulic properties {{as a result of}} fracture coatings. Results from experimental analysis of Topopah Spring tuff showed decreased sorptivity across <b>coated</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces. Statistically, the coatings on the Tiva Canyon samples do not significantly affect sorptivity. Scanning Electron Microscope analysis shows that coatings on the s grit Tiva Canyon samples are made up of iron, aluminum and to some extent magnesium. Coating material on the Topopah Spring samples is made up of calcium, magnesium, aluminum and iron. Coating significantly reduces the sorptivity for the Topopah Spring tuff. Numerical results are presented to show the effect of fracture coatings on water infiltration down a vertical fracture in simulated tuff. For the Topopah Spring tuff, the wetting front in the <b>coated</b> <b>fracture</b> travels deeper in the fracture and less into the matrix compared to the wetting front in the uncoated fracture. For the Tiva Canyon tuff, the wetting front in the uncoated fracture travels deeper in the fracture and less into the matrix as compared to the wetting front in the <b>coated</b> <b>fracture...</b>|$|R

40|$|Radon {{is one of}} the {{radiation}} sources which occurs naturally in the environment. It is a form of radioactive gas and one of the contributors for lung cancer besides smoking due to the emission of alpha particles. Radon (Rn- 222) can be found in common building materials such as the red bricks and it is derived from the series decay process of Uranium (U- 238). It is produced from the combination of sand, cement, and possibly clay to form a bulk of bricks. These aggregates are also consisting of Rn- 222 concentration. People in Malaysia do not realize the existence of Rn- 222 emanates from red bricks. Rn- 222 emanates from the red bricks through the porosity and also the cracking line along the bricks. In order to prevent emanation of α-particles Rn- 222 progenies from red bricks, a layer of plaster was applied. This <b>plaster</b> was then <b>coated</b> with selected coating which are Jotun, Nippon Paint, and Dulux. Radon Sentinel 1030 monitor was used to measure the concentration of Rn- 222 that emanates from the brick before and after coated with different types of coating materials. The concentration of Rn- 222 had decreased after being coated with coating materials. However, the concentration of Rn- 222 in the layer applied with only plaster is in the range of - 0. 6 pCi/L to - 0. 9 pCi/L. The concentration of layer applied with <b>plaster</b> <b>coated</b> with Jotun was in between - 0. 8 pCi/L to - 1. 0 pCi/L whereas the <b>plaster</b> <b>coated</b> with Nippon was from - 0. 3 pCi/L to - 0. 9 pCi/L and the layer coated with Dulux was in between - 0. 7 pCi/L to - 0. 8 pCi/L...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{intended}} to predict the stress behavior of thick hard coating at the interface with the changes of coating stiffness and thickness to the substrate of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and SCMV. The elastic mismatch between the coating and the substrate {{is presented in the}} value of Dundur’s parameter α. The prediction is done using simple geometry of a cylinder-on-flat model in 2 D analysis subjected to normal and tangential loading. Tangential stress distribution along the coating-substrate interface is then obtained from the FE modelling after a finite sliding of the cylinder. It is predicted that the maximum tangential stress value predicted at the interface which relates to <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> failure is increasing as stiffer coating is used on compliant substrate (i. e. increasing α values). The location of the maximum tangential stress predicted also changes from the trailing edge to the center of contact with increasing α values. Effect of changes of coating thickness on the predicted maximum tangential stress value is more significant for high positive α values. Risk of <b>coating</b> <b>fracture</b> at the interface is therefore predicted to increase with the increase of coating thickness and stiffness...|$|R

Under Knobelsdorff's leadership the building was expanded in two phases between 1738 and 1742 into an extensive, symmetrical structure with side wings and small pavilions.
