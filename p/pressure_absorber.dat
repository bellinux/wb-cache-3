40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} heat and mass transfer and pressure drops occurring inside a tube-in-tube refrigerant cooled absorber (RCA) is developed. This heat exchanger {{is used as}} a low <b>pressure</b> <b>absorber</b> in a half-effect water-ammonia absorption chiller. The two-phase stream, resulting from the mixing at low pressure of the weak solution coming from the generator and the refrigerant leaving the evaporator, flows in the tube-in-tube annulus, while the stream of condensed refrigerant, throttled to a pressure level intermediate between condenser and evaporator pressures, flows counter-current in the internal tube. The RCA model is validated by comparing overall heat transfer duty, pressure drops on each stream and temperature axial profile in the annulus with experimental data. Results are in reasonable agreement with experiments in most of the analyzed cases, although some deviations exist in off-design operations. A sensitivity analysis of the model has shown that the measurement uncertainty of the inputs to the model does not affect the validity of the results...|$|E
40|$|Double-lift {{absorption}} cycles {{represent a}} suitable solution for air-cooled thermally driven cooling applications. Among the several existing double-lift configurations, semi-GAX cycles {{are known as}} the most promising in terms of efficiency. These cycles incorporate the GAX effect in a pressure staged cycle, {{by means of a}} split on the solution leaving the low <b>pressure</b> <b>absorber.</b> Two configurations of the semi-GAX cycle have been proposed in the past, the semi-GAX 1 and the semi-GAX 2. The former achieves the GAX effect between the intermediate and the high pressure levels, the latter between the low and the intermediate. Within this paper, the semi-GAX cycles are numerically investigated at operating conditions suitable for a low temperature driven (e. g., by flat plate solar collectors) air conditioning application. The peculiarities of the two cycles are described and the factors affecting their performances are underlined. The COP resulted to be strongly influenced by the split ratio, which determines the intermediate pressure and the possibility to achieve the GAX effect. If the split ratio is optimized to achieve the maximum COP, the COP is higher for semi-GAX 2 for air temperatures below 27 °C and for semi-GAX 1 above. In both cases, the maximum air temperature which allows a circulation ratio below 15 is 40 °C, with chilled water at 7 / 12 °C and driving temperature of 90 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and International Institute of Refrigeration.

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{this study}} is the {{assessment}} of vacuum operating pressure for amine based solvent regeneration with respect to plant efficiency and economic in order to conclude about its industrial potential. The capture process considered is the conventional two columns configuration with MEA solvent. A regeneration pressure range from 0. 06 to 2. 5 bar have been investigated. The thermal integration with the power plant has been performed on a new built, advanced supercritical power plant adapted for CO 2 capture. Flue gases condensation heat and CO 2 compression heat have been fully integrated in the steam cycle. Influence of stripper pressure on optimal lean loading ratio and columns basic design (height and diameter) have been investigated, with a focus on the influence of the CO 2 compression heat integration strategy. Calculations of plant efficiency have been completed by simplified economical calculations for the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and avoided CO 2 (LCCO 2) in order to assess the industrial interest of stripper vacuum operation. Regarding plant efficiency the optimal pressure is at the minimum value: i. e. 0. 06 bar with a loss of efficiency of 7. 6 %pt. In the pressure range from 0. 5 bar (medium vacuum) to 2. 5 bar (standard stripper pressure), plant efficiency is quite stable with a minimum around atmospheric pressure with 9. 4 %pt loss of efficiency. Regarding plant economics the main impact of vacuum regeneration is not the cost of the larger stripper but the cost of the very large compressor needed to maintain vacuum condition. At very low <b>pressure,</b> <b>absorber</b> and stripper have the same operating temperature therefore the economizer is no longer needed. Coupled with the improved plant efficiency, the effect of pressure on cost of electricity and cost of avoided CO 2 is very small. The expected gain for deep vacuum stripper is not large enough to justify pilot demonstration of such operating parameters...|$|E

The improvements result from the use of an electrochemical stripping cycle, in lieu of the traditional thermal swing, to facilitate CO[subscript 2] desorption and amine regeneration; metal cations generated at an anode react with the amines, displacing the CO[subscript 2], which is then flashed off, and the amines are regenerated by subsequent reduction of the metal cations in a cathode cell. The advantages of such a process include higher CO[subscript 2] desorption <b>pressures,</b> smaller <b>absorbers,</b> and lower energy demands. Several example chemistries using different polyamines and copper are presented.

In this paper we describe a hierarchy of such methods. The most versatile and accurate of these is an "exact" line-by-line model (Fels and Schwarzkopf, 1981). Other methods described here employ simplifying assumptions about the structure of the 15 -/•m band which significantly improve their efficiency.

A mini-absorber test stand {{was used to test}} smooth tubes and a variety of advanced tube surfaces placed horizontally in a single-row bundle. The bundle had six copper tubes; each tube had an outside diameter of 15. 9 -mm and a length of 0. 32 -m. A unique feature of the stand is its ability to operate continuously and support testing of LiBr brine at mass fractions {ge} 0. 62. The test stand can also support testing to study the effect of the failing film mass flow rate, the coolant mass flow rate, the coolant temperature, the <b>absorber</b> <b>pressure</b> and the tube spacing. Manufacturers of absorption chillers add small quantities of a heat and mass transfer additive to improve the performance of the absorbers. The additive causes surface stirring which enhances the transport of absorbate into the bulk of the film. Absorption may also be enhanced with advanced tube surfaces that mechanically induce secondary flows in the falling film without increasing the thickness of the film. Several tube geometry's were identified and tested with the intent of mixing the film and renewing the interface with fresh solution from the tube wall. Testing was completed on a smooth tube and several different externally enhanced tube surfaces. Experiments {{were conducted}} over the operating conditions of 6. 5 mm Hg <b>absorber</b> <b>pressure,</b> coolant temperatures ranging from 20 to 35 C and LiBr mass fractions ranging from 0. 60 through 0. 62.

Test results showed the absorber load and the mass absorbed increased as the tube spacing increased because of the improved wetting of the tube bundle. However, tube spacing was not a critical factor if heat and mass transfer additive was active in the mini-absorber. The additive dramatically affected the hydrodynamics of the falling film and a droplet flow regime was evident for testing at all tube spacings. The mechanical mixing of the advanced surfaces increased the mass transfer to about 75 % of that observed on a smooth tube bundle, tested with heat and mass transfer additive. Testing with heat and mass transfer additive and advanced surfaces demonstrated a synergistic effect which doubled the mass absorbed from that observed with only the advanced surface.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} low grade waste heat from {{industrial}} processes are not utilized, {{due to lack}} of heat integration equipment. Industrial processes tend to have specifications at high temperature lifts, that not are suited to be operated by conventional technology from residential heat pumps. Standard vapor compression heat pumps have undesirable high pressure ratios that are inefficient at high temperature lifts. Compression-absorption heat pumps use zeotropic working fluid mixtures that are suitable for temperatures between - 10 and + 160 ℃ at system pressures below 20 bar, which make them applicable for delivering heat to high temperature processes. The advantages of the compression-absorption heat pumps, also known as the hybrid heat pump are the use of non-ozone depleting working fluid mixtures, reduced irreversibilities due to heat transfer with temperature glides, high temperature lifts, low pressure ratios and flexible capacity control. Two separate simulation models were developed comprising a two-stage CAHP system and an absorber model. The two-stage CAHP system used waste heat water at 50 ℃ as heat source and heat sink temperatures, with the objective of achieve maximum supply temperature at four different compressor discharge temperature limitations. The absorber model compared five different compact heat exchangers heating air in a cross-flow, where the main goal was to minimize the absorber height and the fan work. The two-stage process investigated the benefits of the desuperheater, where the supply temperatures with and without the desuperheater where nearly the same. Maximum supply temperatures were obtained at 171. 8 ℃ with a COP of 2. 08, when the maximum discharge temperature was set to 250 ℃. A correction factor was used for the intermediate pressure as K∙√(P_LP∙P_HP) The optimum K-factor increased at elevating <b>absorber</b> <b>pressure</b> from 1. 16 to 1. 35 at <b>absorber</b> <b>pressure</b> from 17 to 47. 5 bar. Simulations from the absorber model yielded much larger mass flow rate for the air than for the mixture.

Finned at tube heat exchangers gave the best results with respect to the absorber height and fan work. There is suggested to conduct further work with other heat sink and source temperatures and also optimize the temperature lift in the two stage model.

Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder – the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the calliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the calliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A “strobing” effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes “just off” the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc centre. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface. Other observations include hot spotting on the disc surface and a surface scan of the disc face indicates a depression at these positions. A metallurgical analysis of the blue spot is currently being carried out to determine if a material phase change has occurred within the disc body and this will be included in the paper.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of possibility for recovering {{of part of}} vibration energy from automobile {{has been done in}} the article. One of the potential possibilities is utilization of fluid <b>pressure</b> in shock <b>absorber</b> to drive turbogenerator applying battery. It can be interesting to utilize air shock absorbers, in Gerard to possibility of direct outlet of expanded air into atmosphere – it can simplify the design of set recovering energy. The aim of researches presented in the article has been to evaluate possibility for recovering of energy from air shock absorber without deterioration of vibration damping level, which can be provided by hydraulic shock absorber. The scheme of proposed air shock absorber, its mathematical model, the results of calculation for pressure increasing in shock absorber during its piston motion, for different velocity of the piston have been shown in the article. The characteristics of hydraulic absorber and air one with energy recovering have been compared. The model of the wheel and the automobile mass connected with that wheel has been presented. Using such model the simulations of the wheel and of the automobile mass motion, for tasked velocity of automobile have been made. The model of road microprofile has been elaborated [...] Using the models the recovered energy in the 1 km road section has been calculated...|$|R
40|$|Absorption {{chillers}} {{are gaining}} global acceptance as quality comfort cooling systems. These machines are the central chilling {{plants and the}} supply for cotnfort cooling for many large commercial buildings. Virtually all absorption chillers use lithium bromide (LiBr) and water as the absorption fluids. Water is the refrigerant. Research has shown LiBr to he {{one of the best}} absorption working fluids because it has a high affinity for water, releases water vapor at relatively low temperatures, and has a boiling point much higher than that of water. The heart of the chiller is the absorber, where a process of simultaneous heat and mass transfer occurs as the refrigerant water vapor is absorbed into a falling film of aqueous LiBr. The more water vapor absorbed into the falling film, the larger the chiller�s capacity for supporting comfort cooling. Improving the performance of the absorber leads directly to efficiency gains for the chiller. The design of an absorber is very empirical and requires experimental data. Yet design data and correlations are sparse in the open literature. The experimental data available to date have been derived at LiBr concentrations ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 60 mass fraction. No literature data are readily available for the design operating conditions of 0. 62 and 0. 64 mass fraction of LiBr and <b>absorber</b> <b>pressures</b> of 0. 7 and 1. 0 kPa...|$|R
40|$|Capture {{and storage}} from fossil fuel fired power plants is drawing {{increasing}} interest {{as a potential}} method for the control of greenhouse gas emissions. An optimization and technical parameter study for a CO 2 capture process of the flue gas of a commercial gas power plant, based on absorption/desorption process with MEA solutions, using HYSYS with the Amine Property Package fluid package, has been performed. The optimization has aimed to reduce the energy requirement for solvent regeneration, by investigating the effects of circulation rate, cross-flow heat exchanger minimum approach, desorber operating <b>pressure</b> and the <b>absorber</b> diameter. In addition, an economic evaluation including investment cost has been performed {{for the first three}} parameters. Major energy savings can be realized by optimizing the desorber pressure and the solvent circulation rate. The circulation rate will have a clearly defined optimal point, while for the desorber pressure the temperature will be a limiting factor. A too high temperature may lead to amine degradation and corrosion problems. The cross-flow heat exchanger minimum temperature approach will not affect the energy consumption significantly. An optimum absorber column diameter was not found, but the column should be designed with a diameter large enough to prevent flooding through the column. A too large diameter will not favour the energy consumption very much, and other factors will be more decisive when the column diameter is chosen...|$|R
40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /j. energy. 2016. 02. 022 An ANN (artificial neural network) {{model was}} {{developed}} to determine the efficiency parameters of a horizontal falling film absorber at operating conditions of interest for absorption cooling systems. The aqueous nitrate solution LiNO 3 +KNO 3 +NaNO 3 with salt mass percentages of 53 %, 28 % and 19 %, respectively, {{was used as a}} working fluid. The authors created the ANN from the database they had compiled with the results of experiments that they had performed in a set-up designed and built for this purpose. The ANN structure consisted of 6 input variables: inlet solution and cooling water temperatures, cooling water and solution mass flow rates, <b>absorber</b> <b>pressure</b> and inlet solution concentration; 4 output variables which facilitated the assessment of the performance of the absorber: heat and mass transfer coefficients, absorption mass flux and the degree of subcooling of the solution leaving the absorber. The hidden layer contained 9 neurons which were determined by training and test procedures. The results showed that the deviation between the experimental data and the estimated values was well adjusted. This indicated that the ANN model was an effective tool for predicting the efficiency parameters of the absorber. The solution flow rate was also observed to be the most significant operating variable which affected the performance of the absorber...|$|R
