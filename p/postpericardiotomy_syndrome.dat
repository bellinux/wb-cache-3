40|$|Background. Operative {{closure of}} atrial septal defect is today {{considered}} a high-benefit and low-risk operation. Patients are often young and {{sensitive to the}} cosmetic results of the procedure. The midline scar of median sternotomy may be unsightly and can provoke dissatisfaction and psychological distress. For cosmetic reasons, an alternative operative approach, such as right anterolateral thoracotomy, can be proposed, with better aesthetic results and without increasing operative risks. Methods. Our study reviews retrospectively the long-term results of a consecutive series of 56 young patients in whom the atrial septal defect was closed through a right submammary approach. The indication for this approach was isolated atrial septal defect in female patients with complete development of the breasts. Results. In-hospital morbidity included three <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndromes</b> with one operative drainage for a moderate pericardial effusion (subxiphoid approach); 6 patients had supraventricular tachycardia in the early postoperative period. One patient presented with a symptomatic supraventricular arrhythmia and was treated medically for atrial flutter or fibrillation. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 240 months and included 41 of 57 patients. There were no early or late deaths. All patients were in normal sinus rhythm and free of symptoms, in New York Heart Association functional class I. Electrocardiography results showed 4 patients with first-degree atrioventricular block and 5 with complete right bundle branch block. Echocardiographic study results showed 3 patients with a trivial residual shunt. There were no other late complications. Breast volume and symmetry and {{the character of the}} scar were evaluated objectively by a physician and subjectively by a multiple-choice questionnaire completed by the same patients. The answers suggested that the patients' subjective impressions were at least commensurate with the objective findings. Most of the patients perceived the cosmetic results as good or excellent. No serious psychological problems related to the scar were found. Conclusions. Right thoracotomy incision is a safe alternative approach to median sternotomy to repair isolated atrial septal defect in young female patients...|$|R

40|$|The <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PPS) is {{a common}} {{complication}} following cardiac surgery. The pathophysiology remains unclear, although evidence exists that surgical trauma {{and the use of}} cardiopulmonary bypass provoke an immune response leading to PPS.

We performed a subanalysis of the DECS study, which is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 4, 494 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of the DECS study was to investigate whether a single intraoperative dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone reduced the incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, or respiratory failure, within 30 days of randomization. In this substudy, we retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of PPS in 822 patients who were included in the DECS trial and underwent valvular surgery. <b>Postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> was diagnosed if 2 of 5 listed symptoms were present: unexplained fever, pleuritic chest pain, pericardial or pleural rub, new or worsening pericardial or pleural effusion. All medical charts, x-rays, and echocardiograms were reviewed. Secondary end point was the occurrence of complicated PPS, defined as PPS with need for evacuation of pleural effusion, pericardiocentesis, and tamponade requiring intervention or hospital readmission for PPS. This is a blinded, single-center, post hoc analysis. <b>Postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurred in 119 patients (14. 5 %).

40|$|The {{presence}} of heart-specific autoantibodies in the sera of some patients with Coxsackievirus B. ~ (CB 3) l-induced myocarditis (1, 2) {{has suggested that}} autoimmunity is a sequela of viral myocarditis.

However, the human disease does not easily lend itself to study due to the rarity {{of the disease and}} the unknown time course of the original viral infection. Therefore, an animal model is extremely valuable. Several murine models of myocarditis have been developed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms involved in CB 3 -induced myocarditis.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that when experimental {{animals such as}} the rabbit are inoculated with group A streptococci, an antibody appears which binds to heart tissue (1 - 3). This heart-reactive antibody (HRA) 1 will also bind to skeletal muscle and smooth muscle of vessel walls as well as preparations of sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac myofibers. HRAs have also been described in the sera of patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) (4, 5). Recently, it has been demonstrated that both group A streptococcal cell walls (6) and membranes (7) can absorb these antibodies from the sera. HRA is also present in the sera of patients with <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (8, 9), Chagas ' disease (10), and Dressler's syndrome (11) {{as well as at}} the time of cardiac transplant rejection (12).

A retrospective review was performed for 177 patients who underwent uncomplicated ASD closure from 1986 to 2006. The study group received prophylactic ASA 20 to 50  mg/kg/day for 1 to 6  weeks after surgery, whereas the control group did not. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of PPS based {{on the presence of}} two {{or more of the following}} symptoms or signs occurring at least 72  h postoperatively: fever (temperature > 38 °C), pericardial or pleural rub, and worsening or recurring anterior pleuritic chest pain.

40|$|Background: <b>Postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PPS) is {{a common}} {{complication}} following cardiac surgery; however, the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Identifying risk factors of PPS might help {{to better understand the}} syndrome. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide an overview of existing literature around determinants of PPS in adult cardiac surgery patients. Material and methods: Two independent investigators performed a systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register. The search aimed to identify studies published between January 1950 and December 2015, in which determinants of PPS were reported. Results: A total of 19 studies met the selection criteria. In these studies, 14 different definitions of PPS were used. The median incidence of PPS was 16 %. After quality assessment, seven studies were considered eligible for this review. Lower preoperative interleukin- 8 levels and higher postoperative complement conversion products were associated with a higher risk of PPS. Among other clinical factors, a lower age, transfusion of red blood cells and lower preoperative platelet and haemoglobin levels were associated with a higher risk of PPS. Colchicine use decreased the risk of PPS. Conclusion: We found that both the inflammatory response and perioperative bleeding and coagulation may play a role in the development of PPS, suggesting a multifactorial aetiology of the syndrome.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate inflammatory markers of the <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PPS) and to determine individuals prone to develop the PPS. Methods and Results: The study included 75 patients with a stable coronary disease that had underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Serum samples were collected prior to the surgery and on the 5 th day after the operation, to measure the concentration of IL- 8, IL- 6, IL- 1 b, IL- 10, TNF, IL- 12 p 70. All included patients were screened for the PPS before discharge from the hospital and 6 months after the surgery. The 49 patients developed the PPS (65. 4 %), among them 42 (56 %) patients had pleural effusion, and 23 (31 %) had pericardial effusion. The cytokine analysis has shown an inverse correlation between IL- 8 concentration before the surgery, and the occurrence of the PPS (p = 0. 026). There were also positive correlations between the magnitude of increase of IL- 8 and IL- 1 b concentrations on the 5 th day after the surgery and the occurrence of the PPS (p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 049 respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed IL- 8 concentration before surgery as an independent risk factor of the PPS development (HR = 0. 976; 95 %CI: 0. 956 – 0. 996, p = 0. 02).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the long-term prognosis and risk factors of <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PPS). METHODS: We performed a single-center cohort study in 822 patients undergoing nonemergent valve surgery. Risk factors of PPS were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. We also compared the incidence of reoperation for tamponade at 1 year between patients with and without PPS. Main secondary outcomes were hospital stay and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 822 patients, 119 (14. 5 %) developed PPS. A higher body mass index (odds ratio (OR) per point increase, 0. 94; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 89 - 0. 99) was associated with a lower risk of PPS, whereas preoperative treatment for pulmonary disease without corticosteroids (OR, 2. 55; 95 % CI, 1. 25 - 5. 20) was associated with a higher risk of PPS. The incidence of reoperation for tamponade at 1 year in PPS versus no PPS was 20. 9 % versus 2. 5 % (OR, 15. 49; 95 % CI, 7. 14 - 33. 58). One-year mortality in PPS versus no PPS was 4. 2 % versus 5. 5 % (OR, 0. 68; 95 % CI, 0. 22 - 2. 08).

Postoperative pulmonary function testing generally showed a steady improvement that plateaued by postoperative months 9 to 12. Fourteen patients who were followed up for at least 1 year underwent right heart catheterization; pressures and pulmonary vascular resistances were within normal ranges. Bronchiolitis obliterans was definitively diagnosed in three patients. Among the 76 donors, complications in the postoperative period included <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (three), atrial fibrillation (one), and surgical reexploration (three). Conclusions: We believe that these data support an expanded role for living-donor lobar lung transplantation. Our intermediate data are encouraging with respect to the functional outcome and survival of these critically ill patients, who would have died without this option.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVEThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of prophylactic immune suppression on the incidence and severity of <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PPS) in children after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). BACKGROUNDProphylactic suppression of the inflammatory response has an unknown effect on the incidence and severity of PPS in children undergoing surgery with CPB. METHODSThis randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial included two study groups. Group A received pre-CPB intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) plus four additional intravenous doses over 24 h, and Group B received intravenous saline placebo at identical intervals. Data included patient demographics, cardiac diagnosis/operation, CPB time, incidence and severity of PPS. Noncomplicated PPS—temperature > 100. 5 °F, pericardial friction rub, patient irritability, small pericardial ± pleural effusion. Complicated PPS—noncomplicated PPS plus hospital readmission ± pericardiocentesis or thoracentesis. RESULTSWe randomized 266 children: 20 exclusions (6 perioperative deaths, 14 reasons unrelated to treatment) leaving Group A (n = 126) and Group B (n = 120). There were no significant group differences in gender, cardiac diagnosis or CPB time. Group mean age differed (p = 0. 05) and was treated as a covariate with no substantive outcome effect. In total, 39 / 246 children (16 %) developed PPS (noncomplicated: n = 30, complicated: n = 9). There was no inter-group difference in overall PPS incidence (p = 0. 73). However, Group A had a marginally significant increase in complicated PPS (p = 0. 05). CONCLUSIONSIntravenous methylprednisolone at a standard anti-inflammatory dose administered pre-CPB and early post-CPB neither prevents nor attenuates PPS in children. Short-term pre-CPB and post-CPB methylprednisolone treatment may complicate PPS...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} about recurrent pericarditis in children. We sought to explore contemporary causes, characteristics, therapies and outcomes of recurrent pericarditis in paediatric patients. Methods: A multicentre (eight sites) cohort study of 110 consecutive cases of paediatric patients {{with at least two}} recurrences of pericarditis over an 11 -year period (2000 - 2010) [median 13 years, interquartile range (IQR) 5, 69 boys]. Results: Recurrences were idiopathic or viral in 89. 1 % of cases, followed by <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (9. 1 %) and familial Mediterranean fever (0. 9 %). Recurrent pericarditis was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 80. 9 % of cases, corticosteroids in 64. 8 % and colchicine was added in 61. 8 %. Immunosuppressive therapies were administered in 15. 5 % of patients after subsequent recurrences. After a median follow-up of 60 th months, 528 subsequent recurrences were recorded (median 3, range 2 - 25). Corticosteroid-treated patients experienced more recurrences (standardized risk of recurrence per 100 person-years was 93. 2 for patients treated with corticosteroids and 45. 2 for those without), side effects and disease-related hospitalizations (for all P< 0. 05). Adjuvant therapy with colchicine was associated with a decrease in the risk of recurrence from 3. 74 per year before initiation of colchicineto 1. 37 per year after (P< 0. 05). Anakinra therapy (nU 12) was associated with a drop in the number of recurrences from 4. 29 per year before to 0. 14 per year after (P< 0. 05). Transient constrictive pericarditis developed in 2. 7 % of patients. Conclusion: Recurrent pericarditis has an overall favourable prognosis in children, although it may require frequent readmissions and seriously affect the quality of life, especially in patients treated with corticosteroids. Colchicine or anakinra therapies were associated with significant decrease in the risk of recurrenc...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare the safety and {{efficacy}} of the HELEX septal occluder (HSO) with surgical repair of atrial septal defect (ASD). BackgroundThe HSO is a low-profile, double-disk occluder device for percutaneous closure of secundum ASD. MethodsPatients were enrolled (HSO arm prospectively, surgery arm prospectively/retrospectively) from 14 U. S. sites and followed up for 12 months postprocedure. Investigator-reported outcomes were evaluated, including closure success (no or clinically insignificant residual shunt) and the incidence of adverse events. The first 3 HSO patients at each site were considered training cases and were excluded from analysis. ResultsBetween March 2001 and April 2003, 119 nontraining cases received an HSO and 128 had surgical repair. The groups were similar with statistical but clinically unimportant differences in median age, weight, and preprocedural echocardiographic defect size. Anesthesia time and hospital stay were significantly shorter in the HSO group. Closure success, defined as complete closure or a clinically insignificant residual shunt, was similar in both groups. Major and minor adverse events rates were not statistically different. The most common major adverse events for the HSO group was device embolization requiring catheter retreival (1. 7 %), and in the surgery group was <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (6. 3 %), including one death because of tamponade. The primary end point, clinical success, a composite of closure success and no major adverse events at 12 months, satisfied the noninferiority hypothesis comparing device closure with surgery. ConclusionsClosure of ASD with the HELEX septal occluder is safe and effective when compared with surgical repair, with reduced anesthesia time and hospital stay. (U. S.

40|$|The {{etiologic}} {{evaluation of}} pericardial effusion is frequently unsuccessful when noninvasive methods are used. To {{determine the cause}} of the current episode, all patients with echographically identified pericardial effusion from May 1998 to December 2002 underwent noninvasive diagnostic testing of blood, throat, and stool samples. Patients with <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> were excluded. To analyze the value of our tests, we tested randomly selected blood donors as negative controls. Among 204 included patients, 107 (52. 4 %) had a final etiologic diagnosis: the etiology of 52 was highly suspected at first examination and later confirmed (thyroid deficiency, 5 cases; systemic lupus erythematous, 7; rheumatoid arthritis, 7; scleroderma, 3; cancer, 25; and renal insufficiency, 5). A definite etiologic diagnosis was made in 11 patients from pericardial fluid analysis (cancer, 5 cases; tuberculosis, 3; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, and Actinomyces, 1 case each). Among 141 patients considered to have idiopathic pericarditis, 44 (32. 1 %) gained an etiologic diagnosis by our systematic testing strategy. This included serologic evaluation of serum (Coxiella burnetii, 10 cases; Bartonella quintana, 1; Legionella pneumophila, 1; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4; influenza virus, 1), viral culture of throat swabs (enterovirus, 8 cases; and adenovirus, 1), high-level antinuclear antibodies (> 1 / 400, 3 cases), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (15 abnormal results). Antibodies to Toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus, enterovirus recovered from rectal swabs, and low-level antinuclear antibodies were seen with equal frequency in patients and controls. Using our evaluation strategy, the number of pericardial effusions classified as idiopathic was less than in other series. Systematic testing for Q fever, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, thyroid abnormalities, and antinuclear antibodies, accompanied by viral throat cultures, frequently enabled us to diagnose diseases not initially suspected in patients with pericardial effusion...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence and time course of pericardial effusion after open heart surgery for congenital heart diseases {{and to identify}} predisposing risk factors. Design and patients: Prospective assessment of development of pericardial effusion in 336 patients (163 males) undergoing open heart surgery for congenital heart disease by serial echocardiography on days 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 postoperatively. Setting: Tertiary paediatric cardiac centre. Results: The prevalence of pericardial effusion was 23 % (77 of 336). Of the 77 patients who developed effusion, 43 (56 %) had moderate to large effusions and 18 (23 %) were symptomatic. Patients who had {{a large amount of}} effusion {{were more likely to be}} symptomatic than those with only a small to moderate amount (47. 4 % v 15. 5 %, p = 0. 01). The mean (SD) onset of pericardial effusion was 11 (7) days after surgery, with 97 % (75 of 77) of cases being diagnosed on or before day 28 after surgery. The prevalence of effusion after Fontan-type procedures (60 %, 6 of 10) was significantly higher than that after other types of cardiac surgery: repair of left to right shunts (22. 1 %, 43 of 125), repair of lesions with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (22. 6 %, 19 of 84), arterial switch operation (6. 7 %, 1 of 15), and miscellaneous procedures (25 %, 8 of 32) (p = 0. 037). Univariate analyses showed that female patients (p = 0. 009) and those receiving warfarin (p = 0. 002) had increased risk of postoperative pericardial effusion. A greater pericardial drain output in the first four hours after surgery also tended to be significant (p = 0. 056). Multivariate logistic regression similarly identified warfarin treatment (β = 1. 73, p = 0. 009) and female sex (β for male = - 0. 63, p = 0. 037) as significant determinants. Conclusions: Pericardial effusion occurs commonly after open heart surgery for congenital heart disease. Serial echocardiographic monitoring up to 28 days postoperatively is indicated in selected high risk patients such as those with symptoms of <b>postpericardiotomy</b> <b>syndrome</b> and those given warfarin. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

Late pericardial effusions after cardiac surgery are usually related to PPS and can progress to cardiac tamponade. Preventive measures can reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality related to PPS. In a previous study, diclofenac was suggested to ameliorate autoimmune diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether postoperative use of diclofenac is effective in preventing early PPS after cardiac surgery. Methods: A total of 100 patients who were administered oral diclofenac for postoperative analgesia after cardiac surgery and until hospital discharge were included in this retrospective study. As well, 100 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were not administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included as the control group. The existence and severity of pericardial effusion were determined by echocardiography. The existence and severity of pleural effusion were determined by chest X-ray. Results: PPS incidence was significantly lower in patients who received diclofenac (20 % vs 43 %) (P< 0. 001). Patients given diclofenac had a significantly lower incidence of pericardial effusion (15 % vs 30 %) (P= 0. 01). Although not statistically significant, pericardial and pleural effusion was more severe in the control group than in the diclofenac group. The mean duration of diclofenac treatment was 5. 11 ± 0. 47 days in patients with PPS and 5. 27 ± 0. 61 days in patients who did not have PPS (P= 0. 07). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that diclofenac administration (odds ratio [OR] 0. 34, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 18 – 0. 65, P= 0. 001) was independently associated with PPS occurrence. Conclusion: Postoperative administration of diclofenac may have a protective role against the development of PPS after cardiac surgery.
