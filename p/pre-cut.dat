25|$|Competitive pole {{vaulting}} {{began using}} solid ash poles. As the heights attained increased, the bamboo poles {{gave way to}} tubular aluminum, which was tapered at each end. Today's pole vaulters benefit from poles produced by wrapping <b>pre-cut</b> sheets of fiberglass that contains resin around a metal pole mandrel, to produce a slightly curved pole that bends more easily under the compression caused by an athlete's take-off. The shape of the fiberglass sheets {{and the amount of}} fiberglass used is carefully planned to provide the desired length and stiffness of pole. Different fiber types, including carbon-fiber, are used to give poles specific characteristics intended to promote higher jumps. In recent years, carbon fiber has been added to the commonly used E-glass and S-glass materials to create a lighter pole.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{pinewood}} derby is for the parent, usually the father, but sometimes the mother or grandparent, to spend time helping the child design, carve, paint, add weights, and tune the final car. However, it {{is often the case}} that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film Down and Derby, and also in a 2009 episode of South Park. The quest for a fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby car kit costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA and their particular local district. The aftermarket items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official Boy Scouts of America (BSA) kit. Complete cars can be purchased on eBay and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of Woodland Scenics, sells <b>pre-cut</b> or pre-made cars, as well as official kits. Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} shelterwood cutting on the {{abundance}} of Jordan's salamander (Plethodon Jordan!) in western North Carolina were examined during 1997 and 1998. Terrestrial salamander assemblages were sampled before, immediately after, and one year after timber harvest on control and treatment plots to estimate abundance. We also sur-veyed salamanders immediately after the harvest along transects radiating out from cut plots to determine whether cutting triggered salamander emigration from disturbed plots. Both before and after timber harvest, the site was strongly dominated by Jordan's sala-mander. No significant effects of initial shelterwood cutting on Jordan's salamander abun-dance were apparent after timber harvest. Abundance of this species decreased from <b>pre-cutting</b> to post-cutting sampling on both control and treatment plots, which likely reflected the drought that characterized both post-cutting sampling periods, but not <b>pre-cutting</b> sampling. No emigration of salamanders from the cut plots was detected after timber har-vest These findings suggest that at a stand scale, shelterwood harvests may pose less of a short-term threat to salamander populations than clearcutting, but more study is necessary to assess broad-scale tradeoffs between harvest yield and biological impacts associated with alternative timber harvest methods.

40|$|Packet {{classification}} is a {{vital and}} complicated task as the processing of packets should be done at a specified line speed. In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. Hence the matching of packets should be much faster and simpler for quick processing and classification. A hardware accelerator or a classifier has been proposed here using {{a modified version of}} the HyperCuts packet classification algorithm. A new <b>pre-cutting</b> process has been implemented to reduce the memory size to fit in an FPGA. This classifier can classify packets with high speed and with a power consumption factor of less than 3 W. This methodology removes the need for floating point division to be performed by replacing the region compaction scheme of HyperCuts by <b>pre-cutting,</b> while classifying the packets and concentrates on classifying the packets at the core of the network.

Structures had standard parts and <b>pre-cut,</b> pre-measured timbers, which were assembled on the ground, adjusted to fit on site, raised in place, and locked into place with pegs and mortise and tenon joints. Two-story floor plans for homes included a large living room, kitchen, and entrance hall, with stairs to the second floor and attic. In Indiana, Harmonists did their baking in communal ovens, so stoves could be substituted for fireplaces.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in techniques of therapeutic endoscopy for stomach neoplasms are rapidly achieved. One {{of the major}} topics in this fi eld is endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). ESD is a new endoscopic technique using cutting devices to remove the tumor by the following three steps: injecting fl uid into the submucosa to elevate the tumor from the muscle layer, <b>pre-cutting</b> the surrounding mucosa of the tumor, and dissecting the connective tissue of the submucosa beneath the tumor. So the tumors are resectable in an en bloc fashion, regardless of the size, shape, coexisting ulcer, and location. Indication for ESD is strictly confined by two aspects: the possibility of nodal metastases and technical difficulty, which depends on the operators.

40|$|Cutting-induced {{plasticity}} {{can have}} a significant effect on the measurement accuracy of the contour method. The present study examines the benefit of a double-embedded cutting configuration that relies on self-restraint of the specimen, relative to conventional edge-crack cutting configurations. A series of finite element analyses are used to simulate the planar sectioning performed during double-embedded and conventional edge-crack contour cutting configurations. The results of numerical analyses are first compared to measured results to validate the cutting simulations. The simulations are then used to compare the efficacy of different cutting configurations by predicting the deviation of the residual stress profile from an original (<b>pre-cutting)</b> reference stress field, and the extent of cutting-induced plasticity. Comparisons reveal that while the double-embedded cutting configuration produces the most accurate residual stress measurements, the highest levels of plastic flow are generated in this process. This cutting-induced plastic deformation is, however, largely confined to small ligaments formed as a consequence of the sample sectioning process, and as such it does not significantly affect the back-calculated residual stress field...|$|R
