In the course of the study, the new spot-based fast processes (dynamic <b>plate</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test,</b> sounding by means of service trench probe) were employed in addition to the established spot-based procedures (density measurement to DIN 18 125, radiometric density measurement, static <b>plate</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> to DIN 18 134, soundings to DIN 4 094). The use of wide-area dynamic test procedures using vibratory rollers and vibratory compactors was also studied. The fast test methods, particularly dynamic <b>plate</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> and wide-area dynamic density monitoring, are subject to influence not only from the ground type (grain distribution, grain quality, water content, etc.), but also from the trench geometry. Variations in the stiffness around the measuring point and the distance from trench fittings (pipes, manholes, trench irregularities) also have a bearing. Provided certain side constraints are taken into consideration, the service trench probe and dynamic <b>plate</b> <b>loading</b> equipment can be used for density monitoring, even in narrow service trenches. The dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> can also be used for testing stiffness. Good correlations were often reached between the conventional and the new test results on the ground types tested.

The results obtained from a <b>plate</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> are extrapolated to prototype foundation using different extrapolation methods with unknown accuracy levels. There is no standard way to extrapolate the <b>plate</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> results and Terzaghi and Peck method is very widely used for most engineering applications.

The behaviour of the plate is based on the properties of the top most layers while the stiffness of the layers below may affect the behaviour of the prototype foundation. In such situations, the reliability of the extrapolation techniques becomes highly questionable.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the settlement of shallow foundations is an important aspect {{in the design of}} such foundations. Most often elastic settlement estimation methods are used in the {{estimation of}} settlement of shallow foundations. In addition, plate load tests are also performed to estimate the settlement of shallow foundations.

The design of MSW landfills requires the selection of representative MSW material properties. Static and dynamic properties of emplaced MSW from landfill sites at Bangalore, India are evaluated.

The modulus decay curve is called the degradation curve, which also reviewed in this study. With the results of different measurement methods applied for a reclaimed mining site in Klettwitz for determining of stiffness parameter of subsoil, author have tried to find a unification between the results considering the relationship between stiffness parameter and the range of strain levels. The testing methods executed at plant S 9 in Klettwitz-Südfeld are: laboratory oedometer test, static <b>plate</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> dynamic <b>plate</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and seismic testing methods (spectral analysis of surface wave, SASW). Some results getting from this study are: one receives different absolute values of stiffness parameter from different testing methods. The reason is different testing methods produce different range of strain levels in soil during their execution. Conventional and non-destructive testing methods should be combined together for investigating of subsoil characteristics. This means, the soil parameters must be adjusted to the current range of strain level. Especially for settlement calculation it is recommended that different values of stiffness modulus, Es, resulted by different testing methods should be simultaneously utilized along the depth beneath loading surface. Accuracy for determining of stiffness degradation curves depends a lot on the determination of maximal stiffness parameters (E 0, G 0) at the range of very small strain level, and it still requires much further studies...|$|E

As {{a method for}} recycling large quantities of rubber from scrap tyres, this paper analyses the use of unbound granular mixtures with varying percentages of rubber particles as sub-ballast in railway lines. Bearing capacity for such mixtures is studied in laboratory and field tests using static and dynamic <b>plate</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> as well as cyclic triaxial tests. It is found that adding rubber increases permanent and resilient strain and {{that none of the}} mixtures suffer plastic creep after 2. 5 million cycles. Considering the usual bearing capacity requirements, the optimum rubber content is 2. 5 % (by weight). This percentage increases resistance to degradation while ensuring sufficient bearing capacity...|$|R
