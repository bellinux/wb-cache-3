5000|$|John Wooler {{designed}} {{his first}} motorcycle in 1909 - a two-stroke horizontal single-cylinder machine with a double-ended piston. The first production model was a 230 cc two-stroke with {{front and rear}} <b>plunger</b> <b>spring</b> suspension and a patent [...] "anti-vibratory" [...] frame. The motorbike was manufactured by Wilkinson from 1912 onwards with a 344 cc engine and marketed as the Wilkinson-Wooler. Production was halted during WWI, and a receiver was appointed for the company in 1915, but the company's munitions contracts with the Royal Air Force allowed it to survive the war years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tip of the}} {{electric}} foil terminates in a button assembly that generally consists of a barrel, <b>plunger,</b> <b>spring,</b> and retaining screws. The circuit is a [...] "normally closed" [...] one, meaning that at rest {{there is always a}} complete power circuit; depressing the tip breaks this circuit, and the scoring apparatus illuminates an appropriate light. Color-coding is used: white or yellow indicates hits not on the valid target area, and either red or green indicate hits on the valid target area (red for one fencer, green for the other).|$|E
40|$|The <b>plunger</b> <b>spring</b> in {{question}} has failed by overload. There were no evidences of progressive failure like fatigue. No metallurgical abnormalities were found {{responsible for the}} failure. With the evidences and information available, {{it was not possible}} to establish the cause(s) for overload on the spring. This needs to be identified and the corrective actions incorporated to prevent recurrence of similar failures...|$|E
5000|$|The {{frame was}} {{designed}} to accommodate the unusual engine and was welded together with a fully <b>sprung</b> <b>plunger</b> type <b>springing</b> for the rear wheel, unlike the cantilever swingarm suspension on the Brough Superior SS100. The forks were Brough Superior's [...] "Castle" [...] forks derived from a Harley-Davidson design, and many components such as the petrol tank, saddle and wheels {{were the same as}} standard Brough Superior machines.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} reasons for its failure. Foremost was the Reising's complex design of many small pins, <b>plungers,</b> <b>springs</b> and levers. Dis{{assembly}} and assembly was difficult even under normal conditions. Simple maintenance was problematic as there was no bolt hold-open device. Chambering a cartridge was awkward as the action bar was hard to grasp in the forearm and could be obstructed by the sling. Worse, the safety/selector switch couldn't be sensed by feel at night if {{it was in the}} safe, semi, or automatic position.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Solenoid {{operated}} electromagnetic {{control valve}} (ECV) playing {{an important role}} for car’s air conditioning control system. ECV is used in external variable displacement swash plate type compressor and controls the entire air conditioning system {{by means of a}} pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal supplying from an external source (controller). Complete form of ECV contains number of internal features like valve body, core, valve guide, plunger, guide pin, <b>plunger</b> <b>spring,</b> bellows etc. While designing the ECV; dimensions of different internal items must meet the standard requirements as it is quite challenging. In this research paper, especially the dimensioning of ECV body and its three pressure ports through which the air/refrigerant passes are considered. Here internal leakage test analysis of ECV body is being carried out from its discharge port (Pd) to crankcase port (Pc) when the guide valve is placed inside it. The experiments have made both in ordinary and digital system using different assumptions and thereafter compare the results. Keywords—Electromagnetic control valve (ECV), Leakage...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, novel dry-contact sensors for {{measuring}} electro-encephalography (EEG) signals without any skin preparation are designed, fabricated by an injection molding manufacturing process and experimentally validated. Conventional wet electrodes {{are commonly used}} to measure EEG signals; they provide excellent EEG signals subject to proper skin preparation and conductive gel application. However, a series of skin preparation procedures for applying the wet electrodes is always required and usually creates trouble for users. To overcome these drawbacks, novel dry-contact EEG sensors were proposed for potential operation in {{the presence or absence}} of hair and without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage. The dry EEG sensors were designed to contact the scalp surface with 17 spring contact probes. Each probe was designed to include a probe head, <b>plunger,</b> <b>spring,</b> and barrel. The 17 probes were inserted into a flexible substrate using a one-time forming process via an established injection molding procedure. With these 17 spring contact probes, the flexible substrate allows for high geometric conformity between the sensor and the irregular scalp surface to maintain low skin-sensor interface impedance. Additionally, the flexible substrate also initiates a sensor buffer effect, eliminating pain when force is applied. The proposed dry EEG sensor was reliable in measuring EEG signals without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage, as compared with the conventional wet electrodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop a specific modelling approach capable of reducing the size of the fuel injector solenoid device while improving its response time and attraction force. Several developed modelling and simulation procedures have focused on various aspects of solenoid component modifications in order to develop an evolution process of miniaturising a fuel injector solenoid, using the latest finite element method (FEM) tool software. The specific factors that influenced the optimum operation of the fuel injector solenoid were the geometrical shape of individual solenoid components, material properties, air-gap constraints, boundary conditions, current source conditions, mass constants, and damping coefficients of the plunger. The attraction force distribution in the main air-gap was directly influenced by the taper angle of the 2 D and 3 D plunger pole faces, plunger length and the permanent magnetism. The precise definition of the electro-mechanical motion of plunger was of enormous importance in reducing the fuel injector solenoid response time, closely related to stroke and mass of the <b>plunger,</b> <b>spring</b> characteristics, motion and rebound of the plunger. Using the developed approach, the initial size of the fuel injector has been reduced by 35 %, the attraction force increased by 26 % and the response time reduced by 76 %. However, by frequently repeating the design trials and conducting a thorough experimental investigation, the final minimum response time was achieved by the virtual rebound delay model. The reduction in response time from the &# 039;optimal&# 039; experimental to virtual model was by 35 %. The simplicity and effectiveness of the developed methods, allowed for quick and accurate evaluation...|$|E

50|$|Neither AJS or Matchless {{opted for}} <b>plunger</b> type rear <b>springing,</b> and the Model 16 {{retained}} a rigid rear frame until 1949, when pivoted rear suspension controlled by hydraulically dampened spring units designed and made by Matchless became available. The difference was {{indicated by the}} S (for springer) designation.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{a new type of}} {{cylindrical}} DC solenoid is presented in this paper. The solenoid comprises two parts, a stator and a moving plunger. The <b>plunger</b> compresses a <b>spring</b> with a minimum force of 7. 1 N over an 8 mm travel. ANSYS was employed for the design and optimization, incorporating the nonlinear characteristic of the magnetic material. This paper gives an overview of the modelling and optimization procedure involved in the analysis...|$|R

A solenoid is an important element part which hydrau-lically controls a transmission system, etc. The demanded feature of the solenoid is that it performs an electromagnetic force output being constant regardless of the stroke and being proportional to coil current. The <b>plunger</b> compresses a <b>spring</b> with a minimum force of 12 N over an 1. 7 mm travel. The orthogonal array, analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques and response surface optimization, are employed to determine the main effects and their optimal desig...|$|R
50|$|It was {{normally}} {{carried with}} a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier {{was engaged in}} combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike bayonet, reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a <b>spring</b> <b>plunger</b> was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset {{to the right side}} of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upwards.|$|R
50|$|A plastic cord lock (also {{known as}} cord fastener, plastic stopper or cord toggle) {{attaches}} to drawstrings and tightens {{without the use}} of knots. Cord locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (<b>plunger),</b> and a <b>spring.</b> Squeezed together, tension is released and the cord lock can move freely up and down the cords. Released, the tension is engaged and the cord lock stays in place. They come in many sizes and shapes to suit to any purpose, including plastic cord lock, mini size cord lock, no spring cord lock, with spring cord lock, with rim cord lock.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload spring assembly adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A <b>plunger</b> return <b>spring</b> biases the <b>plunger</b> rod against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the spring assembly. Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, detents and spring assembly are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|R
50|$|The {{music for}} the machine {{consists}} of stage adaptations from the original Rock opera Tommy, composed by Pete Townshend of The Who. There are 21 songs total programmed to play throughout gameplay and for various stages and modes. Songs include Captain Walker, It's a Boy, Christmas, See Me Feel Me,Smash the Mirror, Fiddle About, Cousin Kevin, Sensation, Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard, and Sally Simpson. To launch each ball, the player can use either an automatic launch by pressing a flipper button while a ball is in the alley, or manually via the <b>spring</b> <b>plunger</b> assembly. The machine includes an automated silver disc that rotates to cover the flipper portion of the machine to emulate playing pinball as the title character. This mode occurs during each multiball sequence, or for the entire duration of the game by player selection of the Tommy game mode. The owner/operator may program a feature that allows the player to exchange credits for extra ball(s) to continue the game where it left off.|$|R
40|$|To {{downsize}} {{the clamp}} area {{and increase the}} output power of the harvester, we developed a miniature piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with combining a Z-shaped folded spring and a mechanically-switching SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor). The overall harvester size is 4 i× 2 i× 3 cm 3. The FEM analysis revealed that the output power increases {{and the value of}} the 1 st and 2 nd resonance frequencies move closer as the angle of the Z-shaped spring decreases, therefore, the smaller angle would be more promising. The experimental results showed that the maximum output power of our harvester for the 1 st (20. 2 Hz) and 2 nd (53. 0 Hz) resonance frequencies at the applied acceleration of 4. 9 m/s 2 are 088 and 0. 98 mW, respectively. The reason for a marked enhancement of the output power for the 2 nd resonance frequency is attributed to the vertical movement of the 2 nd vibrational mode which applies larger mechanical stress to the piezo ceramic and achieves better electrical contact between the tip of the Z-shaped spring and the <b>spring</b> <b>plunger.</b> © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Novel spring {{contactors}} {{were designed}} and characterized for wafer-level interposer and high-speed package test system applications, especially for wafer-level packages. These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the <b>plunger</b> and the <b>spring.</b> The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular spring pins...|$|R
5000|$|... is {{performed}} by applying external {{pressure on the}} sclera, for example with a <b>spring</b> <b>plunger,</b> while observing the retinal vessels through an ophthalmoscope. The pressure is gradually increased until the central retinal vein begins to pulsate, which happens at the point when the applied external pressure nears the VOP and is approximately equal to ICP. The original method was described in 1925 by Baurmann [...] and belongs to the public domain, but several modifications have been recently patented that combine the classic ophthalmodynamometry with reflectance oximetry of the retina [...] or ultrasound measurement of blood flow in the central retinal artery, or automate the method by adding a camera and an image processing software capable of recognizing venous pulsations from a sequence of images of the eye fundus. Evaluation in patients confirmed a strong linear relationship and clinically negligible differences (2-3mmHg) between VOP and the invasively measured ICP. Ophthalmodynamometry requires dilated pupils, a skilled physician or medic and collaboration of the patient, which all hampers its applicability in the field. It cannot be applied in cases of ocular trauma or conditions that selectively affect the optic nerve, and gives erroneously high readings {{in the presence of}} a papilledema, which may persist long after ICP has returned to normal.|$|R
40|$|There was an {{accident}} to a fighter aircraft. Investigation revealed that the accident was caused due to loss {{of power in the}} engine as a result of failure in the main fuel pump (MFP). The MFP was multi-plunger type. On dis-assembly, the MFP was found severely damaged and there were fractures in one <b>plunger</b> and four <b>springs.</b> Through systematic metallurgical investigation and analysis, the sequence of events leading to the failure in the MFP was established. The primary failure in the MFP was the fatigue fracture of springs. The fatigue crack initiation could be attributed to pitting corrosion {{on the surface of the}} springs. Because of multiple fractures in one of the springs, there was impact load on the corresponding plunger, which resulted in generation of an overload crack. This crack had further propagated progressively by fatigue mechanism culminating in fracture and loss of material from the side wall of the plunger. Subsequently, there was fuel leakage internally in the MFP with the resultant reduction in the fuel delivery pressure. Due to insufficient fuel supply, there was winding down of the engine RPM leading to loss of thrust. After establishing the sequence of failure in the MFP, investigation was carried out to identify the cause for the corrosion on the surface of the springs. It was established that the raw material (wires) used for the manufacture of the springs had developed corrosion pits on the surface due to improper storage...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical {{engineering}} is {{the application of}} engineering principles and techniques to the medical field. It combines the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical and biological sciences to improve healthcare diagnosis and treatment. As the result of improvements in robotics and micro technology science in the 20 th century, micro electromechanical system technology has joined with medical applications which results in micro robotic medical applications. Drug delivery {{is one of the}} most important and controversial topics which scientists and engineers have tried to improve in medical applications. For diseases like cancer, localized drug delivery is a highlight target involving bombarding a small area of a human’s body and this technology has not been completely achieved yet. The ultimate objective of this thesis is the development of wireless capsule robot controlled by a magnetic drive unit. A magnetic drive unit is a system that consists of electromagnets, which produce the magnetic field from outside of the patient’s body. The capsule robot, which is the slave robot in the system, moves inside a human’s gastrointestinal tract. This project is focused mainly on a human esophagus and all the experiments are done in a prototype of the human’s esophagus. Drug delivery for diseases like cancer is the objective of the capsule robot. The proposed design consists of a slave permanent magnet for the motion of capsule robot in a tube, a reservoir of drug, and a micro mechanical mechanism for drug release. The capsule robot is fabricated and developed in a 12 mm length and 5 mm diameter with the weight of 1. 78 grams without the built-in permanent magnet. The drug delivery system is a semi-magnetized system, which can be controlled by an external magnetic field. It consists of a mechanical <b>plunger</b> and <b>spring,</b> which can be open and close through an external magnetic field manipulation. The amount of drug for a desired location can be controlled by manipulating the external magnetic field. To achieve this target, analytical modeling is conducted. A numerical simulation and an experimental setup demonstrate that a capsule robot in a human esophagus in a simple and multi channel system. Horizontal control is set for the capsule robot, using a custom-designed controller and a colored liquid is released with the external magnetic field. The present study with its fabricated prototype is a research is this area to prove the concept of wireless control of a robot inside a human body and the potential for a drug delivery system. It is expected that the results achieved in this project will help realize and promote capsule robot for medical treatments...|$|R
