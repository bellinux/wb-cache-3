5|$|Simultaneously, <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>polls</b> {{during the}} second week of May showed that 50 percent of the American public {{approved}} of President Nixon's actions. Fifty-eight percent blamed the students for what had occurred at Kent State. On both sides, emotions ran high. In one instance, in New York City on 8 May, pro-administration construction workers rioted and attacked demonstrating students. Such violence, however, was an aberration. Most demonstrations, both pro- and anti-war, were peaceful. On 20 May 100,000 construction workers, tradesmen, and office workers marched peacefully through New York City in support of the president's policies.|$|E
5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>polls</b> by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the provincial {{election}} was called in September 2011, support for Dunderdale, her government and the Progressive Conservatives had fallen in <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>polls.</b> However, her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier. On October 11, 2011, Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote, which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign. After an initial bounce in the polls following the election, support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014. Throughout 2012, Dunderdale saw her personal numbers take a big hit, while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline. In November 2012, 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, down from 59 per cent a year earlier. Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support had fallen 14 points over the year to 46 per cent. While government satisfaction had fallen it remained high, with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied. An Angus Reid poll released in December 2012, also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year. Just 37 per cent of those polled approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier, while 55 per cent disapproved.|$|E
