5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt. The symbiote is submerged and infected with the sentient virus (which heals Brock), bonding with the pair and introducing a third mind into their relationship. The virus drives Brock insane (causing him to murder a cleaning lady), and he is physically transported {{to the realm of}} insanity to confront its avatars: Paranoia, Dusk and the Necromancer. The symbiote overcomes the virus; Brock regains his senses, and Venom is returned to earth. Beck later insists on only being Brock's friend, because his romantic feelings for her make him more violent. Among DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1993 Venom: The Madness #1 was number 173; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the 1925 cruise, the ship was modernized at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She had her twelve old coal-fired boilers replaced with four oil-fired models, which were trunked into a single larger funnel. She also had more deck armor added to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> plunging fire, and a short tripod mast was installed {{in place of the}} aft cage mast. The modernization was completed in November 1926, after which Arkansas conducted a shakedown cruise in the Atlantic. She returned to Philadelphia, where she ran acceptance trials before she could rejoin the fleet.

5|$|Sarah’s {{personal}} income was now considerable, {{and she used}} the money to invest in land; she believed this would <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> currency devaluation. The dowager duchess purchased Wimbledon manor in 1723, and rebuilt the manor house. Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, for which she would pay a massive dowry of £100,000. However, Robert Walpole, the First Lord of the Treasury (effectively the same as today's Prime Minister) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, {{good relations with the}} royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by Queen Caroline, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the village of}} Etene, {{focusing}} on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sister is transported to the past to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body {{in a desperate attempt to}} try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner.|$|E
5|$|Sycorax {{has been}} conceptualised {{in a variety}} ways by {{adapters}} and directors of The Tempest. In John Dryden and William Davenant's version of The Tempest (1670), Sycorax is survived by two children, Caliban and a daughter also named Sycorax. This second Sycorax makes sexual advances toward Trinculo, the drunken sailor, and (according to Trinculo) also has incestuous relations with her brother Caliban. Die Geisterinsel, a 1778 version of the play in German, includes a living Sycorax, a witch who has full power during the night, while Prospero rules the day. In this play, {{she is the one}} who causes the tempest and shipwreck, not Prospero; Prospero is extremely wary of her actions as each night approaches, as she has power over those who sleep. Several times he struggles to keep Miranda awake to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> Sycorax's power. In Eugène Scribe's French 1846 version, Sycorax is alive but imprisoned behind some rocks out of sight. She spends most of the play trying to convince her son, Caliban, to free her. Peter Brook's 1968 British version of the play portrayed Sycorax as an ugly witch, including her in a birth scene in which the equally ugly Caliban is born.|$|E
5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two {{fall in love and}} agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both {{a father and a}} husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Thompson gains {{employment}} {{as a high}} school gym coach, while as Venom he comes into conflict with the U-Foes, who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology. When the U-Foes knock Venom, the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space. Kiernan and Thompson's lover Valkyrie later return home, leaving Venom alone. Brock returns as Toxin in Venom #30, to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U-Foes experiments: an alien-lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal. Thompson and Brock's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies: Venom and Toxin. Together, Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens, and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson, promising that the Venom symbiote will inevitably take over Thompson, and that he will return to kill him when that happens. Venom #39 sees the return of Jack, and the introduction of the new symbiote character Mania—Thompson's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom symbiote when Thompson uses it to <b>protect</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> Jack. Jack kills Mania's father, and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack's technology into believing he is the real Jack. According to Bunn, when he envisioned a new symbiote character Andi was not intended to be the host, but as the series progressed his plans changed. It is revealed that Mania's symbiote is the cloned symbiote from Way's 2003 Venom series. The symbiote expelled the clone, and the demonic brand along with it, passing it to Mania. When a team led by Crossbones starts killing the brand bearers and taking the brands for themselves, Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto. Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the symbiote, not Thompson. The series ends with Thompson admitting that despite his issues with his father, he had {{always wanted to be a}} dad, and that he will now take responsibility for Mania.|$|E
