50|$|Controversy arose around Elop {{receiving}} a €18.8 million bonus after Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft {{and he stepped}} down as the CEO. The controversy was further fueled after {{it was revealed that}} his contract had been revised on the same day as the deal was announced. Moreover, the chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors gave initially incorrect information about the contract to the public, and had to correct his statements later. Shortly before his departure from Nokia, Elop had filed for divorce, which he also cited as a reason to reject a renegotiation of the controversial bonus. He claimed he couldn't afford a reduction of the payoff because his wife would demand half of it. Elop also enjoyed a <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>status</b> in Finland, a 35% fixed-rate income tax irrespective of the size of income, while typical tax payers in Finland pay a progressive income tax. Approximately 70% of the bonus costs were absorbed by Microsoft during the acquisition, the majority of which {{came in the form of}} accelerated stock awards.|$|E

40|$|Non-profit {{organizations}} are increasingly gaining {{importance in the}} modern economy with their development and their numbers increasing day by day. It {{is very important to}} note that non-profit {{organizations are}} often subject to various benefits that the for-profit companies are not. Thus, for example, <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>status</b> of non-profit organizations is manifested primarily in the form of exemption from corporate income tax. In addition, private non-profit organizations enjoy various other state, local and federal taxes exemptions. Under certain conditions, these organizations are exempt from taxes on donations and membership fees. A feature that differentiates various non-profit organizations and profit-oriented companies is their source of income. Profit oriented companies depend on their income, obtained from sales of their goods or services to customers, who usually cover the price and cost of goods and services plus the profit. In contrast, nonprofit organizations are very dependent on membership fees, tax exemptions, members donations or depend on funds of the sponsoring agency which covers most of their costs, for example a federal government agency. Those non-profit organizations that have substantial operating costs beyond national borders and do not identify themselves as purely domestic in their mandate are International non-profit organizations. Most non-profit organizations remain in their national boundaries, on the territory of the country in which they were created, but a large number of non-profit organizations rapidly internationalize, and some larger non-profits have grown into important global actors. The paper includes the following sections: (1) introduction, (2) why is the 'non-profit' important, (3) the internationalization of non-profit organizations, (4) sources of income of non-profit organizations (4. 1.) causality of impact and of strategic decisions in cases pertaining to universities, (5) the limits of strategic management impact on non-profit organizations (6) management trends in non-profit organizations, and (7) conclusion...|$|E

Because firm dissolution incurs transaction costs, a <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of transferred family businesses {{seems to be}} desirable from a macroeconomic viewpoint. The support of dynastic succession, however, entails also a cost on the economy if firm continuation by less able heirs prevents entry into entrepreneurship. Here, we investigate analytically and quantitatively the trade-off between transaction costs saved and creative destruction prevented. We find that a unique general equilibrium exists at which, depending on the institutional setup, low-ability heirs either abandon (Type 1) or continue (Type 2) a family business. A calibration of the model with German data suggests that <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of family firms has severe negative consequences on macroeconomic performance if it causes a threshold crossing from Type 1 to Type 2 equilibrium.

We analyze the effects of differential taxation on managerial effort and risk taking in a moral-hazard model of the LEN type. The agent selects a portfolio of a high-risk and a low-risk project and chooses his effort level simultaneously. The principal anticipates the agent's choice and offers an incentive contract. A <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> base for the high-risk project induces a higher managerial effort and a higher optimal fraction of the high-risk project.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} in existing literature that firms manipulate earnings before IPOs (initial public offerings) and SEOs (seasoned equity offerings). This study contributes to prior research by being the first to examine whether fiscal support from local governments has impact on the earnings management behavior of Chinese listed firms. Using data from firms that conduct IPOs and SEOs from 1997 to 2006, I find that firms {{are less likely to}} manipulate earnings prior to the offerings if they enjoy more income tax savings attributed to the <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> favor or more financial subsidy from the local governments. The findings of the study have important policy implications. Noticeably, the new Enterprise Income Tax Law effective from 1 January, 2008 abrogates the original tax system that allows various <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> rates for firms of different properties and stipulates a 25 % enterprise income tax rate for all firms in China. Given the abolishment of the <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> favor, local governments lose a potent avenue of lending fiscal support to the listed firms. To this end, based on the findings in this study, I expect that the opportunistic earnings management by listed firms will probably be aggravated after the new income tax law is duly enforced...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, borders between {{countries}} have been opened gradually thanks to globalization, which is reflected in minimal barriers to the movement of persons and capital. This situation could be potentially abused by taxpayers willing to shift the capital to <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> jurisdictions. Due to facts aforementioned, several instruments for tax administrators have been introduced. Bilateral and multilateral instruments are concluded with particular countries {{for the purpose of}} obtaining information about foreign residents staying abroad but also to avoid double taxation or double non‑taxation.
