5|$|Kratos is {{a warrior}} who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal {{that he was}} once a {{successful}} captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged {{in the depths of}} Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.|$|E
25|$|When the Milwaukee Road {{purchased}} new Budd Company {{stainless steel}} bilevel cars in 1961, the Rock Island elected {{to add to}} a subsequent order and took delivery of its first bilevel equipment in 1964. Power for these new cars was provided by orphaned passenger units: three EMD F7s, an EMD E6, and the two EMD AB6s. The power was rebuilt with head end power to provide heat, air conditioning, and lighting for the new cars. In 1970, another order, this time for Pullman-built bilevel cars arrived to further supplement the fleet. To <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> for these cars, several former Union Pacific EMD E8 and EMD E9 diesels were rebuilt with head end power and added to the commuter pool.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the U.S. needed greater {{aluminum}} {{supplies to}} build airplanes. Aluminum plants required {{huge amounts of}} electricity. To <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> TVA engaged {{in one of the}} largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the U.S. By early in 1942, when the effort reached its peak, 12 hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time, and design and construction employment reached a total of 28,000. The largest project of this period was the Fontana Dam. After negotiations led by Vice-President Harry Truman ("I want aluminum. I don't care if I get it from Alcoa or Al Capone."), TVA purchased the land from Nantahala Power and Light, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and built Fontana Dam.|$|E

25|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} offer significant operating {{advantages over}} steam locomotives. They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives {{continue to have}} 2-man crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being much quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked in multiple with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives throughout a single train—something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered {{for use as a}} single unit on light duties but marshaled together to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> needed on a heavy train still under the control of a single crew. With steam traction a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to double heading with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.|$|E
25|$|More {{powerful}} {{gamma rays}} from very distant quasars and closer active galaxies {{are thought to}} have a gamma ray production source similar to a particle accelerator. High energy electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, or bremsstrahlung, are the likely source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that as a supermassive black hole at the center of such galaxies <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting charged particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles. When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the most commonly visible high intensity sources outside our galaxy. They shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about 1040 watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including radio waves.|$|E
500|$|Because Queen Mary 2s {{propulsion}} machinery is electrically decoupled from her propellers, her propulsion arrangement may arguably be more accurately described as [...] "CODLAG electric" [...] (by analogy with turbo-electric and diesel-electric); however [...] "integrated electric propulsion" [...] {{is the term}} of art. The diesel {{engines and gas turbines}} drive electric generators, which <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to drive four [...] Alstom electrical motors located inside the podded propulsors (and thus entirely outside the vessel's hull). Unusually, Queen Mary 2s gas turbines are not housed along with her diesels in the engine room deep in her hull, but instead are in a soundproofed enclosure directly beneath the funnel. This arrangement allowed the vessel's designers to supply the oxygen-hungry turbines with air intakes without having to run air ducts the height of the ship, which would have wasted valuable interior space.|$|E

500|$|The main {{construction}} site was located at a substantial temporary staging pier erected in the River Thames {{a short distance}} south of the Hungerford Bridge. It was described {{at the time as}} [...] "a small village of workshops and offices and an electrical generating station to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> for driving the machinery and for lighting purposes during construction." [...] The [...] wide stage was located [...] from the Hungerford Bridge's first pier, [...] from the north bank of the Thames. It was originally intended that the work should begin close to the south bank, with a bridge connecting the stage to College Street– a now-vanished road {{on the site of the}} present-day Jubilee Gardens. However, test borings showed that there was a deep depression in the gravel beneath the Thames, which it was speculated was the result of dredging carried out for the abortive Charing Cross & Waterloo Railway project. This led to the work site being relocated to the north side of the river.|$|E

2500|$|Bell {{commenced}} {{development of}} the UH-1C in 1960 in order to correct aerodynamic deficiencies of the armed UH-1B. Bell fitted the UH-1C with a 1,100shp (820kW) T53-L-11 engine to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> needed to lift all weapons systems in use or under development. The Army would eventually refit all UH-1B aircraft with the same engine. A new rotor system was developed for the UH-1C to allow higher air speeds and {{reduce the incidence of}} retreating blade stall during diving engagements. [...] The improved rotor resulted in better maneuverability and a slight speed increase. [...] The increased power and a larger diameter rotor required Bell's engineers to design a new tail boom for the UH-1C. The longer tail boom incorporated a wider chord vertical fin on the tail rotor pylon and larger synchronized elevators.|$|E
2500|$|Bradford had [...] ample {{supplies}} of locally mined coal to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{that the industry}} needed. Local sandstone was an excellent resource for building the mills, and {{with a population of}} 182,000 by 1850, the town grew rapidly as workers were attracted by jobs in the textile mills. A desperate shortage of water in Bradford Dale [...] was a serious limitation on industrial expansion and improvement in urban sanitary conditions. In 1854 Bradford [...] Corporation bought the Bradford Water Company and embarked on a huge engineering programme to bring {{supplies of}} soft water from Airedale and Wharfedale. By 1882 water supply had radically improved. Meanwhile, urban expansion took place along the routes out of the city towards the Hortons and Bowling and the townships had become part of a continuous urban area by the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Solar {{cells have}} a great {{potential}} to help rural electrification. [...] An estimated two million villages near the equator have limited access to electricity and fossil fuels and that approximately 25% {{of people in the}} world {{do not have access to}} electricity. [...] When the cost of extending power grids, running rural electricity and using diesel generators is compared with the cost of solar cells, many times the solar cells win. [...] If the efficiency and cost of the current solar cell technology is decreased even further, then many rural communities and villages around the world could obtain electricity when current methods are out of the question. [...] Specific applications for rural communities would be water pumping systems, residential electric supply and street lights. [...] A particularly interesting application would be for health systems in countries where motorized vehicles are not overly abundant. [...] Solar cells could be used to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to refrigerate medications in coolers during transport.|$|E

2500|$|The Vision is {{described}} as being [...] "every inch a human being—except that all of his bodily organs are constructed of synthetic materials." [...] The Solar Jewel on the Vision's forehead absorbs ambient solar energy to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> needed for him to function, and he is also capable of discharging this energy as optic beams; with this, he can fire beams of infrared and microwave radiation. In extreme cases he can discharge this same power through the Solar Jewel itself which amplifies its destructive effects considerably, albeit {{at the cost of}} losing most of his resources. By interfacing with an unknown dimension to which he can shunt and from which he can accrue mass, thus becoming either intangible or extraordinarily massive, the Vision can change his density, which at its lowest allows flight and a ghostly, phasing intangibility, and at its heaviest, a density ten times greater than that of depleted uranium, which gives him superhuman strength, immovability, and a diamond-hard near invulnerability. On one occasion, the Vision uses this extreme density to render unconscious the villain Count Nefaria; at other times, he thrusts an intangible hand into them and then partially re-materializes it, a process he describes as [...] "physical disruption." [...] This effect typically causes great pain and results in incapacitation, as when used against the Earth-712 version of the hero Hyperion. Being an artificial life-form/android of sorts, the Vision has superhuman senses, superhuman stamina, reflexes, speed, agility, strength (even without being at high density), superhuman analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The Vision was trained in hand-to-hand combat by Captain America, is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers, and is a highly skilled tactician and strategist. The Vision is an expert on his own construction and repair.|$|E
