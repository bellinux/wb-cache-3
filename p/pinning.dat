5|$|Marshal Augereau's arrival from Brest {{with the}} newly formed VII Corps gave the French one more piece of good news. In the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November, Franjo Jelačić's {{division}} was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derrières, a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a <b>pinning</b> force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear. As the enemy became more embroiled with the <b>pinning</b> force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm Campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the <b>pinning</b> force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either <b>pinning</b> or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by <b>pinning</b> Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by <b>pinning</b> Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by <b>pinning</b> Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E

In a King of the Mountain match, {{the objective is to}} climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify.

Waltman was later pinned by Brown following his signature Alpha Bomb, forcing Waltman to go to the penalty box. Raven was the next to qualify by <b>pinning</b> Styles on the outside of the ring following a Pounce by Brown. Styles was then forced to spend two minutes in the box.

40|$|The {{formation}} of leaf vein patterns has fascinated biologists for centuries. Transport {{of the plant}} signal auxin has long been implicated in vein patterning, but molecular details have remained unclear. Varied evidence suggests a central role for the plasma-membrane (PM) -localized PIN-FORMED 1 (<b>PIN</b> 1) intercellular auxin transporter of Arabidopsis thaliana in auxin-transport-dependent vein patterning. However, {{in contrast to the}} severe vein-pattern defects induced by auxin transport inhibitors, <b>pin</b> 1 mutant leaves have only mild vein-pattern defects. These defects have been interpreted as evidence of redundancy between <b>PIN</b> 1 and the other four PM-localized <b>PIN</b> proteins in vein patterning, redundancy that underlies many developmental processes. By contrast, we show here that vein patterning in the Arabidopsis leaf is controlled by two distinct and convergent auxin-transport pathways: intercellular auxin transport mediated by PM-localized <b>PIN</b> 1 and intracellular auxin transport mediated by the evolutionarily older, endoplasmic-reticulum-localized <b>PIN</b> 6, <b>PIN</b> 8, and <b>PIN</b> 5. <b>PIN</b> 6 and <b>PIN</b> 8 are expressed, as <b>PIN</b> 1 and <b>PIN</b> 5, at sites of vein formation. <b>pin</b> 6 synthetically enhances <b>pin</b> 1 vein-pattern defects, and <b>pin</b> 8 quantitatively enhances <b>pin</b> 1 <b>pin</b> 6 vein-pattern defects. Function of <b>PIN</b> 6 is necessary, redundantly with that of <b>PIN</b> 8, and sufficient to control auxin response levels, <b>PIN</b> 1 expression, and vein network formation; and the vein pattern defects induced by ectopic <b>PIN</b> 6 expression are mimicked by ectopic <b>PIN</b> 8 expression. Finally, vein patterning functions of <b>PIN</b> 6 and <b>PIN</b> 8 are antagonized by <b>PIN</b> 5 function. Our data define a new level of control of vein patterning, one wit...|$|R
