40|$|Data on {{self-reported}} {{frequency of}} exercising or <b>playing</b> <b>sport</b> of adults aged 15 and above in 27 EU countries were collected, from the European Commission's Special Eurobarometer. A graphical output was obtained using classical a statistical methodology known as metric Multidimensional Scaling method to better define the interrelationships between a large set of variables {{for the data}} from the 27 European countries and "average" country included in the study. People in Sweden, Denmark and Finland had the highest level of exercise and <b>playing</b> <b>sport</b> level. High level of exercise and <b>play</b> <b>sport</b> level were detected in Slovenia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and France while low level of exercise and <b>play</b> <b>sport</b> level were found in Romania, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Portugal. The lowest level of exercise and <b>play</b> <b>sport</b> was observed in Bulgaria and Greece. The groups of countries that result from this classification also are characterized by the extent of the difference between the lowest levels of activity (never practising) and the highest (regularly practising); Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia, have the highest proportion of people who seldom practising. In 4 countries, Ireland, Malta, Republic of Cyprus and Portugal, the proportion of citizens who practice exercise or <b>play</b> <b>sport</b> regularly or never (extreme behaviour) is high. This study shows what a high level and regularly of exercise and <b>playing</b> <b>sport</b> are associated with adults participating in education and training, satisfaction with household financial situation and kind of work activity...|$|R

The queen sought to combine her daughters' entertainments with educational benefits.

His father {{immigrated to the}} United States and became a successful businessman, but lost his wealth during the Great Depression. His young wife left him at this time. His father abandoned their family when he was 5 years old, and at age of 16, a benign tumor in his spinal column briefly paralyzed him from the waist down, curtailing his ability to <b>play</b> <b>sports.</b> His grades plummeted at Cathedral High School, and the next year, he was expelled from the Roman Catholic institution after getting into a fight after a football game.

25|$|While the JIFF policy {{worked on}} one level—the {{number of foreign}} players {{recruited}} into the Top 14 went from 61 for 2011–12 to 34 for 2014–15—clubs quickly found a way around the rules. Many clubs dispatched scouts to identify top teenage prospects in other countries, and then enrolled them in their academies to start the JIFF qualification process. For example, the 59 players in the 2015–16 Clermont youth squad included 17 from nine countries outside of France. A more fundamental problem was identified in 2015 by Laurent Labit, at the time backs coach of the club now known as Racing 92. In an interview with British rugby journalist Gavin Mortimer, Labit pointed out that France has no organized team sport in its educational system at the primary level—children must join an outside club in order to <b>play</b> <b>sports.</b> Only at age 15 do youths {{have the opportunity to}} attend special sporting schools, but places in such institutions are limited. In turn, this means that young French players are technically well behind their counterparts in many other countries, most notably those of the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{was born}} in Queens, New York. His family moved to Little Italy, Manhattan, before he started school. His father, Charles Scorsese, and mother, Catherine Scorsese (born Cappa), both worked in New York's Garment District. His father was a clothes presser and an actor, {{and his mother was}} a {{seamstress}} and an actress. His father's parents emigrated from Polizzi Generosa, in the province of Palermo, Sicily, and his maternal grandparents were also from Palermo, precisely from Ciminna. Scorsese was raised in a devoutly Catholic environment. As a boy, he had asthma and could not <b>play</b> <b>sports</b> or do any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, Scorsese frequently rented Powell and Pressburger's The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. Scorsese was one of only two people who regularly rented that reel. The other was future Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero.|$|E

500|$|Nixon's {{early life}} {{was marked by}} hardship, and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to {{describe}} his boyhood: [...] "We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it". The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and {{the family moved to}} Whittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station. Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness. At the age of twelve, a spot was found on Richard's lung, and, with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to <b>play</b> <b>sports.</b> Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|Rivera {{attended}} Escuela Victoriano Chacón {{for elementary}} school and La Escuela Secundaria Pedro Pablo Sanchez for his secondary education, but he dropped out in ninth grade. At age 16, he began working six-day weeks on a commercial boat captained by his father, catching sardines. The job was [...] "extremely hard" [...] for Rivera, who {{was more interested in}} becoming a mechanic. He decided to give up fishing as a career after abandoning a capsizing [...] commercial boat as a 19-year-old, and after his uncle died from injuries suffered on a fishing boat. Rivera continued to <b>play</b> <b>sports</b> during his teenage years but eventually quit soccer after a series of ankle and knee injuries around age 17. Consequently, he shifted his attention to baseball but considered it just a hobby rather than a possible profession.|$|E
500|$|As of 2012, Halden had 340 staff members, {{including}} teachers, healthcare workers, personal trainers, and guards. The {{philosophy of}} [...] "dynamic security", which encourages {{the staff and}} the inmates to develop interpersonal relationships, helps prevent potential aggression and guarantees safety. Guards eat meals and <b>play</b> <b>sports</b> with the inmates, and are typically unarmed because guns can produce intimidation and social distance. The interaction between prisoners and the staff is designed [...] "to {{create a sense of}} family," [...] according to architect Per Hojgaard Nielsen, and because the staff can be role models to help the inmates to recreate their sense of daily routine outside of prison walls. Half the guards are women, as Høidal thinks it minimizes aggression. The guard stations were also designed to be tiny and cramped, to encourage officers to interact more with the inmates.|$|E
