40|$|A {{study on}} miocenic ostracods from the {{vestibular}} part of Tejo basin, emphazing systematics, biostratigraphy, <b>paleocology,</b> paleogeography {{as well as}} their relationships with the mediterranean and W European atlantic coasts faunas, is hereby presented. After inventorying one hundred species have been put forward for consideration. Six non formal biozones likely to establish mutual relations in the interior of the basin, between the latter and other portuguese terrains, as well as with those of the regions where stratotypes of miocenic stages have been fixed, are describe. The existence of ostracods reveal new stratigraphic precisions and correlation as regards the terrains studied. A new method of palaecological analysis in the portuguese miocenic has been introduced. It consist in assembling the forms according to common environmental domains, counting the individual within eachg domain and determining the respectivepropotions having in mind the total number of the individuals in the sample; the palaeonenvironments are characterized with basis on the best represented species, as well as taking into account field observations and other availeble data. The ostracodes reflect the miocenic evolution of the Tejo basin. They testify the presence of fresh and brackish water, litoral, infralittoral and circalittoral environments, and register the evolution from one environment to another. They indicate that the first miocenic marine transgression developed in an area of planes; that in miocenic gulfs the water energy was low, the higher dynamic corresponding to the Atlantic Ocean passage point (Carcavelos-Foz da Fonte). Elements of climatic order are not to be disregarde when considering the diversity of the fauna; the presence of species assinable to warmer climates is confirmed in the Aquitanian and Burdigalian. The similitudes with the fauna of the AquiTaine basin=(58 % of the common species) are greater then those from the mediterranean area (= 38 %). The forms registered in Portugal represent 36 % of the whole. In the Atlantic Coast the differences semm to be mainly related to latitude and temperature, as well as distance. As to the Mediterranean they are aggravated by the Gibraltar Strait and, probably, diferences in temperature. The endemic character of the ostracodes has been analyzed. It was confirmed that comon forms in rather distant basins when existing, are rare, and usually don't exist, and also that in neighboring basins they can be found in significant percentages. It is be admited {{that it is impossible to}} define ostracode biozones valid for large geographic areas. t seems however possible that such biozones can engulf several basins. The correlation based on ostracodes are the more significant the closer the concerned areas are, attaining greater significant in deposits within the same basinAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|In recent years, the {{correlation}} between diatom and cetacean richness patterns through time has been deeply investigated. However, the comparison of diatom and cetacean global data sets faced some criticisms, due to the gaps characterizing the cetacean fossil record, contrasting with the well-known Cenozoic fossil record of diatom. Moreover, other studies pointed out the tight and complex relationships existing between biodiversity, primary productivity, and trophic interactions: changes {{in one or more}} of these parameters could have had drastic effects on the stability of past marine ecosystems. For example, it has been observed that the stability of these ecosystems could be dramatically threatened in response to changes in the feeding habits of animals occupying the top of the trophic chains, notably the hypercarnivores. With the aim to provide a contribute to this debate, we undertook an in-depth investigation of Cerro Colorado (middle Miocene, Pisco Formation, Peru), the rich locality where the holotype of the giant raptorial sperm whale Livyatan melvillei and many other well preserved fossil marine vertebrates outcroup from diatom beds. Nowadays, diatoms constitute the base of marine food chains off Peru, and their abundance enriches the biodiversity of fish feeding on them. Therefore, the wealth of fossil vertebrates in the Pisco-Ica desert could be related to the great abundance of food resources that characterized the area during the Neogene. Interestingly, the analysis of worldwide data sets indicated a maximum of diversity for both cetaceans and diatoms during the middle-late Miocene, a time interval including the Livyatan assemblage of Cerro Colorado. During five successive campaigns, all the vertebrate fossils surrounding the Livyatan type locality, on a surface of about 4 km 2, were mapped using GPS equipment and preliminarily identified in the field, whereas the most significant specimens were collected for preparation. The study of a large sample of specimens attributed to the beaked whale Messapicetus lead to two publications including preliminary data on <b>paleocology</b> and taphonomy. A detailed geological and stratigraphical survey of the area, combined with satellite images, allowed an evaluation of the stratigraphic position of each specimen. A high vertebrate concentration and diversity were revealed around the stratigraphic level of Livyatan. In addition, taphonomic observations evidenced the absence of abrasion and bioincrustation on bones, the scarcity of breaks, and the prevalence of articulated skeletons. Based on these taphonomic data, the Livyatan assemblage much likely reflects an original and local abundance of life, rather than a condensed deposit and/or an accumulation due to bottom current transport. This high concentration of marine vertebrates provides a broad range of potential prey for the three top predators of the area, the sperm whale Livyatan and the sharks Caracharocles megalodon and Cosmopolitodus hastalis (whose teeth are frequently encountered in Cerro Colorado) : two cetotheriid mysticetes, the ziphiid Messapiceus gregarius (represented by males, females, and one calf), two new kentriodontids, the small pontoporiid Brachydelphis mazeasi (including a fetus), another new pontoporiid, at least one other undeterminate small physeteroid, the marine turtle Pacifichelis urbinai, and several seabirds and fishes. With such an exceptional fossil record, questions arise about the trophic interactions between members of the Miocene marine ecosystems. Among these questions, the impact of top predators on the diversity and body size evolution of their prey deserves special attention. Livyatan and the other large macropredators certainly generated a strong predatory pressure on medium-size to large members of the ecosystems off Peru. Looking at mysticetes, the bizygomatic width of the numerous skulls found at Cerro Colorado ranges from 60 to 80 cm, corresponding to an estimated body length between 560 to 720 cm. Such moderately large and fat-rich prey would have provided to Livyatan and large sharks a high amount of calories. The bizygomatic width of most of the mysticetes from Cerro la Bruja and Cerro los Quesos, two other fossil vertebrate-rich localities of the Pisco Formation (slightly younger than those of Cerro Colorado), falls in the range of 120 - 140 cm, roughly the double of the size of the Cerro Colorado mysticetes. Such an abrupt increase in the body size of mysticetes, also observed at a worldwide scale from middle to late Miocene, was tentatively interpreted as an antipredatory strategy, an hypothesis that should be tested with other fossil-rich Miocene localities...|$|E
40|$|Tethyan carbonates have {{recorded}} a complex long-term stratigraphic evolution during Cretaceous reflecting relevant paleoecologic shifts due to major paleoceanographic disruptions. Many of these shifts parallel analogous, basically synchronous biotic turning {{points in the}} pelagic realm thus providing relevant clues for biosphere-geosphere interactions, especially during OAEs and/or drowning events of neritic factories. Despite recent, very detailed outcomes on their chronostratigraphy provided by a modern geochemical approach, most of these events lack univocal paleoecologic-paleoceanographic interpretations. This is particularly true regarding the individuation of the paleoenvironmental processes responsible for the observed biofacies shifts in a cause-and-effect scenario. Improving the knowledge of this issue relies, among others, on studies of well exposed platform to basin transitions which may serve to detect and compare the most diverse biosedimentary records from shallow- to deep-water environments. Based on an integrated approach including sedimentology, <b>paleocology</b> and event stratigraphy, we present {{the results of an}} original study on the late Valanginian and late Early Aptian facies shifts recorded across the slightly deformed transition between the Apulia Carbonate Platform (ACP) and Ionian Basin (IB) exposed in the Gargano Promontory (Apulia foreland, southern Italy). We also provide two biofacies models across this transition to compare the paleoecologic signatures recorded by the ACP-IB during two of the most relevant OAEs of the whole Mesozoic. Previous paleoenvironmental analyses on the Early Cretaceous ACP-IB transition cropping out in south-eastern Gargano have enabled the local drowning unconformities and the related shifts of biofacies to be recognized and interpreted in a regional/global frame displaying evident traces of sharp paleoceanographic disruptions during the Weissert and Selli OAEs (Graziano, 1999; Graziano & Ruggiero, 2008). Corresponding, coeval facies shifts have been revealed in the shallow-water successions of the western Gargano (Spalluto, 2004; Spalluto et al., 2005). Both the late Valanginian and late Early Aptian drowning events typically affects the platform margin and slope whereas persisting inner platform successions display the temporary disappearance of ciclically organized dm-thick peritidal deposits replaced by thicker (few metres) mollusc- and microbial-dominated subtidal deposits. This facies shift coincides with a rapid turn-over in biota characterized by mass exctinctions of k-strategist biota (e. g. green algae) and concomitant blooming of opportunistic biota (mostly cyanobacteria). In addition, the late Early Aptian event also displays a remarkable Ostreid-rich, thick-bedded interval with Palorbitolina lenticularis, and Salpingoporella dinarica. Platform margin successions, limited to the late Early Aptian event, display a major facies shifts from urgonian-like, low-energy and well diversified biofacies to oligotypic associations dominated by dysaster taxa as cyanobacteria (Bacinella irregularis), foraminifera (P. lenticularis) and brachiopods (Orbirhynchia nadiae). The platform flank is characterized by distinct incursions of pelagic tongues wedging out toward the platform margins which indicate sharp though episodic starvations during both the drowning events. In addition, the late Valanginian episode is characterized also by the bloom of further dysaster taxa as the brachiopod Peregrinella. Basinal successions document a major facies change, coupled to deposition of black shales, only {{in the case of the}} late Early Aptian event. As a whole, both the investigated intervals indicate a precise correlation with well-known biocalcification crises, evolving paloeclimatic conditions (namely cooling or warming-cooling trends) and marked spikes of δ 13 C curves (cfr. Weissert & Erba, 2004, among many others). 	 References GRAZIANO R. (1999).
