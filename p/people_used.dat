5|$|Florida {{experienced}} a prolonged drought {{at the onset}} of the Early Archaic era that lasted until the Middle Archaic period. Although the population decreased overall on the peninsula, the use of tools increased significantly during this time. Artifacts demonstrate that these <b>people</b> <b>used</b> drills, knives, choppers, atlatls, and awls made from stone, antlers, and bone.|$|E
5|$|Irvin Willat and a {{cast and}} crew of 200 <b>people</b> <b>used</b> Lees Ferry during the filming of The Heritage of the Desert, {{released}} in 1924. Lee's Ferry is also mentioned {{as one of the}} stops in the film Stagecoach (1939).|$|E

40|$|There are {{fears that}} <b>people</b> <b>using</b> Personal Budgets (PBs), {{particularly}} Direct Payments (DPs), to arrange their care and support {{may be at}} greater risk of abuse and neglect than <b>people</b> <b>using</b> conventionally commissioned care services, particularly if they hire unregulated care workers, or rely on relatives or others to manage their money. However, there are predictions that PBs may enhance safety through increasing people's control over their own care. This study aimed to establish whether <b>people</b> <b>using</b> Direct Payments or Managed Personal Budgets are: more likely to be referred to the council with a safeguarding concern compared with <b>people</b> <b>using</b> conventional services, at higher risk of certain types of abuse...|$|R
5|$|The Muisca {{society was}} in essence egalitarian with slight {{differences}} {{in terms of}} use of jewelry. The guecha warriors, priests and caciques were allowed to wear multiple types of jewelry, while the common <b>people</b> <b>used</b> less jewels. Golden or tumbaga jewelry existed of diadems, nose pieces, breast plates, earrings, pendants, tiaras, bracelets and masks.|$|E
5|$|The Song <b>people</b> <b>used</b> the {{turntable}} trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They {{were all}} called 'fire trebuchets' {{because they were}} used to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were the ancestors of the cannon.|$|E

During the airport strike in May 2008—which closed Bergen Airport—Vildanden had full planes since they could land them on the short runway at near-by Stord Airport, Sørstokken. In 2008, 50,000 <b>people</b> <b>used</b> Skien Airport, most of whom flew with Vildanden.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{facilities at}} Black Moshannon State Park were {{constructed by the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, from 1933to 1937. The CCC created many jobs for unemployed industrial workers from throughout the United States. Black Moshannon State Park {{is the result of}} one of many projects undertaken by the CCC throughout central Pennsylvania. However, many <b>people</b> <b>used</b> the area for recreation {{as far back as the}} early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|There {{were times}} when <b>people</b> <b>used</b> to gather below the jharokha window to hold protest demonstrations to place their grievances before the emperor. One such {{incident}} occurred in 1641 in Lahore when people who were affected by famine and were starving pleaded before Shah Jahan to provide famine relief.|$|E
5|$|When the Jones Beach State Park Authority {{was given}} the loan by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in March 1933, a toll was planned for both the Meadowbrook Causeway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway to help repay the loan. Tollbooths were constructed, and a 25-cent toll (1935USD) went into effect on both roadways on January2, 1935. On that day, the {{supervisor}} with the LISPC reported that 300 <b>people</b> <b>used</b> the highway.|$|E

5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared {{to pose a}} threat to Bermuda, its government issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a school to be used as an emergency shelter, though few <b>people</b> <b>used</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Although the bunkers {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local <b>people</b> <b>used</b> the bunkers to shelter from the shelling.|$|E
5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many <b>people</b> <b>used</b> feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{a number}} of notable <b>people</b> <b>used</b> Saint-Inglevert Airfield. King Edward VIII made three visits, the first on 4 February 1935, while still the Prince of Wales, when he arrived from Fort Belvedere, Surrey on {{the first part of}} a journey to take a holiday at Kitzbühel, Austria. As king, he {{departed}} on 26 July 1936 to RAF Hendon on his return from the ceremony to unveil the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and flew in from the Great West Aerodrome, Harmondsworth, UK on 8 August, in order to catch the Orient Express at Calais, as part of a holiday in Yugoslavia. Henri Mignet flew from Saint-Inglevert to Lympne on 13 August 1935, in his Flying Flea, then the world's smallest aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may {{have witnessed the}} collapse of Mount Mazama {{and the formation of}} Crater Lake, have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath <b>people</b> <b>used</b> Crater Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E
5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which <b>people</b> <b>used</b> {{to be able to see}} in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been expected. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR– in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets. 37,000 <b>people</b> <b>used</b> the line on the first day, but {{in the months following}} the line's opening only about 20,000–30,000 passengers a day used the service. The number of carriages used by the BS was cut back to three per train at peak times and only two during off-peak hours. The Daily Mail reported in April 1906 that the rush-hour trains were carrying fewer than 100 people at a time. To add to the line's misfortunes, it suffered its first fatality only two weeks after opening when conductor John Creagh was crushed between a train and a tunnel wall at Kennington Road station on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of numerous Mahasatikals (or Mastikal – hero stones {{for a woman}} who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty. Ritual death by sallekhana and by jalasamadhi (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and <b>people</b> <b>used</b> umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (honnasara and honnagala sara), bracelets (Kaduga) and wristlets (Kaftkina). Women wore a nose jewel (bottu), nose ring (mugutti), bangles (bale or kankana) and various types of necklaces (honna gante sara and kati sutra). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as agraharas, ghatikas, brahmapura or matha. Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places.|$|E
