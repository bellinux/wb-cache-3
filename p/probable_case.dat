25|$|Though fossils {{revealing}} ichthyosaur behavior remain rare, one ichthyosaur fossil {{is known}} to have sustained bites to the snout region. Discovered in Australia, and analyzed by Benjamin Kear et alii in 2011, measurements of the wounds reveal that the bite marks were inflicted by another ichthyosaur, likely of the same species, a <b>probable</b> <b>case</b> of face biting during a conflict. The wounds show signs of healing in the form of bone growth, meaning that the victim survived the attack. Another, very large ichthyosaur close to nine metres in length was found in Svalbard; it was nearly complete save for its tail. Scrutiny of the find revealed that while hunting ammonites (as evidenced by an ammonite shell in the throat region), the ichthyosaur was ambushed and attacked, likely by a pliosaurid (known from the same habitat), which severed its tail. The ichthyosaur then sank to the depths, drowning and eventually becoming fossilized in the deep water. The find was revealed to the public in the National Geographic special Death of a Sea Monster.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Max Muller is {{not content}} with giving a very {{elaborate}} and interesting account of how the story of Tuna arose (i. 5-7). He keeps Tuna in hand, and, at the peroration of his vast work (ii. 831), warns us that, before we compare myths in unrelated languages, we need 'a very accurate knowledge of their dialects [...] . to prevent accidents like that of Tuna mentioned in the beginning.' What accident? That I explained the myth of Daphne by the myth of Tuna? But {{that is precisely what}} I did not do. I explained the Greek myth of Daphne (1) as a survival from the savage mental habit of regarding men as on a level with stones, beasts, and plants; or (2) as a tale 'moulded by poets on the same model.' {11} The latter is the more <b>probable</b> <b>case,</b> for we find Daphne late, in artificial or mythographic literature, in Ovid and Hyginus. In Ovid the river god, Pentheus, changes Daphne into a laurel. In Hyginus she is not changed at all; the earth swallows her, and a laurel fills her place.|$|E

40|$|Backgroud: Heterozygous {{familial}} hypercholesterolemia are either classical cases with high LDL-C levels, tendon xanthomas and LDL receptor gene mutation or <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> with hypercholesterolemia without known LDL receptor gene mutations. Aims & Objectives: This study {{was done to}} compare the severity of hypercholesterolemia and risk of CVD in classical and <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> of heterozygous {{familial hypercholesterolemia}} in tertiary care hospitals of Karachi. This was a case-series done from June 2008 to July 2010 at Dr Ziauddin Hospital and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: Out of more than 240 patients with dyslipidemia or premature coronary artery diseases 120 patients who had primary hypercholesterolemia and {{were found to have}} total cholesterol > 230 mg/dL and LDL-C > 160 mg/dL were included in the study. All these cases had premature coronary artery diseases or had a family history of coronary artery diseases. They were grouped as classical or <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> depending on raised LDL-C, xanthelasmas, xanthoma, premature coronary artery diseases and LDL-R gene mutations. Their blood samples were collected after twelve hours fasting. PCR was done for mutation specific primers for exons 3, 4, 9 and 14. Results: Out of these 120 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, classical cases with LDL-receptor gene mutation were 42 (35 %) and <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> without LDL-receptor gene mutations were 78 (65 %). Eleven (27 %) of these classical cases had severe hypercholesterolemia having total cholesterol (> 290 mg/dL) and LDL-C (> 200 mg/dL) and were found to have xanthelasmas, xanthomas and arcus cornealis. Discussion/Conclusions: Amongst the HeFH patients from the tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, classical cases with tendon xanthomas and LDL receptor gene mutations had severe hypercholesterolemia with greater risk of CVD, they required more aggressive treatment. <b>Probable</b> <b>cases</b> were also at risk of CVD and needed statin therapy...|$|R
