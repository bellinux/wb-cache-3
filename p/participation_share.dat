40|$|Most {{perspectives}} on public <b>participation</b> <b>share</b> {{the notion that}} dialogues should be open, allowing participants to articulate and evaluate different views and knowledge claims. We hypothesize that participants' evaluation of claims may be biased because participants have a preference for a particular type or source of a claim. This would hamper an open dialogue. We tested the effect of three variables on scientists' evaluation of claims {{of the general public}} about GM food: the claim's favorability towards GM food, the phrasing, and the source of the claim. Results are based on a survey-experiment among 73 biotechnology-scientists. Biased processing occurred when scientists evaluated claims. Claims that were corresponding with the attitude of the scientists and that were phrased in a cognitive way were evaluated more positively than claims that were contrasting the attitude of the scientists and that were phrased in an affective way. Contrary to our expectation, scientists evaluated claims of the public more positively than claims of experts. © 2009 SAGE Publications...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{expansion}} of access to Australian {{higher education in the}} past decade, the <b>participation</b> <b>share</b> of rural and isolated people and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds has altered little and remains unacceptably low. This paper reports findings from two national studies at the Centre for the Study of Higher Education that have examined student choices about higher education, especially the inhibiting factors still present for non-traditional students. The discussion focuses on the dilemmas and challenges for Australian universities in balancing the adoption of entrepreneurial approaches to student recruitment with a far from finished equity agenda. The paper raises questions about the new ideology of individual ‘choice’ that is influencing universities and whether or not this can be reconciled with social equity objectives. Since the reforms of the late 1980 s removed the binary divide between Australian universities and colleges, the emphases of federal higher education policy have shifted considerably — from a model based on political theory, in which the objective wa...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} was studied the effect of feed with {{different}} energy and protein level on the carcass characteristics at broiler chickens, which were sacrificed at 35 and 42 days old. The genetic material was represented by broiler chickens {{that belonged to the}} „Ross- 308 ” hybrid, with two groups (LC-control group and LE-experimental group). During the growth periods (starter, growing and finishing) they have received compound feed ad libitum, with different energy and protein levels (LC-conforming to recommendations of Aviagen Company; LE-higher with 10 %). After slaughter, from each group were sampled 30 carcasses (15 carcasses per sex) and was determined slaughter yield and participation percentage of the cut parts from the whole carcasses structure. The meat/bones ratio from carcass and from major parts of the carcass was determined on 10 carcasses from each group (five per sex). The results of this experiment showed that the nutrition and age had significant influence on the slaughter yield, the participation percentage of the cut parts from the whole carcass and meat/bones ratio in breast and legs, while the sex influenced <b>participation</b> <b>share</b> and meat quantity in breast and legs...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss several methodological {{issues related to the}} {{identification}} and estimation of Average Treatment on the Treated (ATT) effects in the presence of low compliance. We consider non-experimental data consisting of a treatment group, where a program is implemented, and of a control group that is non-randomly drawn, where the program is not offered. Estimating the ATT involves tackling both the non-random assignment of the program and the non-random participation among treated individuals. We argue against standard matching approaches to deal with the latter issue because they are {{based on the assumption that}} we observe all variables that determine both participation and outcome. Instead, we propose an IV-type estimator which exploits the fact that the ATT can be expressed as the Average Intent to Treat divided by the <b>participation</b> <b>share,</b> in the absence of spillover effects. We propose a semi-parametric estimator that couples the flexibility of matching estimators with a standard Instrumental Variable approach. We discuss the different assumptions necessary for the identification of the ATT with each of the two approaches, and we provide an empirical application by estimating the effect of the Mexican conditional cash transfer program, Oportunidades, on food consumption...|$|E
40|$|Political {{scientists}} and policymakers have long lamented the consistently dismal levels of civic {{engagement in the}} United States. Despite widespread recognition that low levels of voter turnout are a concern for American democracy, it remains unclear how to remedy the problem. Existing theories of <b>participation</b> <b>share</b> the fundamental assumption that voting is costly. In addition to the informational costs associated with becoming informed about elections and registering to vote, citizens face a number of obstacles in turning out to vote, including locating and traveling to polling locations and navigating long lines on Election Day. In the United States, the costs of participation are incurred repeatedly, given {{the large number of}} elections held and the need to re-register with any changes in home address. Existing theories of participation focus on the individual resources—especially education, income, and mobilizing social networks—that enable individuals to participate. Individuals with higher levels of educational attainment have the cognitive resources to figure out voting requirements and make sense of the noise of political campaigns. Those with higher incomes have the ability to absorb the financial costs of participating. Those at the top end of the education and income distributions {{are also more likely to}} be in social networks where they will be asked to participate. Yet, policy efforts based on these theories have been notoriously unsuccessful. Civic education programs that have focused on teaching facts and knowledge about politics have found limited success (Bachner 2010...|$|E
40|$|Software code review, i. e., the {{practice}} of having third-party team members critique changes to a software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and pro-prietary software domains. Prior work {{has shown that the}} formal code inspections of the past tend to improve the qual-ity of software delivered by students and small teams. How-ever, the formal code inspection process mandates strict re-view criteria (e. g., in-person meetings and reviewer check-lists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the mod-ern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process qual-itatively, little research quantitatively explores the relation-ship between properties of the modern code review process and software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between software quality and: (1) code review coverage, i. e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, and (2) code review participation, i. e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that both code review coverage and <b>participation</b> <b>share</b> a significant link with software quality. Low code review cov-erage and participation are estimated to produce compo-nents with up to two and five additional post-release defects respectively. Our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools...|$|E

This paper seeks {{to answer this question}} in two steps. First, we briefly summarize the main findings from 26 meta-analyses concerned with traditional practices such as goal setting, feedback, work design, financial incentives, or training. These practices can improve both organizational performance and the well-being of organizational members. Second, we examine in more depth a new, increasingly important high performance work practice: Employee involvement in organizational leadership (EIOL). This approach is built on theories focusing on organizational <b>participation,</b> <b>shared</b> leadership, and organizational democracy. We also illustrate recently constructed measurement instruments for assessing these constructs. This synopsis leads us {{to the development of a}} new integrative, multilevel model of EIOL. The model includes several mediator (e. g., knowledge exchange) and moderator variables (e. g., self-leadership competencies of actors) that explain why and when this approach is effective. We conclude that future research should focus on cross-level interactions of different forms of organizational <b>participation,</b> <b>shared</b> leadership, and organizational democracy, and seek to identify the processes mediating their interplay...|$|R
