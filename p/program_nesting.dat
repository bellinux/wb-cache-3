In the literature addressing sora apparent nest success, {{the proportions of}} successful nests varied from 0.61 in Michigan to 0.833 in Minnesota. In western New York, the nest success rate of 6 sora nests was 0.43, and the daily nest success rate was 0.97.

The authors conclude that diminished water level interacting with predators and trampling by cattle resulted in decreased hatching success.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{automatic}} compile-time computation and data decomposition technique for distributed memory machines. Our method can handle complex programs containing perfect and nonperfect loop nests {{with or without}} loop-carried dependences. Applying our decomposition algorithms, a program will be divided into collections (called clusters) of loop nests, such that data redistributions are allowed only between the clusters. Within each cluster of loop nests, decomposition and data locality constraints are formulated as a system of homogeneous linear equations which is solved by polynomial time algorithms. Our algorithm can selectively relax data locality constraints within a cluster to achieve a balance between parallelism and data locality. Such relaxations are guided by exploiting the hierarchical <b>program</b> <b>nesting</b> structures from outer to inner nesting levels to keep the communications at a outer-most level possible.

40|$|An FT nmr {{spectrometer}} is {{by definition}} complex : many users and uses, at least three nuclear frequencies, numerous excitation patterns and sophisticated data-processing methods. Hence such machines are often unwieldy for the designer, builder, operator and end-user. We have set ourselves the goal of building a machine which can be operated with hardly any training by users, and which can be easily maintained or modified by others than the building team. The design {{is based on the}} repetitious use of simple methods. In the analogic part, the three nuclear channels are built alike, pulsing, phase-switching etc. are all done at the intermediate frequency, and most systems are broad-band, notably the transmit/receive switches. A bus carries the logical controls. Receiver recovery time is 8 μs, enabling solid-state type, broad lines to be measured. The spectrometer is multinuclear. Quadrature detection is used. A special design simplifies probe building. The interface between the analogic part and the computer is also built around a bus. It is easily programmed, and it can be extended. Data are accumulated as 32 -bit words, thus avoiding memory saturation. The acquisition, under computer control, is easily programmed but limited to a total spectral width of 28. 5 kHz. The programs, written in FORTRAN, make extensive use of subroutine libraries which manage the interactions of the computer and its peripherals, notably the spectrometer interface and the user's console. The programs are thus reduced mostly to CALL statements. They are easy to understand, maintain or create. User-software communications are fast, extensive, in English. Words are keyed-in by their first letter and printed in full. No mnemonics are used. Lists of available commands, <b>program</b> <b>nesting</b> and abundant information provided by the programs minimize the dependence on introductory manuals.

40|$|Initial algebra {{semantics}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of {{the theory}} of modern functional programming languages. For each inductive data type, it provides a Church encoding for that type, a build combinator which constructs data of that type, a fold combinator which encapsulates structured recursion over data of that type, and a fold/build rule which optimises modular programs by eliminating from them data constructed using the build combinator, and immediately consumed using the fold combinator, for that type. It has long been thought that initial algebra semantics is not expressive enough to provide a similar foundation for <b>programming</b> with <b>nested</b> types in Haskell. Specifically, the standard folds derived from initial algebra semantics have been considered too weak to capture commonly occurring patterns of recursion over data of nested types in Haskell, and no build combinators or fold/build rules have until now been defined for nested types. This paper shows that standard folds are, in fact, sufficiently expressive for <b>programming</b> with <b>nested</b> types in Haskell. It also defines build combinators and fold/build fusion rules for nested types.

This paper {{develops}} and implements an algorithm for estimating dynamic Markov decision {{models with}} continuous state variables, multiple alternatives and unobserved heterogeneity. Several econometric and computational issues are discussed: Since the model allows for continuous state variables, Chebyshev polynomials {{are used to}} approximate value functions over the continuous state space. Since the algorithm allows for unobserved state variables and heterogeneity in coefficients, choice probabilities can not be obtained in closed form, even if the value function is know up to the coefficients. To accommodate this, simulation is used to integrate out unobserved factors. Finally, I perform two monte carlo experiments. First, I evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} approximation methods. Secondly, the importance of heterogeneity bias in dynamic programming discrete choice models is investigated. Date: January, 2005. Key words and phrases.
