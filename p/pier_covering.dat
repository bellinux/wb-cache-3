Alexander built large screens of wood {{upon the}} <b>pier,</b> <b>covering</b> them with hides, which {{protected}} his soldiers from the weapons of the enemy, {{so that they could}} carry on their operations safely behind them. By these means the work advanced for some distance further. As it advanced, various structures were erected upon it, especially along the sides and at the end toward the city. These structures consisted of great engines for driving piles, and machines for throwing stones and darts, and towers carried up to a great height, to enable the men to throw stones and heavy weapons down upon the galleys which might attempt to approach them.|$|E

The selected fish -Landing sites, where sampling exercises were carried out include: Loco, Jinja <b>pier</b> (<b>covering</b> Lake Victoria) and Railway bridge, New bridge and Kalange (covering upper Victoria Nile). Research {{was focused on the}} cast-net design, target commercial fish stocks, impact of cast-net on the fish stocks, mesh-size and techniques ofcast-netting. The research results show that cast-net fishery destroys fish breeding and nursery grounds and other fish ecosystem. The gear targets Oreochromis niloticus and Occassional by catches e. g. Lates niloticus, Mormyrus Kannume Bagrus docmak and Clarias gariepinus. The multi-panel cast-net of mesh-sizes ranging from i (5 lmm) to 6 ' (152 mm) were adaptable by fishermen but they mostly caught immature fish. Nevertheless, this gear showed highest efficiency compared to other gears used at the project area. These research results will be useful to researchers, extension workers and Fishenes, students under taking special research or study on this gear...|$|E

Shanks, had {{expanded}} to {{a staff of}} 2,500 officers, embarkation camps, hospitals, twelve piers and seven warehouses in Hoboken, in Brooklyn eight piers and 120 warehouses of which six piers were also Bush Terminal Company assets, and two Army Supply Base warehouses and, in the North River, Manhattan three <b>piers</b> <b>covering</b> a total of fifty-seven acres.|$|R
50|$|Designed by the {{architectural}} firm of Donaldson and Meier, the First Unitarian Church of Detroit was a Romanesque Revival-style church built of red sandstone. After its remodeling during the 1936 widening of Woodward, it remained substantially as built. The gabled fa√ßade {{had a great}} expanse of masonry; a simple four-bay porch with a shed roof and stone Romanesque columns spanning the first floor. There was a two-story hip-roofed projection at the corner, and a side porch with stone <b>piers</b> <b>covering</b> a side entrance.|$|R

Kirkwood and built in 1847-1848 by New York and Erie Railroad, of locally quarried random ashlar bluestone, except for three brick interior longitudinal spandrel walls and the concrete base portions of the <b>piers</b> and deck <b>covering.</b> This {{may have been the}} first structural use of concrete in American bridge construction.|$|R
