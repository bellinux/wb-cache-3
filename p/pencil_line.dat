Today, when he arrived to seek an interview with Lord Ismay to convey him the message from Jinnah, {{he was told that}} Ismay was closeted with Sir Cyril Radcliffe, Chairman Boundary Commission. When Chaudhri saw him at last, Ismay professed complete ignorance of any knowledge of the proposed Punjab boundary, {{while at the same time}} Chaudhri discovered a <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> on the map in Ismay's room very similar to the boundary that had been reported to Jinnah. [...] "Ismay turned pale," [...] says Chaudhri Muhammad Ali, [...] "and asked in confusion who had been fooling with his map." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{the black}} outline {{seems to be}} peculiarly that which we ought to begin to reason upon, because it is simple and open-hearted, and does not {{endeavor}} to escape into mist. A <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> may be obscurely and undemonstrably wrong; false in a cowardly manner, and without confession: but the ink line, if it goes wrong at all, goes wrong with a will, and may be convicted at our leisure, and put to such shame as its black complexion is capable of. May we, therefore, begin with the hard line? It will lead us far, if we can come to conclusions about it.|$|E
6000|$|It involves, therefore, always, {{ideas of}} power and dexterity, but also of restraint; and the delight you take in it should involve the {{understanding}} of the difficulty the workman dealt with. You perhaps doubt the extent to which this feeling justly extends, (in the first volume of [...] "Modern Painters," [...] expressed under the head [...] "Ideas of Power.") But why is a large stone in any building grander than a small one? Simply because it was more difficult to raise it. So, also, an engraved line is, and ought to be, recognized as more grand than a pen or <b>pencil</b> <b>line,</b> because it was more difficult to execute it.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1883 preface of [...] "Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught," [...] Rose {{explained}} that, {{the object}} of the book is to enable the beginner to learn to make simple mechanical drawings without the aid of an instructor, and to create an interest in the subject by giving examples such as the machinist meets with in his every-day workshop practice. The plan of representing in many examples the <b>pencil</b> <b>lines,</b> and numbering the order in which they are marked, Rose believed to possess great advantages for the learner, since it is the producing of the <b>pencil</b> <b>lines</b> that really proves the study, the inking in being merely a curtailed repetition of the pencilling. Similarly when the drawing of a piece, such, for example, as a fully developed screw thread, is shown fully developed from end to end, even though the <b>pencil</b> <b>lines</b> were all shown, yet the process of construction will be less clear than if the process of development be shown gradually along the drawing.|$|R

60|$|So in {{due time}} the New Church was built and it towered above the maple trees of Mariposa like a beacon on a hill. It stood so high that from the open steeple of it, where the bells were, you could see all the town lying at its feet, and the {{farmsteads}} {{to the south of}} it, and the railway like a double <b>pencil</b> <b>line,</b> and Lake Wissanotti spread out like a map. You could see and appreciate things from the height of the new church,--such as the size and the growing wealth of Mariposa,--that you never could have seen from the little stone church at all.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, the old Florentine workmen {{constructed}} the line itself, in important places, of successive minute touches, {{so that it}} became a chain of delicate links which could be opened or closed at pleasure.[AC] If you will examine through a lens {{the outline of the}} face of this Astrology, you will find it is traced with an exquisite series of minute touches, susceptible of accentuation or change absolutely at the engraver's pleasure; and, in result, corresponding to the finest conditions of a <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> drawing by a consummate master. In the fine plates of this period, you have thus the united powers of the pen and pencil, and both absolutely secure and multipliable.|$|E

In order to do so [...] without the trouble of carrying any instrument (except my compass [...] and spirit-level), I had my Alpine pole made as even as a round rule [...] for about a foot in the middle of its length. Taking the bearing of [...] the mountain, placing the pole at right angles to the bearing, and [...] adjusting it by the spirit-level, I brought the edge of a piece of [...] finely cut pasteboard parallel, in a vertical plane (plumbed), with [...] the apparent slope of the hillside.

60|$|The {{outline of}} any simple solid form, {{even though it}} may have complex parts, {{represents}} an actual limit, accurately to be followed. The outline of a cup, of a shell, or of an animal's limb, has a determinable course, which your pen or <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> either coincides with or does not. You can say of that line, either it is wrong or right; if right, it is in a measure suggestive, and nobly suggestive of the character of the object. But the greater number of objects in a landscape either have outlines so complex that no pencil could follow them (as trees in middle distance), or they have no actual outline at all, but a gradated and softened edge; as, for the most part, clouds, foam, and the like. And even in things which have determinate form, the outline of that form is usually quite incapable of expressing their real character.|$|E
60|$|Generally, I think, the {{perception}} of the muscular qualities of the tree trunk incomplete, except in men who have studied the human figure, and in loose expression of those characters, the painter who can draw the living muscle seldom fails; but the thoroughly peculiar lines belonging to woody fibre, can only be learned by patient forest study; and hence in all the trees of the merely historical painters, there is fault of some kind or another, commonly exaggeration of the muscular swellings, or insipidity and want of spring in curvature, or fantasticism and unnaturalness of arrangement, and especially a want of the peculiar characters of bark which express the growth and age of the tree; for bark is no mere excrescence, lifeless and external--it is a skin of especial significance in its indications of the organic form beneath; in places under the arms of the tree it wrinkles up and forms fine lines round the trunk, inestimable in their indication of the direction of its surface; in others, it bursts or peels longitudinally, and the rending and bursting of it are influenced in direction and degree by the under-growth and swelling of the woody fibre, and are not a mere roughness and granulated pattern of the hide. Where there are so many points to be observed, some are almost always exaggerated, and others missed, according to the predilections of the painter. Rembrandt and Albert Durer have given some splendid examples of woody texture, but both miss the grace of the great lines. Titian took a larger view and reached a higher truth, yet (as before noticed) from the habit of drawing the figure, he admits too much flaccidity and bend, and sometimes makes his tree trunks look flexible like sea-weed. There is a peculiar stiffness and spring about the curves of the wood, which separates them completely from animal curves, and which especially defies recollection or invention; it is so subtile that it escapes but too often, even in the most patient study from nature; it lies within the thickness of a <b>pencil</b> <b>line.</b> Farther, the modes of ramification of the upper branches are so varied, inventive, and graceful, that the least alteration of them, even in the measure of a hairbreadth, spoils them; and though it is sometimes possible {{to get rid of a}} troublesome bough, accidentally awkward, or in some minor respects to assist the arrangement, yet so far as the real branches are copied, the hand libels their lovely curvatures even in its best attempts to follow them.|$|E

5000|$|According to Adelaide-born {{astronaut}} Andy Thomas, {{the line}} is identifiable from space, because of its unnatural straightness. [...] "It's a very fine line, it's like someone has drawn a very fine <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> across the desert," [...] he has said.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{examined}} the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane. In all of these, the width of the line - the allowed displacement of the positions of the points from a perfect straight line - is important. It allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. Alfred Watkins, in his classic work on ley lines The Old Straight Track, used the width of a <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. For example, using a 1 mm <b>pencil</b> <b>line</b> to draw alignments on an 1:50,000 Ordnance Survey map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m.|$|E
40|$|The Stage 3 {{revision}} {{sets up the}} Theory Palette with hues and {{tones of}} green (author, history, and nature), yellow (culture), purple (psyche), grey (text), red (reader), dark blue (literature), light blue (language), rose (embodiment/perception), and hot pink (intersectional feminisms). Airbrush and pencil tools suggest color blending without diminishing the complexity of theory hues and tones, to allow more nuanced explorations of the theory concerns in play, in individual texts and across our readings. Larger paint splotches echo the setup of an artist’s palette; smaller paint splotches indicate secondary and tertiary hues and tones. <b>Pencil</b> <b>lines</b> complement the paint splotches, layering in circulation, gradation, and entanglement. In an curious side-effect, the airbrushed splotches and curling <b>pencil</b> <b>lines</b> also resemble stylized strands of holiday lights or nodes on circuit boards...|$|R
