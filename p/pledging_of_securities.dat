50|$|Nothing {{more clearly}} {{demonstrates}} the sterile paradox of the Napoleonic work than {{the history of}} the Grand Duchy. It was Napoleon, and he alone, who created this whole state in 1803 to reward in the person of the little margrave of Baden a relative of the emperor of Russia. It was he who after Austerlitz aggrandized the margravate at the expense of Austria; transformed it into a sovereign principality and raised it to a Grand Duchy. It was he too who, by the secularization {{on the one hand and}} by the dismemberment of Württemberg on the other, gave the Grand Duke 500,000 new subjects. He believed that the recognition of the prince and the artificial ethnical formation of the principality would be <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> for France. But in 1813 Baden joined the coalition, and since then that nation created of odds and ends ("de bric et de broc") and always handsomely treated by us, had not ceased to take a leading part in the struggles against our country. The Grand Duke Frederick, Grand Duke by the will of Napoleon, has done France all the harm he could. But French opinion itself renders justice to the probity of his character and to the ardour of his patriotism, and nobody will feel surprise at the homage with which Germany feels bound to surround his old age.|$|R

A estrutura de governança dominante que tem papel formalizador na relação entre a agroindústria e o produtor rural no setor de aves é o contrato de integração vertical, que se apresenta como estratégia de um lado para garantir o fornecimento de aves em escala e padrão de qualidade exigida pelo mercado e do outro como garantia de segurança de mercado para os produtores. As relações contratuais têm se tornado mais sofisticadas e hoje os contratos se apresentam como estruturas que tentam abranger todas as dinâmicas relacionadas à produção e comercialização das aves. Tais relações têm sinalizado a necessidade de uma nova dinâmica na coordenação das cadeias produtivas. Este trabalho tem como objetivo avaliar o modelo de Integração entre a agroindústria e os produtores de aves de corte no Distrito Federal. Para tanto foi realizado um estudo do discurso dos principais atores envolvidos no cenário de tramitação do Projeto de Lei 8023 / 10, bem como dos produtores integrados, agroindústria e representantes do ambiente institucional e organizacional. A análise dos conteúdos verbalizados pelos participantes foi feita por meio do Alceste(Analyse de LexémesCoocurrentdans lês EnnoncésSimple d’unTexte- Análise Lexical Contextual de um Conjunto de Segmentos de Texto), em que foi possível identificar as principais variáveis que influenciam e/ou afetam os contratos de parceria. Algumas categorias de análise emergiram a partir do discurso dos participantes e os resultados foram organizados e interpretados à luz dos quadros referenciais da Teoria de Custos de Transação. Com isso, observou-se que os contratos são percebidos como pouco equitativos e com concentração de poder de determinação econômica, estratégica e administrativa na agroindústria. Havendo assim a necessidade de regulamentação dos contratos de integração no agronegócio, em especial na avicultura, como forma de garantir a equidade e eficiência desta cadeia produtiva. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{productive}} {{chain of}} birds in Distrito Federal has demonstrated expressive results throughout {{the last decades}} due to some advances in the agro-industrial and organizational systems, making the productive environment extremely complex and influencing the beginning of new ways of coordination of the productive chains.

These contractual relations have become more sophisticated and today such contracts build structures that try to enclose allthe dynamic related to the production and commercialization of the birds. Such relations have signaled the necessity of a new dynamics in the coordination of the productive chains. This work aims to evaluate the model of integration between the agro-industry and the producers of birds in Distrito Federal. To do that were made analysis of contracts of integration of the effective poultry in Distrito Federal and the study of the speech of the people involved in the transaction of the Project of Law n º 8, 023 / 10, as integrated producers, integrating agro-industry and representatives of the institutional and organizational environment.
