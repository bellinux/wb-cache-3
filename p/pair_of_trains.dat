60|$|But the {{friendly}} feelings existing between them did not relax the chief's notions of discipline. Attim was {{not permitted to}} follow his master as an idle companion. He was made to carry, or rather to drag, his own food, {{by means of a}} collar with two pieces of stick attached, the ends of which trailed on the ice, thus forming as it were a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> without wheels. This is a simple contrivance, largely used by the prairie Indians with their horses as well as dogs. The two sticks or poles, being long, project a good way behind the animal, thus leaving space for a load. As the poles are suited to their size, each horse or little dog is loaded with an appropriate bundle, and it is to be presumed does not feel overburdened.|$|E
