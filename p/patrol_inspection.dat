50|$|The aqueducts {{were under}} the overall care and {{governance}} of a water commissioner (curator aquarum). It was a high status and high-profile appointment. In 97, Frontinus served both as consul and as curator aquarum, under the emperor Nerva. Little is known of the day-to-day business of aqueduct maintenance teams (aquarii). Under the emperor Claudius, Rome's contingent of imperial aquarii comprised a familia aquarum of 700 persons, both slave and free, funded {{through a combination of}} Imperial largesse and water taxes. They were supervised by an Imperial freedman, who held office as procurator aquarium. Theirs was probably a never-ending routine of <b>patrol,</b> <b>inspection</b> and cleaning, punctuated by occasional emergencies. Full closure of any aqueduct for servicing would have been a rare event, kept as brief as possible, with repairs preferably made when water demand was lowest, which was presumably at night. The water supply could be shut off at its aqueduct outlet when small or local repairs were needed, but substantial maintenance and repairs to the aqueduct conduit itself required the complete diversion of water at any point upstream or at the spring-head itself.|$|E
40|$|The {{pipelines}} {{of oil and}} gas well, oil and gas transmission, {{power transmission}} and so on are put in field. and it needs regular <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection.</b> Pipeline <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> system based on GIS, GPS and GSM solve the disadvantages of traditional <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> model and improve the <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> efficiency, and it also can describe the pipelines and its ancillary facility in detail with the powerful geographic information techniques, it has been extended rapidly in the pipeline inspection work. However, Pipeline <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> system based on GIS, GPS and GSM also has some disadvantages; it just describes the pipelines and their surrounding on the electronic map with the simple GIS Data such as points, lines and polygons. Because it can not give a true representation for the pipelines and their surrounding scenes, it’s feeble to display the objective world compared with the real world. With the global high-resolution images of geographic data and supporting overlaying vector data on the Google Earth client, Google Earth can solve the problem above. So we introduce Google Earth to pipeline <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> work and do some researches on how to makes full use of the advantages of GIS, GPS, GSM and Google Earth to inspect pipelines. According to the advantages of GIS, GPS, GSM and Google Earth, after analyzing the feasibility of integrating them, this paper presents a 4 G integration technology, and introduces the methods of 4 G integration technology. In the paper, the work principle, the system features and the application range of Kuainiao <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> system based on 4 G technology are introduced in detail.

Thus the inspector should inspect the parameter that increase the rejection or rework with more attention. on the whole this concept helps the inspector {{to improve the quality of}} the product by inspecting more components according to the frequency of the component...|$|E

30|$|The railway track, {{including}} rail, sleeper, and fastener, is {{the most}} important infrastructure of the railway. Due to the long-term impact of the train and the natural environment on the railway, a variety of defects will be formed on the rail, which will jeopardize the safety of the railway, such as the deformed rail and broken sleeper [1]. These changes {{on the surface of the}} railway are caused by defects and can be directly seen by the worker’s eyes; therefore, the <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> method by sight can be used for first detecting the defects of the railway. At present, the track surface defect detection mainly relies on manual inspection, but this method is labor-intensive, has lower efficiency, and influences results easily; it cannot meet the needs of daily inspection of the modern railway, especially the China High-speed Railway (CRH). As the daily inspecting time of CRH is always scheduled quickly and at night to avoid disrupting the regular operation of the train, there is not enough light and the workers tire easily so that it is hard to get a creditable inspection result from workers’ eyes. Therefore, it is urgent to find faster and more efficient automatic detection equipment to carry out the real-time detection of the track in the operation line [2 – 4]. The research mainly aims at the common rail surface defects, such as cracks, peeling, scratches, folds, broken rails, scars, and other forms [5].|$|E
40|$|Power {{transmission}} line inspection {{is of utmost}} importance for power companies towards having sustainable electricity supply to vast number of customers in major industries as well as households in a city. Inspection provides valuable data from status of the line, thus helps line engineers to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damages which may result in outage. Constant energy supply to the customers requires performing all the inspection tasks without de-energizing the line, so live line inspection methods are of the most interest to power companies. These companies perform <b>patrol</b> <b>inspection</b> mainly using helicopters equipped with infrared and corona cameras to detect observable physical damages {{as well as some}} internal deterioration to the line and line equipment. However, aerial inspection is costly and always there is a risk of contact with live lines and loss of life. Moreover, there are some critical specifications of the line such as internal corrosion of steel reinforced aluminium conductors that should be inspected precisely from close distances to the line that are not accessible by a mobile platform such as a helicopter or even an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Hence, power companies have endeavored to make especial cable-climbing robots to accomplish inspection tasks from close distances to the hot line. Thanks to technological advances, utilizing robots as reliable substitutes for human beings in hazardous environments such as live lines has become possible. For many tasks requiring high precision {{over a long period of}} time, robots even do their job better than human operators. However, power companies have mainly focused on automating inspection tasks more willingly than making autonomous systems to perform repair works on the live line due to the fact that repair works are often complex to be accomplished by a robot...|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} number of North Korean defectors reached its peak in 1998 and 1999, the {{estimated}} population {{is believed to have}} declined since then. Some main reasons for the falling number of defectors especially since 2000 are strict border <b>patrols</b> and <b>inspections,</b> forced deportations, and rising cost for defection. During the mourning period of Kim Jong-il s death on December 17, 2011 and the start of Kim Jong-uns rule, the movements of people were tightened and strictly controlled. This included requiring families that live near the border areas to take turns standing guard, having strong official warnings that three generations of a family would be destroyed if caught defecting, as well as having the defector being executed on-site. The number of North Korean defectors has dramatically decreased as a result.|$|R
