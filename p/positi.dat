40|$|Yeast {{mitochondrial}} ATP synthase is a multisubunit complex {{composed of}} at least 17 different subunits. Subunit 8 of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase is a hydrophobic protein of 48 amino acids encoded by themitochondrial ATP 8 gene. Although ATP synthase from eukaryotes and prokaryotes shows a similar basic structure, no homologue of subunit 8 is found in prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli. Subunit 8 has three distinct domains; an N-terminal domain, a central hydrophobic domain and a C-terminal domain. In order to elucidate its structureand function, a set of nuclear genes encoding subunit 8 variants was designed to incorporate a FLAG tag at the C-terminus and a mitochondrial signal peptide at the N-terminus. Each gene was cloned into a yeast expression vector and then allotopically expressed in a yeast strain lacking endogenous subunit 8. Structural and functionalanalysis showed that the hydrophobic character of the central hydrophobic domain of subunit 8 is critical for the ATP synthase function. Subunit 8 is sensitive to charge manipulation at the C-terminus. The <b>positi...</b>|$|E

The National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) was used to obtain a longitudinal subsample of 582 first-married couples, as well as the wide range of variables necessary to explore this broader context of paternal influence. Three research questions guided the study: (I) What is the unique contribution of positive paternal involvement-with respect to positive maternal involvement and marital quality- in child ren 2 ̆ 7 s development? (2) How does the influence of positive paternal involvement interact with the influence of positive maternal involvement and marital quality to influence children 2 ̆ 7 s development? (3) To what degree do fathers indirectly influence their children via the marital relationship and the mother-child relationship? Analysis demonstrated little evidence of fathers 2 ̆ 7 unique contribution to children 2 ̆ 7 s aggressive/anti social behavior, school problems, and other outcomes. Similarly, analysis demonstrated no indirect effects for paternal involvement across the 4 - 5 years span between Wave I and Wave 2 of the NSFH. Specifically, fathers 2 ̆ 7 involvement did not indirectly affect children 2 ̆ 7 s outcomes via either the marital relationship or maternal involvement. However, limitations relating to internal reliability rendered findings questionable. Analysis also demonstrated a limited pattern of interaction effects between paternal involvement measures and marital and maternal variables.

The present study aimed to elucidate whether differential interpretation of the external feedback signal influences the time to task failure of a sustained submaximal contraction and modulates motor cortical activity. In Experiment 1, subjects had to maintain a submaximal contraction (30 % of maximum force) performed with their thumb and index finger. Half of the tested subjects were always provided with feedback about joint position (pF-group), whereas {{the other half of the}} subjects were always provided with feedback about force (fF-group). Subjects in the pF-group were led to belief in half of their trials that they would receive feedback about the applied force, and subjects in the fF-group to receive feedback about the position. In both groups (fF and pF), the time to task failure was increased when subjects thought to receive feedback about the force. In Experiment 2, subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the right motor cortex and revealed an increased motor cortical activity when subjects thought to receive feedback about the joint position.
