The most {{destructive}} flood on Nescopeck Creek occurred in 1850, when a dam on the creek was breached, killing 22 people. From 1858 to 1870 there was a tannery on Nescopeck Creek. In 1828, plans for a canal in Nescopeck Creek were made. In 1885, a number of French Indian artifacts, which were <b>Plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> casts for making sculptures, were discovered along Nescopeck Creek in Dennison Township.|$|E
5|$|The helmet was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth held together with <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris.</b> It {{was taken to the}} British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E
50|$|In Paris, Russell met Stanton Macdonald-Wright, {{a fellow}} expatriate, in 1911, {{and soon after}} the two began {{developing}} theories about color and its primacy {{in the creation of}} a meaningful work of art. Like other young adventurous artists of the time, they had come to view academic realism as a dead-end and were pondering the possibilities of an art form that might minimize or even abandon representational content. They were particularly interested in the theories of their teacher, Canadian painter Percyval Tudor-Hart, who believed that colors could be orchestrated in the same harmonious way that a composer arranges notes in a symphony. Inspired by their experience of Delacroix, the Post-Impressionists, and the Fauves, Russell and Macdonald-Wright co-founded Synchromism in 1912. In June of the same year, they held their first Synchromist exhibition at Der Neue Kunstsalon in Munich, followed four months later by another exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Like other young modernists eager to make a name for themselves, they issued a manifesto broadcasting their goals, <b>plastered</b> the kiosks <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> with notices <b>of</b> their show, and hoped to create a sensation. Russell also began exhibiting at the Salon des Indépendants in 1913.|$|R

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris,</b> to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|To {{design the}} armour used by Charan {{in his role}} as Kalabhairava, art {{director}} R. Ravinder wanted the precise measurements of Charan's body; they used <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> to make a mould of Charan's body shape from which they created a statue. They designed costumes for the statue and had Charan try them on once they were satisfied with the designs. In an interview with Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com, the film's stylist, Rama Rajamouli, said that it took one month to develop the right look for the olden period before she began working on the materials and costumes for the film. She added that all of the film's costumes were designed by her and stitched in Hyderabad, and that Kajal's costumes were heavily detailed as she needed to look rich, elegant and bright. Rajamouli had some disagreements with cinematographer K. K. Senthil Kumar over the colours of the costumes. Her decision of having Kajal wear a dress of baby pink and pista green during the war sequence at Bhairavakona was initially opposed by Rajamouli, but later agreed to after the director saw the final edit. She also used minimal jewellery for the princess's outfits.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{bandages}} were {{an improvement}} over Larrey’s method, they were far from ideal. They required {{a long time to}} apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (<b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris)</b> was moulded around the patient’s leg to cause immobilization. If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box which was then filled with moist sand. The substitution of <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> for the sand was the next logical step. Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome.|$|E

25|$|The main use {{of calcium}} sulfate {{is to produce}} <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> and stucco.

The NCC improved Gassner's model by replacing the <b>plaster</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> with coiled cardboard, an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble.
