40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} <b>Pegaspargase</b> instead of L-asparaginase to treat children with advanced-stage lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) on the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) - 95 protocol. Methods: Fifty-four newly diagnosed patients with stage III or IV LBL and without any treatment were enrolled in this study. <b>Pegaspargase</b> took place of L-asparaginase in BFM- 95. The complications and treatment responses of patients treated on the BFM- 95 protocol and modified BFM- 95 protocol were then evaluated respectively. Findings: For LBL patients treated with BFM- 95 protocol or modified BFM- 95 protocol, the complete response, event-free survival, overall survival were similar. Stage 4 myelosuppression {{was the most common}} complication in both groups. Besides that, among 31 patients receiving modified BFM- 95 protocol, coagulation defects were the most common complication.

40|$|CALGB 9511 used <b>pegaspargase</b> (PEG-ASP) {{in lieu of}} {{the native}} enzyme. The aim was to compare {{differences}} in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between patients who did and did not achieve asparagine depletion, defined by enzyme levels greater than 0. 03 U/mL plasma for 14 consecutive days after at least 1 of 4 planned PEG-ASP administrations. Samples were available from 85 eligible patients. On univariate analyses, the 22 patients who did not achieve asparagine depletion had inferior OS (P =. 002; hazard ratio [HR] = 2. 37; 95 % CI = 1. 38 - 4. 09) and DFS (P =. 012; HR = 2. 21; 95 % CI = 1. 19 - 4. 13). After adjusting for age, performance status, leukocyte count, and karyotype in a proportional hazards model, both the OS and DFS HRs decreased to 1. 8 (P =. 056; 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 3. 2 and P =. 084; 95 % CI = 0. 9 - 3. 6, respectively).

40|$|Jamie Koprivnikar, James McCloskey, Stefan Faderl Division of Leukemia, John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA Abstract: Adults {{with acute}} lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) {{are known to}} have {{inferior}} outcomes compared to the pediatric population. Although the reasons for this are likely manyfold, the agents utilized and the increased intensity of pediatric treatments compared to adult treatments are likely significant contributing factors. Asparaginase, an enzyme that converts asparagine to aspartic acid, forms the backbone of almost all pediatric regimens and works by depleting extracellular asparagine, which ALL cells are unable to synthesize. Asparaginase toxicities, which include hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, liver dysfunction, and thrombosis, have hindered its widespread use in the adult population. Here, we review the toxicity and efficacy of asparaginase in adult patients with ALL. With the proper precautions, it is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of younger adults with ALL with response rates in the frontline setting ranging from 78 % to 96 %, compared to most trials showing a 4 -year overall survival of 50 % or better. The age cutoff for consideration of treatment with pediatric-inspired regimens is not clear, but recent studies show promise particularly in the adolescent and young adult population. New formulations of asparaginase are actively in development, including erythrocyte-encapsulated asparaginase, which is designed to minimize the toxicity and improve the delivery of the drug.

40|$|Background: A phase II {{study of}} methotrexate, etoposide, dexamethasone, and <b>pegaspargase</b> (MESA) {{sandwiched}} with radiotherapy for newly diagnosed, stage IE-IIE extranodal natural-killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type (ENKTL) {{was conducted to}} explore its clinical efficacy and safety, as well as novel serum biomarkers upon anti-metabolic treatment. Methods: Four cycles of MESA sandwiched with radiotherapy were administered. The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). Serum metabolomic profiles were assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, with specific metabolites quantified by targeted metabolic analysis. Findings: Forty patients were enrolled and the ORR was 92. 1 % (95 %CI, 83. 1 %– 100. 0 %). The 2 -year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 89. 1 % and overall survival (OS) rate was 92. 0 %. Grade 3 / 4 non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities were observed in 17 (42. 5 %) and 26 patients (65 · 0 %) during chemotherapy, and in 9 (22. 5 %) and 0 (0. 0 %) patients during radiotherapy, respectively. Fifty-six significantly decreased and 59 increased metabolites were identified in ENKTL, as compared to healthy volunteers. A predictive principal components analysis model of asparaginase-associated metabolites, asparaginase-associated metabolic score (AspM), was established, including alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and succinic acid. Patients with high AspM score displayed superior survival and prognostic significance of AspM was validated in a historical cohort of early and advanced-stage ENKTL treated with asparaginase-based regimens. Multivariate analysis confirmed AspM as a prognostic score independent of PINK and PINK combined with Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Interpretation: MESA sandwiched with radiotherapy is an effective and safe regimen for early-stage ENKTL. AspM score may be a promising prognostic index of serum metabolites in addition to clinical prognostic index in ENKTL...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG] to therapeutic proteins produces several benefits, including enhanced plasma half-life, lower toxicity, {{and increased}} drug stability and solubility. In certain instances, pegylation of a protein can increase its therapeutic efficacy {{by reducing the}} ability of the immune system to detect and mount an attack on the compound. A PEG-protein conjugate is formed by first activating the PEG moiety so that it will react with, and couple to, the protein. PEG moieties vary considerably in molecular weight and conformation, with the early moieties (monofunctional PEGs; mPEGs) being linear with molecular weights of 12 kD or less, and later moieties being of increased molecular weights. PEG 2, a recent innovation in PEG technology, involves the coupling of a 30 kD (or less) mPEG to lysine that is further reacted to form a branched structure that behaves like a linear mPEG of much larger molecular weight. These compounds are pH and temperature stable, and this factor along with the large molecular weight may account for the restricted volume of distribution seen with drugs utilising these reagents. Three PEG-protein conjugates are currently approved for clinical use in the US, with more under clinical development. Pegademase is used in the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, <b>pegaspargase</b> for the treatment of various leukaemias, and pegylated interferon-α for chronic hepatitis C virus infections. As illustrated {{in the case of the}} 2 pegylated interferon-αs, all pegylated proteins are not equal. The choice of PEG reagent and coupling chemistry is critical to the properties of the PEG-protein conjugate, with the molecular weight of the moiety affecting its rate and route of clearance from the body, and coupling chemistry affecting the strength of the covalent attachment of PEG to therapeutic protein...|$|E

Comparative studies of SC versus IV, IM versus IV, or IM versus SC have been sporadically conducted, and some new findings are completely different from the dosage recommendation as described in prescribing information. However, clinicians may still be ignorant of such new evidence-based findings when choosing treatment methods. Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Sciences™ Core Collection to analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of SC, IV, and IM administration in head-to-head comparative studies. Results: “SC better than IV” involves trastuzumab, rituximab, antitumor necrosis factor medications, bortezomib, amifostine, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, recombinant interleukin- 2, immunoglobulin, epoetin alfa, heparin, and opioids. “IV better than SC” involves ketamine, vitamin K 1, and abatacept. With respect to insulin and ketamine, whether IV has advantages over SC is determined by specific clinical circumstances. “IM better than IV” involves epinephrine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, <b>pegaspargase,</b> and some antibiotics. “IV better than IM” involves ketamine, morphine, and antivenom. “IM better than SC” involves epinephrine. “SC better than IM” involves interferon-beta- 1 a, methotrexate, human chorionic gonadotropin, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, hydrocortisone, and morphine. Safety, efficacy, patient preference, and pharmacoeconomics are four principles governing the choice of injection route. Safety and efficacy must be the preferred principles to be considered (eg, epinephrine should be given intramuscularly during an episode of systemic anaphylaxis). If the safety and efficacy of two injection routes are equivalent, clinicians should consider more about patient preference and pharmacoeconomics because patient preference will ensure optimal treatment adherence and ultimately improve patient experience or satisfaction, while pharmacoeconomic concern will help alleviate nurse shortages and reduce overall health care costs. Besides the principles, the following detailed factors might affect the decision: patient characteristics-related factors (body mass index, age, sex, medical status [eg, renal impairment, comorbidities], personal attitudes toward safety and convenience, past experience, perception of current disease status, health literacy, and socioeconomic status), medication administration-related factors (anatomical site of injection, dose, frequency, formulation characteristics, administration time, indication, flexibility in the route of administration), and health care staff/institution-related factors (knowledge, human resources). Conclusion: This updated review of findings of comparative studies of different injection routes will enrich the knowledge of safe, efficacious, economic, and patient preference-oriented medication administration as well as catching research opportunities in clinical nursing practice.
