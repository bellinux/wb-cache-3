Each product's packaging included a tongue-in-cheek commentary about the product itself. Alex Bogusky, partner and executive creative director of CP+B, stated that BK decided [...] "to create {{a dialogue with the}} consumer" [...] by utilizing the large areas of white space found on its packaging at the time. All of its sandwich wrappers, cartons, tray liners, bags, breakfast platters, chili cups, condiments, and regional product packaging received what was described as [...] "quirky ad copy" [...] specifically targeting the 18–34-year-old male demographic segment. Besides the humorous commentary, the company also created sniglet-type names for things that would appear in its products, such as a [...] "ringer" [...] – a single onion ring that had been accidentally included in an order of fries.|$|E

40|$|Retrovirus vectors {{can be made}} in {{the absence}} of helper virus by using {{retrovirus}} <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Helper-free virus is critical for a variety of gene transfer studies. The most useful <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> contain helper virus DNA from which the signal required for packaging of the viral RNA genome into virions has been deleted. However, we showed that the ability to package virus is conferred at very low frequency to cells infected with virus from these <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines,</b> presumably by low-frequency transmission of the deleted virus genome. In addition, these <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> can interact with some retroviral vectors to yield replication-competent virus. We constructed <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> containing helper virus DNA that had several alterations in addition to deletion of the packaging signal. The new packaging cells retained the useful features of previously available lines but did not yield helper virus after introduction of any of the vectors tested, and transfer of the packaging function was not detected...|$|R

40|$|Foamy viruses are nonpathogenic retroviruses {{that offer}} several unique {{opportunities}} for gene transfer in various cell types from different species. We have previously demonstrated {{the utility of}} simian foamy virus type 1 (SFV- 1) as a vector system by transient expression assay (M. Wu et al., J. Virol. 72 : 3451 – 3454, 1998). In this report, we describe the first stable <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> for foamy virus vectors based on SFV- 1. We developed two <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> in which the helper DNA is placed {{under the control of}} either a constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early gene or inducible tetracycline promoter for expression. Although the constitutive <b>packaging</b> expressing cell <b>line</b> had a higher copy number of packaging DNA, the inducible <b>packaging</b> cell <b>line</b> produced four times more vector particles. This result suggested that the structural gene products in the constitutively expressing <b>packaging</b> cell <b>line</b> were expressed at a level that is not toxic to the cells, and thus vector production was reduced. The SFV- 1 vector in the presence of vesicular stomatitis virus envelope protein G (VSV-G) produced an insignificant level of transduction, indicating that foamy viruses could not be pseudotyped with VSV-G to generate high-titer vectors. The availability of stable <b>packaging</b> cell <b>lines</b> represents a step toward the use of an SFV- 1 vector delivery system that will allow scaled-up production of vector stocks for gene therapy...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} industry, {{homogeneous}} products {{have to be}} packed. For an unpacked product (milk, paint), a variety of packaging materials (glass, tin) and packaging sizes (1 / 2 litre, 1 kilo) are available. Generally, the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines</b> are used for various products (milk, buttermilk) in one type of packaging material (glass) and various packaging sizes (1 / 2 litre, 1 litre). These possibilities make the scheduling of the <b>packaging</b> <b>lines</b> rather complex. In recent years, under market pressure, the number of products in the process industry has been increased, the order sizes have been reduced, and the delivery times have been shortened. This has caused augmented scheduling tasks and, usually, the scheduling systems supporting these tasks have not followed these changes sufficiently. We have investigated and compared {{the origins of the}} increasing complexity of the scheduling problems of several companies in the process industry producing dairy products, pharmaceutical products, tobacco, paint, chocolate products, and foods, and we have analyzed the ways in which these companies deal with this increasing complexity in different situations. Schedulers have to deal {{with a wide range of}} information such as due dates, availability of material, sequence-dependent set-up times, and availability of <b>packaging</b> <b>lines</b> and employees. In most cases the scheduling is still done by hand, which is very time-consuming. We show the need for a more adequate support system which will provide necessary information, and speed up the development and evaluation of production schedules. We also discuss future trends with regard to the packaging process, and their likely effect on the scheduling process...|$|R
