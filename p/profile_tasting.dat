The taste-masked drug is formulated in to a conventional tablet by direct compression method for ease of administration. Taste masking was done by solid dispersion using polymer such as urea and mannitol by melting/fusion method Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to identify the physicochemical interaction between drug and carrier, hence its effect on dissolution. Conventional taste masked tablets were evaluated for weight variation, disintegration time, hardness and friability. In vitro drug release studies were performed for conventional tablets of drotoverine. Bitterness score was evaluated on volunteers. FTIR spectroscopy and SEM showed no interaction between drug and carriers. Conventional tablets prepared using solid dispersion, showed faster disintegration and complete bitter taste masking of drotoverine. In addition the prepared tablets exhibited better dissolution <b>profile.</b> <b>Taste</b> evaluation of taste masked tablets in human volunteers rated tasteless with a score of 0.

40|$|Grape juices {{represent}} one of {{the most}} consumed fruit juices because of its sensory properties, availability, reasonable price, and more recently because of their functional properties demonstrated by a vast number of in vitro, in vivo, clinical, and epidemiological studies. Although grape juices have been the target of a high number of studies, it is still not fully known how geographical origin and production management system, affect the chemical profile, quality traits related to flavor, and in vitro antioxidant of grape juices. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study is to}} elucidate the reflectance of origin (botanical, geographical, production system) in the unique compositional traits of juices from different botanical origins, with emphasis on purple grape juices. Subsequently, chemometric methods were used to try to authenticate the origin of grape juice based on the grape juice’s quality traits. Results showed that it was possible to note that the instrumental <b>taste</b> <b>profile,</b> chemical composition related to phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity of juices from distinct botanical origins differ considerably. More specifically, pomegranate and elderberry juices presented the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity, implying that the botanical origin of juices affected remarkably their unique instrumental <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> and physicochemical parameters, phenolic composition, and in vitro antioxidant activity. The production managements systems, (organic/biodynamic, ORG/BIO, versus conventional, CONV) is influencing the volatile organic composition (VOC) profiles, some phenolic compounds and copper chelating activity. It is not affecting the instrumental <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> nor the in vitro antioxidant activity results. ORG and BIO purple grape juices can be differentiated by their VOC profiles but not by the other characteristics studied.   More specifically, CONV juices had higher mean levels for all ions compared to ORG and BIO juices. More specifically, in fact, BIO juices presented the lowest mean values for almost all ions measured. When European grape juices were studied, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between ORG, BIO, and CONV juices was observed for instrumental richness, umami, saltiness, sourness, astringency, bitterness, total phenolic content, total soluble solids, pH, ortho-diphenols, copper chelating activity, and ferric reducing antioxidant activity. For the Brazilian samples, the contents of chlorogenic acid and myricetin were statistically higher in ORG juices, while the in vitro antioxidant activity measured by three assays (DPPH, CUPRAC, and  iron chelating ability) were not different between production management systems. For the European juices, some differences were observed: BIO and ORG juices presented higher contents of (-) -epicatechin, quercetin, (+) -catechin, and myricetin compared to the CONV juices. The VOC <b>profile,</b> instrumental <b>taste</b> parameters, phenolic composition, and in vitro antioxidant activity is highly affected between regions, in which Brazilian juices presented higher ion intensities as compared to the European juices. Brazilian juices, regardless of the production management system adopted, presented higher total phenolic content and flavonoids, total anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, and flavanols, except for trans-resveratrol, malvidin- 3 -glucoside and pelargonidin- 3 -glucoside.

Performance of both panels was described by discrimination, repeatability (RMSE), and agreement. Nineteen products with different sensory characteristics were profiled in the Netherlands and Malaysia; subsequently the obtained <b>taste</b> <b>profiles</b> were compared.

Six Belgian tomato cultivars were classified according to similarity in <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> using both multisensor systems. The tomato cultivars were selected based on their difference in sweetness and sourness as perceived by trained sensory panels. The concentration of sugars (glucose and fructose), organic acids (citric acid, malic acid and glutamic acid) and minerals (Na and K) were also determined with reference techniques. Multivariate statistical data analysis techniques as principal components analysis (PCA), canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and partial least squares regression (PLS) were used to classify tomato cultivars according to similarity in <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> and to quantitatively relate the taste compounds to the sensory panel scores. Both electronic tongues were very well suited to classify tomato cultivars based on their <b>taste</b> <b>profile.</b> To quantify individual sugars, acids and minerals in a complex mixture the system which was developed at the University of Saint-Petersburg was highly appropriate, but this system could not predict general sweetness and umami taste as evaluated by the sensory panel.

However, the role of taste in acceptance of new foods, in particular in the first months of complementary feeding, is not fully understood and was the aim of the present study. Infants had to be in good health to participate (N= 74). First, the infants' reactions to new foods were recorded by their parents between the ages of 5 and 7 months using a 4 -point-scale ranging from very negative to very positive. Taste intensities of infant foods were scored by a trained panel and foods were clustered into groups showing similar <b>taste</b> <b>profiles.</b> Infants' reactions were used to calculate new food acceptance (NFA) defined as the average reaction towards a group of foods showing a similar <b>taste</b> <b>profile.</b> Second, preferences for the five basic tastes over water were measured using a 4 -bottle test at 6 months old comparing intake of tastant solutions to water. Taste acceptance was evaluated through ingestion ratio (IR=intake of tastant solutions/intake of tastant solutions and water). NFAs were compared across food groups. Kendall correlations were calculated between NFA and IR. Most reactions (88 %) to new foods were positive. However, NFA varied according to the <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> of the foods: vegetables in which salt or a salty ingredient was added were more accepted than plain vegetables (P< 0. 01). On average no rejection of basic tastes was observed. For sweet, sour and umami tastes, significant positive correlations were observed between NFA and IR. Healthy foods like vegetables could be easily introduced in the diet of most, but not all infants.

40|$|Sodium {{content in}} human diet being {{excessive}} in many industrialized country, health authorities recommended its progressive reduction in food products in order both to improve {{public health and}} to decrease health cost (1). Cheese {{is one of the}} most important sodium vectors. However, salt (NaCl) is not only responsible for saltiness but is also implied in other functionalities such as flavour enhancement, texture, preservation (2). Keeping a good acceptability of food by the consumer at lower sodium chloride concentration is a real challenge for cheese industry to avoid negative consequences. To reach this goal, it is necessary to understand the role of cheese structure and composition on the release and perception of salt. The objective of this study is to determine to what extent cheese composition and texture influence the release of sodium and the saltiness perception during eating, taking into account the oral behaviour of consumers. Semi-hard cheeses varying in composition (Fat in dry matter, water content in defatted cheese, calcium in defatted dry matter, salt content) were made according to an experimental design. The cheeses were characterized by a conventional sensory <b>profile</b> (<b>taste,</b> texture and global aroma intensity), composition parameters and rheological properties (uniaxial compression at constant displacement rate). Then, both temporal sodium release and temporal saltiness intensities were simultaneously evaluated for each cheese. Important differences were observed between cheeses for both rheological properties and sensory characteristics in term of saltiness and texture. Several significant effects were observed on the increasing phase and at the maximum of the sodium release and on saltiness time intensity curves according to cheese composition / texture. For example, the in-mouth maximum concentration of sodium and the maximum saltiness intensity decreased when fat content increased.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2016. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Devin Peterson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 139 pages. Despite the increasing demand, healthier foods suffer from lower consumer acceptability due to inferior flavor quality. The flavor of food is greatly {{affected by the}} food composition and thermal processing. This study specifically investigates the thermal processing impact on {{the positive and negative}} taste attributes of foodstuffs, which enables the optimization of processing strategies to improve the palatability and ultimately the consumption of ‘healthier’ formulated food products. The overall goal of this work was to characterize the effect of thermal processing on the taste-active compounds or the generation of taste modulating compounds in foodstuffs. This work mainly focuses on the influence of three common thermal processing techniques on the resulting <b>taste</b> <b>profiles</b> in three food systems respectively: the roasting of cocoa, the extrusion of corn cereal, and the frying of potato chips. These three processing techniques are widely utilized by the food industry. Bitterness was investigated in roasted cocoa and extruded whole grain corn while umami was characterized in deep fried potato chips. The influence of roasting on the taste attributes of cocoa was studied first. Roasting processes involve the Maillard reaction, which is a ubiquitous thermally catalyzed chemical pathway that is well-known to impact aroma development as well as taste, such as bitterness. Bitterness is a challenge for consumer acceptability, which is typically masked by adding sugar. The goal of this part of the research was to discover the impact of Maillard chemistry on endogenous bitter-tasting compound, catechin, in raw cocoa, and likewise on the resulting bitter <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> of the roasted beans. Catechin-Maillard reaction products were identified by stable isotope labeling techniques in model reactions using the simulated cocoa roasting conditions. Eight reaction products were identified and reported for the first time. One of the newly-identified compounds significantly suppressed the perceived bitter intensity of the caffeine solution, which is a novel bitter blocker. Further analysis revealed that this bitter blocking compound was present in both the raw and roasted cocoa beans; however its concentration was higher in roasted cocoa beans. A generation mechanism of the bitter blocker was proposed. The results of the first phase indicated that the bitter profile of cocoa beans was altered by thermal reactions of the endogenous bitter compounds. In the second research phase of this study, the influence of extrusion on the <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> of puffed whole grain corn products was examined. The goal of this phase is to identify the key bitter compounds and understand how they are influenced by extrusion. Three phenolic compounds (chaenorpine, coumaryl-spermidine, terrestribisamide) and one amino acid (L-tryptophan) were identified as the main bitter compounds in the extruded whole grain corn product. Based on sensory recombination analysis, chaenorpine was found to have the highest contribution to the bitterness intensity, based on the concentration of the bitter compounds reported in the saliva during mastication. Additionally, all of the identified bitter compounds were found to be degraded during extrusion, suggesting that the further optimization of extrusion could be utilized to suppress bitterness in order to improve the flavor quality of whole grain extruded products. In the last phase of this research project, the role of the thermal process, deep frying, on the <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> of potato chips was examined. Potato chips are a highly desired food product and the umami taste is well known to positively contribute to the <b>taste</b> <b>profile.</b> Initial analysis indicated that the umami taste attribute of potato chips increases with frying time thus the compounds that contribute to umami were characterized. A dehydration product of monosodium glutamate (MSG), monosodium L-pyroglutamate (L-MSpG) and monosodium D-pyroglutamate (D-MSpG) were identified {{for the first time as}} umami enhancing compounds that contributed to the umami flavor of potato chips. The generation of pyroglutamates was reported to be directly related to the frying time. Sensory time-intensity taste analysis of potato chips with topical added L-MSpG and D-MSpG revealed significantly higher umami intensity and the overall higher potato chip flavor intensity. In summary, the impact of three thermal processes on <b>taste</b> <b>profile</b> was studied in three different food products. This study provides a novel basis for flavor optimization by investigating the thermal impact on taste chemistry. The ultimate goal of this study is to increase the market demand for health conscious foods, thus benefiting the food industry as well as promoting a healthy lifestyle...|$|R

In contrast, the IXth nerve innervating the posterior part of the tongue has almost exclusively the AI type.
