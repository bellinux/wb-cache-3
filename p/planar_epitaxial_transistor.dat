40|$|The {{selective}} CdTe Nanohetero-Epitaxy {{growth on}} Si(100) substrates {{has been achieved}} {{without the use of}} a mask in an attempt to reduce the dislocation density at the CdTe/Si interface to 105 /cm 3 using the Close-Space Sublimation (CSS) technique, which is a low-cost effective technique for the deposition of polycrystalline CdTe films. Furthermore, CdTe is a compound semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 1. 5 eV, which makes it an ideal material for the applications of infrared detectors and solar cells. It has been demonstrated that the selective growth of CdTe on patterned Si(100) substrates results in CdTe grains with smooth surfaces. For this reason, these high quality grains may be used for the subsequent growth of planar MBE CdTe followed by HgCdTe for the applications of Long-Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) detectors and Middle-Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) detectors. Several techniques have been used for the epitaxial growth of CdTe on Si, such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE), Hot-Well Epitaxy (HWE) and Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE); however, these techniques are expensive and have low growth rates. For this reason, special interest has been given to the CSS technique for the growth of CdTe such as its low-cost and higher growth rates (3 ̆e 1 μm/h). ^ In this study, the first set of experiments consisted of the <b>planar</b> <b>epitaxial</b> growth of CdTe on CdTe(111) substrates, resulting in average growth rates between 5 – 10 μm/hr. The film with the most promising film morphology resulted from growth parameters, where Tsou = 530 °C and Tsub = 350 °C. The second set of experiments consisted of the <b>planar</b> <b>epitaxial</b> growth of CdTe on Si(100) substrates, resulting in average growth rates between 6 – 10 μm/hr. The same parameters used to produce the highest quality CdTe films on CdTe(111) were found to be optimum for Si(100) as well. The third set of experiments consisted of the selective epitaxial growth of CdTe on patterned Si(100) substrates, where CdTe selectively was achieved for all substrate and source temperatures analyzed without using a mask. This has never been observed before for CdTe deposited on patterned Si. Characterization methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to observe CdTe film and grain morphology and to analyze the structure and quality of the planar CdTe films. As a result, the characterization of these films confirmed that CSS can be an effective and low-cost technique for the <b>planar</b> and selective <b>epitaxial</b> growth of CdTe films. ...|$|R

Several materials and designs are under investigation in order to build a detector that can withstand such high fluences.

40|$|Successes in {{the growth}} and {{fabrication}} of semiconductor nanowires, have led to new opportunities in device design {{for a wide variety}} of applications. Nanowires provide unique opportunities in device engineering in that their properties can be manipulated and tailored at the time of their creation to meet specific functional applications. Such nanowire devices can then be harvested to serve as building blocks for larger integrated systems. This is typically referred to as the "bottom-up" approach and adds a degree of flexibility not available in planner device fabrication. In this dissertation we will exam on a few specific aspects of semiconductor device and system engineering. Specifically we examine the geometric limits for coherence in radial nanowire heterostructures as well as the use of electric fields to align and place nanowires. Novel nanowire device designs often require, or can benefit from, the use of heterostructures in their design. In determining the feasibility of these designs it is necessary to consider the strain that arises in heterostructures due to the lattice mismatch between materials. Such strain not only affects the electronic and optical properties of the device, but also determines the device dimensions at which coherence is lost and dislocations form, which will significantly alter or degrade device performance. In the second chapter of this dissertation we present a methodology to predict critical dimensions for coherently strained coaxial nanowire heterostructures based on a well-known formalism used to determine the critical thickness in <b>planar</b> <b>epitaxial</b> growth. It is anticipated that this model will serve as a guide to determine the feasibility of specific coherently strained nanowire heterostructure device designs.

Manipulating and placing nanowires in a useful fashion continues to be a considerable challenge.

DEP refers to the use of electric fields to manipulate neutrally charged particles in solution and can be used to attract nanowires (suspended in solution) onto predefined electrodes.
