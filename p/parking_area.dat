5|$|Upper Pine Bottom State Park {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} state parks in Pennsylvania, and is maintained by staff from nearby Little Pine State Park. In addition to picnics, its chief use is as a <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> for local hunters, anglers, hikers, cross-country skiers, snowmobilers, and all-terrain vehicle riders. Upper Pine Bottom Run is state-approved and stocked for trout fishing in season. Second-growth forest now covers the region; the surrounding state forest and park are home to a variety of flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E

5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to <b>Parking</b> <b>Area</b> C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, and only when it is properly aligned will the train's doors open. This enables the AirTrain to use automatic train operation without drivers.|$|E
5|$|The National Press Monument {{is located}} at 59 Gajah Mada Street in Surakarta, Central Java, {{at the corner of}} Gajah Mada and Yosodipuro Streets. It is west of Mangkunegaran Palace. The complex {{consists}} of the original Sasana Soeka building, two two-story buildings, as well as a four-story building; these additions were constructed much later. At the front of the museum is a <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> and two public boards where the latest editions of local newspapers (in 2013, Solo Pos, Suara Merdeka, and Republika) can be read freely. The front façade is decorated with a naga design symbolising the year 1980, the year in which construction was completed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Open green <b>areas</b> and <b>parks</b> {{function}} as the green lungs of urban ecosystems. Since open areas are rarely found in cities, parks are the main recreational areas and the green cells of urban ecosystem. Each city has its own urban ecosystem and structural units and green area patterns vary from city to city. A <b>park</b> <b>area</b> preserves nature, social life and recreation, play for children and rest for urban people. From the point of landscape architects, some differences are observed in different areas within each city. Wrong land use, misallocated <b>park</b> <b>areas</b> for different purposes, narrowing or removing the <b>park</b> <b>areas</b> due to building pressure etc. create problems in unplanned urbanizing cities in Turkey. The current study focused on the question how we can develop park networks in built environment.

5|$|While at the discothèque, De Simone and Savage were {{together}} throughout the evening, and DeSimone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage drove DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> and that they sat chatting {{for a while before}} DeSimone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and drove away from the scene. Savage was the last witness to see DeSimone before she was killed.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends down the {{mountain}} toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to {{the face of the}} bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin turns, the first of which has a scenic overlook and <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's <b>parking</b> <b>area,</b> injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E

5|$|Five miles (8km) past West Shokan, NY28A intersects Monument Road, {{which used}} to connect to the reservoir's {{spillway}} and the road above the reservoir, which is closed to automobile traffic. The junction has {{been converted into a}} small <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> A quarter-mile (0.4km) further on is the western terminus of NY213, the only other state route that NY28A intersects aside from its parent. Although NY213 is an east–west route, it actually heads due south from this junction to the nearby hamlet of Olivebridge on its way to Stone Ridge and High Falls. Continuing east, NY28A descends to cross Esopus Creek again before climbing back up to the city's watershed visitor center. Across from the center is Beaverkill Road, a local highway leading southeastward to SUNY New Paltz's outdoor environmental education center and Ashokan Bridge, a covered bridge over Esopus Creek, located on Ashokan Road.|$|E
5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} out around the house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed on {{the north and south}} sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected near the house, and the area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was ploughed up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at Risk Register as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised by recent developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Using two {{different}} measures of <b>park</b> <b>area,</b> at three buffer distances, {{we sought to}} investigate {{the ways in which}} <b>park</b> <b>area</b> and proximity to parks, are related to the frequency of walking (for all purposes) in Australian adults. Little previous research has been conducted in this area, and results of existing research have been mixed. Methods Residents of 50 urban areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia completed a physical activity survey (n = 2305). Respondents reported how often they walked for ≥ 10 minutes in the previous month. Walking frequency was dichotomised to ‘less than weekly’ (less than 1 /week) and ‘at least weekly’ (1 /week or more). Using Geographic Information Systems, Euclidean buffers were created around each respondent’s home at three distances: 400 metres (m), 800 m and 1200 m. Total area of parkland in each person’s buffer was calculated for the three buffers. Additionally, total area of ‘larger parks’, (park space[*]≥[*]park with Australian Rules Football oval (17, 862 m 2)), was calculated for each set of buffers. <b>Area</b> of <b>park</b> was categorised into tertiles for <b>area</b> of all <b>parks,</b> and <b>area</b> of larger <b>parks</b> (the lowest tertile was used as the reference category). Multilevel logistic regression, with individuals nested within areas, was used to estimate the effect of area of parkland on walking frequency. Results No statistically significant associations were found between walking frequency and <b>park</b> <b>area</b> (total and large parks) within 400 m of respondent’s homes. For total <b>park</b> <b>area</b> within 800 m, the odds of walking at least weekly were lower for those in the mid (OR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 46 - 0. 91) and highest (OR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 44 - 0. 95) tertile of <b>park</b> <b>area</b> compared to those living in areas with the least amount of <b>park</b> <b>area.</b> Similar results were observed for total <b>park</b> <b>area</b> in the 1200 m buffers. When only larger parks were investigated, again more frequent walking was less likely when respondents had access to a greater amount of <b>park</b> <b>area.</b> Conclusions In this study we found that more <b>park</b> <b>area</b> in residential environments reduced the odds of walking more frequently. Other area characteristics such as street connectivity and destinations may underlie these associations by negatively correlating with <b>park</b> <b>area.</b> </p...|$|R
