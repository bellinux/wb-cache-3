5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created {{as a result of the}} nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven <b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E

5000|$|Federweisser (also Federweißer , from German Feder, [...] "feather", and weiß, [...] "white"; {{from the}} {{appearance}} of the suspended yeast), is an alcoholic beverage, typically 4 <b>percent</b> alcohol <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> but it's not uncommon to see Federweißer in the region of 10 <b>percent</b> alcohol <b>by</b> <b>volume.</b> It is the product of fermented freshly pressed grape juice, known as must.

25|$|After obtaining {{an alcohol}} content {{of at least}} 12 <b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> the mead {{undergoes}} racking prior to ageing. Leaving the pitched wort on the lees beyond the still fermentation period would adversely affect the mead's organoleptic properties because of yeast autolysis. Ageing (maturing) and siphoning (decantation) is repeated as necessary to prevent unwanted processes from {{taking place in the}} lees. During ageing, it is possible to carry out pasteurisation and filtration. This stage is essential for ensuring that the product has the right organoleptic properties.|$|E
2500|$|Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for {{producing}} fuel oil and gasoline, both important [...] "primary energy" [...] sources. 84 <b>percent</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other fuel oils, and liquefied petroleum gas. The lighter grades {{of crude oil}} produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and medium oil are depleted, oil refineries are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using fluid catalytic cracking to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.|$|E
