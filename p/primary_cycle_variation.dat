40|$|AbstractSpectrum sensing {{is the key}} {{technology}} in cognitive radio for the efficient use of radio spectrum. The implementation of energy detection based spectrum sensing is done with the assumption of constant activity of the primary user. Practically, often the scenario occurs when primary user transmits signal in the frequency band of interest only {{for a fraction of}} the observation period. The paper aims at analyzing the degradation in performance of energy detection based sensors in the case of generalized κ-μ and α-μ fading channels. The theoretical results indicate low reliable performance in the case of fading channel due to <b>primary</b> user duty <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> at low signal-to-noise ratios...|$|R

30|$|As far as ionospheric {{response}} to the solar rotation variation of EUV is concerned, some studies revealed that ionospheric variations are usually most correlated with the EUV variations of previous days or hours, i.e., there are time lags (e.g., Coley and Heelis 2012; Min et al. 2009; Rich et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2006). The thermosphere is {{the background of the}} ionosphere; its variations significantly affect ionospheric variability. The time lags were found to also exist in thermospheric responses to the changes of the solar irradiance (e.g., Buonsanto and Pohlman 1998; Eastes et al. 2004; Jakowski et al. 1991). Some studies suggested that the lags of the ionosphere to the solar irradiance are possibly related to the lags of the thermosphere to the solar irradiance (e.g., Min et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2006). The solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of solar irradiance also significantly modulates the thermosphere (e.g., Emmert et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2005; Solomon et al. 2010, 2011), which should affect the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of the ionosphere. Thus, it is essential to investigate whether the response of the ionosphere to the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of EUV has evident time lags.|$|R
40|$|In the heliosheath (HS), Voyager 2 has {{observed}} a flow with constant radial velocity and magnetic flux conservation. Voyager 1, however, {{has observed}} {{a decrease in}} the flow's radial velocity and an order of magnitude decrease in magnetic flux. We investigate the role of the 11 yr solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of the magnetic field strength on the magnetic flux within the HS using a global 3 D magnetohydrodynamic model of the heliosphere. We use time and latitude-dependent solar wind velocity and density inferred from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/SWAN and interplanetary scintillations data and implemented solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variations</b> of the magnetic field derived from 27 day averages of the field magnitude average of the magnetic field at 1 AU from the OMNI database. With the inclusion of the solar cycle time-dependent magnetic field intensity, the model matches the observed intensity of the magnetic field in the HS along both Voyager 1 and 2. This is a significant improvement from the same model without magnetic field solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variations,</b> which was over a factor of two larger. The model accurately predicts the radial velocity observed by Voyager 2; however, the model predicts a flow speed ~ 100 km s[superscript − 1] larger than that derived from LECP measurements at Voyager 1. In the model, magnetic flux is conserved along both Voyager trajectories, contrary to observations. This implies that the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variations</b> in solar wind magnetic field observed at 1 AU does not cause the order of magnitude decrease in magnetic flux observed in the Voyager 1 data.

We study {{the response of the}} interaction region to 11 -year solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variations</b> of the solar wind dynamic pressure. It is shown that the termination shock location varies within ± 7 AU, the heliopause variation is ~ 4 AU, and the bow shock variation is negligible. At large heliocentric distances, the solar cycle induces 10 - 12 % fluctuations in the number density of both primary and secondary interstellar H atoms and atoms created in the inner heliosheath. We underline the kinetic behavior of the fluctuations of the H atom populations.

40|$|Multiple {{regression}} {{methods are}} applied to estimate the solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of (1) zonal mean ozone {{as a function of}} altitude and latitude using a combination of Nimbus 7 solar backscattered ultraviolet (SBUV) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 11 SBUV/ 2 ozone profile data for a 15 -year period; (2) total ozone as a function of latitude, longitude, and season using Nimbus 7 total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) data for a 13. 3 -year period; (3) lower stratospheric temperature as a function of latitude, longitude, and season using microwave sounding unit (MSU) Channel 4 data for a 16 -year period; and (4) lower stratospheric geopotential height as a function of latitude, longitude, and season in the northern hemisphere using Berlin height data for a 30 -year period. According to the SBUV-SBUV/ 2 data, most (about 85 %) of the 1. 5 – 2 % solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of global mean total column ozone occurs in the lower stratosphere (altitudes < 28 km). Evidence is obtained for a related solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of lower stratospheric temperature (50 – 150 mbar) and geopotential height (30, 50, and 100 mbar) with geographic dependences {{similar to that of the}} solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation</b> of total ozone. Specifically, total ozone, lower stratospheric temperature, and lower stratospheric geopotential height have annual mean solar regression coefficients in the northern hemisphere that reach a maximum near 30 °N latitude within a longitude sector extending from approximately 160 °E to 250 °E. Maximum variations from solar minimum to maximum in this sector are approximately 11 Dobson units, 0. 8 K near 100 mbar, and 60 m at 50 mbar, respectively. Seasonal solar regression coefficients tend to be statistically significant over larger areas in summer but have larger amplitudes within limited regions in winter. These geographic similarities between total ozone, lower stratospheric temperature, and geopotential height solar coefficients suggest that changes in lower stratospheric dynamics between solar minimum and maximum may play an important role in driving the observed total ozone solar <b>cycle</b> <b>variation.</b> To test this hypothesis, a simplified perturbation ozone transport model is applied to calculate the expected total ozone variation owing to dynamical forcing for the calculated geopotential height solar coefficients, climatological ozone mixing ratios, and zonal winds. For the summer season during which the solar regression coefficients are significant over the largest area, both the amplitude and latitude dependence of the observed solar <b>cycle</b> ozone <b>variation</b> are approximately consistent with the model estimates...|$|R
