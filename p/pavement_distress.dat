40|$|Abstract. The {{literature}} has identified several possible causes of asphalt <b>pavement</b> <b>distresses.</b> Load‐related distresses are apparent where the pavement has been over‐stressed by traffic loads applied to its surface. Climate/durability‐related distresses arise due to {{exposure to the}} environment. Other‐related distresses are caused by actions not related to load or climate such as fuel spills or construction deficiencies. In this paper, information about fourteen asphalt <b>pavement</b> <b>distresses</b> frequently occurred on Taiwan’s pavements was surveyed, structured and explored using formal concept analysis (FCA) method. FCA is an important mathematical tool for conceptual data analysis and knowledge acquisition. By using FCA, the concept lattice of the formal context of asphalt <b>pavement</b> <b>distresses</b> was created and studied. Based on the concept lattice and association rules derived from FCA, the causes of asphalt <b>pavement</b> <b>distresses</b> were understood.

50|$|As {{roads are}} worn down by tire wear, wheelpath rutting often {{interrupts}} the DG, and water will collect in the wheelpaths. This is more prevalent on asphalt pavement, but concrete pavements are not immune. Before wet pavement crashes reach unacceptable levels, maintenance actions such as resurfacing or diamond grinding should be taken, even if other <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> such as cracking is still low.|$|E
50|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} is an asphalt <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> {{most often}} instigated by {{failure of the}} surface due to traffic loading. However, fatigue cracking can be greatly influenced by environmental and other effects while traffic loading remains the direct cause. Frequently, overloading happens because the base or subbase inadequately support the surface layer and subsequently cannot handle loads that it would normally endure. There are many ways that the subbase or base can be weakened.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{important}} criteria {{to take into}} account when measuring fatigue cracking. The first is the [...] of the cracking. This is the amount of road surface area which is affected by this <b>pavement</b> <b>distress.</b> The second criterion is the severity of the cracking. Severity, which has been discussed above, refers to how far the cracking has progressed, and is often directly a function of crack width. Severity may be rated numerically, or given a rating from [...] "low" [...] to [...] "severe". The rating may be entered into a pavement management system, which will suggest a priority and method for the repair.|$|E
5000|$|More {{severe cases}} involve pumping of fines, spalling, and loose pieces of pavement.

However, currently adopted ground-based evaluation methods for pavement surface conditions have many disadvantages, like being time-consuming and expensive. Aircraft-based evaluation methods, although getting more attention, have not been used for any operational evaluation programs yet because the acquired images lack the spatial resolution to resolve finer scale <b>pavement</b> surface <b>distresses.</b> Hyper-spatial resolution natural color aerial photography (HSR-AP) provides a potential method for collecting <b>pavement</b> surface <b>distress</b> information that can supplement or substitute for currently adopted evaluation methods. Using roadway pavement sections located in the State of New Mexico as an example, this research explored the utility of aerial triangulation (AT) technique and HSR-AP acquired from a low-altitude and low-cost small-unmanned aircraft system (S-UAS), in this case a tethered helium weather balloon, to permit characterization of detailed <b>pavement</b> surface <b>distress</b> conditions. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and visual comparison were used to compare detailed <b>pavement</b> surface <b>distress</b> rates measured from HSR-AP derived products (orthophotos and digital surface models generated from AT) with reference distress rates manually collected on the ground using standard protocols. The results reveal that S-UAS based hyper-spatial resolution imaging and AT techniques can provide detailed and reliable primary observations suitable for characterizing detailed <b>pavement</b> surface <b>distress</b> conditions comparable to the ground-based manual measurement, which lays the foundation for the future application of HSR-AP for automated detection and assessment of detailed <b>pavement</b> surface <b>distress</b> conditions...|$|R

A non-overlay option used to repair areas of distress in concrete pavement without changing its grade, CPR restores the pavement to a condition close to or better than original and reduces the need for major and more costly repairs later. CPP/CPR addresses the cause of <b>pavement</b> <b>distress,</b> minimizing further deterioration. Covering road distress with an asphalt overlay does not correct the cause and will eventually manifest itself again, usually as a larger, more expensive problem.

40|$|The {{condition}} of municipal roads has deteriorated considerably in recent years, leading to large scale <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> such as cracks or potholes. In order to enable road maintenance, <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> should be timely detected. However, manual investigation, {{which is still}} the most widely applied approach toward pavement assessment, puts maintenance personnel at risk and is time-consuming. During the last decade, several efforts have been made to automatically assess the {{condition of}} the municipal roads without any human intervention. Vehicles are equipped with sensors and cameras in order to collect data related to <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> and record videos of the pavement surface. Yet, this data are usually not processed while driving, but instead it is recorded and later analyzed off-line. As a result, a vast amount of memory is required to store the data and the available memory may not be sufficient. To reduce the amount of saved data, the authors have previously proposed a graphics processing units (GPU) -enabled <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> detection approach based on the wavelet transform of pavement images. The GPU implementation enables <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> detection in real time. Although the method used in the approach provides very good results, the method can still be improved by incorporating pavement surface texture characteristics. This paper presents an implementation of textural features on GPUs for <b>pavement</b> <b>distress</b> detection. Textural features are based on gray-tone spatial dependencies in an image and characterize the image texture. To evaluate the computational efficiency of the GPU implementation, performance tests are carried out.
