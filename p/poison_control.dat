5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to <b>poison</b> <b>control</b> centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas <b>poison</b> <b>control</b> centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. <b>Poison</b> <b>control</b> centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to <b>poison</b> <b>control</b> centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|In England and Wales an {{estimated}} 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It {{is estimated that}} 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur {{as a result of}} poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to <b>poison</b> <b>control</b> centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% of cases in children.|$|E
40|$|In 1988 the National <b>Poisons</b> <b>Control</b> Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) {{analysed}} reported expositions to xenobiotics {{to establish}} the frequency of accidental intoxication in adolescents, adults and older persons. Adults were involved in 72 % of the approximately 20, 000 information requests on exposition to xenobiotics. In most (63 %) of the intoxication cases, medicines were ingested. Alcohol, drugs and tobacco, and household and industrial products were involved in 21 % of the cases. Exposure to pesticides, plants, mushrooms and cosmetics was limited. Some new medicines were highly frequent in intoxication cases after their introduction. Look-alike packages of some "non-food" products, of which the appearance resembles a "food product", increasingly lead to erroneous use and unintended exposure. New illicit drugs can suddenly become available and the revival of old products, like gammahydroxybutyrate, used in a different manner caused severe intoxications. The <b>poisons</b> <b>control</b> centre has {{an important role in}} the signalling of unexpected possible dangerous circumstances or exposure to xenobiotics, especially after the introduction of new consumer products and medicines.

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to <b>poison</b> <b>control</b> centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E

40|$|Cellulose acetate (CA) {{films with}} degree of {{substitution}} (d. s.) values of 1. 7 and 2. 5 {{were exposed to}} biologically active in-laboratory composting test vessels maintained at approximately 53 °C. The CA 1. 7 - and 2. 5 -d. s. films (thickness values of ∼ 0. 5 - 1. 0 and 2. 0 mil, respectively) had completely disappeared {{by the end of}} 7 - and 18 -day exposure time periods in the biologically active bioreactors, respectively. The relatively small CA film weight loss observed in the <b>poisoned</b> <b>control</b> test vessels allows the conclusion that CA film erosion during the composting exposures resulted, at least in part, from biologically mediated processes. Under strictly anaerobic conditions, an active methanogenic inoculum was developed by acclimation of a sewage sludge to a synthetic municipal solid waste (SMSW) mixture at 42 °C. The CA 1. 7 -d. s. film samples (0. 5 - to 1. 0 -mil thickness) were exposed in anaerobic serum bottles containing a 25 % solids loading of SMSW in which methanogenic activity was rapidly established after introducing of the developed inoculum. For exposures of 30 days only small visually distinguishable fragments of the CA 1. 7 -d. s. films were recovered. In contrast, exposure of the CA 1. 7 -d. s. film to a <b>poisoned</b> <b>control</b> test vessel resulted in negligible weight loss. Therefore, degradation of the CA 1. 7 -d. s. films upon exposure to the anaerobic bioreactors was due, at least in part, to biologically mediated processes. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Although {{technically}} the antivenin CroFab {{could be}} used to treat an envenomation, it is usually not administered for copperheads, as the risk of complications of an allergic reaction to the treatment are greater than the risk from the snakebite itself in most cases.

25|$|The various benzodiazepines {{differ in}} their {{toxicity}} since they produce varying levels of sedation in overdose. A 1993 British study of deaths during the 1980s found flurazepam and temazepam more frequently involved in drug-related deaths, causing more deaths per million prescriptions than other benzodiazepines. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0), followed by temazepam (11.9), versus benzodiazepines overall (5.9), taken with or without alcohol. An Australian (1995) study found oxazepam less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, {{which happens to be}} the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than diazepam and other benzodiazepines. They also cited a review of the Annual Reports of the American Association of <b>Poison</b> <b>Control</b> Centers National Data Collection System, which showed alprazolam was involved in 34 fatal deliberate self-poisonings over 10 years (1992–2001), compared with 30 fatal deliberate self-poisonings involving diazepam.
