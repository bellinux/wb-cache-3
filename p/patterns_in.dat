5|$|Mathematics, {{physics and}} {{chemistry}} can explain <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> nature at different levels. <b>Patterns</b> <b>in</b> living things are explained by the biological processes of natural selection and sexual selection. Studies of pattern formation make use of computer models to simulate {{a wide range of}} patterns.|$|E

50|$|Any {{value that}} matches the <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the second clause will also match the <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the first clause, so the second clause is unreachable. Therefore, this {{definition}} as a whole exhibits redundancy, and causes a compile-time warning.|$|R
40|$|The {{groundwater}} level of 39 observation wells including 35 unconfined wells and 4 confined wells from 2004 to 2006 in North China Plain (NCP) was monitored using automatic groundwater monitoring data loggers KADEC-MIZU II of Japan. The automatic groundwater sensors were installed for the corporation project between China and Japan. Combined with the monitoring results from 2004 to 2006 {{with the major}} factors affecting the dynamic patterns of groundwater, such as topography and landform, depth of {{groundwater level}}, exploitation or discharge extent, rivers and lakes, the dynamic regions of NCP groundwater were gotten. According to the dynamic features of groundwater in NCP, six dynamic patterns of groundwater level were identified, including discharge <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the piedmont plain, lateral recharge-runoff-discharge <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the piedmont plain, recharge-discharge <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the central channel zone, precipitation infiltration-evaporation <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the shallow groundwater region of the central plain, lateral recharge-evaporation <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the recharge-affected area along the Yellow River and infiltration-discharge-evaporation <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the littoral plain. Based on this, the groundwater fluctuation features of various dynamic patterns were interpreted and the influencing factors of different dynamic patterns were compared...|$|R

However, lawrencium is an exception, since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1/2 subshell due to relativistic effects.|$|E

5|$|Alongside fractals, {{chaos theory}} ranks as an {{essentially}} universal influence on <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> nature. There {{is a relationship}} between chaos and fractals—the strange attractors in chaotic systems have a fractal dimension. Some cellular automata, simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and <b>patterns.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the gas-liquid flow <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> a single gas-evolving {{electrochemical}} channel can be remarkably different from the flow <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> multiple submerged gas-evolving electrochemical channels. This {{is due to the}} fact that in a single channel there is a higher accumulation of small bubbles and these can considerably affect the liquid velocity <b>pattern</b> which <b>in</b> turn may affect the performance of a cell. Since experimental work is often carried out in single channels, while industrial applications almost always involve multiple channels, this study provides insight into the factors that affect the flow <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> each situation and establishes the basis for relating the behavior of single-and multiple-channel devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} finding a {{sequence}} of characters, called the <b>pattern,</b> <b>in</b> another much longer sequence of characters, called the text, is known as pattern matching. Several patternmatching algorithms exist, that locate all the positions where a <b>pattern</b> occurs <b>in</b> a text. In this paper we have presented an algorithm which implements a divide and conquer technique, which divides the text in smaller independent sub-texts and then looks {{for the existence of}} the <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> each such subtext. The said divide and conquer method thus eventually finds all the occurrences of the <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the given text. The points of division have been chosen using a genetic algorithm...|$|R

5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and <b>patterns,</b> <b>in</b> an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Companies closely {{associated}} with camouflage patterns include 6876, A Bathing Ape, Stone Island, Stüssy, Maharishi, mhi, Zoo York, Addict, and Girbaud, using and overprinting genuine military surplus fabric; others use camouflage <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> bright colours such as pink or purple. Some, such as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for Little Children, Part 2. As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm <b>patterns.</b> <b>In</b> this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, {{though some of the}} pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, an {{important}} {{year of his}} life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year he traveled through Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He {{was impressed by the}} Italian countryside, and in Granada by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation, and became a powerful influence on his work.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the African dung beetle Scarabaeus zambesianus {{was shown}} to {{navigate}} using polarization <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> moonlight, making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation. In 2013, it was shown that dung beetles can navigate when only the Milky Way or clusters of bright stars are visible, making dung beetles the only insects known to orient themselves by the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} usage, soldiers often either exchange their disruptively-patterned summer uniforms for thicker snow camouflage uniforms {{printed with}} mainly-white versions of camouflage <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> winter, or they wear white overalls over their uniforms. Some armies have {{made use of}} reversible uniforms, printed in different seasonal patterns on their two sides. Vehicles and guns are often simply repainted in white. Occasionally, aircraft too are repainted in snow camouflage patterns.|$|E
