5|$|Laird {{was born}} in Taunton, Somerset, {{and grew up in}} Bridgwater. He {{supported}} Rangers as a boy, and states that Brian Laudrup was a player he always aspired to <b>play</b> <b>like.</b> Laird also supports Ipswich Town. He says that Guti is the best player he has ever played against. Laird's grandmother gives him a one pound coin every time he scores a goal, something that she has done ever since he started playing football.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2010 {{with the goals}} of {{reworking}} the character Falco Lombardi to mechanically <b>play</b> <b>like</b> he did in Melee and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style, but the project quickly evolved to a full-scale reworking of Brawl. The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to <b>play</b> <b>like</b> he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E

5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they <b>play</b> <b>like</b> lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
25|$|The half-back flank is {{very similar}} to the back pocket position. However, a true half-back flanker is more attacking and {{concentrates}} on rebounding the ball out of the defensive 50. Sometimes half-back flankers even forgo their defensive duties in order to be more attacking. When a half-back flanker is attacking, they <b>play</b> <b>like</b> a wing-back in soccer (or an attacking full-back), and if they are more defensive then they <b>play</b> <b>like</b> a traditional full-back in soccer.|$|E
25|$|Fashion often {{extends from}} the {{clothing}} worn during <b>play,</b> <b>like</b> the bikini or boardshorts. And much like surfers, beach volleyball players are {{at the mercy of}} the weather; patterns of play often develop based on weather conditions like sun and wind.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game has}} two {{different}} main gameplay modes. In [...] "extermination mode", the game <b>plays</b> much <b>like</b> a 3D third person shooter, while in [...] "defense mode", the game <b>plays</b> <b>like</b> a 2D sidescroller.|$|R

On 4 November 2009, Babel scored the opening goal against Lyon in a Champions League game, a strike from 25 yards in a 1–1 draw. Former Liverpool player Alan Hansen called upon Babel to <b>play</b> <b>like</b> he did against Lyon, as he still possessed {{the ability to be}} a 'top player'.|$|E
25|$|Damsels in Distress was {{originally}} intended {{to be only a}} pair of plays: GamePlan and FlatSpin. However, during early preparations, Ayckbourn had an idea for a third play, RolePlay. When the cast agreed to the third play, the end of the Stephen Joseph Theatre's 2001 season was altered to accommodate this third <b>play.</b> <b>Like</b> the other two plays, this drew some inspiration from the London Docklands, where Alan Ayckbourn has a flat, and people often do not know each other well.|$|E

25|$|In 1993 the Geelong {{once again}} underachieved as Malcolm Blight experimented with more {{defensive}} tactics. For {{most of the}} season on-field performances were lacklustre as the players struggled to adapt. It was not until late in the season when Geelong reverted to its all-out attacking style of play. Several experienced players urged Blight to revert to Geelong's customary geisha style of play. Blight agreed and Geelong began to <b>play</b> <b>like</b> champions again. Frustratingly, Geelong narrowly missed the finals on percentage.|$|E

50|$|Although {{a strong}} {{contributor}} to early Norwegian romanticism, Henrik Ibsen {{is perhaps best}} known as an influential Norwegian playwright who was {{largely responsible for the}} popularity of modern realistic drama in Europe, with <b>plays</b> <b>like</b> The Wild Duck and A Doll's House.

500|$|Although he {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} other pianists, Flanagan stated that, [...] "I like to <b>play</b> <b>like</b> a horn player, like I'm blowing into the piano.

[...] In concerts, Flanagan typically played a range of composers' works and, once he had become established as a small-group leader, he often played songs by Tadd Dameron, Duke Ellington, Benny Golson, Thad Jones, Tom McIntosh, and Thelonious Monk.|$|E
