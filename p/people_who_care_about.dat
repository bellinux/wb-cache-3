500|$|... "Simpson Safari"'s setpiece {{shows some}} of Springfield's {{citizens}} mistreating the bag boys {{in a grocery}} store, prompting the bag boys to go on strike. The sequence was inspired by an Albertsons store in Los Angeles, whose employees went on strike {{at the time the}} episode was written. The idea to have the Simpsons visit Africa was pitched by former staff writer Larry Doyle. Former staff writer John Swartzwelder was then assigned to write the first draft of the episode's script. Because of his involvement with the episode, [...] "Simpson Safari" [...] contains several [...] "classic" [...] Swarzwelder-type jokes, according to staff writer Matt Selman. Examples of these include the cover of the Animal Cracker box and Homer and Dr. Joan Bushwell's discussion about the smell of feces in the doctor's hut. After Swarzwelder wrote the first draft, the writing staff rewrote the script. When writing the episode, the writers deliberately included factual errors to annoy viewers who wanted the series to seem realistic. Commenting on the episode, Selman said [...] "It's kind of a combination of really nice, observational designs and then just [...] things that are deliberately wrong. To anger <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> things being real." ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{communications}} aide Robert Gibbs, who {{had worked}} for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> this stuff. How {{do you say to the}} average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?' Even though you've been so disappointed and cynical about politics in the past, and with good reason, we can move in the right direction. Just give me a chance." ...|$|E

Some fans loyal to Willow reacted angrily as {{she chose to}} be with Tara when Oz made himself available, and they lashed out at Tara and Amber Benson on the fansite message boards. Whedon replied sardonically, [...] "we're going to shift away from this whole lifestyle choice that Willow has made. Just wipe the slate. From now on, Willow {{will no longer be}} a Jew. And I think we can all breathe easier." [...] However, he seriously explained his motivation, writing [...] "My show is about emotion. Love is the most powerful, messy, delightful and dangerous emotion... Willow's in love. I think it's cool." [...] Hannigan was also positive about the way the character and her relationship with Tara was written: [...] "It is not about being controversial or making a statement. I think the show is handling it really nicely. It's about two <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> each other." ...|$|E

25|$|Console RPGs {{distinguished}} {{themselves from}} computer RPGs {{to a greater}} degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters. Console RPGs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits, with players assuming the roles of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> each other, fell in love or even had families. Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs at the time but absent from most computer RPGs. During the 1990s, console RPGs had become increasingly dominant, exerting a greater influence on computer RPGs than the other way around. Console RPGs had eclipsed computer RPGs for some time, though computer RPGs began making a comeback {{towards the end of the}} decade with interactive choice-filled adventures.|$|R
