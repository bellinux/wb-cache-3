Our paper reviews the statistical models commonly used in time-series regression methods, specially allowing for serial correlation, make them potentially useful for selected epidemiological purposes. In particular, we discuss the use of time-series regression for counts using a wide range Generalised Linear Models as well as Generalised Additive Models. In addition, recently critical points in using statistical software for GAM were stressed, and reanalyses of time series data on air pollution and health were performed in order to update already published.

We provide here a quantitative summary of the short-term effects of <b>photochemical</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> on mortality in seven Spanish cities involved in the EME-CAM project, using generalized additive models from analyses of single and multiple pollutants. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone data were provided by seven EMECAM cities (Barcelona, Gijón, Huelva, Madrid, Oviedo, Seville, and Valencia). Mortality indicators included daily total mortality from all causes excluding external causes, daily cardiovascular mortality, and daily respiratory mortality.

40|$|Although <b>photochemical</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are {{believed}} to be associated with respiratory illness, there is also a need to consider their possible effects on postnatal lung maturation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the maturation of lungs of young beagle dogs might be altered by an inhalation exposure to ozone that represents a severe 5 -d episode of <b>photochemical</b> oxidant <b>air</b> pollution. Exposures were at 6 wk of age to purified air, 1 or 2 ppm ozone for 4 hid on 5 consecutive days. After holding for 6 wk in clean air, lungs were removed and weighed, and the left lung was fixed both by inflation at 30 cm pressure and immersion using buffered formalin. Histologic sections were used for morphometric measurements. Statistical analysis showed that the mean linear intercept (inversely related to lung surface area) was greater than controls (up to about 5 %) in the 7 ppm ozone-exposed group. This effect was not seen at 2 ppm ozone, apparently due to large variations in mean linear intercept. No significant differences were seen in body weight, chest girth, lung weight, or volumes of the fixed, inflated lungs. It is concluded that if anatomic maturation of the lung was retarded by this brief regimen of ozone exposure, the effect was small and not likely to have major health consequences. © 1986 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} report is to update a 1978 U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report entitled: Site Selection for the Monitoring of <b>Photochemical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutants</b> (EPA, 1978). This updated report, Guideline on Ozone Monitoring Site Selection, is motivated {{by the need to}} help air quality agencies and others incorporate 8 -hour monitoring into their ozone monitoring program. Since the 1970 s, ozone monitoring programs have been designed to address the 1 -hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS); however, on July 18, 1997, the U. S. EPA promulgated an 8 hour ozone NAAQS. This report assists those agencies considering how to design, implement or revise ozone monitoring networks, particularly in light of the need to collect 8 -hour ozone concentration data. Although this report does not specifically address special purpose monitors (SPMs), these additional monitors deployed by air pollution control agencies can serve multiple purposes including :. fulfilling the need to obtain information on where to locate permanent monitoring stations,. providing data to support pollutant formation and transport analyses,. assessing air quality in a particular location, or. determining where the monitored domain near urban areas should be expanded to ensure measurement of a maximum 8 -hour concentration. Where SPM data are used as part of a demonstration of attainment or nonattainment or in computing an ozone design value, the SPM must meet the requirements for SLAMS.

40|$|Abstract. Ozone (O 3) is a <b>photochemical</b> oxidant, an <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> and a {{greenhouse}} gas. As the main precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH) it strongly affects the oxidation {{power of the}} atmosphere. The remote marine boundary layer (MBL) is considered an important region in terms of chemi-cal O 3 loss; however surface-based atmospheric observations are sparse and the photochemical processes are not well un-derstood. To investigate the photochemistry under the clean background conditions of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, ship measurements of NO, NO 2, O 3, JNO 2, J(O 1 D), HO 2, OH, ROx {{and a range of}} meteorological parameters were carried out.

It is found that photochemical generation contributes significantly to form-aldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and acrolein concentrations for the 2 -day period studied. Phenol concentrations are dominated by direct emissions, despite the existence of a pathway for atmospheric formation from benzene oxidation.

40|$|Recent results {{concerning}} {{the identification and}} measurement of nitrogenous <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the California South Coast Air Basin (CSCAB) are presented. In planning or evaluating studies of the human health effects of these pollutants, {{it is important to}} consider the entire range of species which may be present. We provide estimates of typical exposures to nitrogenous <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> during a single day oxidant event in the CSCAB. A critical requirement in obtaining a better understanding of the nature and magnitude of health effects associated with nitrogenous <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> is to extend the quantitative data base {{concerning the}} atmospheric burden of such pollutants. Thus, it is important to have detailed information on the concentrations and temporal and geographical distributions not only of nitrogen dioxide-which, as a criteria pollutant, has been a prime focus of regulatory action-but also of the host of other toxic or potentially toxic nitrogenous copollutants. Many of these have been observed in laboratory or environmental chamber systems but until recently have not been unequivocally identified and measured in ambient air. Reliably determined atmospheric concentrations of the nitrogenous <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are one important criterion for judging the relevancy of clinical and laboratory studies of their biological effects to health impacts resulting from human exposure to ambient polluted atmospheres.

A description of the impact of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> on children's health is complicated by the presence of many types of air pollution and by the variety of indicators of adverse health effects. Over the period April-September 1994, the frequency of emergency room visits for asthma, bronchitis, laryngitis and bronchiolitis in the Paediatrics Department in Padua (Italy) has been documented and compared to outdoor concentrations of airborne particulate, sulphur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) and ozone in a case-control study. Two control groups of children affected by air pollution not related diseases (acute gastro-enteritis or cranial trauma) have been considered. Atmospheric airborne particulate, SO 2, NO(x) and ozone concentrations were obtained from the Air Quality Monitoring Network of Padua. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple logistic step-wise regression. A total of 468 emergency room visits were noted; 139 children suffering from respiratory symptoms and 339 controls. The highest pollution levels were observed for ozone, with average 24 hr - concentrations, ranging from 30 to 160 mcg per cubic meter, still lower than permitted limits. No significant relationships could be found between any of the pollution indices and the incidence of emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms. No difference related to <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> was found between daily frequency of visits between cases and controls. Only bronchiolitis in the age < 2 years was related to the concentrations of NO 2 (p < 0. 05).
