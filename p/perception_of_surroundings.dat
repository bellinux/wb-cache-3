These are participative observation and in-depth interviewing which will be evaluated in a case scenario in a workplace context. These techniques have been found to be useful not only organizational research but in practical situations as well. Through an illustration of how security personnel perform their duty at work, we suggest that qualitative methodology can be applied in daily contexts to evaluate the capacity, understanding and the capability of these personnel in relation to their adherence to policy and procedure.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify my concept of the Grass-roots Culture, {{cultural}} expressions which are deeply rooted in the situation of a time and place. Artists of the Grass-roots Culture notice the sights, sounds and experiences of everyday life and use them as source materials. They find value in what we overlook, in what is too ordinary and too close at hand for us to pay attention to. The power of arts to cultivate new meanings and change the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>surroundings</b> is mobilized through the Grass-roots Culture for the enrichment of everyday life. Under this concept, I try to see cultural trends such as Community-based art, Folklore, DIY Punks and so on from a common viewpoint and evaluate their significance in the current social context.

This paper examines the psychological characteristics of normative dissociation (detachment) across musical and non-musical experiences in ‘real world’, everyday settings. It draws upon a subset of data arising from an empirical project designed to compare transformative shifts of consciousness, with and without music in daily life, {{and the ways in}} which use of music may facilitate the processes of dissociation and absorption. Twenty participants kept unstructured diaries for two weeks, recording free descriptions of involving experiences of any kind as soon as possible after their occurrence. All descriptions were subsequently subjected to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results suggest that dissociative experiences are a familiar occurrence in everyday life. Diary entries highlight an established practice of actively sought detachment from self, surroundings or activity, suggesting that, together with absorption, the processes of derealization (altered <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>surroundings)</b> and depersonalization (detachment from self) constitute common means of selfregulation in daily life. Music emerges as a particularly versatile facilitator of dissociative experience because of its semantic ambiguity, portability, and the variety of ways in which it may mediate perception, so facilitating an altered relationship to self and environmen...|$|E

Here we aim to characterize differences in MCS plus as compared to MCS minus by means of functional connectivity (FC). Method: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) was acquired in 292 MCS patients and a seed-based analysis was conducted on {{a convenience sample of}} 19 MCS patients (10 MCS plus and 9 MCS minus) and 35 healthy controls. We investigated the left and right frontoparietal networks (FPN), the auditory network and the default mode network (DMN). We employed a ROI-to-ROI analysis to investigate the inter-hemispheric connectivity and we investigated inter-group differences in grey and white matter volume by means of voxel-based morphometry. Results: We found a higher FC in MCS plus as compared to MCS minus in the left FPN, specifically between the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the left temporo-occipital fusiform cortex (TOFC). The FC of auditory network, right FPN and DMN, inter-hemispheric connectivity and structure of grey and white matter did not show differences between patients groups.

40|$|Patients in a {{minimally}} conscious state (MCS) {{have been}} subcategorized in MCS plus and MCS minus, that is, {{with or without}} command following capacity respectively. We aimed to characterize this residual capacity in both patient groups by means of resting state fMRI. We hypothesized a higher connectivity in MCS plus as compared with MCS minus in language-related networks, that is the left fronto-parietal network (FPN). Our sample includes 10 MCS plus and 9 MCS minus who match for age, gender, etiology and disease duration, as well as 35 healthy controls. We performed a seed-based resting state analysis using CONN toolbox 2. We investigated the left FPN, and also the right FPN, the auditory network and the default mode network (DMN) in order to exclude the influence of perception of surrounding, auditory capacity, or internal thoughts. We employed a ROI-to-ROI analysis to investigate the inter-hemispheric connectivity and we investigated inter-group differences in grey and white matter volume by means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We observed a higher functional connectivity in controls than in patients, {{as well as in}} MCS plus as compared to MCS minus patients. Specifically, with DLPFC as seed, the left FPN was more connected in MCS plus patients to the left temporo-occipital fusiform cortex. No {{significant differences were found between}} both patient groups in the right FPN, the auditory network and the DMN, or using the ROI-to-ROI analyses and the VBM. Our results suggest that the clinical sub-categorization of MCS is sustained by functional connectivity differences in a language-related executive control network.

50|$|The {{blind spot}} metaphor {{refers to the}} {{physiological}} blind spot in human vision in which <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>surroundings</b> and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is {{in part due to}} an assumption that novices’ cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts’ and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed (Borko & Livingston, 1989: 474). Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter (Borko, Eisenhart, Brown, Underhill, Jones, & Agard, 1992: 195). Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators’ experience with instructing learners over time.|$|R
