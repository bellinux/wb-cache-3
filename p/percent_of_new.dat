In 2004, there were just over 600 French breeders of the Norman Cob, and in 2005, 914 Norman Cob mares were bred, with 65 stallions recorded as active in France. In recent years, the number of Norman Cobs has remained relatively stable.

5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of this through July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, {{president and chief executive officer}} of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Older electricity generating unitsthose that began operating in or before 1978 provided 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> electricity from fossil fuel units in 2010 but produced {{a disproportionate share of}} emissions, both in aggregate and per unit of electricity generated. Overall, in 2010 older units contributed 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> sulfur dioxide emissions, 64 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen oxides emissions, and 54 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel units. For each unit of electricity generated, older units collectively emitted about 3. 6 times as much sulfur dioxide, 2. 1 times as much nitrogen oxides, and 1. 3 times as much carbon dioxide as newer units. The difference in emissions between older units and their newer counterparts may be attributed to a number of factors. First, 93 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the electricity produced by older fossil fuel units in 2010 was generated by coal-fired units. Compared with natural gas units, coal-fired units produced over 90 times as much sulfur dioxide, twice as much carbon dioxide and over five times as much nitrogen oxides per unit of electricity, largely because coal contains more sulfur and carbon than natural gas. Second, fewer older units have installed emissions controls, which reduce emissions by limiting their formation or capturing them after they are formed. Among coal-fired unitswhich produce nearly all sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power generationapproximately 26 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> older units used controls for sulfur dioxide, compared with 63 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> units. Controls for nitrogen oxide emissions were more common among all types of fossil fuel units, but these controls vary widely in their effectiveness. Among older units, 14 percent had installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment, the type of control capable of reducing the greatest amount of nitrogen oxides emissions, compared with 33 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> units. In addition, approximately 38 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> older units did not have any controls for nitrogen oxides, compared with 6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> units. Third, lower emissions among newer units may be attributable in part to improvements in the efficiency with which newer units convert fuel into electricity. Nonetheless, older units remain {{an important part of the}} electricity generating sector, particularly in certain regions of the United States. ...|$|R
