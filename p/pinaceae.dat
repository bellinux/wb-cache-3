5|$|Based on ancestral {{reconstruction}} studies, {{the earliest}} (basal) {{members of the}} Sclerodermatineae originated in the late Cretaceous (145–66Ma). The major genera diversified near the mid Cenozoic (66–0Ma). Asia and North America are the most probable ancestral areas for all Sclerodermatineae, and <b>Pinaceae</b> and angiosperms (primarily rosids) are the most probable ancestral hosts.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, <b>Pinaceae</b> and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and <b>Pinaceae.</b> The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
50|$|Scutulopsis is a genus of {{fungi in}} the Helotiales order. The {{relationship}} of this taxon to other taxa within the order is unknown (incertae sedis), {{and it has}} not yet been placed with certainty into any family.

40|$|The {{information}} provided by thè biomarkers extracted from the sediments recovered {{in the bottom of}} Venta Micena stratigraphic section, together with pollen data and supported by studies about its fauna (ostracodes and vertebrates), indicate that this area was constituted in a low-saline and shallow lacustrine-palustrine environment with stagnant waters surrounded by high-plants (<b>pinacea</b> and dicotyledoneus) under warm and arid climatic condition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a scientific investigation on a preserved head of hair, discovered in 1839 inside a lead coffin beneath the Norman Abbey of Romsey (Hampshire, UK). Accelerator mass 30 spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating, modelled to account for dietary marine protein intake indicated by stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 15 N), suggests that this individual died between 895 - 1123 calAD (95. 4 % probability). A wooden ‘pillow’ found supporting the hair produced a date of 895 - 1016 calAD (95. 4 % probability). These results suggest that this burial dates {{from the end of the}} ninth century to the early twelfth century, placing it in the late Saxon or immediately post-Conquest era. 35 Analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of residue adhering to the hair surface indicates the presence of <b>Pinacea</b> resin, deriving either from funerary ritual or hair care during life...|$|R
5|$|Hydnellum fungi are mycorrhizal, and {{are usually}} found in {{coniferous}} and mixed woods. Favored tree hosts include members of the Fagaceae and the <b>Pinaceae.</b> The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Europe and North America, but some species are also found in tropical Asia. Harrison identified a dozen new species from North America in the 1960s. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus recognized 16 European species in his 1975 treatment of the genus, to which H. dianthifolium has been recently added by Loizides and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests <b>Pinaceae</b> such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|E
5|$|The genus, {{with about}} 20 {{described}} species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About {{half of the}} species {{are found in the}} southeastern United States, including three species added to the genus in 2013–14. Several Phellodon species were placed on a preliminary Red List of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic mycorrhizal association with trees from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and <b>Pinaceae</b> (pines). Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of Phellodon species in the soil, even in the extended absence of visible fruitbodies. Although Phellodon fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh, the type species, P.niger, is used in mushroom dyeing.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Compare {{the rate}} of growth of four {{microbial}} strains that cause disease in the equine, on four commonly used types of bedding. The moisture holding capacity of each bedding type was also tested. Methods and results: Microbial strains included, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Dichelobacter nodosus and Dermatophilus congolensis. The bedding types tested were Pinus syvestrus (Scots pine shavings), Pinus nigra (Corsican pine shavings), Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce shavings), Cannabis sativa (hemp) and chopped wheat straw. A suspension of each microbial strain was spread in triplicate on agar media and incubated in its optimal growth conditions. The viable count (colony forming unit per ml) was determined for each bacterial strain for the five different bedding types. Pinus syvestrus bedding resulted in significantly less (p= 0. 001) bacterial growth of all strains tested. Conclusions: Factors resulting in the inhibition of bacterial growth include the anti-bacterial effects reported in the <b>Pinacea</b> family and the physical properties of the bedding substrate. Research is currently focussed on the diagnosis and management of disease. Prevention of disease is also important for matters of biosecurity. Strategies should include the provision of a hygienic environment and the use of specific types of bedding. Significance and impact of the study; Bedding choice has implications for global equine health and disease prevention as well as potential benefits in other animal species...|$|R
40|$|Ectomycorrhizas (ECM) are {{symbiotic}} {{associations between}} roots of higher plants, mainly trees (e. g. <b>Pinacea</b> and Fagaceae), and soil fungi (asco- and basidiomycetes). The establishment of this symbiotic association requires {{a sequence of}} highly regulated and coordinated events, initiated by an exchange of specific signalling compounds between both partners. The triggering mechanisms and the progression of the colonization process are still not well understood. The present work focus on the signalling process occurring during the early contact of ectomycorrhizal fungi with Castanea sativa roots, using a model ECM fungus (Pisolithus tinctorius). Early contacts between symbionts were also observed by scanning electron microscopy. In previous work, we have evaluated the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the first 48 h after P. tinctorius contact with C. sativa roots, in which three production peaks of H 2 O 2 and two O 2 •- burst were detected. The effect of C. sativa root extracts in promoting ECM fungi growth was also evaluated by measuring the radial growth of P. tinctorius mycelium cultured in medium supplemented with crude extracts from C. sativa roots elicited with the same ECM fungi up to 48 h. P. tinctorius growth is differentially stimulated {{in the presence of}} aqueous extracts from elicited C. sativa roots, and was significantly correlated with H 2 O 2 production pattern. The results suggest that during the early stages of ECM establishment, H 2 O 2 appears to be an important initial product and a serious candidate to act as a signal molecule during symbiotic development and might be a general strategy to enable successful colonization of the roots...|$|R
25|$|A pine is any conifer in {{the genus}} Pinus, , {{of the family}} <b>Pinaceae.</b> Pinus is the sole genus in the {{subfamily}} Pinoideae. The Plant List compiled by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden accepts 126 species names of pines as current, together with 35 unresolved species and many more synonyms.|$|E
25|$|EcM {{plants and}} fungi exhibit a wide taxonomic {{distribution}} and are similarly present across all continents (apart from Antarctica), suggesting the EcM symbiosis has ancient evolutionary roots, as well. <b>Pinaceae</b> represents the oldest extant plant family in which symbiosis with EcM fungi occurs, and fossils from this family {{date back to}} 156 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|In both botanical {{and popular}} {{literature}} the tree {{has been almost}} universally {{referred to as the}} Wollemi pine, although it is not a true pine (genus Pinus) nor a member of the pine family (<b>Pinaceae),</b> but, rather, is related to Agathis and Araucaria in the family Araucariaceae. The oldest fossil of the Wollemi tree has been dated to 200 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Many EcM species co-invade {{without the}} help of human activity, however. Members of <b>Pinaceae</b> {{represent}} another prime example of this convention, often invading habitats along with specific EcM fungi from the genera Suillus and Rhizopogon. There are, however, ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi with cosmopolitan distributions. These EcM fungi allow non-native plant species to form mutualisms that are not novel in environments that are, thus bypassing the need for co-invasion with specific EcM fungi from the native ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} name Pinophyta {{conforms to}} the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), which state (Article 16.1) that the names of higher taxa in plants (above the rank of family) are either formed from the name of an included family (usually the most common and/or representative), in this case <b>Pinaceae</b> (the pine family), or are descriptive. A descriptive name in widespread use for the conifers (at whatever rank is chosen) is Coniferae (Art 16 Ex 2).|$|E
25|$|While {{the plant}} hosts exhibit low specificity, EcM fungi exhibit {{various levels of}} specificity, and the costs and {{benefits}} to their specialization are not well understood. A good example is the suilloid group, a monophyletic assemblage containing the genera Suillus, Rhizopogon, Gomphidius and others. This is the largest group that exhibits such an extreme degree of specificity, with almost all of its members forming ectomycorrhizas with members of the <b>Pinaceae.</b> However, many other fungal groups exhibit a very broad host-range more akin to host lineages.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Pinaceae,</b> Araucariaceae, Sciadopityaceae {{and most}} Cupressaceae, the cones are woody, and when mature the scales usually spread open {{allowing}} the seeds {{to fall out}} and be dispersed by the wind. In some (e.g. firs and cedars), the cones disintegrate to release the seeds, and in others (e.g. the pines that produce pine nuts) the nut-like seeds are dispersed by birds (mainly nutcrackers, and jays), which break up the specially adapted softer cones. Ripe cones may remain on the plant for a varied amount of time before falling to the ground; in some fire-adapted pines, the seeds may be stored in closed cones for up to 60–80 years, being released only when a fire kills the parent tree.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that {{reversals}} back to the ancestral free-living condition have occurred, but this evidence has been extensively challenged because: 1) the data exhibits taxa sampling bias and model dependency, 2) most non-mycorrhizal taxa lie within strongly AM clades, rather than EcM ones, and 3) the derived EcM condition is specialized, and would likely have given an ecological advantage that reversion to saprotrophy would not have. Furthermore, Hibbett and Matheny performed Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses yielding results that indicate that an ancestral EcM condition that was subsequently lost multiple times is simply not parsimonious. These reversals to a saprotrophic mode are impractical given that the host plants involved in the EcM symbioses (<b>Pinaceae</b> and rosids) had not yet evolved when the studied class Agaricomycetes first appeared.|$|E
25|$|Conifers are {{the largest}} and {{economically}} most important component group of the gymnosperms, but nevertheless they comprise {{only one of the}} four groups. The division Pinophyta consists of just one class, Pinopsida, which includes both living and fossil taxa. Subdivision of the living conifers into two or more orders has been proposed from time to time. The most commonly seen in the past was a split into two orders, Taxales (Taxaceae only) and Pinales (the rest), but recent research into DNA sequences suggests that this interpretation leaves the Pinales without Taxales as paraphyletic, and the latter order is no longer considered distinct. A more accurate subdivision would be to split the class into three orders, Pinales containing only <b>Pinaceae,</b> Araucariales containing Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae, and Cupressales containing the remaining families (including Taxaceae), but there has not been any significant support for such a split, with the majority of opinion preferring retention of all the families within a single order Pinales, despite their antiquity and diverse morphology.|$|E
25|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that ectomycorrhizal fungi might {{be at odds with}} the general latitudinal gradient of diversity (LGD). Data sets, free from inconclusive fruit-body surveys and largely relying on more accurate sequencing and microarray technologies, indicate that EcM fungi may be at enhanced diversity in the temperate zone. This implies that many of the causal mechanisms proposed to explain the LGD pattern might be inapplicable, or in need of modification, in reference to EcM. Though this relationship is far from certain, there exist some hypotheses to explain the plausibility of this phenomenon: 1) EcM fungi may have evolved at higher latitudes with <b>Pinaceae</b> hosts, and are subsequently inferior at competition in tropical climates, 2) host lineages might be more diverse in temperate conditions, and well developed soil and soil horizons in temperate regions allow for higher niche differentiation and species accumulation, and 3) tropical EcM hosts are more sparsely distributed, yielding small isolated forest islands that may reduce the population sizes and subsequent richness of EcM fungi.|$|E
25|$|Since most {{conifers}} are evergreens, {{the leaves}} of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae {{and some of the}} Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as Araucaria columnaris have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (-4). In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as Abies grandis (pictured), the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache Pine, Pinus engelmannii). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves, and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish Pine Pinus brutia) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, Picea pungens) have a very strong glaucous wax bloom to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2-40) years before falling, but five genera (Larix, Pseudolarix, Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) are deciduous, shedding the leaves in autumn and leafless through the winter. The seedlings of many conifers, including most of the Cupressaceae, and Pinus in <b>Pinaceae,</b> have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.|$|E
500|$|Level Mountain is {{characterized}} by three biophysical zones. The first zone, below an elevation of , is predominated by vegetation of the <b>Pinaceae</b> and Betulaceae families.

2500|$|The arid, {{continental}} conditions {{characteristic of}} the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period, especially at higher latitudes; the warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape.

Extant conifer families that flourished during the Jurassic included the Araucariaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, <b>Pinaceae,</b> Podocarpaceae, Taxaceae and Taxodiaceae. The extinct Mesozoic conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby Bennettitales. Cycads were also common, as were ginkgos and tree ferns in the forest. Smaller ferns were probably the dominant undergrowth. Caytoniaceous seed ferns were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized.
