40|$|The RAD 6 <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair</b> group {{participates in}} various {{processes}} of DNA metabolism. To elucidate {{the contribution of}} RAD 6 to starvation-associated mutagenesis, which occurs in nongrowing cells cultivated under selective conditions, we analyzed the phenotype of strains expressing various alleles of the RAD 6 gene and single and multiple mutants of the RAD 6, RAD 5, RAD 18, REV 3, and MMS 2 genes from the RAD 6 repair group. Our {{results show that the}} RAD 6 repair pathway is also active in starving cells and its contribution to starvation-associated mutagenesis {{is similar to that of}} spontaneous mutagenesis. Epistatic analysis based on both spontaneous and starvation-associated mutagenesis and UV sensitivity showed that the RAD 6 repair group consists of distinct repair pathways of different relative importance requiring, besides the presence of Rad 6, also either Rad 18 or Rad 5 or both. We postulate the existence of four pathways: (1) nonmutagenic Rad 5 /Rad 6 /Rad 18, (2) mutagenic Rad 5 /Rad 6 /Rev 3, (3) mutagenic Rad 6 /Rad 18 /Rev 3, and (4) Rad 6 /Rad 18 /Rad 30. Furthermore, we show that the high mutation rate observed in rad 6 mutants is caused by a mutator different from Rev 3. From our data and data previously published, we suggest a role for Rad 6 in DNA repair and mutagenesis and propose a model for the RAD 6 <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair</b> group...|$|E

40|$|In vitro, {{the protein}} complex Chromatin Assembly Factor-I (CAF-I) from human or yeast cells {{deposits}} histones onto DNA templates after replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CAC 1, CAC 2, and CAC 3 genes encode the three CAF-I subunits. Deletion {{of any of}} the three CAC genes reduces telomeric gene silencing and confers an increase in sensitivity to killing by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We used double and triple mutants involving cac 1 Delta and yeast repair gene mutations to show that deletion of the CAC 1 gene increases the UV sensitivity of cells mutant in genes from each of the known DNA repair epistasis groups. For example, double mutants involving cac 1 Delta and excision repair gene deletions rad 1 Delta or rad 14 Delta showed increased UV sensitivity, as did double mutants involving cac 1 Delta and deletions of members of the RAD 51 recombinational repair group. cac 1 Delta also increased the UV sensitivity of strains with defects in either the error-prone (rev 3 Delta) or error-free (pol 30 - 46) branches of RAD 6 -mediated postreplicative DNA repair but did not substantially increase the sensitivity of strains carrying null mutations in the RAD 6 or RAD 18 genes. Deletion of CAC 1 also increased the UV sensitivity and rate of UV-induced mutagenesis in rad 5 Delta mutants, as has been observed for mutants defective in error-free <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair.</b> Together, these data suggest that CAF-I has a role in error-free postreplicative damage repair and may also have an auxiliary role in other repair mechanisms. Like the CAC genes, RAD 6 is also required for gene silencing at telomeres. We find an increased loss of telomeric gene silencing in rad 6 Delta cac 1 Delta and rad 18 Delta cac 1 Delta double mutants, suggesting that CAF-I and multiple factors in the <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair</b> pathway influence chromosome structure...|$|E

40|$|Methylating {{agents of}} S(N) 1 type {{are widely used}} in cancer chemotherapy, but their mode of action is poorly understood. In particular, {{it is unclear how}} the primary {{cytotoxic}} lesion, O(6) -methylguanine ((Me) G), causes cell death. One hypothesis stipulates that binding of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins to (Me) G/T mispairs arising during DNA replication triggers cell-cycle arrest and cell death. An alternative hypothesis posits that (Me) G cytotoxicity is linked to futile processing of (Me) G-containing base pairs by the MMR system. In this study, we provide compelling genetic evidence in support of the latter hypothesis. Treatment of 4644 deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the prototypic S(N) 1 -type methylating agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) identified MMR as the only pathway that sensitizes cells to MNNG. In contrast, homologous recombination (HR), <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair,</b> DNA helicases, and chromatin maintenance factors protect yeast cells against the cytotoxicity of this chemical. Notably, DNA damage signaling proteins played a protective rather than sensitizing role in the MNNG response. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that (Me) G-containing lesions in yeast must be processed to be cytotoxic...|$|E

In this study, we report a direct interaction between a uracil-DNA glycosylase (Pa-UDGa) and a PCNA homolog (Pa-PCNA 1), both from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (T(opt) = 100 degrees C). We demonstrate that the Pa-UDGa-Pa-PCNA 1 complex is thermostable, and two hydrophobic amino acid residues on Pa-UDGa (Phe(191) and Leu(192)) are shown to be crucial for this interaction. It {{is interesting to note that}} although Pa-UDGa has homologs throughout the Archaea and bacteria, it does not share significant sequence similarity with hUNG 2.

40|$|The MPH 1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{encoding}} {{a member}} of the DEAH family of proteins, had been identified by virtue of the spontaneous mutator phenotype of respective deletion mutants. Genetic analysis suggested that MPH 1 functions in a previously uncharacterized DNA repair pathway that protects the cells from damage-induced mutations. We have now analyzed genetic interactions of mph 1 with a variety of mutants from different repair systems with respect to spontaneous mutation rates and sensitivities to different DNA-damaging agents. The dependence of the mph 1 mutator phenotype on REV 3 and REV 1 and the synergy with mutations in base and nucleotide excision repair suggest an involvement of MPH 1 in error-free bypass of lesions. However, although we observed an unexpected partial suppression of the mph 1 mutator phenotype by rad 5, genetic interactions with other mutations in <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair</b> imply that MPH 1 does not belong to this pathway. Instead, mutations from the homologous recombination pathway were found to be epistatic to mph 1 with respect to both spontaneous mutation rates and damage sensitivities. Determination of spontaneous mitotic recombination rates demonstrated that mph 1 mutants are not deficient in homologous recombination. On the contrary, in an sgs 1 background we found a pronounced hyperrecombination phenotype. Thus, we propose that MPH 1 is involved in a branch of homologous recombination that is specifically dedicated to error-free bypass...|$|E

In addition, it could be shown to exert a protective effect against oxidizing and nitrosating agents. Interestingly, inactivation of uvrB and uvrD 1 significantly increased marker integration frequencies in gene conversion assays.

In RNA viruses, treatment with mutagenic nucleoside analogues selects for polymerase variants with increased fidelity, showing that viral mutation rates {{can be adjusted}} in response to imposed selective pressures. However, this type of resistance is not possible in viruses that do not encode their own poly-merases, such as single-stranded DNA viruses. We previously showed that serial passaging of bacteriophageX 174 in the pres-ence of the nucleoside analogue 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) favored substitutions in the lysis protein E (P. Domingo-Calap, M. Pereira-Gomez, and R. Sanjuán, J. Virol. 86 : 9640 – 9646, 2012, doi: 10. 1128 /JVI. 00613 – 12). Here, we found that approximately half (6 / 12) of the amino acid replacements in the N-terminal region of this protein led to delayed lysis, and two of these changes (V 2 A and D 8 A) also conferred partial resistance to 5 -FU. By delaying lysis, the V 2 A and D 8 A substitutions allowed the virus to increase the burst size per cell {{in the presence of}} 5 -FU. Furthermore, these substitutions tended to alleviate drug-inducedmu-tagenesis by reducing the number of rounds of copying required for population growth, revealing a newmechanism of resis-tance.

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid three-step {{procedure}} {{for the large}} scale purification of the recA protein f Escherichia coli is described. The method depends primarily on a single chromatographic step which is highly specific for recA protein: elution by ATP from single-stranded DNA cel-lulose. With this procedure, gram quantities of recA protein, greater than 99 % pure, can be reproducibly prepared for biochemical and biophysical analysis. The recA gene product of Escherichia coli (recA protein) is required for homologous genetic recombination and for the <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair</b> of damage to DNA (1, 2). It is also involved in the regulation of DNA repair, mutagenesis, cell division, and prophage induction (“SOS functions”) (1, 2). Because of its central role in these processes, the recA protein has become the object of intensive study. The recA protein is also a valuable reagent for the site-specific mutagenesis of DNA in vitro (3). Clearly, a simple and easily reproducible purification procedure for recA protein would be of value in several areas of current biochemical interest. Several procedures for the purification of recA protein have been published (4 - 6), all of which involve elution from phos-phocellulose or DNA-cellulose with solutions of increasing ionic strength. Although large amounts of recA protein have been prepared by these methods, {{the purity of the}} final product has been variable.

40|$|Ubiquitination of the {{replication}} clamp {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) at the conserved residue lysine (K) 164 triggers <b>postreplicative</b> <b>repair</b> (PRR) to fill single-stranded gaps {{that result from}} stalled DNA polymerases. However, it has remained elusive as to whether cells engage PRR in response to replication defects that do not directly impair DNA synthesis. To experimentally address this question, we performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ubiquitination-deficient K 164 to arginine (K 164 R) mutant of PCNA against a library of S. cerevisiae temperature-sensitive alleles. The SGA signature of the K 164 R allele showed a striking correlation with profiles of mutants deficient in various aspects of lagging strand replication, including rad 27 Δ and elg 1 Δ. Rad 27 is the primary flap endonuclease that processes 5 ' flaps generated during lagging strand replication, whereas Elg 1 has been implicated in unloading PCNA from chromatin. We observed chronic ubiquitination of PCNA at K 164 in both rad 27 Δ and elg 1 Δ mutants. Notably, only rad 27 Δ cells exhibited a decline in cell viability upon elimination of PRR pathways, whereas elg 1 Δ mutants were not affected. We further provide evidence that K 164 ubiquitination suppresses replication stress resulting from defective flap processing during Okazaki fragment maturation. Accordingly, ablation of PCNA ubiquitination increased S phase checkpoint activation, indicated by hyperphosphorylation of the Rad 53 kinase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alternative flap processing by overexpression of catalytically active exonuclease 1 eliminates PCNA ubiquitination. This suggests a model in which unprocessed flaps may directly participate in PRR signaling. Our findings demonstrate that PCNA ubiquitination at K 164 in response to replication stress {{is not limited to}} DNA synthesis defects but extends to DNA processing during lagging strand replication...|$|E

These noncanonical functions remained unexplained because knowledge of cohesin-binding sites and functional interactors in metazoans was lacking. We show that the distribution of cohesins on mammalian chromosome arms is not driven by transcriptional activity, in contrast to S. cerevisiae. Instead, mammalian cohesins occupy a subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites, many of which contain sequence motifs resembling the consensus for CTCF, a DNA-binding protein with enhancer blocking function and boundary-element activity. We find cohesins at most CTCF sites and show that CTCF is required for cohesin localization to these sites. Recruitment by CTCF suggests a rationale for noncanonical cohesin functions and, because CTCF binding is sensitive to DNA methylation, allows cohesin positioning to integrate DNA sequence and epigenetic state...|$|R

Moreover, MMR proteins are involved also in other pathways of DNA metabolism, but their exact role in these processes is unknown. In an attempt to gain novel insights into the function of MMR proteins in human cells, we searched for interacting partners of the MutL homologues MLH 1 and PMS 2 by tandem affinity purification and of PMS 1 by large scale immunoprecipitation. In addition to proteins known to interact with the MutL homologues during MMR, mass spectrometric analyses identified a number of other polypeptides, some of which bound to the above proteins with very high affinity.

40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} slippage occurs {{frequently in}} tracts of a tandemly repeated nucleotide, and such slippage events can be genetically detected as frameshift mutations. In long mononucleotide runs, most frameshift intermediates are <b>repaired</b> by the <b>postreplicative</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> (MMR) machinery, {{rather than by}} the exonucleolytic proofreading activity of DNA polymerase. Although mononucleotide runs are hotspots for polymerase slippage events, it is not known whether the composition of a run and the surrounding context affect the frequency of slippage or the efficiency of MMR. To address these issues, 10 -nucleotide (10 N) runs were inserted into the yeast LYS 2 gene to create + 1 frameshift alleles. Slippage events within these runs were detected as Lys(+) revertants. 10 G or 10 C runs were found to be more unstable than 10 A or 10 T runs, but neither the frequency of polymerase slippage nor the overall efficiency of MMR was greatly influenced by sequence context. Although complete elimination of MMR activity (msh 2 mutants) affected all runs similarly, analyses of reversion rates in msh 3 and msh 6 mutants revealed distinct specificities of the yeast Msh 2 p-Msh 3 p and Msh 2 p-Msh 6 p mismatch binding complexes in the repair of frameshift intermediates in different sequence contexts...|$|R

These studies demonstrate that (i) DNA polymerase slippage occurs more often in 10 -cytosine/ 10 -guanine (10 C/ 10 G) runs than in 10 -adenine/ 10 -thymine (10 A/ 10 T) runs, (ii) the MMR system removes frameshift intermediates in 10 A/ 10 T runs more efficiently than in 10 C/ 10 G runs, (iii) the MMR system removes − 1 frameshift intermediates more efficiently than + 1 intermediates in all 10 -nucleotide runs, and (iv) the repair specificities of the Msh 2 p-Msh 3 p and Msh 2 p-Msh 6 p mismatch recognition complexes with respect to 1 -nucleotide insertion/deletion loops vary dramatically as a function of run composition.

To examine the relative contributions of these factors to replication fidelity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we determined the reversion rates and spectra of the lys 2 Delta Bgl + 1 frameshift allele. Wild-type and homozygous mutant diploid strains with all possible combinations of defects in the exonuclease activities of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon (conferred by the pol 3 - 01 and pol 2 - 4 alleles, respectively) and in mismatch repair (deletion of MSH 2) were analyzed. Although there was no direct correlation between homopolymer run length and frameshift accumulation in the wild-type strain, such a correlation was evident in the triple mutant strain lacking all repair capacity. Furthermore, examination of strains defective in one or two repair activities revealed distinct biases in the removal of the corresponding frameshift intermediates by exonucleolytic proofreading and/or mismatch repair.

The fission yeast Eco 1 ortholog, Eso 1, is expressed as a fusion protein with the translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase Polg. The involvement of Eso 1 in S phase cohesion was attributed to the Eco 1 homologous part of the protein and bypass of UV-induced DNA lesions to the Polg part. Here we describe an additional novel function for budding yeast Polg, i. e. formation of postreplicative DI genome-wide cohesion. This is a unique Polg function not shared with other TLS polymerases. However, Polg deficient cells are DSB repair competent, as Polg is not required for cohesion locally at the DSB. This reveals differential regulation of DSB–proximal cohesion and DI genome-wide cohesion, and challenges the importance of the latter for DSB repair.

In this latter role, MLH 1 –MLH 3 heterodimers predominate and are essential for prophase I progression. Previous studies demonstrated that mice lacking Mlh 1 exhibit a 90 % reduction in crossing over at the Psmb 9 hot spot while noncrossovers, which do not result in exchange of flanking markers but arise from the same double-strand break event, are unaffected. Using a PCR-based strategy that allows for detailed analysis of crossovers and noncrossovers, we show here that Mlh 3 −/− exhibit a 85 – 94 % {{reduction in the number of}} crossovers at the Psmb 9 hot spot. Most of the remaining crossovers in Mlh 3 −/− meiocytes represent simple exchanges similar to those seen in wild-type mice, with a small fraction (6 %) representing complex events that can extend far from the initiation zone. Interestingly, we detect an increase of noncrossovers in Mlh 3 −/− spermatocytes. These results suggest that MLH 3 functions predominantly with MLH 1 to promote crossovers, while noncrossover events do not require these activities.

We recently demonstrated that the eukaryotic MMR machinery can make use also of strand breaks arising during excision of uracils or ribonucleotides from DNA. We now show that intermediates of MYH-dependent excision of adenines mispaired with 8 -oxoguanine (GO) also act as MMR initiation sites in extracts of human cells or Xenopus laevis eggs. Unexpectedly, GO/C pairs were not processed in these extracts and failed to affect MMR directionality, but extracts supplemented with exogenous OGG 1 did so.

In recent years, MMR has also been implicated in the response of mammalian cells to DNA damaging agents. Thus, MMR-deficient cells were shown to be around 100 -fold more resistant to killing by methylating agents of the S(N) 1 type than cells with functional MMR. In the case of cisplatin, the sensitivity difference was lower, typically two- to three-fold, but was observed in all matched MMR-proficient and -deficient cell pairs. More controversial {{is the role of}} MMR in cellular response to other DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR), topoisomerase poisons, antimetabolites, UV radiation and DNA intercalators. The MMR-dependent DNA damage signalling pathways activated by the above agents are also ill-defined.

We previously showed that a methylating antitumor triazene compound, temozolomide, induces apoptosis and that the persistence of O 6 -methylguanine in DNA is required to trigger the process. We wanted to test whether the latter apoptotic signal is dependent on a functional mismatch repair system. To this end, we used two human lymphoblastoid cell lines (i. e., the mismatch repair-proficient TK 6 line and its mismatch repair-deficient subline MT 1) that are both deficient in O 6 -methylguanine repair. Temozolomide treatment of TK 6 cells brought about efficient cell growth inhibition, G 2 /M arrest, and apoptosis, as indicated by the results of cytofluorimetric analysis of 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine incorporation and DNA content and evaluation of DNA fragmentation. The drug treatment resulted also in the induction of p 53 and p 21 /waf- 1 protein expression. In contrast, MT 1 cells were highly resistant to the drug and no p 53 and p 21 /waf- 1 induction was observed. Importantly, we could show that MT 1 cells are not deficient in the p 53 -dependent apoptosis pathway; treatment with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, resulted in p 53 and p 21 /waf- 1 protein expression and apoptosis in both cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrate the existence of a link between a functional mismatch repair system and the trigger of apoptosis in cells exposed to clinically relevant concentrations of temozolomide. The results also suggest that p 53 induction in response to O 6 -guanine methylation involves the mismatch repair system...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary nonpolyposis {{colon cancer}} (HNPCC) is {{associated}} with malfunction of <b>postreplicative</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> (MMR). While a majority of HNPCC-associated mutations in the MMR genes MLH 1, MSH 2, or MSH 6 genes cause truncations-and thus loss of function [...] of the respective polypeptides, little is currently known about the biochemical defects associated with nontruncating mutations. We studied the interactions of six MLH 1 variants, carrying either missense mutations or in-frame deletions, with normal PMS 2 and tested the functionality of these heterodimers of MLH 1 and PMS 2 (MutL(alpha)) in an in vitro MMR assay. Three MLH 1 carboxy-terminal mutations, consisting of internal deletions of exon 16 (amino acids 578 - 632) or exon 17 (amino acids 633 - 663), or a missense R 659 P mutation in exon 17, affected {{the formation of a}} functional MutL(alpha). Interestingly, mutations C 77 R and I 107 R in the amino-terminal part of MLH 1 did not affect its heterodimerization with PMS 2. The complexes MLH 1 (C 77 R) /PMS 2 and MLH 1 (I 107 R) /PMS 2, however, failed to complement a MMR-deficient extract lacking a functional MutL(alpha). As all these five mutations were identified in typical HNPCC families and produce nonfunctional proteins, they can be considered disease-causing. In contrast, the third amino-terminal mutation S 93 G did not affect the heterodimerization, and the MLH 1 (S 93 G) /PMS 2 variant was functional in the in vitro MMR assay, given thus the nature of the HNPCC family in question. Although the missense mutation segregates with the disease, the mean age of onset in the family is unusually high (approximately 65 years) ...|$|R
40|$|Msh 4 (MutS homolog 4) is {{a member}} of the {{mammalian}} mismatch repair gene family whose members are involved in <b>postreplicative</b> DNA mismatch <b>repair</b> as well as in the control of meiotic recombination. In this report we show that MSH 4 has an essential role in the control of male and female meiosis. We demonstrate that MSH 4 is present in the nuclei of spermatocytes early in prophase I and that it forms discrete foci along meiotic chromosomes during the zygotene and pachytene stages of meiosis. Disruption of the Msh 4 gene in mice results in male and female sterility due to meiotic failure. Although meiosis is initiated in Msh 4 mutant male and female mice, as indicated by the chromosomal localization of RAD 51 and COR 1 during leptonema/zygonema, the chromosomes fail to undergo normal pairing. Our results show that MSH 4 localization on chromosomes during the early stages of meiosis is essential for normal chromosome synapsis in prophase I and that it acts in the same pathway as MSH 5...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} Dam methyltransferase of Haemophilus influenzae was mutagenized by {{the insertion}} of a chloramphenicol-resistance cassette {{into the middle of}} the Dam coding sequence. This mutant construct was introduced into the H. influenzae chromosome by transformation and selection for CamR transformants. The authors have shown that several phenotypic properties, resistance to antibiotics, dyes and detergent as well as efficiency of transformation, depend on the Dam methylation state of the DNA. Although the major role of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system is to <b>repair</b> <b>postreplicative</b> errors, it seems that in H. influenzae its effect is more apparent in repairing DNA damage caused by oxidative compounds. In the dam mutant treated with hydrogen peroxide, MMR is not targeted to newly replicated DNA strands and therefore mismatches are converted into single- and double-strand DNA breaks. This is shown by the increased peroxide sensitivity of the dam mutant and the finding that the sensitivity can be suppressed by a mutH mutation inactivating MMR. In the dam mutant treated with nitrofurazone the resulting damage is not converted into DNA breaks but the high sensitivity is also suppressed by a mutH mutation...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is clear}} that <b>postreplicative</b> DNA {{mismatch}} <b>repair</b> (MMR) plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in nearly all forms of life surveyed, much remains to be understood about the genome-wide impact of MMR on spontaneous mutation processes {{and the extent to which}} MMR-deficient mutation patterns vary among species. We analyzed spontaneous mutation processes across multiple genomic regions using two sets of mismatch repair-deficient (msh- 2 and msh- 6) Caenorhabditis elegans mutation-accumulation (MA) lines and compared our observations to mutation spectra in a set of wild-type (WT), repair-proficient C. elegans MA lines. Across most sequences surveyed in the MMR-deficient MA lines, mutation rates were ∼ 100 -fold higher than rates in the WT MA lines, although homopolymeric nucleotide-run (HP) loci composed of A:T base pairs mutated at an ∼ 500 -fold greater rate. In contrast to yeast and humans where mutation spectra vary substantially with respect to different specific MMR-deficient genotypes, mutation rates and patterns were overall highly similar between the msh- 2 and msh- 6 C. elegans MA lines. This, along with the apparent absence of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH 3 ortholog in the C. elegans genome, suggests that C. elegans MMR surveillance is carried out by a single Msh- 2 /Msh- 6 heterodimer...|$|R
40|$|A {{major role}} of the methyl-directed {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system of Escherichia coli is to <b>repair</b> <b>postreplicative</b> errors. In this report, we provide evidence that MMR also acts on oxidized DNA, preventing mutagenesis. When cells deficient in MMR are grown anaerobically, spontaneous mutation frequencies are reduced {{compared with those of}} the same cells grown aerobically. In addition, we show that a dam mutant has an increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide treatment that can be suppressed by mutations that inactivate MMR. In a dam mutant, MMR is not targeted to newly replicated DNA strands and therefore mismatches are converted to single- and double-strand DNA breaks. Thus, base pairs containing oxidized bases will be converted to strand breaks if they are repaired by MMR. This is demonstrated by the increased peroxide sensitivity of a dam mutant and the finding that the sensitivity can be suppressed by mutations inactivating MMR. We demonstrate further that this repair activity results from MMR recognition of base pairs containing 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) based on the finding that overexpression of the MutM oxidative repair protein, which repairs 8 -oxoG, can suppress the mutH-dependent increase in transversion mutations. These findings demonstrate that MMR has the ability to prevent oxidative mutagenesis either by removing 8 -oxoG directly or by removing adenine misincorporated opposite 8 -oxoG or both...|$|R
40|$|Myco{{bacterium}} smegmatis is {{a bacterium}} that is naturally devoid of known <b>postreplicative</b> DNA mismatch <b>repair</b> (MMR) homologs, mutS and mutL, providing {{an opportunity to}} investigate how the mutation rate and spectrum has evolved {{in the absence of}} a highly conserved primary repair pathway. Mutation accumulation experiments of M. smegmatis yielded a base-substitution mutation rate of 5. 27  ×  10 − 10 per site per generation, or 0. 0036 per genome per generation, which is surprisingly similar to the mutation rate in MMR-functional unicellular organisms. Transitions were found more frequently than transversions, with the A:T→G:C transition rate significantly higher than the G:C→A:T transition rate, opposite to what is observed in most studied bacteria. We also found that the transition-mutation rate of M. smegmatis is significantly lower than that of other naturally MMR-devoid or MMR-knockout organisms. Two possible candidates that could be responsible for maintaining high DNA fidelity in this MMR-deficient organism are the ancestral-like DNA polymerase DnaE 1, which contains a highly efficient DNA proofreading histidinol phosphatase (PHP) domain, and/or the existence of a uracil-DNA glycosylase B (UdgB) homolog that might protect the GC-rich M. smegmatis genome against DNA damage arising from oxidation or deamination. Our results suggest that M. smegmatis has a noncanonical Dam (DNA adenine methylase) methylation system, with target motifs differing from those previously reported. The mutation features of M. smegmatis provide further evidence that genomes harbor alternative routes for improving replication fidelity, even in the absence of major repair pathways...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{sequences}} of mono-, di-, and trinucleotide repeats {{are prone to}} replication errors and thus constitute mutational hot spots. This is well illustrated by the occurrence of DNA microsatellite instability in tumors from patients affected by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) resulting from a defect in a gene that participates in <b>postreplicative</b> DNA mismatch <b>repair</b> (MMR). We selected repeat sequences present within coding regions of four genes involved in either cell proliferation or promotion of apoptosis. These repeats consisted of (A) 10 in the TGF beta RII, (G) 8 in the BAX, (A) 8 in the CASP 1, and (CCA) 7 in the APP genes. These repeats were analyzed in ten tumors from HNPCC patients carrying a germline pathogenic mutation in the MMR gene MLH 1. For each tumor the rate of somatic replication errors was measured by sequencing 20 - 50 cloned PCR-amplified fragments. Substantial intertumor variations were observed {{in the pattern of}} repeat alterations, with error rates varying between 12 % and 80 % for TGF beta RII, 2 % and 84 % for BAX, 0 % and 30 % for CASP 1, and 0 % to 18 % for APP. The BAX repeat error rate did not exceed 20 % in nine of the ten tumors, in contrast to results from previous studies. High error rates in more than one gene in a same tumor suggested additive selective effects from inactivation of different pathways influencing tumorigenesis. Our methodology can contribute to define tumor characteristics and may, if applied to genes strongly involved in tumorigenesis, improve tumor classification and outcome prediction...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{survival of}} a species depends on faithful passage of genetic material from one cell to its daughters. Replicative polymerases possess low error rates, but, in spite of this, 1 / 107 nucleotides escape their proof reading activity. These biosynthetic errors have to be corrected by <b>postreplicative</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> (MMR), which improves replication fidelity by two to three orders of magnitude. The importance of MMR is beyond doubt – its malfunction brings about a mutator phenotype, which was shown to be the underlying cause of Lynch Syndrome, a predisposition to early-onset cancer of the colon, endometrium, ovary and other organs. We hypothesized that MMR might interfere with chromatin packaging, as rapid assembly of nucleosomes behind the replication fork would most likely hinder the mismatch recognition factor MutSa from binding mismatches and initiating their repair. To study the interplay of MMR and chromatin assembly, {{we set up a}} biochemical system using human cell extracts that were proficient for both chromatin assembly and MMR. As anticipated, mismatch-containing plasmids carrying preassembled nucleosomes were poor substrates for MMR. In contrast, ongoing MMR interfered with nucleosome deposition. CAF- 1, the mediator of chromatin assembly, and the MSH 6 subunit of the mismatch recognition factor MutSa both interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the processivity factor of replicative DNA polymerases. We therefore postulated that PCNA might govern the balance between MMR and chromatin assembly. We found, however, that this regulation might be more complex than foreseen, as MutSa and CAF- 1 interact not only with PCNA, but also with each other. Recent literature implicated MMR proteins, in addition to the repair of biosynthetic errors, also in DNA damage response, triplet repeat stability, mitotic and meiotic recombination, the repair of interstrand cross-links and antibody diversification. Antibody diversification consists of three processes affecting immunoglobulin (Ig) loci: V(D) J recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). CSR endows antibodies with different effector functions. It is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which converts cytosines to uracils and thus gives rise to U/G mispairs. Surprisingly, metabolism of U/Gs in activated B-cells is inefficient and gives rise to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), one of the key prerequisites for CSR. Genetic data implicate two DNA repair pathways in the processing of these mismatches: base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR). In order to dissect the molecular mechanism of the roles of these repair pathways in the processing of U/G mispairs, we generated substrates containing uracils at defined positions and incubated them with extracts of human cells. We found that the induction of DSBs was dependent on the BER enzyme uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) and on the MMR factor MutSa, whereas MutLa was only found to participate in a subset of events and its contribution depended on its endonucleolytic activity. Given that interference of BER and MMR is not restricted to B-cells, it may pose a general threat to genomic integrity...|$|R
40|$|The cohesin {{complexes}} play a {{key role}} in chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. They establish sister chromatid cohesion between duplicating DNA molecules during S-phase, but they also have an important role during <b>postreplicative</b> double-strand break <b>repair</b> in mitosis, as well as during recombination between homologous chromosomes in meiosis. An additional function in meiosis is related to the sister kinetochore cohesion, so they can be pulled by microtubules to the same pole at anaphase I. Data about the dynamics of cohesin subunits during meiosis are scarce; therefore, it is of great interest to characterize how the formation of the cohesin complexes is achieved in order to understand the roles of the different subunits within them. We have investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of three different cohesin subunits in prophase I grasshopper spermatocytes. We found that structural maintenance of chromosome protein 3 (SMC 3) appears as early as preleptotene, and its localization resembles the location of the unsynapsed axial elements, whereas radiation-sensitive mutant 21 (RAD 21) (sister chromatid cohesion protein 1, SCC 1) and stromal antigen protein 1 (SA 1) (sister chromatid cohesion protein 3, SCC 3) are not visualized until zygotene, since they are located in the synapsed regions of the bivalents. During pachytene, the distribution of the three cohesin subunits is very similar and all appear along the trajectories of the lateral elements of the autosomal synaptonemal complexes. However, whereas SMC 3 also appears over the single and unsynapsed X chromosome, RAD 21 and SA 1 do not. We conclude that the loading of SMC 3 and the non-SMC subunits, RAD 21 and SA 1, occurs in different steps throughout prophase I grasshopper meiosis. These results strongly suggest the participation of SMC 3 in the initial cohesin axis formation as early as preleptotene, thus contributing to sister chromatid cohesion, with a later association of both RAD 21 and SA 1 subunits at zygotene to reinforce and stabilize the bivalent structure. Therefore, we speculate that more than one cohesin complex participates in the sister chromatid cohesion at prophase I...|$|R
