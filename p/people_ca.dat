40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to develop a framework of trust determinants in the interactions between people and cognitive assistants (CAs). We define CAs as new decision tools, able to provide people with high quality recommendations and help them make data-driven decisions understanding the environment around people. We also define trust as the belief of <b>people</b> that <b>CAs</b> will help them reach a desired decision. An extensive review on trust in psychology, sociology, economics and policy making, organizational science, automation, and robotics is conducted to determine the factors influence <b>people’s</b> trust on <b>CAs.</b> On the basis of this review, we develop a framework of trust determinants in <b>people’s</b> interaction with <b>CAs</b> where reliability, attractiveness, and emotional attachment positively affect the intention of people in society to use CAs. Our framework also shows that innovativeness positively moderates the intention to use CAs. Finally, in this paper, we suggest future research directions for developing and validating more concrete scales in measuring trust determinants in the interactions between <b>people</b> and <b>CAs...</b>|$|R

5000|$|After a {{four-year}} moratorium on executions in California, multiple proceedings in federal court, a state administrative law proceeding, and state court appeals, it is incredible {{to think that}} the deliberative process might be driven by the expiration date of the execution drug. U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 2010 [...] It is absurd that our legal system continues to prevent the state from carrying out the will of the <b>people.</b> <b>CA</b> Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 2010 On September 27, Marin County judge Verna Adams denied a defense request to stop the execution. An appeal for clemency was forwarded to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Prosecutor Rod Pacheco wrote to Schwarzenegger urging him not to intervene. The governor refused Brown's request to commute the sentence to life imprisonment without parole, but delayed the execution to 9 p.m. on September 30 to provide appeals courts more time to review the case. Brown alleged that he suffered child abuse that should have been brought up at his trial. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Fogel to revisit the case because California law specified that the inmate should only choose between the gas chamber and lethal injection, not the drugs themselves. Fogel admitted his offer to Brown was [...] "ill-advised" [...] and halted the execution to permit time to determine whether the new injection procedures addressed defense arguments of cruel and unusual punishment. The appeals court also noted that the prison's supply of sodium thiopental, a drug required for lethal injection, was expiring on October 1. A state appeal to resume the execution by 7 p.m. on September 30 was unanimously denied by the California Supreme Court. California and other states had run short of the drug because the manufacturer Hospira is unable to meet demand at least until January 2011 because of raw material supply issues. State attorney general Jerry Brown (no relation) recommended halting execution proceedings until necessary supplies were secured. His office stated that a new date would be scheduled as soon as legally possible.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One of the {{defining}} trends of the 1990 s {{has been the}} explosive growth of the Internet.

These trends present us with a number of challenges: Enabling ubiquitous reachability. Most people will continue to use a variety of network-enabled devices and applications to communicate with others. The notion of a onesize -fits-all communication device is just as misguided as a universal network link or operating system.

40|$|ABSTRACT Various nonelectrolyte meal {{components}} such as glucose and lysine enhance gastrointestinal calcium absorption under experimental conditions. The {{effect of}}a mixed meal on Ca absorption from Ca supplements is unknown. The effect of glucose polymer on Ca absorption when ingested with food also is unknown. Using a single-day method, we measured net Ca absorption from Ca carbonate when ingested in fasting state, with a steak and potatoes meal, {{and with the}} meal and 50 g glucose polymer. Eight healthy human subjects were studied after a 500 -mg elemental Ca dose. Mean net Ca absorption was 195 ± 18 mg (4. 87 ± 0. 45 mmol) fasting, 2 1 3 ± 2 1 mg (5. 3 1 ± 0. 52 mmol) with a meal, and 179 ± 16 mg (4. 47 ± 0. 40 mmol) with a meal plus glucose polymer.

40|$|Healthcare is {{important}} to people, especially to elderly people who lives independently. Since Internet services are getting reliable and stable, the tele-healthcare systems built on the Internet can be good supports to the traditional home healthcare centres and hospitals. The Internet-based tele-healthcare systems use Internet and specific modules can decrease the healthcare costs for patients and organization; can relieve the health professional shortage (at all levels) and the limit of institutional beds situations; and, can reduce unnecessary medical facility visits as well as examinations. Furthermore, such systems can reduce time costs, for instance, elderly people don't need {{to travel to the}} hospitals just for figuring out their health conditions. This research uses state-and-transition graph to analyze and build tele-healthcare system. The state-and-transition graph makes the healthcare process such as the care-giving tasks and status become crystal clear, and the token-based flow can help the care service providers (e. g. healthcare organizations and caregivers) ensure that the correct care services/actions have given at right time as well as avoid the possible mistakes which may be made by caregivers accidentally.

Driven {{by the need to}} detect the presence of HCV, as an essential factor in diagnostic medicine, the monitoring of viral protein has been of great interest in developing simple and reliable HCV detection methods. Despite considerable advances in viral protein detection as an HCV disease marker, the current enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based detection methods using antibody treatment have several drawbacks. To overcome this bottleneck, an RNA aptamer become to be emerged as an antibody substitute in the application of biosensor for detection of viral protein. In this study, we demonstrated a streptavidin-biotin conjugation method, namely, the RNA aptamer sensor system that can quantify viral protein with detection level of 700 pg mL− 1 using a biotinylated RNA oligonucleotide on an Octet optical biosensor. Also, we showed this method can be used to screen inhibitors of viral protein rapidly and simply on a biotinylated RNA oligonucleotide biosensor. Among the inhibitors screened, (−) -Epigallocatechin gallate showed high binding inhibition effect on HCV NS 5 B viral protein. The proposed method can be considered a real-time monitoring method for inhibitor screening of HCV viral protein and is expected to be applicable to other types of diseases...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the age, {{origins and}} {{extinction}} of oceanic island biota has captivated {{the interest of}} evolutionary biologists since Darwin and Wallace. Because oceanic islands are discrete entities of small geographical size but with considerable habitat diversity, they provide ideal templates within which to study evolutionary processes. The peripheral North Atlantic islands, collectively referred to as Macaronesia, are considered a hot spot of biodiversity {{due to the fact}} that they contain a large proportion of endemic taxa (ca 25 %). Recent molecular studies are providing insight into the patterns of colonization and radiation within the extant avifauna, while paleontological studies have described many extinct avian species, sometimes identifying the causes and chronology of extinction. The aim of this review is to develop an understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the macaronesian avifauna, combining information from phylogenetic and paleontological studies. We then compare patterns for Macaronesia with those of other oceanic archipelagos to evaluate to what extent patterns may be generalised across regions. Phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the close relationships between endemic macaronesian avifauna and the closest mainland areas (Europe and Africa), however, in contrast to other archipelagos of a similar age, we show that most extant birds appear to have colonized macaronesian archipelagos relatively recently, within the last four million years, despite some islands being approximately 30 million years old. Fossil records support the idea that higher species richness previously existed, with recent dating on bone collagen of selected extinct species suggesting that their extinction coincided with the arrival of aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>ca</b> 2500 years ago in the Canary Islands, or the arrival of Europeans across all the macaronesian islands in the 14 th century. It is plausible that these human mediated extinctions may have selectively acted upon older lineages, but there is little evidence available to evaluate this...|$|E
