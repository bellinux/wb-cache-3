5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E

5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E

According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

The new hospital was opened by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, on 18 March 1948. It is the largest hospital in Gateshead and has since been expanded, most notably with the opening of the North East NHS Surgery Centre in 2008, which cost £13.3 million.|$|E

5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used a <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> the Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having {{to abide by the}} regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E

Such an act was illegal in Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society petitioned Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin to demand punishment of the three men by the Governor of Virginia.

That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the redesign of United States coins, if the former design had been struck for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, a <b>provision</b> <b>in</b> the latter act made them eligible for immediate redesign. In 1896, pattern nickels were struck {{for the first time since}} 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested; however, no redesign took place.|$|E
40|$|Public {{participation}} {{has become}} a legal component of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system. There are various public participation <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> EIA-related legislation. These public participation provisions have experienced different development stages in different countries and their developments {{have been influenced by}} various factors. In many developing countries, there are still some unclear public participation <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> their own EIA legislation and these vague provisions have influenced the implementation of public participation in the EIA process. This research aims to develop a comprehensive analytical framework for classifying and characterizing public participation <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> EIA legislation and identify the factors influencing the development of EIA public participation <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> developing countries. In this research, the developed framework has been applied to analyze the EIA public participation <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> 36 developing countries and its usefulness has been demonstrated. In addition, three developing countries (i. e. China, India and Indonesia) are selected as in-depth case studies. The influencing factors and the implementation situations of EIA public participation <b>provisions</b> <b>in</b> these three countries have been identified. The research results have revealed that at present, for the developing countries, their current public participation provisions need to be further improved based on the country-specific situation, and most importantly, the governments should ensure the effective implementation of public participation provisions and avoid the token implementation, in order to ensure true and meaningful public participation in the EIA process...|$|R
