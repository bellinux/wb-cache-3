5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} treatises on famine relief goes back more than 2000 years. This treatise is commonly attributed to Kautilya, who recommended that a good king should build new forts and water-works and share his provisions with the people, or entrust the country to another king. Historically, Indian rulers have employed several methods of famine relief. Some of these were direct, such as initiating free distribution of food grains and throwing open grain stores and kitchens to the people. Other measures were monetary policies such as remission of revenue, remission of taxes, increase of pay to soldiers, and <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>advances.</b> Yet other measures included construction of public works, canals, and embankments, and sinking wells.

Within these arrangements, the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>advances</b> {{is a form}} of credit interlinking that addresses the isolation of rural-based enterprises from the formal finance sector. This viewpoint motivates specification of a testable hypothesis: advance payments are greater the more remote a rural-based subcontractor is from the urban center. The paper shows that such a hypothesis can be derived from a simple principal-agent model of the subcontracting relation. Moreover, the hypothesis is empirically confirmed by multivariate analysis of data from a case study of garment and metalcraft industries in the Philippines. The finding supports the view that subcontracting arrangements may be an organizational form appropriate to rural industrialization. Interlinked contracts, rural industrialization...|$|E
