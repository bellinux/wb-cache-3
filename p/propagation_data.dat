40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} {{to compute}} the optimal parameters of a probabilistic <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSN). The probabilistic <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm we consider was introduced in previous work, and {{it is known that}} this algorithm, when used with adequate parameters, balances the energy consumption and increases the lifespan of the WSN. However, we show that in the general case achieving energy balance may not be possible. We propose a centralised algorithm computing the optimal parameters of the probabilistic <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm, and prove that these parameters maximize the lifespan of the network even when {{it is not possible to}} achieve energy balance. Compared to previous work, our contribution is the following: (a) We give a formal definition of an optimal <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm: an algorithm maximizing the lifespan of the network. (b) We find a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm to be optimal. (c) We constructively prove that there exists a choice of parameters optimizing the probabilistic <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm. (d) We provide a centralised algorithm computing these optimal parameters, thus enabling their use in a WSN. (e) We extend previous work by considering the energy consumption per sensor, instead of the consumption per slice, and propose a spreading technique to balance the energy among sensors of a same slice. The technique is numerically validated by simulating a WSN accomplishing a data monitoring task and propagating data using the probabilistic <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm with optimal parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} fatigue crack growth models based on elastic–plastic stress–strain {{histories}} {{at the crack}} tip region and local strain-life damage models have been proposed in literature. The fatigue crack growth {{is regarded as a}} process of continuous crack initializations over successive elementary material blocks, which may be governed by smooth strain-life damage data. Some approaches account for the residual stresses developing at the crack tip in the actual crack driving force assessment, allowing mean stresses and loading sequential effects to be modelled. An extension of the fatigue crack propagation model originally proposed by Noroozi et al. (2005) to derive probabilistic fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data</b> is proposed, in particular concerning the derivation of probabilistic da/dN-ΔK-R fields. The elastic-plastic stresses at the vicinity of the crack tip, computed using simplified formulae, are compared with the stresses computed using an elasticplastic finite element analyses for specimens considered in the experimental program proposed to derive the fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data.</b> Using probabilistic strain-life data available for the S 355 structural mild steel, probabilistic crack propagation fields are generated, for several stress ratios, and compared with experimental fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data.</b> A satisfactory agreement between the predicted probabilistic fields and experimental data is observed...|$|E

40|$|Following a short introduction, the {{state-of-the-art}} {{fatigue life}} assessment methods {{based on the}} nominal stress, the structural hot spot stress and the effective notch stress, {{as well as the}} crack propagation analysis are explained and discussed. Thereafter, the effect of mean stress on crack propagation was investigated by exemplifying crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data</b> from different aluminium alloys. In this context, Walker's equation received wide attention. In addition, a new, simple equation to express the mean stress dependency of crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data</b> has been proposed. In order to generate crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data</b> for the 6082 -T 6 aluminium alloy, investigate the behaviour of short cracks and find the mean stress dependency of crack growth in this alloy, crack propagation tests of sub-millimetre cracks subjected to different stress ratios have been carried out. The crack depth was successfully monitored on-line employing a special direct current potential drop technique. The crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data</b> generated verified the long crack <b>propagation</b> <b>data</b> given in Eurocode 9. In addition, useful experience was gained to improve future tests. Some evidence was found of accelerated crack growth near the threshold. Based on the data obtained and literature data a Walker exponent γ= 0. 78 has been calculated for the aluminium alloy 6082 -T 6. The fatigue life of welded aluminium T-joints has been estimated using the approaches introduced in Chapter 2. The results have been compared with experimental data from T-joints subjected to 4 -point bending. In addition, a series of T-joints subjected to transverse bending has been fatigue tested and the results have been compared with predictions using the same fatigue life assessment methods. The nominal stress gave a conservative prediction in case of the 4 -point bending loading. Since no applicable detail category for the transverse bending load case exists, a suitable detail category has been suggested. The structural hot spot stress approach resulted in conservative predictions (factor 4 - 10 in life) for both load cases. The predictions from the effective notch stress approach are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, where the method using a 1 mm weld toe radius gave the best results. It has been shown that the method can be successfully applied to joints with wall thicknesses down to 3 mm. The fatigue life predicted with the crack propagation approaches is in excellent agreement with the experimental results from the 4 -point bending load when the M k factor was used. Applying the local stress distribution, the predictions are conservative for both load cases. The slopes of all predicted S-N curves, especially from the stress based methods, are steeper than the experimental curves. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|A major {{obstacle}} for {{the adoption of}} cloud services in enterprises is the potential loss of control over sensitive data. Companies often have to safeguard a subset of their data because {{it is crucial to}} their business or they are required to do so by law. In contrast, cloud service providers handle enterprise data without providing guarantees and may put confidentiality at risk. In order to maintain control over their sensitive data, companies typically block all access {{to a wide range of}} cloud services at the network level. Such restrictions significantly reduce employee productivity while offering limited practical protection in the presence of malicious employees. In this paper, we suggest a practical mechanism to ensure that an enterprise maintains control of its sensitive data while employees are allowed to use cloud services. We observe that most cloud services use HTTP as a transport protocol. Since HTTP offers welldefined methods to transfer files, inspecting HTTP messages allows the <b>propagation</b> of <b>data</b> between the enterprise and cloud services to be monitored independently of the implementation of specific cloud services. Our system, CLOUDFILTER, intercepts file transfers to cloud services, performs logging and enforces <b>data</b> <b>propagation</b> policies.
