40|$|While {{equality}} of rights {{between men and}} women is a generally recognised principle, much remains to be done to ensure its effective application. The meagre results obtained in Western Europe under equal pay or equal treatment legislation have led a number of countries to enact laws providing for <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> to correct discriminatory practices and alter {{the rules of the game}} on the labour market. A theoretical analysis of <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> for women is made. -from AuthorSCOPUS: NotDefined. jFLWNOinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Scottish housing organizations, where the {{relative}} absence {{of black and}} minority ethnic employees is beginning {{to be addressed by}} <b>programmes</b> of <b>positive</b> <b>action.</b> The paper defines <b>positive</b> <b>action,</b> discusses experiences elsewhere in Europe and the USA, and identifies issues that have arisen from such programmes. Schemes targeted at the housing profession, such as PATH in both England and Scotland, are described in some detail. The attitudes and experiences of Scottish housing organizations were examined as part of an evaluation of the Scottish PATH programme carried out in 1998, and these are discussed. The paper concludes that a reservoir of goodwill exists towards <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> {{and that there is a}} need for such programmes to be extended, possibly with the support of the Scottish Parliament...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people from}} ethnic {{minorities}} experience disadvantage in the labour market {{in comparison to}} the white population. In general, they have lower employmen rates, suffer higher levels of unemployment, longer periods of unemployment, occupational and industrial segregation and lower earnings. However, different groups experience different levels of disadvantage. Whilst African Asians and Chinese experience broad parity with the white population, Indians and Caribbeans experience some disadvantage and Pakistanis and Bangladeshis experience 'severe' disadvantage. This thesis reports upon research based on an in-depth case study in Bristol and evaluates the <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> training <b>programme</b> delivered by an ethnic minority training provider.

40|$|Abstract   This paper {{focuses on}} whether {{individual}} development plans {{as well as}} <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed. Pupils in need of particular support get {{to be involved in}} an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> – the school needs to provide any particular support a pupil needs. However, the individual development plan does not substitute the <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> as well as an individual development plan will be provided to students in need of particular support. The individual development plan follows the pupil throughout the entire education, regardless of whether its content changes, whilst the <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> pertains to a limited period of time. Pupils that are not in need of particular support are not likely to need to set goals for themselves in addition to those already set outside of school. An <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is primarily concerned with affecting the conditions under which the pupils carry out their work.   The results of my study indicate that the individual development plan is yet another duty on part of the teachers, but with exceptionally scarce repayment. According to teachers at the school explored, the individual development plan generates little or no progress for pupils already involved in an <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> A thoroughly crafted <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is sufficient, according to teachers participating in the study. A pupil not in need of particular support will not need the individual development plan either, according to the teachers – it would merely be another paper to look at during development talks, but it would not benefit the pupil or the teacher...|$|R

40|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>action</b> is {{measures}} that usually constitute discrimination but which are justified when achieving {{the purpose of}} an effective equality between people of the society. <b>Positive</b> <b>action</b> regarding gender is regulated in primary law, secondary law and case law of the EU whereas <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> regarding other discrimination groups is regulated in secondary law and negligible regulated in case law.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} management's {{perception}} {{of affirmative action}} for affirmative change. A questionnaire, developed to measure attitudes towards the implementation of an affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programme,</b> was distributed to managers {{at all levels of}} management in a parastatal. Results supply evidence of a negative orientation towards affirmative action amongst younger managers. They hold the view that members of disadvantaged groups are favoured at their expense. Younger managers also perceive older managers not to have the necessary vision and skills to implement an affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> successfully. It is recommended that line management encourage communication between the different race groups, and develop positive attitudes and expectations towards the employers, the affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> and the various jobs available...|$|R
40|$|Trade-offs between {{competitive}} {{priorities are}} {{often seen as}} exogenous – managers accept them as a given downside while simultaneously addressing multiple competitive priorities. However, some companies seem to face fewer trade-offs than others. The question is how companies reduce their trade-offs to successfully compete on multiple competitive priorities simultaneously. We address this question by theorising that bundles of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed to reduce trade-offs between competitive priorities. We examine four Swiss manufacturing plants and show how the selection of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> influences the simultaneous competition on multiple competitive priorities. We show that successful competition on multiple competitive priorities does not happen by accident but is achieved by aligning competitive priorities, <b>action</b> <b>programmes,</b> infrastructural/structural changes and contextual factors...|$|R

The thesis is composed of three main chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> measures. First chapter is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis. This chapter is subdivided into two different sections. Section one explains what the concept of <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> means including classification of its different types and provides justification of its application. Second section focuses on the relationship between <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> measures and the concepts of equality and non-discrimination. Second chapter examines the relevant provisions of EU law which deal with the <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> measures in different areas of application of EU law with special attention to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Third chapter is subdivided into three sections and provides an outline of relevant case law of ECJ in the area of judicial review of <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> measures.
