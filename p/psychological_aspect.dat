Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who have been critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a <b>psychological</b> <b>aspect</b> to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
500|$|The total {{construction}} cost of Boden Fortresssomewhere around 20 million kronor at the timewould {{correspond to}} almost 1 billion kronor (as of 2011) {{according to the}} consumer price index which the government agency Statistics Sweden uses. Despite this, the cost has been claimed to correspond to 4 billion kronor of today, and it has also been claimed that the project was more expensive than the JAS 39 Gripen project, which cost 106 billion kronor in total, each aircraft costing between 300 and 500 million kronor depending on what to include in the calculation. No matter what the actual cost was, opinions on Boden Fortress differ markedly, from being called a boastful project and the [...] "JAS project of the turn of the century" [...] to {{one of the reasons that}} kept Sweden out of two World Wars. The fortress also had a <b>psychological</b> <b>aspect,</b> in that its mere existence kept a firm grip of peoples' mindsessentially functioning as a morale boosterduring times when Sweden was in the shadow of war.|$|E

Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event a 6 out of 10, which {{was lower than}} the 8 out of 10 given to the 2006 Lockdown event by Chris Sokol. A rating was not given to TNA's previous event Destination X, but Clevett gave a rating of 7 out of 10 in his review of TNA's Against All Odds. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania 21 PPV event held on April4, Lockdown was rated lower, Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk gave WrestleMania a 7 out of 10. Regarding the overall event, Clevett felt the all cage match format was [...] "too {{much of a good}} thing". He went on to state {{that by the end of}} the event he [...] "was tired of seeing the cage", but that Styles and Abyss [...] "quickly brought my interest back with a brutal and fun bout that ended off the show on a positive note". When speaking of the TNA X Division Championship match, Clevett wrote that he felt it [...] "was technically a very good match", but he [...] "expected more considering the talent involved". However, he felt that the <b>psychological</b> <b>aspect</b> was [...] "excellent" [...] regarding the two former Triple X partners' counters of each other's moves. Clevett gave the highest match rating of 8.5 out of 10 to the main event, while he gave the lowest rating of 2 out of 10 to the Prince of Darkness match. He gave the Lethal Lockdown match a 5 out of 10, while he gave the X Division Title match an 8 out of 10.|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} researches {{showed that}} alliance performance was normally {{influenced by the}} structural aspects as well as <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects.</b> The structural aspects involves the characteristics of an alliance such as resource uniqueness, organization culture, number of partners, etc. <b>Psychological</b> <b>aspects</b> which are also called as relational capital determine the quality of collaboration. There are three key aspects of relational capital, namely, trust, commitment and communication. The previous researches examined the direct impact of structural and <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects</b> on alliance performance respectively, however, limited {{attention has been paid}} to treating those aspects as multiple and interrelated dependence relationships. This research attempts to examine how structural and <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects</b> interrelatedly affect alliance performance. This research uses 7 latent variables which consist of 3 exogenous constructs and 4 endogenous ones. The impact of structural and <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects</b> that are interrelatedly dependent on alliance performance was analyzed by AMOS 4. 01. Results show that there are significant interrelated dependence relationships among constructs. Structural aspects have significant direct impact on <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects.</b> Both structural and <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects</b> have significant direct impact on alliance performance. This research also shows that structural aspects have significant indirect impact on alliance performance through <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects</b> as mediating variables. The results support the stated hypotheses which were developed based on several previous researches. Alliance performance is the function of both structural and <b>psychological</b> <b>aspects.</b> Both of these aspects must be taken into consideration by partners entering into an alliance...|$|R

2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the <b>psychological</b> <b>aspect</b> of his work – in fact I sometimes felt as if I had been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|Cats also display pica {{behavior}} {{in their natural}} environments and {{there is evidence to}} support that this behavior has a <b>psychological</b> <b>aspect</b> to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common. [...] Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. Eating wool or other substances may be a soothing mechanism that cats develops to cope with the changes. Pica is also observed predominately during 6–8 months of a cat's life when territorial and sexual behaviors emerge. Pica may be induced by these social stressors. [...] Other theories contemplated include pica as a redirection of prey-catching/ingestion behavior as a result of indoor confinement, especially common among oriental breeds due to risk of theft. [...] In natural environments pica has been observed in parrots (such as macaws) and other birds and mammals. Charles Munn has been studying Amazon macaws lick clay from riverbeds in the Amazon to detoxify the seeds they eat. Amazon macaws spend two to three hours a day licking clay. [...] Munn has found that clay helps counter the tannin and alkaloid in the seeds the macaws ingest, a strategy that is also used by native cultures in the Andes Mountains in Peru.|$|E
