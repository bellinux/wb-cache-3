40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the frictional force between the archwire and orthodontic bracket generated by elastomeric ligatures with polymer coating (Super slick, TP Orthodontics) and conventional ligatures (Morelli) using {{two types of}} insertion techniques. METHODS: Forty elastomeric ligatures, 20 with polymer coating and 20 conventional, were evaluated. Each <b>type</b> of <b>ligature</b> was separated into two groups (n= 10), according to the insertion mode: conventional or crossed (from mesial to distal region crossed in front). To analyze friction, 40 5 -cm-long segments of stainless steel orthodontic archwire 0. 019 " x 0. 025 " (Morelli) and Edgewise brackets (slot 0. 022 " x 0. 028 "; Morelli) were used. Each set (bracket, wire and elastic) was submitted to frictional testing in a universal test machine (Instron 4411) at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Each bracket was moved 5 mm on the wire, with maximum friction and mean friction being recorded by software. Three readouts were taken for each bracket. Data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: It was shown that for maximum and mean friction, the polymer-coated ligature did not differ statistically from the conventional type in a dry environment condition. Ligatures placed in crossed mode promoted significantly greater friction than those placed in conventional mode, irrespective of the <b>type</b> of elastomeric <b>ligature.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Friction depended on the insertion mode, {{but not on the}} <b>type</b> of elastomeric <b>ligature...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the in vitro behavior of JAL 90458 as a buffering agent which reduces friction between brackets and stainless steel arch wires of different cross sections and sizes.

Methods: Four brackets were mounted on a custom metal fixture allowing an 0. 018 -in stainless steel wire attached to an opposite fixture with one bracket to be passively centered in the bracket slot. The wire was ligated to the bracket using one of five <b>types</b> of <b>ligatures</b> including the low friction test ligatures (AO), conventional ligatures (AO), Sili–TiesTM, Silicone Infused Ties (GAC), Synergy® Low-Friction Ligatures (RMO), and SuperSlick ligatures (TP Orthodontics). Resistance to sliding was measured over a 7 mm sliding distance using a universal testing machine (Instron) with a 50 Newton load cell and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The initial resistance to sliding (static) {{was determined by the}} peak force needed to initiate movement and the kinetic resistance to sliding was taken as the force at 5 mm of wire/bracket sliding. Fifteen unique tests were run for each ligature group in both dry and wet (saliva soaked for 24 hours with one drop prior to testing) conditions. Results: In the dry state, the SuperSlick ligature demonstrated more static friction than all of the other ligatures, while SuperSlick and Sili–Ties demonstrated more kinetic friction than the AO conventional, AO experimental and Synergy ligatures. In the wet condition, SuperSlick and the AO experimental ligature demonstrated the least static friction, followed by the AO conventional and Sili–Ties. The most static friction was observed with the Synergy ligatures. In the wet condition, the SuperSlick, AO experimental and AO conventional exhibited less kinetic friction than the Sili-Ties and Synergy ligatures. Conclusions: AO 2 ̆ 7 s experimental ligature exhibits less friction in the wet state than conventional ligatures, Sili–Ties and Synergy and is comparable to the SuperSlick ligature.

Coating elastomeric ligatures with a hydrophobic polymeric substance has been suggested as a methodology in reducing friction at the archwire-bracket interface and in repelling salivary adherends. A new polymeric coated ligature tie - Super Slick Ties™ (SST), manufactured using Metafasix technology, has been marketed by TP laboratories for potential reduction in treatment time. Aim: The basic in vitro design is to compare the frictional characteristics of the coated ligatures with those of uncoated ligatures in four different archwires, namely, stainless steel, NiTi, TMA, and Timolium. Materials and Methods: Four archwires used are stainless steel archwires, TMA archwires, Timolium, NiTi archwires, and two <b>types</b> of elastomeric <b>ligatures</b> (the coated and uncoated ligatures) were used.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{traditional}} {{measure of}} success after exclusion and bypass of popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) is graft patency. In addition to fate of the bypass, we hypothesize that late outcome after surgical treatment of PAA is influenced by completeness of exclusion. Methods: Thirty patients who underwent 41 reconstructions for PAA over a 10 -year period were reviewed. Results: Excluded PAAs were examined with duplex ultrasound scan for size, patency, and patent feeding branches; bypass grafts and native inflow and outflow arteries were examined for patency and size. Thirty-six limbs were available for follow-up (mean follow-up period, 46 ± 42 months). Only two aneurysms (5. 6 %) appeared patent on duplex ultrasound scan, but five limbs had patent arterial branches communicating with thrombosed excluded PAAs. PAA diameter decreased from 2. 5 ± 0. 8 cm to 1. 7 ± 0. 5 cm (P <. 0001) in most. However, 12 excluded PAAs (33 %) showed significant enlargement from 2. 2 ± 0. 9 cm to 2. 8 ± 1. 0 cm (P =. 002). A quarter of enlarging excluded PAA were associated with new compressive symptoms. Three methods of PAA exclusion were used: proximal and distal ligation with short segment isolation (type 1), proximal and distal ligation with long segment isolation (type 2), and single <b>ligature</b> (<b>type</b> 3). In univariate analysis, type of exclusion significantly influenced late size of excluded PAA (P =. 004). Type 1 exclusion was superior to both type 2 and 3 exclusions in producing aneurysm diameter reduction. Type 3 exclusion resulted in aneurysm growth. In addition, excluded aneurysms with visualized feeding branches were associated with significant growth compared with PAAs without feeding branches (P =. 006). Graft primary and assisted primary patency rates at 5 years were 86 % ± 9. 4 % and 92 % ± 7. 4 %, respectively. Although graft diameter and native donor artery diameter significantly increased, this did not adversely affect graft patency. Conclusion: Enlargement of excluded PAA after surgical treatment can cause compressive symptoms. Exclusion requires adequate vascular isolation to prevent late PAA enlargement, with proximal and distal arterial ligation best performed adjacent to the aneurysm. Vein graft enlargement occurs, but this enlargement does not adversely influence patency. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 392 - 8. ...|$|R
