By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States. and the bulk in PAL regions, Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt {{the marketing of}} the game, as {{at the time of}} the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as Ico lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.|$|E

5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise.

Archer and Hearn also <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
