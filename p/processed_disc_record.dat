2500|$|As was {{the case}} in many of her performances, most of Melba's {{recordings}} were made at [...] "French Pitch" [...] (A=435Hz), rather than the British early 20th century standard of A=452Hz, or the modern standard of A=440Hz. This, and the technical inadequacies of the early <b>recording</b> <b>process</b> (<b>discs</b> were frequently <b>recorded</b> faster or slower than the supposed standard of 78rpm, whilst the conditions of the cramped recording studios– kept very warm to keep the wax at the necessary softness when cutting– would wreak havoc with instrumental tuning during recording sessions), means that playing her recordings back in the speed and pitch she made them at is not always a simple matter.|$|R

5000|$|Through experimentation, in 1892 Berliner began {{commercial}} production of his <b>disc</b> <b>records,</b> and [...] "gramophones" [...] or [...] "talking-machines". His [...] "gramophone record" [...] {{was the first}} <b>disc</b> <b>record</b> to be offered to the public. They were five inches (12.7 cm) in diameter and recorded on one side only. Seven-inch (17.5 cm) records followed in 1895. Also in 1895 Berliner replaced the hard rubber {{used to make the}} discs with a shellac compound. Berliner's early records had poor sound quality, however. Work by Eldridge R. Johnson improved the sound fidelity to a point where it was as good as the cylinder. By 1901, ten-inch (25 cm) records were marketed by Johnson and Berliner's Victor Talking Machine Company, and Berliner had sold his interests. By 1908, a majority of the public demanded double-sided disc recordings, and cylinders fell into disfavor. Edison felt the commercial pressure for <b>disc</b> <b>records,</b> and by 1912, though reluctant at first, his movement to <b>disc</b> <b>records</b> was in full swing. This was the Edison <b>Disc</b> <b>Record.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{vertical}} cut recording process {{is an early}} method of audio recording by which a stylus cuts a vertical groove into a phonograph record. This {{is in contrast to}} the lateral recording system which uses a stylus that cuts side-to-side across a record. The vertical recording process, also known as the hill and dale process, was used to record phonograph cylinder records as well as Edison <b>Disc</b> <b>Records,</b> Pathé <b>disc</b> <b>records,</b> and <b>disc</b> <b>records</b> made by numerous smaller companies. Vertical cut recording was also used as a means of copyright protection by the early Muzak 16-inch background music discs.|$|R
