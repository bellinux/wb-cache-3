40|$|Eleven Angus, 12 Friesian and 12 Hereford steers {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the degree of accuracy and usefulness of <b>primal</b> <b>cut</b> tissues in predicting side composition. The criteria used for evaluating the cuts were: (a) {{standard error of estimate}} of the equation, (b) homogeneity of ‘b’ values among breeds, (c) appreciable bone content in cut to allow the prediction of side bone, and (d) the absence of major difficulties in the replication and dissection of cuts. Simple and multiple regression analyses showed that the most accurate predictors of carcass composition, in descending order, with standard errors of estimate of muscle, fat and bone percentages respectively, were: hindquarter plus rib cut (0. 37 %, 0. 47 %, 0. 30 %); hindquarter (0. 73 %, 0. 87 %, 0. 49 %); loin plus rib cut (0. 84 %, 0. 88 %, 0. 48 %); rib cut (1. 13 %, 1. 26 %, 0. 59 %); loin (1. 24 %, 1. 21 %, 0. 72 %). The most useful of four easily obtained carcass variables in improving the prediction accuracy of carcass components from multiple regression proved to be <b>primal</b> <b>cut</b> weight and fat thickness at the 12 th rib, particularly the former. Both significantly reduced the standard errors of estimate of muscle, fat or bone in equations based on loin, rib cut and loin plus rib cut, but not in equations based on hindquarter plus rib cut and hindquarter.

The BS pigs had the lowest serum CPK and AST activity which indicates their lower suspectability to stress (P< 0. 05).

Composites were from lines M 1, M 2, M 3, M 4 and TX. The SM type contained M 3 and other small breeds; AH contained M 1 and M 2 which had either Angus (A) or Hereford (H), and GLC contained both M 4 made up of either Gelbveih (G) or Limousin (L) and TX made up of Charolais (C). Tissue weights and proportions were analyzed by covariance within slaughter time (274, 347, 372, 399, 427 and 456 d, respectively) with composite type (SM, AH and GLC) as fixed, year (1 & 2) as random and age within slaughter time as a covariate.

Apparent digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein and gross energy and the plasma concentrations of urea, glucose and nonesterified fatty acids were similar for both individually and group-penned pigs.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} breeding for phenotypes predicted from video image analysis (VIA). In meat factories in Ireland, digital images are routinely taken after slaughter to derive EUROP conformation and fat grades. Two datasets (1, 048 carcasses in total) on individual carcass dissections were made available for this study, one by a research center and the other by a commercial partner. Dissection data consisted of eight and six primal cuts taken in the hind- and fore-quarter, respectively, and analyses revealed significant genetic variations in these data. Heritabilities of <b>primal</b> <b>cut</b> weights ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 83 in the fore-quarter cuts, and from 0. 14 to 0. 86 in the hind-quarter cuts. <b>Primal</b> <b>cut</b> weights were subsequently grouped into four wholesale cut weights according to their retail values: lower value cuts, medium value cuts, high value cuts, and very high value cuts. Equations to predict wholesale cut weights were subsequently derived from VIA image parameters. Accuracy of prediction were > 0. 84 and > 0. 72 in the steer and heifer datasets, respectively. Genetic analysis of the wholesale cut weights predicted in a large national dataset of steers and heifers revealed heritabilities of 0. 18, 0. 27, 0. 40, and 0. 17 for lower value cuts, medium value cuts, high value cuts, and very high value cuts, respectively. Genetic correlations among predicted wholesale cut weights ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 89 across genders. Predicted wholesale cut weights were also strongly genetically correlated with animal price at weaning age (0. 37 to 0. 66), as well as price at postweaning age (0. 50 to 0. 67) suggesting a benefit of indirect selection especially where data on carcass cut weights were not yet available. Including predicted wholesale cut weights in a selection criteria increased genetic gain for carcass traits {{over and above the}} current selection practice of selection on EUROP conformation score. Expanding knowledge on wholesale cut weights and extending it to meat quality traits is an attractive option for Ireland...|$|E

The birds were slaughtered in batches of four properly bled, defeathered and dressed, the carcasses and organs weighed.
