5|$|According to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not {{including}} rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) {{were used}} in procedures that did not include more than momentary <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> distress. 247,882 (31%) animals {{were used in}} procedures in which <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> distress {{that would not be}} relieved.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local <b>pain,</b> <b>or</b> systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal <b>pain,</b> <b>or</b> excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans.

5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> systemic symptoms.

Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E

5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many of these drugs have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the <b>pain,</b> <b>or</b> by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of <b>pain,</b> <b>or</b> a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression {{back to the surface}} pressure. Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded almost entirely by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.|$|E
5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion.

Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable <b>pain</b> <b>or</b> decreased consciousness.|$|E
