40|$|Statement of Problem: Given that meticulous implant {{prosthodontic}} {{procedures are}} recommended {{to obtain the}} best possible intraoral fit, the die systems used for multi implant casts warrant further investigation. Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac <b>precision</b> <b>die</b> system, and Conventional brass dowel pin system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac <b>precision</b> <b>die</b> tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass dowel pin system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional Dowel pin system however for Accu-trac <b>precision</b> <b>die</b> tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, NASA {{plans to}} orbit a giant telescope, whose {{aperture}} {{may be as}} great as 30 meters, for infrared and sub-millimeter astronomy. Its primary mirror will be deployed or assembled in orbit from a mosaic of possibly hundreds of mirror segments. Each segment must be shaped to precise curvature tolerances so that diffraction-limited performance will be achieved at 30 micron (nominal operating wavelength). All panels must lie within 1 micron on a theoretical surface described by the optical precipitation of the telescope's primary mirror. To attain diffraction-limited performance, the issues of alignment and/or position sensing, position control of micron tolerances, and structural, thermal, and mechanical considerations for stowing, deploying, and erecting the reflector must be resolved. Radius of curvature precision influences panel size, shape, material, and type of construction. Two superior material choices emerged: fused quartz (sufficiently homogeneous with respect to thermal expansivity to permit a thin shell substrate to be drape molded between graphite dies to a precise enough off-axis asphere for optical finishing on the as-received a segment) and a Pyrex or Duran (less expensive than quartz and formable at lower temperatures). The optimal reflector panel size is between 1 - 1 / 2 and 2 meters. Making one, two-meter mirror every two weeks requires new approaches to manufacturing off-axis parabolic or aspheric segments (drape molding on <b>precision</b> <b>dies</b> and subsequent finishing on a nonrotationally symmetric dependent machine).

40|$|Significant {{technological}} advancement of wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) process has been observed in recent times {{in order to meet the}} requirements of various manufacturing fields especially in the production of parts with complex geometry in <b>precision</b> <b>die</b> industry. Taper cutting is an important application of WEDM process aiming at generating complex parts with tapered profiles. Wire deformation and breakage are more pronounced in taper cutting as compared with straight cutting resulting in adverse effect on desired taper angle and surface integrity. The reasons for associated problems may be attributed to certain stiffness of the wire. However, controlling the process parameters can somewhat reduce these problems. Extensive literature review reveals that effect of process parameters on various performance measures in taper cutting using WEDM is also not adequately addressed. Hence, study on effect of process parameters on performance measures using various advanced metals and metal matrix composites (MMC) has become the predominant research area in this field. In this context, the present work attempts to experimentally investigate the machining performance of various alloys, super alloys and metal matrix composite during taper cutting using WEDM process. The effect of process parameters such as part thickness, taper angle, pulse duration, discharge current, wire speed and wire tension on various performance measures such as angular error, surface roughness, cutting rate and white layer thickness are studied using Taguchi’s analysis. The functional relationship between the input parameters and performance measures has been developed by using non-linear regression analysis. Simultaneous optimization of the performance measures has been carried out using latest nature inspired algorithms such as multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and bat algorithm. Although MOPSO develops a set of non-dominated solutions, the best ranked solution is identified from a large number of solutions through application of maximum deviation method rather than resorting to human judgement. Deep cryogenic treatment of both wire and work material has been carried out to enhance the machining efficiency of the low conductive work material like Inconel 718. Finally, artificial intelligent models are proposed to predict the various performance measures prior to machining. The study offers useful insight into controlling the parameters to improve the machining efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Plasticine {{and other}} soft {{materials}} {{are often used}} for physical modeling of metal- forming processes. In this experiment, two colors of Plasticine are used to model coextrusion of a non-axisymmetric channel with a thin copper sleeve of uniform thickness surrounding an aluminum core. Since analysis of the flow behavior is cumbersome, {{the foundation of the}} die design is drawn from the process of upsetting described by S. Kivivuori in a recent paper. The upsetting involves the compression of the desired final cross-section between parallel plates. After a sufficient reduction in thickness, the cross- section transforms to a circular shape. The path taken by the material, as described by intermediate profiles,is the reverse of the path through the die. Therefore,the intermediate profiles provide the contour of the extrusion die cavity. In 1988, Kulick discovered that, {{in the case of the}} profile in question, the channel collapses upon itself. Unfortunately, the path which includes this collapse is not reversible with an extrusion die, as part of the die would need to be infinitely thin. Kulick's solution was to change the billet design to a solid core with a 40 ° sector of the sleeve material, all surrounded by a sleeve of uniform thickness. In order to facilitate production, it is desirable to have an axisymmetric billet design. Therefore, rather than change the billet design, the extrusion die design must depart from the least-work path of the upsetting. The upsetting experiment was modified to prevent the channel from collapsing upon itself. A constraint was placed where the material was not permitted to flow, as conducted by S. Kivivuori, in order to modify the material flow in the upsetting experiment, yielding the correct die design. Computer modeling allowed three dimensional analysis before die construction. CADKEY generated a three dimensional image of the extrusion die, and later versions of the same software can link the profiles and interpolate the surface of the die. If plans for die design could have been generated in the proper format, these would be input to a computer driven machining device, in order to make smaller, <b>precision</b> <b>dies</b> for extrusion of metal rather than clay. This work has been left as a path for future work on the project. The prospect of the generation of the desired profile from a cylindrical, axisymmetrical billet is good. The upsetting method has been proven by Kivivuori, and the modification of the constraints is permitted in the process, so the prototype should be successful. To facilitate the continuation of the project, appendices have been added which give instructions as to how various elements are conducted...|$|R
