40|$|A modern {{competitive}} environment requires rapid and effective responses to varying production demands with shorter life cycles. A feasible solution {{to cope with}} such unpredictable situations is to introduce an automated manufacturing system characterized by high flexibility, autonomy and cooperation. Much {{research has been done}} on negotiation-based scheduling and control under the distributed control architecture due to its operational flexibility and scalability. Despite many advantages, the probability of the system stalling at a deadlock state is high. Specifically, it is difficult to detect impending <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> deadlocks within the system. A system request network model is defined here to analyse various deadlock situations. Request cycles are then identified by a virtual <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> control mechanism. No request cycle in the system request network represents 'no system deadlock'. For any request cycle, a deadlock analysis is performed. If any request cycle exists that represents either a <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> deadlock or an impending <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> deadlock, then the system will be deadlocked. The proposed model can analyse all types of impending <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> deadlocks. Furthermore, it is more efficient through the reduction of search space, is applicable to various configurations and is less restrictive in dynamic shop floor control. close 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a heuristic algorithm that addresses problems of machine allocation in cellular manufacturing (CM). The {{focus is on}} the intra-cell machines allocation, because the inter-cell material flows should be minimal in CM. The algorithm tackles one cell at a time with a maximum of 9 machines, which will be assigned into a 3 × 3 grid space according to the ranking result. The proposed algorithm uses an adoptive approach to relate machines in a cell by examining the merged <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> weights of machine pairs. The establishment of the <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> weight includes practical constrains, such as the part-handling factor and the number of parts per transportation. Then, an objective function is employed to determine the total travelling score in which the travelling distance is covered. The procedures of the proposed heuristic algorithm will be presented in this paper and data used in Yaman's cases are used to illustrate the operation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{integrated}} approach {{for the formation}} of parts and machine families in group technology is developed. The integrated approach is used to solve cell formation, process planning, and production planning simultaneously. The given information is part processing sequence, part production volume, part alternative processing plans, and part processing times. The approach is used to determine the machine-part cells and part processing plans, while the total intercell <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> is minimized. Also, the convergence of the algorithm is investigated. The approach goes across and beyond the group technology methods by considering sequencing, production planning, process planning, and part-machine cellular information simultaneously. Two methods are investigated: exact (optimal) and heuristic. The approach first solves an integer programming problem to find processing plans and then uses a procedure to form the machine-part cells. The proposed approach solves the problem iteratively until a set of plans for machinepart cell formations is obtained with minimal intercell <b>part</b> <b>flow</b> or interflow cost. An example is presented to explain the developed approach. Experimental results are also provided. An extension of the approach for solving the operations planning of an emergency room is also covered. In this extension of the approach, the application of cell formation provides a solution to efficiently managing patients and utilizing resources.
