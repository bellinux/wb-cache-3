50|$|For a {{nuisance}} {{that the law}} will provide a remedy, there must he a substantial and unreasonable interference with the property interest being asserted. The interference can be negligent or intentional. For instance in the duties of farm operations, an action constituting {{a nuisance}} will be deemed intentional {{even if it is}} unintended if it is an easily likely consequence of the farmer's otherwise <b>protected</b> <b>farming</b> activities. The drifting of sprayed farm pesticides onto a neighbor's land is considered an intentional nuisance even though this particular result is unintended.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — India has vast area, but {{current status}} of {{agriculture}} management {{is not sufficient to}} provide everything to the population, which can be problematic. The solution to this issue is the practice of <b>protected</b> <b>farming</b> which includes polyhouse farming. The greenhouse covered with simple polyethylene sheet is termed as polyhouse. The function of a polyhouse is to create the optimal growing conditions for the full lifecycle of the plants. The objective of our project is to design a simple, efficient ‘programmable logic controller ’ (PLC) based system for automation of polyhouse. The project features monitoring, recording and controlling the values of temperature, light intensity and soil moisture inside the polyhouse. The PLC used is a highly compact, durable and easily available. The values of temperature, light intensity and soil moisture are continuously communicated through various sensors to the PLC. Also, the system uses ‘Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ’ for real time analysis of the process. Proper design, selection, construction and the management of the polyhouse using sensors would augur well to the growth of a crop...|$|E

So, the cultivation of these plants with appropriate technology may fulfill the demand of pharmaceutical industry and may also promote the conservation at their natural habitat. Highly important two species of Aconitum were studied for the enhancement of net profit by applying <b>protected</b> <b>farming</b> system. Both the experimental species were grown under natural and greenhouse conditions. Very positive results were obtained in plants of both Aconitum species grown under greenhouse as compared to natural conditions. Enhancement in yield was 12 and 9 times high in Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. ex Royle and Aconitum balfourii Stapf. respectively grown under greenhouse as compared to natural condition. Pseudoaconitine and aconitine were also observed high in greenhouse grown (0. 51 % and 0. 42 % respectively) than naturally grown plants (0. 49 % and 0. 40 % respectively). The quantity of atisine and aconitine was also found high (0. 35 % & 0. 27 % respectively) in greenhouse than naturally grown plants (0. 19 % & 0. 16 % respectively). It was noticed that plant height, leaf number, and average length of tubers were high in plants grown inside greenhouse in contrast to natural habitat. Almost five and two folds more tubers were found in A. balfourii and A. heterophyllum respectively in plants grown under greenhouse in comparison to natural conditions...|$|E
