40|$|In recent years, <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> (going private transaction) {{has become}} a common {{practice}} in Taiwan''s business models. However, what are the problems of this business model? How should the legal system regulate it? In the U. S. A., the development and academic studies of the concept and regulations of <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> are mature. This thesis hopes to help readers to understand the problems and regulation of <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> by researching the concept and regulations of <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> in the United States. Chapter one includes the motive, the purpose, the range, the methodology of the research and the analysis of related domestic papers {{in order to make}} readers understand where the questions are in the topic. Chapter two describes the concept, motive, and means of the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> in the U. S. A., and based on protecting the interests of minority shareholders, points out the problems of the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> and the related regulations of the U. S., such as information asymmetry and Securities Exchange Act of information disclos ure standards; fair price uncertainty and the appraisal rights; conflicts of interest and the fiduciary duties. Chapter three covers the information disclosure standards of the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction,</b> namely the United States Securities and Exchange Act Rule 13 e- 3 and Schedule 13 e- 13 and the relationship between the foregoing rules and the anti-fraud provisions. Chapter four discusses the relations between the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> and the appraisal rights. It starts with the process of the development and the function of the appraisal rights in the public-to-private transaction; and then discusses the regulations and the operations of the court of the appraisal rights. Chapter five describes the fiduciary duties of corporate insiders, such as controlling shareholders and managements. It includes the meaning and the standards of the judicial review of the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction.</b> The discussion focuses on the formation and the judicial review of the fiduciary obligations of “long-form merger” and “tender offer followed by short-form merger”, that are the two main approaches of the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction.</b> In the last chapter, there are some reviews about the the information disclosure regulations, the appraisal rights, and the fiduciary duty of the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> in the U. S [...] Based on the regulations of the U.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four chapters. The first chapter developed a new warning system for international currency crises. The existing crisis indicators in the literature are essentially static. We {{examine the relationship between}} the foreign reserves dynamics and currency crises. It is shown that rapid reserve depletion is a prominent feature before the collapse of the exchange rate system. Our model provides clear warning signals for policy makers to take actions before the reserves has reached a critical value that heralds the arrival of a full-blown crisis. The second chapter employed a competing risk model to investigate the crisis-driven exit and orderly exit from fixed exchange rate regime for the period 1972 - 2001. It is found that the time spent within a regime is itself a significant determinant of the probability of an exit. Different types of exits exhibit different patterns of duration dependence. Crisis-driven exits have a positive duration dependence pattern while orderly exits show a negative duration dependence pattern, even after controlling for country specific characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity. The Competing Risk model yields several interesting results. It is found that the more open the economy, the lower the likelihood of leaving an exchange rate peg, and that the higher the trade concentration, the lower the probability of an orderly exit. Further, financial openness increases the probability of having an orderly exit. There is also strong evidence that a lower reserve growth rate and the incidence of bank crisis are associated with a higher likelihood of crisis driven exits. The third chapter examines whether the gains from incentive realignment have driven corporations out of the public security market. It is shown that going private transactions are due to the reduction in the diversification gains from the public market. For firms whose managers own most equity and are highly leveraged, they have low incentive gains prior to the <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction.</b> Such firms go private because of financial distress and dwindling profitability. These kinds of going-private activities are counter-cyclical. On the other hand, a financially healthy firm with a low managerial ownership has high anticipated incentive gains. The gain from incentive realignment is the dominant factor for these going-private transactions. Such firms go private because of an increase in profitability or an improvement in financial distress. We show that these going-private activities are pro-cyclical. The fourth chapter investigates the sources of economy fluctuations in China since its economic reform in 1978. Under the framework of a standard neoclassical open economy model with time-varying frictions (wedge), we study the relative importance of efficiency, labor, investment and foreign debt wedges on recent business cycles phenomena in China. The business accounting procedure suggests that productivity best explains the behavior of aggregate economic variables in China throughout the 1978 - 2006 periods. Labor wedge {{plays a major role in}} explaining the movement of labor enforcement. Foreign debt wedge and investment wedge primarily affect the composition of output between consumption, investment and trade balance, and have a modest role in explaining the fluctuation of output. Our results imply that the reform on inefficiency factor utilization and labor market rigidity should be a focus of future government policies. He, Qing. Adviser: Tai Leung Chong.

40|$|Observed industry-specific {{leverage}} ratios in {{and across}} financial systems imply {{the relevance of}} capital market imperfections. This severely questions {{the validity of the}} irrelevance of capital structure decisions for firm value. Moreover, survey studies of CFOs suggest that managers have some target debt ratio or range, which also refutes the irrelevance of capital structure. The number of studies on capital structure is enormous, but to date no universal theory has been formulated for capital structure. It has even been argued that there might not be any reason to expect a universal theory of capital structure. Instead, different theories apply to firms under different circumstances. For that reason, this dissertation on empirical capital structure research aims to discuss and investigate two specific ?firm circumstances? that influence corporate financing choices and seem promising for future research. First, I investigate a determinant of capital structure that has so far received little attention in literature ? credit ratings by the external agencies Standard & Poor?s and Moody?s. Rating agencies play an eminent role in today?s capital markets. It is likely that firms under the scrutiny of such strong external supervisors may follow a different leverage policy to non-rated firms. However, rating agencies? renowned importance is so far not reflected in the capital structure research. Therefore, I thoroughly investigate the financing choices of externally rated firms for managers? rating considerations. Chapter 2 shows that managers follow a more conservative leverage policy if their firm?s credit rating is about to be upgraded or downgraded. While retained earnings are cross-sectional the dominant source of funding, the economics of security offerings has generated considerable empirical research interest over the past two decades. Survey evidence and stock price dynamics around seasoned equity offerings indicate that managers exploit temporary overvaluations of the firm?s stock and therefore time the equity offering. These efforts are possible because of the information asymmetry between managers and investors and the associated incentives for managers to exploit this informational advantage. Externally rated firms, on the other hand, reduce adverse selection problems with the information gathering process of the rating agencies. Therefore, it is questionable if the market timing hypothesis still holds for externally rated firms? seasoned equity offerings. The results of Chapter 3 imply that rating concerns are an important consideration for equity issuing firms. As a second ?firm circumstance? that may alter the composition of the balance sheet, I examine managers? weighting of public versus private equity in the decision to opt out of the public markets and go private. Such a <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transaction</b> (PTP) is an important step in the corporate life cycle, and modifies the capital structure of the firm significantly. However, consensus has not been reached in the literature on the underlying motives, and accordingly the relevant financial theories. Therefore, in Chapter 3 I investigate the characteristics of German firms that opted out of the public equity markets. Studying the public-to-private decision in Germany is of particular interest, because Germany can still be regarded as a prime example of an insider-controlled and relationship-based financial system. Therefore, the transferability of findings from Anglo-Saxon countries is difficult, as the structure of the financial and legal system is known to have a strong influence on corporate decisions. On the whole, I find no evidence of the free cash flow problem in the German corporate governance system. In respect of the respective PTP companies, the PTP phenomenon can be accounted for by a changing corporate life cycle status and a malfunctioning of the public capital markets. Auch mehr als 50 Jahre nach den Irrelevanz-Theoremen von Modigliani und Miller (1958) herrscht in der Literatur kaum Einigkeit darüber, nach welchen Kriterien Unternehmen ihre Kapitalstruktur wählen. Diese Diskussion umfasst sowohl die Suche nach der optimalen Kombination aus Eigen- und Fremdkapital, das Anpassungsverhalten des Verschuldungs¬grades, als auch die Wahl zwischen öffentlich notiertem und privatem Eigenkapital. Empirische Studien haben zahlreiche Faktoren identifiziert, die maßgeblichen Einfluss auf das Verhältnis von Eigen- und Fremdkapital haben und verschiedenen Kapitalstrukturtheorien zugeordnet. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen sind jedoch teilweise konträr und konnten nur einen beschränkten Teil der beobachteten Verschuldungsgrade erklären. Demzufolge gibt es in der Literatur bislang keine durchgängige Kapitalstrukturtheorie und es wird allgemein angenommen, dass Unternehmen in verschiedenen Lebensphasen ihre Kapitalstruktur auch nach unterschiedlichen Theorien steuern. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht daher zwei spezifische Unternehmensumstände, welche die gewählte Kapitalstrukturpolitik maßgeblich beeinflussen können. So hat die Bedeutung der organisierten Fremdkapitalmärkte für die Unternehmensfinanzierung in den letzten Jahren stark zugenommen. Der Zugang zum öffentlichen Fremdkapitalmarkt ist jedoch meist nur mit einem Credit Rating durch die externen Ratingagenturen möglich. Pressemitteilungen und Management¬aussagen auf Analystenkonferenzen zeigen, dass die Kapitalstruktur immer häufiger auch im Hinblick auf die Kennzahlen der Ratingagenturen gesteuert wird. Formal betrachtet kann dies mit diskreten Kosten bzw. Vorteilen der einzelnen Ratingklassen erklärt werden. Die empirische Forschung zur Bedeutung von Bonitätsbeurteilungen durch externe Rating¬agenturen in der Kapitalstrukturpolitik ist jedoch bislang unzureichend. Das erste Kapitel dieser Arbeit liefert eine konsequentere Testmethodik des Einflusses von Credit Ratings bzw. deren Veränderung auf den Verschuldungsgrad als bislang in der Literatur vorhanden. Die Untersuchung zeigt, dass das Management eine konservativere Kapitalstrukturpolitik verfolgt, wenn das Credit Rating vor einer Verbesserung oder Verschlechterung steht. Im zweiten Kapitel wird der Untersuchungsgegenstand auf die Entscheidung Eigenkapital am Kapitalmarkt aufzunehmen erweitert. Kapitalerhöhungen sind ein zentraler Bestandteil der Finanzierungsforschung und werden zumeist durch die Market Timing Theorie erklärt. Die Ergebnisse dieses Kapitels zeigen jedoch, dass zum Teil Ratinggesichtspunkte eine größere Rolle spielen als eine Überbewertung des Unternehmens zum Zeitpunkt der Emission. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit (Kapitel 3) untersucht einen weiteren wichtigen Schritt im Unternehmenslebenszyklus auf Implikationen für die Kapitalstrukturpolitik. So wird die Börsenrückzugs-Entscheidung, also der Wechsel einer börsennotierten zu einer privaten Eigenkapitalfinanzierung von Unternehmen am deutschen Kapitalmarkt betrachtet. Der Großteil der Studien zu diesem Thema konzentriert sich bislang auf den angelsächsischen Raum. Deutsche Unternehmen bieten dabei mit ihrer traditionellen Finanzierung durch eine beschränkte Anzahl an Banken und einen geringem Streubesitzanteil einen vielver¬sprechenden Gegenentwurf. Die Untersuchung zeigt, dass die Motive eines Börsenrückzugs in den USA bzw. aus den 1980 er Jahren nur sehr eingeschränkt auf den deutschen Kapitalmarkt übertragen werden können...|$|E

40|$|Managers {{have the}} choice to take the firm private {{themselves}} in a management buyout or to seek private equity backing. We argue that managers seek private equity backing in case they are more constrained to finance the deal themselves. We confirm the hypothesis using a sample of UK <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions</b> over the period 1997 – 2003. A post going private performance analysis reveals that both management buyouts and private equity backed deals outperform their industry peers. However, private equity backed deals outperform their peers already before the deal takes place whereas management buyouts improve performance afterwards. This suggests a passive role for private equity firms in going private transactions...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the sources of}} value gains in <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions</b> by examining the wealth effects on industry rivals of target firms. For a sample of 279 public-to-private bids in the U. S. from 1980 to 2007, I find that agency hypothesis explains more of the cross-sectional variation in rival firms’ abnormal returns at the initial bid announcements than the other suggested hypotheses. For rival firms with Tobin’s q (less than one), abnormal returns are positively related to the firms’ cash holdings before the relevant buyout bids and to the decline in cash holdings from before to after the bids. The median portfolio of rival firms with low Tobin’s q and above-median cash holdings reduces cash holdings and capital spending significantly after a buyout bid in the industry and experiences improved return on assets. Although the median portfolio in the entire sample of rival firms reduces cash holdings and capital spending significantly after a buyout bid, only that with low Tobin’s q and above-median cash holdings experiences significantly-increased return on assets. Also, rival firms that are subsequent targets within one year of buyout bids in their industries earn higher abnormal returns at the bid announcements. Rival firms with low Tobin’s q and low sales growth have higher likelihoods of becoming targets within one year of buyout bids in their industries. These findings suggest that rival firms that {{are more prone to}} agency conflicts are perceived to be more likely candidates for future private buyouts and that they improve returns on assets in response to buyout threats, implying that agency cost savings is a source of value in <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the going private market has {{experienced}} a considerable boom in size and also has become more interesting for private equity investors that are looking to partner with incumbent management. This offers managers the choice to take the firm private themselves in a traditional management buyout or to seek private equity backing. We propose that managers decide for a management buyout without any involvement of private equity in case they are less financially constrained: when their firms are undervalued, have high cash levels, are smaller and less financially visible, and the managers own a large toehold. In contrast, managers invite participation of private equity investors when they cannot complete the deal themselves: in firms that are larger, have less cash and managers own a smaller fraction of the firm. Our analysis on a sample of UK <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions</b> completed over the period 1997 - 2003 provides results that {{are in line with}} these predictions. corporate governance;private equity;public-to-private transactions...|$|R

40|$|Privatization of {{publicly}} traded companies arguably {{represents one of the}} most important trends in North American business during this decade. The sweep of private equity (PE) through the hotel and other industries was dramatic, until the 2007 credit crisis slammed on the brakes. Because these transactions are leveraged buyouts (LBOs), the reduced availability of debt capital stemming from recent problems in the credit markets appears to be responsible for the disappearance of PE deals. Notwithstanding those matters, conditions unrelated to debt financing sparked the PE surge during the early 2000 s. As detailed in this report, these conditions are property market liquidity, real estate investment trust (REIT) shares trading at deep discounts to net asset values (NAVs), high regulatory costs for public companies, public company incentive problems, and factors specific to real estate ownership companies that make them poorly suited for public trading. The same conditions could motivate another wave of <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions</b> when debt for large-scale transactions again becomes available. A principal source of this funding is found in pension accounts. Despite problems in the credit markets and the U. S. economic slowdown, money continues to flow into the pension accounts from a record number of workers. Fund managers must invest this capital somewhere! Forecasting how much will flow to finance PE-led LBOs during the coming years, particularly hotel company LBOs, requires consideration of a variety of underlying economic, financial, and regulatory conditions...|$|R
40|$|Private equity, {{characterized}} by firms operating as privately held partnerships organizing the acquisition and 'taking private' of public companies, is currently dominating the business news due to deals growing rapidly {{in number and}} size. If the trend continues unabated, the 1989 prediction by economist Michael Jensen of 'the eclipse of the public corporation' could be proved accurate soon. This paper argues matters will work out much differently, with private equity being at least partially eclipsed. One possibility is that current market and legal conditions, which are highly congenial to <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions,</b> could be disrupted in ways that cause the private equity surge to stall or even go into reverse. The paper draws on history to make this point, discussing how the spectacular rise of conglomerates in the 1960 s was reversed in subsequent decades and how the 1980 s buyout boom led by LBO associations [...] the private equity firms of the day [...] collapsed. Factors that undercut conglomerate mergers and buyouts by LBO associations (e. g. the tightening of debt markets and increased regulation) potentially {{could do the same}} with the current wave of private equity buyouts, and cause at least a temporary eclipse of private equity deals. Even if conditions remain favorable to private equity, its eclipse is likely to occur in a different way. Privacy has been a hallmark of private equity, with industry leaders operating as secretive partnerships that negotiate buyouts behind closed doors and restructure portfolio companies outside the public gaze. However, assuming market conditions remain sufficiently favorable, top private equity firms, following the lead of the Blackstone Group, may well carry out public offerings. If this happens, then even if the taking private of publicly quoted companies remains a mainstream pursuit, the exercise will occur largely under the umbrella of public markets.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY While buyouts in the 1980 s {{have been}} shown to improve {{operational}} performance of companies significantly, more recent studies have found little evidence of improved operational performance. However, due to limited scope in previous studies, understanding on how performance varies across transaction types, time periods, and geographies is limited. Moreover, buyout research lacks knowledge on how the companies acquired in the latest buyout boom have weathered the subsequent downturn. This thesis contributes to the existing literature by studying the operational impact of a comprehensive sample of Nordic private equity backed buyouts in the recession of 2007 - 2009. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on both private-to-private and <b>public-to-private</b> <b>transactions.</b> DATA I study 144 companies domiciled in Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark acquired by a private equity fund within the time period from 1. 1. 2005 to 30. 6. 2007. I combine a hand-collected deal characteristics data from M&A databases and news articles to accounting data to create a novel dataset that allows for comparison of various operational measures in 2007 - 2009 across deal types and geographies. I benchmark the performance measures against an industry- and size-matched peer group. RESULTS My findings support the hypothesis on private equity model’s ability to create economic value also in tough economic conditions. Private equity backed companies have outperformed their peers in terms of profitability and working capital efficiency. While employee productivity increases relative to benchmark, I find no significant difference in wage or employment development after the buyout. Decreasing personnel costs in relation to sales and higher leverage are associated with greater abnormal profitability. Performance varies significantly variation between deal types, suggesting different underlying motivations for alternative types of buyouts. Swedish and Norwegian buyouts have performed clearly better than Finnish and Danish buyouts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an exhaustive literature {{review of the}} motives for <b>public-to-private</b> LBO <b>transactions.</b> First, the paper develops the theoretical framework for the potential sources of value creation from going private: a distinction is made between the reduction in agency costs, stakeholder wealth transfers, tax benefits, transaction costs savings, takeover defense strategies, and corporate undervaluation. The paper then reviews and summarizes whether and how these theories have been empirically verified in the four different strands of literature in LBO research. These strands of literature are categorized by phase in the LBO transaction: Intent (of a buyout), Impact (of the LBO on the various stakeholders), Process (of restructuring after the leveraged buyout) and Duration (of retaining the private status). Then, the paper shows {{that in the first}} half of the 2000 s, a public-to-private LBO wave re-emerged in the US, UK and Continental Europe, whose value vastly exceeded that of the 1980 s US LBO wave. Finally, the paper provides suggestions for further researc...|$|R
40|$|Private equity critics {{claim that}} {{leveraged}} buyouts bring huge job losses. To investigate this claim, we construct and analyze a new dataset that covers U. S. private equity transactions from 1980 to 2005. We track 3, 200 target firms and their 150, 000 establishments {{before and after}} acquisition, comparing outcomes to controls similar in terms of industry, size, age, and prior growth. Relative to controls, employment at target establishments declines 3 percent over two years post buyout and 6 percent over five years. The job losses are concentrated among <b>public-to-private</b> buyouts, and <b>transactions</b> involving firms in the service and retail sectors. But target firms also create more new jobs at new establishments, and they acquire and divest establishments more rapidly. When we consider these additional adjustment margins, net relative job losses at target firms are less than 1 percent of initial employment. In contrast, the sum of gross job creation and destruction at target firms exceeds that of controls by 13 percent of employment over two years. In short, private equity buyouts catalyze the creative destruction process in the labor market, with only a modest net impact on employment. The creative destruction response mainly involves a more rapid reallocation of jobs across establishments within target firms. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} private equity on {{employment}} outcomes arouses considerable controversy. Critics claim that private equity buyouts bring huge job losses, while private equity groups claim large employment gains. To address the issue, we construct and analyze a new dataset that overcomes {{many of the}} limitations in previous research. We examine U. S. private equity transactions from 1980 to 2005, following 4, 500 target firms and more than 200, 000 establishments before and after acquisition by private equity groups. We compare employment outcomes at target firms and their establishments to controls that have no private equity ties and that are similar in terms of industry, size and age. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Employment declines at target establishments relative to controls {{in the wake of}} private equity buyouts. (2) Target establishments create roughly as many new jobs as control establishments post-buyout, but they destroy old jobs at a much faster pace. (3) However, target firms also create new jobs in new establishments at a much faster pace than control firms. Once we account for new establishments opened post-buyout, the net job loss at target firms relative to controls is about 3 - 4 % of initial employment. (4) The sum of gross job creation and destruction rates is much higher at target firms than at controls in the wake of private equity buyouts. (5) These effects differ considerably across broad industry groups and between <b>public-to-private</b> and private-to-private <b>transactions.</b> Taken together, our results suggest that private equity groups act as a catalyst for creative destruction in the labor market, and that their employment effects vary greatly by sector and type of target...|$|R
