40|$|A família, em sua origem, é tida como matriz {{fundamental}} nas relações sociais, na medida em que se constitui como lócus de transmissão de sentimentos e afetos, como também de proibições e permissões fundamentadas nas relações de poder. Este estudo teve por finalidade compreender como tais relações se estabelecem, bem como evidenciar as implicações dos microexercícios de poder dentro da família. Alicerçada numa abordagem interdisciplinar, buscou-se construir uma teia argumentativa a partir de reflexões encetadas por saberes e teorias das ciências humanas e sociais, como a antropologia, a história, a ciência política, a psicanálise, a psicologia e a filosofia. Os dados utilizados provêm primordialmente da história da família e da sociedade ocidental-européia. O método utilizado foi à revisão de literatura sobre família, poder, patriarcado, gênero, feminismo e psicologia. As bases de dados a que se recorreu advêm de documentos bibliográficos especializados, artigos científicos, teses e dissertações sobre o tema. Através do trabalho ensaístico pretendeu-se evidenciar que a família como lócus de controle é fonte de desigualdades e conflitos. O fio condutor do trabalho foi o conceito de gênero, poder e suas relações com as desigualdades familiares. Questiona-se a perspectiva da Psicologia, em particular a teoria psicanalítica, frente às desigualdades de gênero nas relações familiares. Pode-se supor que a família seja um lócus de controle dos sujeitos que a compõem, dando maior evidência à dissimetria de gênero nas relações entabuladas, resultando dessa microfísica de poder, tensões e conflitos que desestruturam a relação familiar. Infere-se, portanto, que através de relações mais equânimes homens e mulheres possam atenuar desigualdades e conflitos nas relações que estabelecem tornando a família um genuíno lócus de cuidado. The family, in its origin, is had {{as first}} basic {{in the social}} relations, in the measure where if constitutes as place of transmission of feelings and affection, {{as well as of}} prohibitions and permissions based on the relations of being able. This study it had for purpose to understand as such relations if they establish, as well as evidencing the implications of the microexercises of being able inside of the family. Anchored in a boarding to interdisciplinary, one searched to construct argumentative a from reflection found for knowing and theories of sciences social human beings and, as the anthropology, the history, the science politics, the psychoanalysis, the psychology and the philosophy. The used data primordially come from the history of the family and the society occidental European. The used method was the revision of literature on family, power, patriarchate, gender, feminism and psychology. The databases the one that if it appealed happen of specialized bibliographical documents, scientific, thesis articles and dissertation on the subject.

40|$|MOT International Brussels {{is delighted}} to bring {{together}} a selection of works by Benoit Maire, Ulrike Müller, Anouchka Oler, Zin Taylor and Sue Tompkins. The exhibition echoes a strategy often used by Benoît Maire in his practice—experimentation with relationships between forms and texts by bringing the disparate {{in close proximity to}} one another. This grouping of distinct works allows for unpredicted connections to emerge between language, the body and the performance of both into objects. Benoît Maire’s practice is centred on theory as a medium and the speculation of the divide between saying and seeing. The included new works {{take the form of a}} script, a painting and a reproduction of an ancient bust made of soap, the soap, paint and words highlighting the potential for instability and transformation. Invested in philosophical thought, Maire deploys images and objects as an efficient mode of assessing an idea. Similarly to Maire, Ulrike Müller also creates an alternative language for interrogating the dichotomies between form and content, abstraction and figuration. To create her enamel pieces, Müller combines the handmade with the industrially produced. She works with an actively changing and distinctly abstract geometric language as a way of codifying bodily forms with queer politics. The sexualised triangles, lines and circles are imbued with a sense of humor and a clear reference to popular culture. The shapes become syntax open to interpretation in order to break with the didactic system of binaries, such as masculine and feminine. The physicality of Sue Tompkins live spoken-word performances is re-contextualised as text-based wall works. Each jolt of her body and rhythmic inflection of her singsong voice is translated through the typewriter; the surface of the oversized folded-to-fit newsprint is imprinted by each hammer of the inked slug of metal type. Created, borrowed or altered snippets of songs and fragments of every-day phrases are combined with grids or clusters of organised punctuation marks. The works on paper act both as the record of the artist’s body and voice, as well as a score or set of instructions for a performance. Anouchka Oler’s film Épisode 2 (2014) is the sole work in the exhibition that utilises audio. The artist’s own authoritative voice articulates an anxiety with contemporary individualism illustrated through the contrast between the rebellious group of her hand-made sculptural forms set against a backdrop of collaged reproductions of historical antiquities. The narrator, as collaborator in the performance, moves from a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> to one of saddened confessional. Drawing attention to the futility of a sole authorial voice, and the inadequacies of human limitations, Oler fills the void of the absent voice for both the objects and the artist. Expanding on the abstraction of narrative Zin Taylor’s collages are part of: The Story of Stripes and Dots. The recurrent zigzag pattern in his work suggests a visual transcription of a random and disruptive conversation. The patterns are overlaid with photographic images of dislocated human and animal body parts—extendable plastic ears, a face enveloped by a beard, a tie-died torso with a blank whiteout face—breaking up the symmetry of the jagged black lines. Taylor’s formal vocabulary gives form to conceptual thoughts and abstract notions...|$|E

Although Foucault did not come to a refined analysis of security—he devoted only a few lectures to this concept and scarcely dealt with the question of what it means for the spatial context in which we live—an important element of the new security policies is an architecture that combines the concern for control with the freedom of circulation of both people and things.
