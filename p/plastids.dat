It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines.

40|$|Presence and {{possible}} functions of DNA methylation in <b>plastid</b> genomes of higher {{plants have been}} highly controversial.

To test if either adenine or cytosine methylation can play a regulatory role in <b>plastid</b> gene expression, we have introduced cyanobacterial genes for adenine and cytosine DNA methyltransferases (methylases) into the tobacco <b>plastid</b> genome by chloroplast transformation. Using DNA cleavage with methylation-sensitive and methylation-dependent restriction endonucleases, we show that the <b>plastid</b> genomes in the transplastomic plants are efficiently methylated. All transplastomic lines are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type plants and, moreover, show no alterations in <b>plastid</b> gene expression.

5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant <b>plastids</b> and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of <b>plastids</b> received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of <b>plastids</b> and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eukaryotic}} cell, the cytosol {{is within}} the cell membrane and {{is part of the}} cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, <b>plastids,</b> and other organelles (but not their internal fluids and structures); the cell nucleus is separate. The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plastid</b> {{transcription}} and translation are light-activated in 8 -day-old dark-grown barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings. Pretreatment of dark-grown seedlings with cycloheximide (inhibitor of {{cytoplasmic protein}} synthesis) abolished the activation of rbcL, psbA, and psaA-B transcription by light. In contrast, inhibition of <b>plastid</b> protein synthesis by chloramphenicol stimulated light-activated transcription of rbcL, psbA, and psaA-B. Light-induced transcription of the <b>plastid</b> genome occurred normally in the chlorophyll-deficient mutant xan-J 64. These {{results suggest that}} although the light-induced activation of <b>plastid</b> transcription is modulated by cytoplasmic and organellar protein synthesis, transcriptional activation is not dependent on the absorption of light by protochlorophyllide or the attainment of photosynthetic competence. In addition, <b>plastid</b> translation increased dramatically when 8 -day-old dark-grown seedlings were illuminated and activation was dependent on cytoplasmic protein synthesis. Blockage of light-activated <b>plastid</b> transcription by Tagetin treatment (inhibitor of <b>plastid</b> RNA polymerase) did not attenuate the activation of <b>plastid</b> translation by light. These results suggest that while light simultaneously activates <b>plastid</b> transcription and translation, the rapid burst in <b>plastid</b> protein synthesis is due mainly to cytoplasmic-derived changes that regulate the rate of translation of pre-existing mRNAs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plastid</b> {{genes of}} higher plants are {{transcribed}} {{by at least}} two <b>plastid</b> RNA polymerases: the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the nuclear-encoded <b>plastid</b> RNA polymerase (NEP).

Besides, {{it is quite possible that}} there are some other regulatory elements resembling those for nuclear genes or exclusively related to <b>plastid</b> genes. Therefore we decided to search for both additional PEP/NEP promoters and σ 54 /σ 32 -type eubacterial promoters, as well as other transcription regulatory elements upstream of <b>plastid</b> genes of Zea mays. Results: The analysis revealed a set of additional putative PEP (σ 70 -, σ 54 -and σ 32 -type) and NEP promoters upstream most of <b>plastid</b> genes of maize. Interestingly, some <b>plastid</b> genes contain several PEP promoters of various types (σ 70, σ 54, σ 32). Moreover, other motifs resembling plant nuclear and <b>plastid</b> transcription regulatory elements upstream most of maize <b>plastid</b> genes were found.

The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group.

40|$|Abstract. We sequenced to {{completion}} the circular <b>plastid</b> genome {{of the red}} alga Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui. This is the first <b>plastid</b> genome sequence from the subclass Florideophycidae (Rhodophyta). The ge-nome is composed of 183, 883 bp and contains 238 predicted genes, including a single copy of the ribo-somal RNA operon. Comparisons with the <b>plastid</b> genome of Porphyra pupurea reveal strong conserva-tion of gene content and order, but we found major genomic rearrangements {{and the presence of}} coding regions that are specific to Gracilaria. Phylogenetic analysis of a data set of 41 concatenated proteins from 23 <b>plastid</b> and two cyanobacterial genomes support red algal <b>plastid</b> monophyly and a specific evolutionary relationship between the Florideophycidae and the Bangiales.

25|$|In normal {{intraspecific}} crossings (resulting {{in normal}} hybrids of one species), the inheritance of plastid DNA {{appears to be}} quite strictly 100% uniparental.

Although <b>plastids</b> inherit mainly maternally in interspecific hybridisations, there are many reports of hybrids of flowering plants that contain <b>plastids</b> of the father.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>plastids,</b> {{particularly}} {{those responsible for}} photosynthesis, possess numerous internal membrane layers.|$|E
25|$|Those <b>plastids</b> {{that contain}} {{chlorophyll}} can carry out photosynthesis. <b>Plastids</b> can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes, {{which can be}} used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules.

All <b>plastids</b> are derived from proplastids, which are present in the meristematic regions of the plant. Proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission, but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity.|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the <b>plastid</b> transcriptional apparatus (two or three different RNA polymerases and numerous regulatory proteins) makes {{it very difficult to}} attribute specific function(s) to its individual components. We have characterized an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion line disrupting the nuclear gene coding for one of the six <b>plastid</b> sigma factors (SIG 4) that regulate the activity of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase PEP. This mutant shows a specific diminution of transcription of the <b>plastid</b> ndhF gene, coding for a subunit of the <b>plastid</b> NDH [NAD(P) H dehydrogenase] complex. The absence of another NDH subunit, i. e. NDHH, and the absence of a chlorophyll fluorescence transient previously attributed to the activity of the <b>plastid</b> NDH complex indicate a strong down-regulation of NDH activity in the mutant plants.

40|$|<b>Plastid</b> {{development}} in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana {{is affected by}} the transfer of 1 O 2 -mediated retrograde signals from the <b>plastid</b> to the nucleus and changes in nuclear gene expression during late embryogenesis.

Inactivation of the 2 nuclear-encoded <b>plastid</b> proteins EXECUTER 1 and EXECUTER 2 blocks 1 O 2 -mediated retrograde signaling before the onset of dormancy and impairs normal <b>plastid</b> formation in germinating seeds. This long-term effect of 1 O 2 retrograde signaling depends on the recruitment of abscisic acid (ABA) during seedling development. Unexpectedly, ABA acts as a positive regulator of <b>plastid</b> formation in etiolated and light-grown seedlings...|$|R
30|$|Chloroplast is a {{semi-autonomous}} organelle {{and carries}} out photosynthesis: {{the capture of}} light energy and its conversion into chemical energy. It is known that chloroplast development consists {{of a series of}} complex events related to chloroplast differentiation and can be divided into three steps which are coordinately regulated by <b>plastid</b> and nucleus genes (Jarvis and López-Juez 2013; Kusumi et al. 2011; Kusumi and Iba, 2014). The first step involves the activation of <b>plastid</b> replication and <b>plastid</b> DNA synthesis. The second step is the chloroplast ‘build-up’, characterized by the establishment of chloroplast genetic system. At this step nuclear-encoded <b>plastid</b> RNA polymerase (NEP) preferentially transcribes <b>plastid</b> genes encoding <b>plastid</b> gene expression machineries (Hajdukiewicz et al. 1997), and the transcription/translation activities in the chloroplast are dramatically increased. At third step, the <b>plastid</b> and nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic apparatus are expressed at very high levels. <b>Plastid</b> genes for photosynthetic apparatus are mainly transcribed by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) (Santis-Maciossek et al. 1999). All expressions of these genes lead to the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic machineries. In spite of these, the mechanisms of the major genes in higher plants remain largely unknown (Pfalz and Pfannschmidt 2013).|$|R

25|$|Each plastid creates {{multiple}} {{copies of}} a circular 75–250 kilobase plastome. The number of genome copies per plastid is variable, ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly dividing cells, which, in general, contain few <b>plastids,</b> to 100 or fewer in mature cells, where plastid divisions {{have given rise to}} a large number of <b>plastids.</b> The plastome contains about 100 genes encoding ribosomal and transfer ribonucleic acids (rRNAs and tRNAs) as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid gene transcription and translation. However, these proteins only represent {{a small fraction of the}} total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain the structure and function of a particular type of plastid. Plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins, and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of <b>plastids</b> in relation to cell differentiation.|$|E
40|$|Tilia is an ecologically and {{economically}} important genus {{in the family}} Malvaceae. However, there is no complete <b>plastid</b> genome of Tilia sequenced to date, and the taxonomy of Tilia is difficult owing to frequent hybridization and polyploidization. A well-supported interspecific relationships of this genus is not available due to limited informative sites from the commonly used molecular markers. We report here the complete <b>plastid</b> genome sequences of four Tilia species determined by the Illumina technology. The Tilia <b>plastid</b> genome is 162, 653 bp to 162, 796 bp in length, encoding 113 unique genes and a total number of 130 genes. The gene order and organization of the Tilia <b>plastid</b> genome exhibits the general structure of angiosperms and {{is very similar to}} other published <b>plastid</b> genomes of Malvaceae. As other long-lived tree genera, the sequence divergence among the four Tilia <b>plastid</b> genomes is very low.
