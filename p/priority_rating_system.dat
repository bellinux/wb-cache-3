40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This thesis {{presents}} the procedure adopted {{to develop the}} <b>priority</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> for highway safety improvements. Safety hazards are classified into four categories: (1) Railroad crossings, (2) Intersections, (3) Geometric-Related Hazards, and (4) Roadside Hazards. For each category of hazards, relationships are developed to obtain a hazard index and expected accident potentials per year. Hazard indices are used to rank the hazardous locations within each hazard category. The most hazardous locations of each category are analyzed to estimate the expected accident potentials. From the expected accident potentials, the number of fatal plus non-fatal injury accidents are then estimated and used to set priorities for safety improvements...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is how to {{incorporate}} a multi-disciplinary and inter-sectored approach into development of public health policy and plans at the local (county) level in Croatia by educational program. Method used was the public health capacity building program »Health – Plan for it«, which was developed with the aim to assist the counties to overcome recognized weaknesses and introduce more effective and efficient local public health practices. Two main instruments were used: Local Public Health Practice Performance Measures Instrument, and Basic <b>Priority</b> <b>Rating</b> <b>System.</b> This program has helped counties to asses population health needs in a participatory manner, to plan for health and, ultimately, assure provision of the right kind and quality of services (better tailored to population health needs). This program’s benefits are going beyond and above the county level. It provides support for the Healthy Cities project locally, and facilitates changes in national policymaking body’s mindset that a »one-size-fits-all« approach is sufficient...|$|E
40|$|When {{resources}} are limited, decisions {{must be made}} regarding which public health activities to undertake. A <b>priority</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system,</b> which incorporates various data sources, {{can be used to}} quantify disease problems or risk factors, or both. The model described in this paper ranks public health issues according to size, urgency, severity of the problem, economic loss, impact on others, effectiveness, propriety, economics, acceptability, legality of solutions, and availability of resources. As examples of how one State can use the model, rankings have been applied to the following health issues: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, coronary heart disease, injuries from motor vehicle accidents, and cigarette smoking as a risk factor. In this exercise, smoking is the issue with the highest overall priority rating. The model is sensitive to the precision of the data used to develop the rankings and works best for health issues that are not undergoing rapid change. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses can be incorporated into the model or used independently in the priority-setting process. Ideally, the model is used in a group setting with six to eight decision makers who represent the primary agency as well as external organizations. Using this method, health agencies, program directors, or community groups can identify the most critical issues or problems requiring intervention programs...|$|E

40|$|Pavement {{deterioration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important driver for prioritizing pavement management and preservation (PMP) projects. The primary goal of this thesis is to provide reasonable predictive functions from multiple linear regression (MLR) models and artificial neural networks (ANN) that can be adopted by Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). Furthermore, we use analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to design a composite pavement distress index in order to help Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) prioritizing PMP projects based on 11 different distress indices. Numerical results show that the MLR models provide relatively high R square values of approximately 0. 8. Both MLR and ANN models have small average squared errors (ASE). Finally, for all nine distress indices studied in this thesis, MRL models are recommended to KYTC due to their simplicity, interpretability along with robust performance that is comparable to the ANN model. Finally, a <b>priority</b> <b>rating</b> method is developed using analytical hierarchy process and it integrates 11 pavement distress indices into one priority score. A case study shows that the propose AHP-based rating method overcomes the drawback of KYTC’s current <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> for overemphasizing the international roughness index (IRI) among all distress indices...|$|R
40|$|To develop {{adaptable}} {{and context}} sensitive building <b>rating</b> <b>systems,</b> the present work aimed to evaluate four <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> that emerged {{recently in the}} Middle East.

50|$|In {{the gold}} {{standard}} and the Bretton Woods system, the major developed countries mainly implemented fixed exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b> Due to the devaluation of the pound around the 1970s {{and the collapse of}} the Bretton Woods system, many developed countries switched to floating exchange rates. In 1971, France started to adopt the dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system.</b> After that, in 1973, Italy also adopted this system. Both countries maintained these dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems</b> through the early 1970s. The Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union has been using this system since the early 1990s. Around the same time, many Latin American countries also shifted from a single exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> to a dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> or a multiple exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system.</b> With the structural adjustment to international trade that has occurred since the mid-1980s, especially the deepening of trade reform, Latin American countries have begun gradually abandoning multiple exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems,</b> favoring instead the implementation of single exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

40|$|Quality {{function}} deployment (QFD) {{has been}} widely used to translate customer requirements (CRs) into engineering characteristics (ECs) in product improvement. Product planning house of quality (PPHOQ) is of fundamental and strategic importance in the QFD system. In the construction process of the PPHOQ of mature-period (MP) product, correctly estimating the final priority ratings of ECs is essential, because it will largely affect the target value of ECs for improvement. To exploit competitive information of MP products, this paper develops a comprehensive and systematic methodology to <b>rate</b> the final <b>priority</b> of ECs for MP product improvement. The proposed method is {{on the basis of}} maximal deviation based approach (MDBA) for dealing with the corporations' performance estimations of ECs, and it integrates AHP and scale method for analyzing the <b>priority</b> <b>rating</b> of achieving the improvement goal of performance evaluation (IGPE) of each EC.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} behavioral risk factor prevalence at Lands' End, Incorporated, and to prioritize these risk factors for health promotion program intervention. A randomly-selected stratified sample of employees from three employee classifications were invited to participate in the study anonymously. Of the 493 subjects selected, 333 (67. 5 %) completed the Centers for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. Population Descriptive Statistics were used to determine prevalence estimates for nine risk factors. Sedentary lifestyle was found to be the most prevalent risk factor (47. 4 %), followed by obesity (29. 4 %), acute drinking (26. 4 %), and lack of safety belt use (22. 0 %). The Hanlon Method, a process to prioritize health interventions, was used to determine risk factor intervention priorities. This method combines four components; size of the problem, seriousness of the problem, solubility, and pertinent organizational factors, into an Overall <b>Priority</b> <b>Rating</b> formula. Sedentary lifestyle received the highest <b>priority</b> <b>rating,</b> followed by obesity, safety belt use, and smoking. Institute for WellnessThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
