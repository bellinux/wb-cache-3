25|$|An earlier {{example of}} <b>psychodrama</b> was The Pawnbroker in 1964, {{starring}} Rod Steiger. In it, Steiger played a Holocaust survivor whose spirit {{had been broken}} and lives day-to-day as a pawn shop owner in Harlem. Lumet used the film to examine, with occasional flashbacks, the psychological and spiritual scars Steiger's character lives with, including his lost capacity to feel pleasure. Steiger, who has made nearly 80 films, said during a TV interview that the film was his favorite as an actor.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{storytelling}} has a broad purview. In {{addition to}} its traditional forms (fairytales, folktales, mythology, legends, fables etc.), it has extended itself to representing history, personal narrative, political commentary and evolving cultural norms. Contemporary storytelling is also widely used to address educational objectives. New forms of media are creating new ways for people to record, express and consume stories. Tools for asynchronous group communication can provide an environment for individuals to reframe or recast individual stories into group stories. Games and other digital platforms, such as those used in interactive fiction or interactive storytelling, {{may be used to}} position the user as a character within a bigger world. Documentaries, including interactive web documentaries, employ storytelling narrative techniques to communicate information about their topic. Self-revelatory stories, created for their cathartic and therapeutic effect, are growing in their use and application, as in <b>Psychodrama,</b> Drama Therapy and Playback Theatre.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} practitioner in {{the field}} of <b>psychodrama</b> is Carl Hollander. Hollander was the 37th director certified by Moreno in <b>psychodrama.</b> He is known primarily for his creation of the Hollander <b>Psychodrama</b> Curve, which may be utilized as a way to understand how a <b>psychodrama</b> session is structured. Hollander uses the image of a curve to explain the three parts of a <b>psychodrama</b> session: the warm-up, the activity, and the integration. [...] The warm-up exists to put patients into a place of spontaneity and creativity in order to be open in the act of <b>psychodrama.</b> The [...] "activity" [...] is the actual enactment of the <b>psychodrama</b> process. Finally, the [...] "curve" [...] moves to integration. It serves as closure and discussion of the session, and considers how the session can be brought into real life – a sort of debriefing.|$|E
500|$|<b>Psychodrama</b> is {{an action}} method, {{often used as}} a psychotherapy, in which clients use {{spontaneous}} dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives. [...] Developed by Jacob L. Moreno, <b>psychodrama</b> includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space {{that serves as a}} stage area, where props can be used. [...] A <b>psychodrama</b> therapy group, under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time. Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior, reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives. [...] <b>Psychodrama</b> offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems. It may be used in a variety of clinical and community-based settings, and is most often utilized in a group setting, in which the members of the group serve as therapeutic agents for one another in the enacted drama. [...] <b>Psychodrama</b> is not, however, a form of group therapy, and is instead an individual psychotherapy that is executed from within a group. There are [...] "side-benefits" [...] that the other group members may experience, as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the <b>psychodrama</b> of another. A <b>psychodrama</b> is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method, called a <b>psychodrama</b> director.|$|E
25|$|Film {{historian}} Stephen Bowles {{notes that}} Lumet was most comfortable and {{effective as a}} director of serious <b>psychodramas,</b> as opposed to light entertainments. His Academy Award nominations, for example, were all for character studies of men in crisis, from his first film, Twelve Angry Men, to The Verdict. Lumet excelled at putting drama on the screen. Most of his characters are driven by obsessions or passions, such as the pursuit of justice, honesty, and truth, or jealousy, memory, or guilt. Lumet was intrigued by those kinds of obsessive conditions, writes Bowles.|$|R
5000|$|Number Two {{begins to}} use {{regressive}} therapy following Shakespeare's Seven Ages of Man, using the various props {{to enact a}} series of <b>psychodramas,</b> with Number Two playing the authority figure (e.g., father, headmaster, employer) and Number Six the subject (child, student, employee). Each drama is aimed at trying to make Number Six explain why he resigned. During the first six of these, Number Two finds Number Six has developed an aversion to saying the word [...] "six". Number Two also comes to like and respect Number Six as he learns more about him.|$|R

500|$|<b>Psychodrama</b> {{can be used}} in both non-{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} arenas. In the non-clinical field, <b>psychodrama</b> is used in business, education, and professional training. In the clinical field, <b>psychodrama</b> may be used to alleviate the effects of emotional trauma and PTSD. One specific application in clinical situations is for people suffering from dysfunctional attachments. For this reason, it is often utilized in the treatment of children who have suffered emotional trauma and abuse. [...] Using role-play and story telling, children may be able to express themselves emotionally and reveal truths about their experience they are not able to openly discuss with their therapist, and rehearse new ways of behavior. Moreno's theory of child development offers further insight into <b>psychodrama</b> and children. [...] Moreno suggested that child development is divided into three stages: finding personal identity, recognizing oneself (the mirror stage), and recognizing the other person (the role-reversal stage). [...] Mirroring, role-playing and other psychodramatic techniques are based on these stages. [...] Moreno believed that <b>psychodrama</b> could be used to help individuals continue their emotional development through the use of these techniques.|$|E
500|$|While {{a student}} at the University of Vienna in 1913-14, Moreno {{gathered}} a group of prostitutes as a way of discussing the social stigma and other problems they faced, starting {{what might be called the}} first [...] "support group". [...] From experiences like that, and as inspired by psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich and Freud, Moreno began to develop <b>psychodrama.</b> After moving to the United States in 1925, Moreno introduced his work with <b>psychodrama</b> to American psychologists. [...] He began this work with children, and then eventually moved on to large group <b>psychodrama</b> sessions that he held at Impromptu Group Theatre at Carnegie Hall. These sessions established Moreno's name, not only in psychological circles, but also among non-psychologists. [...] Moreno continued to teach his method of <b>psychodrama,</b> leading sessions until his death in 1974.|$|E

500|$|Aquino divided {{black magic}} into two forms, lesser black magic and greater black magic. He stated that lesser black magic entails [...] "impelling" [...] things {{that exist in}} the [...] "objective universe" [...] into doing a desired act by using [...] "obscure {{physical}} or behavioural laws" [...] and into this category he placed stage magic, <b>psychodramas,</b> politics, and propaganda. Conversely, he used the term greater black magic in reference to changes in the subjective universe of the magician, allowing them to realize their self in accordance with the principle of Xeper. Among Setians it is accepted that there may be changes in the objective universe as a result of greater black magic, however such effects are considered secondary to the impact that they have on the subjective universe.|$|R
50|$|Avant-garde writers, such as Kōbō Abe, {{who wrote}} fantastic novels such as The Woman in the Dunes (1960), wanted {{to express the}} Japanese {{experience}} in modern terms without using either international styles or traditional conventions, developed new inner visions. Yoshikichi Furui tellingly related the lives of alienated urban dwellers coping with the minutiae of daily life, while the <b>psychodramas</b> within such daily life crises have been explored by a rising number of important women novelists. The 1988 Naoki Prize went to Shizuko Todo (ja) for Ripening Summer, a story capturing the complex psychology of modern women.

The protagonist, Professor Katsumi, has {{been in charge of}} developing a computer/information system capable of predicting human behavior. Fatally for him, this system predicts his compulsive refusal to go along with his associates and his government in the creation of genetically engineered children, adapted for life in the rising seas. Most of the novel, narrated by Katsumi, deals with a philosophical confrontation between his deeply alienated refusal of the future and the computer's knowing representations of that refusal and the alternatives to it. The resulting <b>psychodramas</b> include a mysterious murder and the enlistment of his unborn child into the ranks of the mutated water-breathers." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cohen's {{story of}} United Fruit {{president}} and banana king Sam Zemurray, The Fish That Ate the Whale, {{was published by}} Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 2012. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, critic and historian Mark Lewis called the book [...] "Kiplingesque" [...] and [...] "fascinating", and provided an overview of Cohen's work. [...] "Rich Cohen books constitute a genre unto themselves: pungent, breezy, vividly written <b>psychodramas</b> about rough-edged, tough-minded Jewish machers who vanquish their rivals, and sometimes change {{the world in the}} process." [...] In The Christian Science Monitor, critic Chris Hartman called the book [...] "masterful and elegantly written ... a cautionary tale for the ages". In The Washington Post, James Auley called it [...] "immensely readable" [...] and [...] "as good an example of the American promise as one could imagine".

500|$|In <b>psychodrama,</b> {{participants}} explore internal conflicts {{by acting}} out their emotions and interpersonal interactions on stage. [...] A <b>psychodrama</b> session (typically 90 minutes to 2 hours) focuses principally {{on a single}} participant, known as the protagonist. [...] Protagonists examine their relationships by interacting with the other actors and the leader, known as the director. [...] This is done using specific techniques, including mirroring, doubling, soliloquy, and role reversal. [...] The session is often broken up into three phases - the warm-up, the action, and the post-discussion.|$|E
500|$|A core {{tenet of}} <b>psychodrama</b> is Moreno's theory of [...] "spontaneity-creativity". Moreno {{believed}} {{that the best way}} for an individual to respond creatively to a situation is through spontaneity, that is, through a readiness to improvise and respond in the moment. By encouraging an individual to address a problem in a creative way, reacting spontaneously and based on impulse, they may begin to discover new solutions to problems in their lives and learn new roles they can inhabit within it. Moreno's focus on spontaneous action within the <b>psychodrama</b> was developed in his Theatre of Spontaneity, which he directed in Vienna in the early 1920s. [...] Disenchanted with the stagnancy he observed in conventional, scripted theatre, he found himself interested in the spontaneity required in improvisational work. He founded an improvisational troupe in the 1920s. [...] This work in the theatre impacted the development of his psychodramatic theory.|$|E
500|$|Moreno is also {{credited}} for founding sociodrama. [...] Though sociodrama, like <b>psychodrama,</b> utilizes {{the theatrical}} form as means of therapy, the terms are not synonymous. [...] While <b>psychodrama</b> focuses on one patient {{within the group}} unit, Sociodrama addresses {{the group as a}} whole. [...] The goal is to explore social events, collective ideologies, and community patterns within a group in order to bring about positive change or transformation within the group dynamic. Moreno also believed that sociodrama {{could be used as a}} form of micro-sociologythat by examining the dynamic of a small group of individuals, patterns could be discovered that manifest themselves within the society as a whole, such as in Alcoholics Anonymous. [...] Sociodrama can be divided into three main categories: crisis sociodrama, which deals with group responses after a catastrophic event, political sociodrama, which attempts to address stratification and inequality issues within a society, and diversity sociodrama, which considers conflicts based on prejudice, racism or stigmatization.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, Italian avant-garde, {{alternative}} {{rock and}} Metal bands gained international notoriety, {{at least among}} critics. In general, the sonic model {{was a mixture of}} Big Black, Sonic Youth and Fugazi, while the themes coined a sort of neo-existentialism, very much concerned with the <b>psychodramas</b> of ordinary kids. Italy, the homeland of melodic music, {{turned out to be one}} of the major international centers for post-rock. Gianna Nannini in the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s was the first Italian rocker who achieve real popular success outside of Italy. Especially in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Benelux and later in Mexico. While Francesco De Gregori was well appreciated by critics and well-informed fans outside of Italy it was Nannini who was first Italian pop icon to stick and to shift between pop and rock with ease and to stay the course through trends and upcoming generations. Zucchero, Eros Ramazzotti and Jovanotti (later: Nek and Laura Pausini) all went on to become huge international pop names in the late 1980s and 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, Sigmund Freud {{wrote that}} [...] "with the {{progress}} of psychoanalytic studies {{the importance of the}} Oedipus complex has become, more and more, clearly evident; its recognition has become the shibboleth that distinguishes the adherents of psychoanalysis from its opponents"; thereby it remained a theoretic cornerstone of psychoanalysis until about 1930, when psychoanalysts began investigating the pre-Oedipal son-mother relationship within the theory of psychosexual development. Janet Malcolm reports that by the late 20th century, to the object relations psychology [...] "avant-garde, the events of the Oedipal period are pallid and inconsequential, in comparison with the cliff-hanging <b>psychodramas</b> of infancy. ... For Kohut, as for Winnicott and Balint, the Oedipus complex is an irrelevance in the treatment of severe pathology". Nonetheless, ego psychology continued to maintain that [...] "the Oedipal period—roughly three-and-a-half to six years—is like Lorenz {{standing in front of the}} chick, it is the most formative, significant, moulding experience of human life ... If you take a person's adult life—his love, his work, his hobbies, his ambitions—they all point back to the Oedipus complex".|$|R
40|$|Doppelgänger' is a four-screen {{stereoscopic}} dance installation jointly {{commissioned by}} the New Art Gallery Walsall (NAGW) with the Arts Council England (£ 15 k), {{as part of its}} Capture 4 series. Cowie’s research built on the interdisciplinary work of the earlier 'Men in the Wall' in three specific areas; gallery as site; nano-choreography; deep stereoscopic projection. The resultant work, sited in an art gallery, was designed to create new inter-audience relationships to the work, empowering each spectator to view the work in their own unique fashion. This was further enhanced by the out-of-phase looping of the four films providing a non-repeating infinity of relationships between the four films and especially their hyper-sound tracks. Conceived by Cowie and collaborator Aggiss, this dance installation introduced a number of innovations in the field. Shot entirely on location at the NAGW using its iconic architecture as a foil to the choreographed dancers, the site was thus embedded in the site itself. The more conventional anaglyph stereoscopy of 'Men in the Wall' was replaced with an experimental and novel projected double-image system, viewed with specially-made prism glasses that give an unparalleled sense of depth to each of the four scenes. The use of high resolution digital still cameras rather than conventional video technology offered new challenges – the resulting series of over 16, 000 still images were meticulously constructed into the four moving sequences. This filming technique allowed the choreographic process to be minutely crafted in 1 / 8 th second slices, a form of nano-choreography where every nuance of movement and expression was constructed frame by frame. The performance takes the form of four miniature <b>psychodramas</b> where the principal dancer is relentlessly plagiarised by the other performers (this in itself mirrored by the stereoscopic doubling of the images) ...|$|R
