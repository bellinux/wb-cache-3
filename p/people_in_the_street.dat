25|$|On 13 February 1978, the Sydney Hilton Hotel was bombed, {{one of the}} few {{domestic}} terrorist incidents on Australian soil. The Hotel was {{the location}} for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). Three <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> were killed – two council workers and a policeman – and several others injured. Former police officer Terry Griffiths, who was injured in the explosion, provided some evidence that suggested ASIO might have orchestrated the bombing or been aware of the possibility and allowed it to proceed. In 1985, the Director-General of Security issued a specific denial of the allegation. In 1991 the New South Wales parliament unanimously called for a joint State-Federal inquiry into the bombing. However, the Federal government vetoed any inquiry.|$|E
500|$|Yellow Star {{received}} starred {{reviews in}} Publishers Weekly and Booklist. The Publishers Weekly review commended {{the book for}} [...] "the lyricism of the narrative, and Syvia's credible childlike voice, maturing with each chapter, as she gains further understanding of the events around her". Another reviewer praised the format, saying the [...] "free-verse format suits the young narrator and subject matter well" [...] and concluding that [...] "Readers searching for an accessible Holocaust novel will be absorbed by this haunting story based on true events". Library Media Connections review praises Roy for her age-appropriate language: [...] "When Syvia witnesses the shooting of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> author Jennifer Roy captures {{the fear of the}} moment without graphic descriptions". Yellow Star was selected as a [...] "fiction and poetry honor book" [...] in the 2006 Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book for Older Readers in April 2007, and won the 2009 William Allen White Children's Book Award, selected by vote of sixth- through eighth-graders in Kansas.|$|E
500|$|In New York City, Bella Abzug, who had {{introduced}} the first gay {{civil rights bill}} in U.S. Congress in 1974, was awoken at 2 am by <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> chanting her name. [...] "It {{was hard not to}} feel sad for this crowd", Abzug said of the several hundred people below her window. She was optimistic, telling them the defeat would develop a maturity and determination in gay activism. About the same time that evening, about 3,000 gay men and lesbians spontaneously gathered in what had become the largest gay neighborhood in the United States—Castro Street in San Francisco—furious at the loss in Dade County. The crowd marched around the Castro District, chanting [...] "We Are Your Children!" [...] pulling people out of gay bars to cheers. Local gay activist and future supervisor Harvey Milk led marchers through a [...] course through the city, careful not to stop for too long lest rioting began. He addressed the crowd with a bullhorn: [...] "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force". The day after the vote, Jean O'Leary and NGTF co-director Bruce Voeller said Bryant was doing [...] "an enormous favor" [...] for the gay community by focusing national media attention on discrimination against them.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

They also ruled that Google Street View does not contravene the Data Protection Act, as an image of a house held on Street View is not a data protection matter, as data protection is about people's personal information.|$|E

2500|$|The {{weapon was}} {{designed}} as a private venture by William Godfray de Lisle (known as Godfray), an engineer who worked for the Air Ministry. He made the first prototype in [...]22 calibre; this he tested by shooting rabbits and other small game for the table, near his home on the Berkshire Downs. In 1943, he approached Major Sir Malcolm Campbell of Combined Operations with his prototype; this was informally tested by firing the weapon into the River Thames from the roof of the New Adelphi building in London. This was chosen to discover if <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> below heard it firing – they did not. Combined Operations officials were impressed with the weapon and requested De Lisle produce a 9mm version. However, this was a failure. A third prototype, using the [...]45 ACP cartridge that was favoured by de Lisle, was much more successful. Tests of this showed the weapon had acceptable accuracy, produced no visible muzzle flash and was inaudible at a distance of [...]|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 1998 the Taliban {{launched}} {{an attack on}} Mazar-i Sharif. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, {{and thousands of people}} were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead. At this time ten Iranian diplomats and a journalist were killed. Iran assumed the Taliban had murdered them, and mobilized its army, deploying men along the border with Afghanistan. By the middle of September there were 250,000 Iranian personnel stationed on the border. Pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to Tehran {{towards the end of the}} month. The killings of the Diplomats had been carried out by Sipah-e-Sahaba a Pakistani Sunni group with close ties to the ISI. [...] They burned orchards, crops and destroyed irrigation systems, and forced more than 100,000 people from their homes with hundreds of men, women and children still unaccounted for.|$|E
