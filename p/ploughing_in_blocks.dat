40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the impact of different management systems of grass-clover (various cutting and/or mulching combinations) and date of ploughing (autumn or spring) {{on the fate of}} nitrogen (N) and the yield of succeeding wheat. The 3 -cut system resulted in nitrate losses below the limit of the EC Nitrate Directive (91 / 676 /EEC), even with <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn. When <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> spring, treatments with frequent cutting and/or mulching induced nitrate leaching below the critical value. In contrast, losses from swards mulched only once were considerably above the threshold value, independently of ploughing time. With swards mulched and <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> autumn, nitrate concentrations exceed the EC-limit. The management of grass-clover swards did not affect the yield of wheat, whereas <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn increased the yield. It is concluded, that appropriate grass-clover management and date of ploughing can reduce N-leaching, even in stockless farms...|$|R

40|$|Litterbag {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} {{different}} ploughing depths on decomposition rate of barley straw with different ploughing depths. The burying depth of the litter (13 vs 25 cm) affected the decomposition rate of barely straw more than the different ploughing depths (13 vs 25 cm). From our results we suggest that slowly decomposable organic matter, such as leached barley straw, may be incorporated deeply by <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> organic cereal production systems, in order to regulate perennial weeds. In soils with good structure and porosity, the decomposition rate of straw can even be larger with deep <b>ploughing.</b> <b>In</b> dense, clayey soils {{it is important to be}} very accurate <b>in</b> <b>ploughing</b> time <b>in</b> order to secure that the <b>ploughing</b> is <b>in</b> fact loosening the soil. Otherwise, lack of oxygen and low decomposition of straw is likely to be the results...|$|R
