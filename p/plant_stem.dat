5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E

5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{all species}} have a tight cluster of leaves (a rosette), {{either at the}} base of the plant or at the end of a more-or-less woody stem as with Yucca. In some cases the leaves are {{produced}} along the stem. The flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive, being of a general 'lily type', with six tepals, either free or fused from the base and up to six stamina. They are frequently clustered at the end of the <b>plant</b> <b>stem.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{there are}} {{only a small number of}} ants in any given area on the <b>plant</b> <b>stem.</b> There are about 40 workers per leaf, but {{generally}} only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.|$|E
500|$|The most {{critical}} factors in flowering and fruit set are physiological, {{having to do}} with the age of the plant and whether it already has developing fruit. The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key in fruit set and development. Ethylene promotes the production of female flowers. When a plant already has a fruit developing, subsequent female flowers on the plant are less likely to mature, a phenomenon called [...] "first-fruit dominance", and male flowers are more frequent, an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the <b>plant</b> <b>stem.</b> Ethephon, a plant growth regulator product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant, can be used to increase fruit and seed production.|$|E

500|$|Cucurbita species {{fall into}} two main groups. The first group are annual or {{short-lived}} perennial vines and are mesophytic, i.e. they require {{a more or less}} continuous water supply. The second group are perennials growing in arid zones and so are xerophytic, tolerating dry conditions. Cultivated Cucurbita species were derived from the first group. Growing [...] in height or length, the <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is C.ficifolia, and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial Cucurbita can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among Cucurbita fruits, and even within a single species. C.ficifolia is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance. The morphological variation in the species C.pepo and C.maxima is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.|$|E
500|$|Mating in dragonflies is a complex, {{precisely}} choreographed process. First, {{the male}} has {{to attract a}} female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When {{he is ready to}} mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, {{near the end of his}} abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2–3, near the base of his abdomen. The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen; the structure of the claspers varies between species, and may help to prevent interspecific mating. The pair flies in tandem with the male in front, typically perching on a twig or <b>plant</b> <b>stem.</b> The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male's secondary genitalia, while the male uses his [...] "tail" [...] claspers to grip the female behind the head: this distinctive posture is called the [...] "heart" [...] or [...] "wheel"; the pair may also be described as being [...] "in cop".|$|E
2500|$|According to Theodore Andrea Cook, Barr {{gave the}} golden ratio {{the name of}} phi (ϕ) in about 1909; Cook wrote that Barr chose ϕ by analogy {{to the use of}} [...] for the ratio of a circle's {{circumference}} to its diameter, and because it is the first Greek letter {{in the name of the}} ancient sculptor Phidias. (Although Martin Gardner later wrote that Phidias was chosen because he was [...] "believed to have used the golden proportion frequently in his sculpture", Barr himself denied this, writing in his paper [...] "Parameters of beauty" [...] that he doubted Phidias used the golden ratio.) Schooling communicated some of his discoveries with Barr to Cook after seeing an article by Cook about phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a <b>plant</b> <b>stem,</b> which often approximates the golden ratio.|$|E

2500|$|Dolomedes spiders {{are covered}} all over in short, velvety hairs which are unwettable (hydrophobic). [...] This {{allows them to}} use surface tension to stand or run on the water, like pond skaters. [...] They can also climb beneath the water, and then air becomes trapped in the body hairs and forms a thin film over the whole {{surface of the body}} and legs, giving them the {{appearance}} of fine polished silver. [...] Like other spiders, Dolomedes breathe with book lungs beneath their abdomens, and these open into the air film, allowing the spiders to breathe while submerged. [...] The trapped air makes them very buoyant and if they do not hold onto a rock or a <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> they float to the surface where they pop onto the surface film, completely dry.|$|E
50|$|Despite that callus {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} stem cell-like properties for a temporary period {{and that it has}} been cultured for useful plant compounds as an alternative source of <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> cell, callus and <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> cell are fundamentally different from each other. Callus is similar to <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> cell in its ability to differentiate, but the two are different in their origin.

5000|$|Cambium {{is a type}} of {{meristem}} {{with thin}} walls which minutely exist in small populations within a plant. Due to this structural characteristic, once physical force is applied to it, it is easily damaged in the very process of isolation, losing its stem cell characteristics. Despite 160 years of biological effort to isolate and retrieve <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> cells, none succeeded in the isolation due to the distinct structural characteristics of <b>plant</b> <b>stem</b> cell: [...] "the cambium consists of a few layers of narrow elongated, thin-walled cells, easily damaged during sampling."
