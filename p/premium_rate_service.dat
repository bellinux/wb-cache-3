Although they are undoubtedly of significant importance {{to the structure of}} businesses, surprisingly there exists just a little work on integration of legal constraints into private business or public workflow models. In our paper, we integrate legal constraints into a formal business process model and use the resulting specification as a reference model for workflow implementations. We analyse a business-to-government process where the legal framework has a strong influence on the processes on both sides. As an example we consider the process of applying for <b>premium</b> <b>rate</b> <b>service</b> numbers at the German regulation authority for telecommunication and post.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the telecommunication industry in Denmark is quite liberal. There are no requirements to register with national authorities when providing telecommunication services or Premium Rate Services. Only Network Operators, {{who want to make}} use of the scarce frequency resources, must register with the National IT and Telecom Agency. This liberal approach may be a contributory factor to the fact that there are no official statistics on Premium Rate Services available from public authorities. This article is structured into five parts concerning 1) Premium Rate Services in Denmark, 2) relevant actors, 3) regulation concerning Network Operators, 4) regulation concerning Content Providers, and 5) telecommunication services that are not Premium Rate Services. The proposed structure has been departed to reflect the general division of regulation concerning the Network Operator and the Content Provider, respectively. The areas covered, reflects the regulation that is relevant to those Premium Rate Services provided in Denmark. The emphasis of the article is laid on the regulation safeguarding consumers in the context of Premium Rate Services. This regulation may be grouped into regulation that: sets requirements for carrying out business as Network Operator or Content Provider, concerns which <b>Premium</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Service</b> may be provided, and under which number-series or applications codes, imposes certain information requirements, ensures fair and truthful marketing of the Premium Rate Services, or allows the User to monitor his bill, limit his usage, or limits the liability in connection to unauthorised usage. Infringement of the legislation in question is mainly sanctioned by administrative or civil sanctions. The overall impression is that the Danish telecommunication industry is quite active in securing compliance with the law...|$|E

50|$|The other set {{of changes}} {{affected}} mobile, non-geographic and <b>premium</b> <b>rate</b> numbers, completing {{a series of}} steps first detailed almost a decade earlier. In the early-1990s, mobile, non-geographic and <b>premium</b> <b>rate</b> <b>services</b> had used nine digit numbers with various codes such as 0402, 0645, and 0898 scattered among the similar-looking geographic area codes such as 0384, 0562 and 0949. The number of available codes for new services was quickly dwindling. In 1995, PhONEday partially addressed this by altering all geographic area codes to begin 01, freeing up hundreds of codes beginning 02 to 09 for other uses. Existing mobile, non-geographic and <b>premium</b> <b>rate</b> <b>services</b> continued as before, using various codes from 02 to 09 and with nine-digit numbers.|$|R
