The paper can itself be shaped to create the desired effects in the final image. Many of László Moholy-Nagy's photograms were luminograms. The image is created by variations in light shape and intensity. They can be created using a small light source, as from a flashlight, that is moved to expose the <b>photosensitive</b> <b>substrate.</b> Moholy-Nagy used this technique to create many of his photograms.Gottfried Jäger (photographic theorist) describes this as [...] "the result of pure light design; the rudimentary expression of an interaction of light and photosensitive material… a kind of self representation of light." ...|$|E

The dependence of the observed effects on the wavelength, polarization direction of the light, and on {{the thickness of the}} LC layer is explained by a model based on photoinduced surface torque. The application possibilities of the phenomena are also explored. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Liquid crystal layers {{sandwiched}} between a reference plate and a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>substrate</b> were investigated. We {{focused on the}} reverse geometry, where the cell was illuminated by a laser beam from the reference side. In planar cells instabilities occurred, static and dynamic ones, depending on the angle between the laser polarization and the director orientation on the reference plate. In cells where the molecules were aligned along the normal of the reference plate, dynamic pattern was observed at all angles of polarization. A simple model based on a photo-induced surface torque gives account of the findings. Light scattering studies revealed some basic properties of the instabilities. Comment: to appear in Phys.

40|$|We discuss {{advantages}} of using non-classical states of light for {{two aspects of}} optical imaging: creating of miniature images on <b>photosensitive</b> <b>substrates,</b> which constitutes the foundation for optical lithography, and conversely, imaging of micro objects. In both cases, the classical resolution limit given by the Rayleigh criterion is approximately a half of the optical wavelength. It has been shown, however, that by using multi-photon quantum states of the light field, and multi-photon sensitive material or detector, this limit can be surpassed. In the present work, we give a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of this problem, address some particularly widespread misconceptions and discuss the requirements arising on the way of turning the research on quantum imaging into a practical technology...|$|R
40|$|The most used {{methods such as}} ion implantation, laser {{irradiation}} and nanosphere lithography for modification {{and creation}} of special microrelief of thin absorbing films on <b>photosensitive</b> <b>substrates</b> have been described. Controlled modification of surface structure of the samples for improving their optical properties, especially for enhancing absorption, has many applications in optical devices. The basic things were analyzed from selection of film materials and ways for their further processing to shapes and dimensions of the obtained surface structures.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages of}} using non-classical states of light for two aspects of optical imaging: the creation of microscopic images on <b>photosensitive</b> <b>substrates,</b> which constitutes the foundation for optical lithography, and the imaging of microscopic objects. In both cases, the classical resolution limit given by the Rayleigh criterion is {{approximately half of the}} optical wavelength. It has been shown, however, that by using multi-photon quantum states of the light field, and a multi-photon sensitive material or detector, this limit can be surpassed. A rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of this problem is given, some particularly widespread misconceptions are addressed, and turning quantum imaging into a practical technology is discussed. The idea of overcoming the limits of classical optical imaging by using multiphoton processes is fairly well known.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{optical microscopy}} (NLM) modalities of Multi-Photon Excited Fluorescence (MPEF) and Third Harmonic Generation (THG) have been combined {{in this work}} to characterize {{as a function of}} depth with micrometric resolution the type and extent of morphological and photochemical modifications that take place upon ultraviolet (UV) pulsed laser removal of a dammar varnish layer applied on a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>substrate.</b> The latter consists on a layer of the synthetic polymer polymethyl methacrylate doped with a photosensitizer, the aromatic compound 1, 4 -di[2 -(5 -phenyloxazolyl) ] benzene, that strongly fluoresces upon UV light illumination. A number of laser conditions for partial or total elimination of the varnish coating were explored, namely different wavelengths (266, 248 and 213 nm) and pulse durations, in the nanosecond, picosecond and femtosecond ranges. Changes in the MPEF signals upon laser ablation of the outermost varnish layer successfully signpost photochemical modifications of the varnish or of the photosensitive under-layer, and their dependence with the laser ablation parameters, i. e., wavelength and pulse duration. In turn, THG signals mark the presence of layer boundaries and the reduction by laser ablation of the thickness of the varnish coating. The obtained MPEF and THG data are complemented by morphological observation by optical microscopy and measurements of laser induced fluorescence and micro-Raman spectra of the samples before and after laser ablation at the selected laser irradiation conditions. The results acquired through these nondestructive NLM imaging techniques serve to understand the phenomena that are induced upon laser ablation and to determine the best operating conditions that ensure controlled removal of the varnish with minimal morphological and chemical modifications to the under-layers. This research is of direct application to the UV pulsed laser cleaning of paintings and demonstrates the potential of NLM as a novel assessment tool for non-destructive, on line monitoring of the laser cleaning process.

The idea of overcoming the limits of classical optical imaging by using multi-photon processes is fairly well known. For example, Marlan Scully discusses, in his book [1], a two-photon microscope scheme that beats the diffraction limitation by a factor of √ 2, by making a sinc 4 (kx) diffraction pattern instead of the usual sinc 2 (kx). Such narrowing of a diffraction pattern can be observed by a detector sensitive to the square of intensity...|$|R

We first realize a theoretical study of the programming of a multilayer Fabry-Perot filter, then of the programming of a cascaded solid-spaced Fabry-Perot filter; finally of an ”hybrid” filter composed with a Bragg grating and a dielectric mirror. Secondly, we make a presentation of {{the realization of}} an absolute optical thickness measurement set-up of optical windows and we show the experimental results of the characterization of potentially <b>photosensitive</b> thin <b>substrates.</b> Finally, we describe the experimental manufacturing of a guided hybrid filter, and of the programming of a solid-spaced etalon. Nous presentons differentes applications de la photosensibilite a la realization de filtres optiques interferentiels. Nous commencons par une etude theorique de la programmation de la reponse spectrale d'un fabry-Perot multicouches et de celle d'un filtre a cavites-substrats tandem; enfin nous presentons le principe de fonctionnement d'un filtre dit ”hybride”, compose d'un miroir de Bragg et d'un miroir dielectrique.

40|$|Direct UV Writing (DUW) is a {{relatively}} new technique used to define channels on <b>photosensitive</b> planar <b>substrates</b> and relies on a photosensitive reaction of the substrate material to UV light irradiation. Photosensitivity refers to the permanent (but reversible) change in the index of refraction of the waveguide core when exposed to light with characteristic wavelength and intensity that depends on the core material. A laser with an emission around the 240 nm absorption window is focussed down to a circular spot about 4 µm in diameter and the sample is then translated relative to this writing spot, with the path of translation defining the channel waveguide structure. The more advanced Direct Grating Writing (DGW) technique involves utilising interference pattern generated by crossed UV beams and allows the simultaneous definition of channel waveguides and grating structures. The UV interference pattern is generated by intersecting two tightly focussed coherent UV beams at a fixed point in space. A photosensitive sample is then aligned with this interference spot and translated relative to it. Both of the techniques require no clean room facility and involve no etching processes. UV writing is particularly attractive for researching crossed waveguides as it is does not require etching and allows a smooth and continuous merging and splitting of channels. Characterisation of direct UV written straight channels, s-bends and crossed waveguides are presented in this manuscript. The structures were defined on 3 -layer photosensitive silica-on-silicon (SiO 2 :Si) samples fabricated via flame hydrolysis deposition (FHD), involving the production of silica soot through the injection of halide reagents into a hydrogen/oxygen (H 2 /O 2) flame. Straight channels written at various fluences show a saturation effect, possibly due to the sample reaching its upper limit of photosensitivity level whereas the s-bends display the reduction in excess loss with increase of bend radius as expected...|$|R
