5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she is {{passed by a}} man riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, {{it does not seem}} likely that they are a common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The <b>Prisoner,</b> in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held <b>prisoner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Farrow was posthumously given {{multiple}} awards. These {{included the}} Order of the Sacred Tripod (寶鼎勳章) of the Republic of China, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Purple Heart.

25|$|On February 22, {{the first}} Confederate <b>prisoners</b> arrived by train at Indianapolis. Additional <b>prisoners</b> {{arrived at the}} camp {{over the next three}} days, {{bringing}} the number of <b>prisoners</b> to thirty-seven hundred men. Local residents helped provide the necessary food, clothing, and nursing to the incoming <b>prisoners.</b> The death rate among the unfortunate Confederate <b>prisoners</b> was high. In March 1862, 144 <b>prisoners</b> died at the camp. By April 1 the camp's inhabitants, including <b>prisoners</b> and guards, numbered five thousand. More <b>prisoners</b> arrived in subsequent months, including a group of a thousand <b>prisoners</b> from the battle at Shiloh.|$|R

50|$|In 1945 {{when the}} prison {{was taken over}} by the Soviet and Polish forces, it was used briefly to hold German <b>prisoners</b> of war and other German <b>prisoners.</b> After the war, from 1945-1955, the prison was {{attached}} to the Ministry of Public Security and again used for political <b>prisoners.</b> A notable group of <b>prisoners</b> early on was formed from former soldiers of Armia Krajowa. The prison was still overcrowded, often holding about 3,000 <b>prisoners,</b> and <b>prisoners</b> were again mistreated. About 250 <b>prisoners</b> died during that period, out of over 15,000 imprisoned.|$|R
50|$|Kim {{reported}} that the <b>prisoners</b> have no human rights and are treated at the guards’ mercy. To humiliate the <b>prisoners,</b> the guards would force them to get on their knees, and then spit into the <b>prisoner's</b> mouths and make them swallow the spit. If <b>prisoners</b> do not immediately obey, they are savagely beaten. The <b>prisoners</b> are monitored almost continuously by security agents and are urged to spy on {{each other and to}} denounce other <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only {{very sick}} <b>prisoners</b> were {{admitted}} to the camp infirmary. SS doctors conducted periodic selections there and among the other <b>prisoners</b> as well; <b>prisoners</b> who were {{no longer able to}} work were moved to the Birkenau hospital sector (BIIf). The rotation of <b>prisoners</b> was significant as new <b>prisoners</b> replaced those who had been selected. For example, from May 8 to 14, 1944, as many as 42 Fürstengrube <b>prisoners</b> entered the hospital sector of Birkenau.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prisoners</b> {{themselves}} are categorized as [...] "civil prisoners," [...] criminal <b>prisoners,</b> <b>prisoners</b> charged under the National Security Act, and military personnel convicted in military court. Detainees are classed as those under criminal investigation, detainees under trial, and other detainees [...] "as directed by court for civil cases." [...] Populations of civil, criminal, and political <b>prisoners</b> {{are to be}} separated from each other while inside. <b>Prisoners</b> may wear their own clothing, subject to a dress code, and may even raise children on prison grounds through age nine. <b>Prisoners</b> are allowed spousal conjugal visits, provided female <b>prisoners</b> agree to prevent conception. These benefits are balanced by six-day weeks of hard labour within the prisons, imposed on all but juveniles, the physically and mentally infirm, political <b>prisoners,</b> and <b>prisoners</b> with pending trials.|$|R
5|$|Yount {{served two}} {{terms in the}} Union Army during the American Civil War. He first enlisted for a six-month term in November 1861.

5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards <b>prisoner</b> management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure <b>prisoner</b> welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E

5|$|After {{extensive}} reorganization {{during the}} winter of 1863–1864, Walker and the Army of the Potomac fought in the Overland Campaign through May and June 1864. The Battle of Cold Harbor in early June took a substantial toll on the ranks of the II Corps and Walker injured his knee during the battle. In the ensuing Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, Walker was appointed a brevet colonel. However, on August 25, 1864, as he rode to find Maj. Gen. John Gibbon at the front during the Second Battle of Ream's Station, Walker was surrounded and captured by the 11th Georgia Infantry. On August 27, Walker was able to escape from a marching <b>prisoner</b> column with another <b>prisoner</b> but was recaptured by the 51st North Carolina Infantry after trying to swim across the Appomattox River and nearly drowning. After being held as a <b>prisoner</b> in Petersburg, he was transferred to the infamous Libby Prison in Richmond, where his older brother was also held. In October 1864, Walker was released with thirty other prisoners as a part of an exchange.|$|E

50|$|In late April 1945 a {{group of}} 140 high-status <b>prisoners</b> were {{transferred}} to Tyrol, guarded by SS troops. A delegation from the <b>prisoners</b> contacted senior German army officers, made known {{the identity of the}} high-status <b>prisoners,</b> and conveyed the apprehension that those <b>prisoners</b> were to be executed. A regular German army unit under the command of Captain von Alvensleben moved in to protect the <b>prisoners.</b> Outnumbered, the SS guards moved out, leaving the <b>prisoners</b> behind. The <b>prisoners</b> were then set free, with the majority taking sanctuary for a time in Pragser Wildsee until the arrival of U.S. troops.|$|R
