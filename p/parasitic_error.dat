40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a family of}} XY flexure mechanisms with large ranges of motion, first-order decoupled degrees of freedom, and small <b>parasitic</b> <b>error</b> motions. Synthesis {{is based on an}} systematic and symmetric layout of constraints that are realized by means of common flexure building blocks. An analytical formulation incorporating geometric non-linearities is used in deriving the characteristics of these flexure building blocks. Of concern are issues related to qualification and quantification of undesirable motions, mobility, stiffness variation within the range of motion, determination of center of stiffness, and sensitivity to manufacturing and assembly tolerances. Based on the properties of the building blocks, the performances characteristics of the resulting XY flexure mechanisms are discussed and the influence of symmetry in reducing error motions is analytically illustrated. To verify the design theory, a 300 mm x 300 mm prototype stage was fabricated, assembled and tested at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

40|$|We {{developed}} and tested a novel rotation scanner for nano resolution and accurate rotary motion about the rotation center. The scanner consists of circular hinges and leaf springs {{so that the}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>error</b> {{at the center of}} the scanner in the X and Y directions is minimized, and rotation performance is optimized. Each sector of the scanner's system was devised to have nano resolution by minimizing the parasitic errors of the rotation center that arise due to displacements other than rotation. The analytic optimal design results of the proposed scanner were verified using finite element analyses. The piezoelectric actuators were used to attain nano-resolution performances, and a capacitive sensor was used to measure displacement. A feedback controller was used to minimize the rotation errors in the rotation scanner system under practical conditions. Finally, the performance evaluation test results showed that the resonance frequency was 542 Hz, the resolution was 0. 09 μrad, and the rotation displacement was 497. 2 μrad.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the principles necessary to guide designers {{in determining the}} optimal number and placement of actuators for driving the stage of a general serial or hybrid flexure system at any desired speed. Although the degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a flexure system are largely determined by the location and orientation of its flexure elements, the system’s stage will tend to displace in unwanted directions (i. e., parasitic errors) while attempting to traverse its intended DOFs {{if it is not}} actuated correctly. The problem of correctly placing actuators is difficult because the optimal location changes depending on the speed with which the stage is driven. Moreover the issue of correctly actuating the stage of a serial or hybrid flexure system is substantially more complicated than actuating the stage of a parallel system because serial and hybrid systems possess multiple rigid bodies, which greatly enhance the system’s dynamic complexity, and provide a host of alternative options for actuating the system with its intended DOFs. In this paper we review the principles of static and dynamic actuation space and provide the mathematics necessary to apply these spaces to serial and hybrid systems such that designers can rapidly visualize all the ways actuators can be placed to correctly drive any combination of the system’s rigid body constituents such that the system’s stage achieves the desired DOFs with minimal <b>parasitic</b> <b>error</b> at any speed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} reduce {{parasitic}} mismatch in analog circuits, some groups of devices are required to share a common centroid while being placed. Devices are split into smaller ones and placed with a common center point. We will address this problem of handling common centroid constraint in placement. A new representation called Centerbased Corner Block List (C-CBL) is proposed which is {{a natural extension of}} Corner Block List (CBL) [1] to represent a common centroid placement of a set of device pairs. C-CBL is complete and non-redundant in representing any common centroid mosaic packings with pairs of blocks to be matched. To address the same problem with an additional constraint that devices are required to be placed uniformly to average out the <b>parasitic</b> <b>errors,</b> a grid-based approach is proposed. Experimental results show that both approaches are fast and promising, and have high scalability that even large data sets can be handled effectively. I...|$|R

30|$|The current {{research}} of kinetostatic characteristics in flexure mechanisms mainly {{focus on the}} improvement of accuracy. To reduce or eliminate the parasitic motion is considered as an approach by using the common knowledge of symmetry. However, there is no study on designing the flexure mechanisms with symmetrical features {{as many as possible}} for better kinetostatic performance, when considering the resulting cost by the symmetry. In this paper, the concept of degree of symmetry (DoS) is proposed for the first time, which is committed to symmetry design in the phase of conceptual design. A class of flexure mechanisms with 0 -DoS, 1 -DoS, 2 -DoS and 3 -DoS are synthesized respectively based on the Freedom and Constraint Topology method. Their overall compliance matrices in an analytical form formulated {{within the framework of the}} screw theory are used to analyze and compare the effect of different number of DoS on the kinetostatic characteristics for flexure mechanisms. The finite element analysis (FEA) simulations are implemented to verify the analytical results. These results show that the higher the DoS is, the smaller the <b>parasitic</b> motion <b>error</b> will be. The flexure model with 3 -DoS is optimized according to the overall compliance matrix and then tested by using the FEA simulation. The testing result shows that with the best combination parameters, the <b>parasitic</b> motion <b>error</b> for 3 -DoS mechanism is almost eliminated. This research introduces a design principle which can alleviate the unwanted parasitic motion for better accuracy.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates lower-power lower-voltage {{analog circuit}} techniques suitable for wireless sensor applications. Wireless sensors {{have been used}} {{in a wide range of}} applications and will become ubiquitous with the revolution of internet of things (IoT). Due to the demand of low cost, miniature desirable size and long operating cycle, passive wireless sensors which don 2 ̆ 7 t require battery are more preferred. Such sensors harvest energy from energy sources in the environment such as radio frequency (RF) waves, vibration, thermal sources, etc. As a result, the obtained energy is very limited. This creates strong demand for low power, lower voltage circuits. The RF and analog circuits in the wireless sensor usually consume most of the power. This motivates the research presented in the dissertation. Specially, the research focuses on the design of a low power high efficiency regulator, low power Resistance to Digital Converter (RDC), low power Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) with <b>parasitic</b> <b>error</b> reduction and a low power low voltage Low Dropout (LDO) regulator. This dissertation includes a low power analog circuit design for the RFID wireless sensor which consists of the energy harvest circuits (an optimized rectifier and a regulator with high current efficiency) and a sensor measurement circuit (RDC), a single end sampling SAR ADC with no error induced by the parasitic capacitance and a digital loop LDO whose line and load variation response is improved. These techniques will boost the design of the wireless sensor and they can also be used in other similar low power design...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{formulate}} an index for accuracy, parasitic motion {{is defined as}} any undesirable motion along the constraint directions of a mechanism [6]. There are several methods to reduce and even to eliminate the parasitic motion. The first method is to tune the structural parameters and material properties without changing the type of flexure mechanisms. Li et al. [7, 8] analyzed a family of [PP]S parallel mechanisms and took the 3 -PRS parallel mechanism as an example to reveal the relationship between structural parameters and parasitic motion, and then showed the necessary structural condition for a 3 -PRS parallel mechanism without parasitic motion. However, it is rather difficult to eliminate the parasitic motion by optimizing the geometrical parameters. The second one is designing a parasitic-motion compensation module, as done in linear-motion flexure mechanisms [9]. Trease et al. [10] and Cannon et al. [11] constructed a linear-motion flexure mechanism with higher accuracy by mirroring two double-parallelogram flexure modules. A class of compliant Roberts mechanisms can also be combined both in serial and parallel {{to compensate for the}} parasitic motion [12]. In respect to the multi-axis motion mechanism, an extended parasitic motion compensation approach that characterizes 3 D flexure deformations with twists and <b>parasitic</b> <b>error</b> with compliance elements is proposed to synthesize multi-axis flexure mechanism [13]. It is noted that symmetry design is essentially a special case of the latter method, which is to design a system free of parasitic motion directly. Several practical full-symmetrical compliant mechanisms have been studied by Hao et al. [14 – 16], in which tri-symmetrical planar structures enabled three large-range out-of-plane motions.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and control of flexure-based {{mechanisms}} for applications requiring multi-degree-of-freedom positioning and alignment. Example applications include positioning a probe or sample in atomic force microscopy, alignment of tool and sample in stamping processes, and fine-positioning of wafer steppers in semiconductor manufacturing. Such applications necessitate nanopositioning systems that satisfy critical functional requirements, such as load-capacity, bandwidth, resolution, and range. Therefore, a systematic approach for design and control is an important tool {{for research and development}} for flexure-based nanopositioning systems. In this thesis, a novel methodology is presented for generating flexure-based topologies that can meet performance requirements, such as those dictating structural strength or dynamical behavior. We present performance metrics that allow for the generation of topologies that are tuned for a desired level of structural strength or modal separation. The topology generation is aimed as a valuable addition to the design toolkit, facilitating novel designs that could not have been conceived otherwise. The parameters within any particular topology could be adjusted at a subsequent phase through a detailed shape and size optimization. The thesis also proposes a controller generation approach. Unlike existing controller parameterizations, a novel parameterization formulated in this thesis allows for directly tuning the sensitivity transfer function of the closed-loop system. Tuning sensitivity is critical in mitigating the effects of disturbances affecting the system, as well as those arising from cross-coupling and <b>parasitic</b> <b>error</b> motions. Further, an integrated methodology for design and control is presented. This methodology uses the design topology generation approach and controller generation approach proposed in the thesis. The key distinction of our design for control approach is that the design is iterated over topologies and not just parameters within a selected topology. A simple one-degree-of-freedom positioning system example is worked out to detail the steps of the proposed integrated design and control methodology. A novel design topology that is ideally suited for achieving a desired design and control performance is derived using this methodology. Finally, the hardware design and control of a novel flexure-based nanopositioner implementation for scanning probe microscopy are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approaches discussed in this thesis. by Vijay Shilpiekandula.

Chapter 1 contains a review of recent developments in instrumentation that require both manipulation and measurement over the range 0. 1 - 100 nm. The instruments considered are the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM), Stylus techniques, X-ray interferometry and x-ray microscopy. The rest of the thesis presents the design and assessment of a novel STM incorporating an X-ray interferometer, an ultra-high precision stylus measuring instrument and an x-ray microscope two axis specimen translation stage. Chapters 2 and 3 present an assessment of different mechanisms for the production of rectilinear motions having <b>parasitic</b> <b>errors</b> of better than mm. Theoretical and experimental investigations into monolithic parallel spring systems based on a notch type hinge and long range slideways based on a polymeric bearing sliding on a polished glass prism are presented. Optimisation of a soleniod magnet force transducer is presented as a drive technique for the former device, whilst a mechanically non-influencing feedscrew drive is described for the latter system. A stylus based measuring instrument, called "Nanosurf 2 ", that incorporates the polymeric slideway is presented in chapter 4. The performance of this system has been assessed and the results are presented in the following chapter. The linearity and accuracy of an electromagnetically driven, single crystal silicon, monolithic spring make it a suitable for use as the translation mechanism in a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope. Consequently, a three-axis spring has been constructed to generate the translations required for imaging. An X-ray interferometer is built into the probe axis to facilitate absolute calibration.

40|$|The {{broadband}} {{performance of}} the high-contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at JPL is investigated through optical modeling and simulations. The analytical tool is an optical simulation algorithm developed by combining the HCIT’s optical model with a speckle-nulling algorithm that operates directly on coronagraphic images, an algorithm {{identical to the one}} currently being used on the HCIT to actively suppress scattered light via a deformable mirror. It is capable of performing full three-dimensional end-to-end near-field diffraction analysis on the HCIT’s optical system. By conducting speckle-nulling optimization, we clarify the HCIT’s capability and limitations in terms of its broadband contrast performance under various realistic conditions. Considered cases include non-ideal occulting masks, such as a mask with optical density and wavelength dependent <b>parasitic</b> phase-delay <b>errors</b> (i. e., a not band-limited occulting mask) and the one with an optical-density profile corresponding to a measured, non-standard profile, as well as the independently measured phase errors of all optics.

40|$|The {{essential}} {{parameters for}} structure integrity assessment in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) are Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs). The estimation of SIFs {{can be done}} by analytical or numerical techniques. The analytical estimation of SIFs is limited to simple structures with non-complicated boundaries, loads and supports. An effective numerical technique for analyzing problems with singular fields, such as fracture mechanics problems, is the extended finite element method (XFEM). In the paper, XFEM is applied to compute an actual stress field in a two-dimensional cracked body. The XFEM is based on the idea of enriching the ap-proximation {{in the vicinity of the}} discontinuity. As a result, the numerical model consists of three types of elements: non-enriched elements, fully enriched elements (the domain of whom is cut by a discontinuity), and partially enriched elements (the so-called blending elements). In a blending element, some but not all of the nodes are enriched, which adds to the approximation <b>parasitic</b> term. The <b>error</b> caused by the parasitic terms is partly responsible for the degrada-tion of the convergence rate. It also limits the accuracy of the method. Eliminating blending elements from approximation space and replacing them with standard el-ements, together with applying shifted-basis enrichment, makes it possible to avoid the problem. The numerical examples show improvements in results when compared with the standard XFEM approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{strong market}} demand for mobile {{applications}} such as iPhone makes value on the form factor of the mobile devices. The form factor means how much we can integrate many functions in a given size of the mobile devices. The external component size is almost comparable to a chip size so that elimination of external component {{is crucial to the}} success of mobile devices in addition to the cost issues of the external components. External reference resistors are often used as the standard for calibrating voltage sources, current sources, and other component values within a circuit. Often these calibrations occur at a factory, but may also occur on an electronic device as it is used. However, external reference resistors consume area and cost and it is desirable to eliminate them. This work introduces a new way to calibrate on-chip resistance and capacitance without the external reference resistors. An integrated circuit includes a benchmarking circuitry and a tunable circuitry. The benchmarking circuit includes a target component and an internal reference component. The internal reference component exhibits a lower sensitivity to the changes in test conditions than the target component. Benchmarking Metric Measurement Module (BMMM) measures benchmarking metrics for the internal reference component and the target component. A benchmark value is calculated based on the benchmarking metrics. The novelty of this work is the powerful way to cancel the <b>parasitic</b> and systemic <b>errors</b> caused by operational amplifiers in RC tuner circuitry. This technique is broadly applicable to any RF and analog circuits that need the calibration of tunable circuit elements without external references...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, two {{separate}} research topics are undertaken {{both in the}} general area of compact RF/microwave circuit design. The first topic involves characterizing the <b>parasitic</b> effects and <b>error</b> due to unused post-production tuning bars. Such tuning bars are used in microwave circuit designs to allow the impedance or length of a microstrip line to be adjusted after fabrication. In general, the tuning bars are simply patterns of small, isolated sections of conductor adjacent to the thru line. Changing the impedance or length of the thru line involves bonding the appropriate tuning bars to the line. Unneeded tuning bars are simply not removed and left isolated. Ideally, {{there should be no}} coupling between these unused tuning bars and the thru line. Therefore, the unused tuning bars should have a negligible effect on the circuit??s overall performance. To nullify the parasitic effects of the tuning bars, conventional wisdom suggests placing the bars 1. 0 to 1. 5 substrate heights away from the main line. While successful in the past, this practice may not result in the most efficient and cost-effective placement of tuning bars in today??s compact microwave circuits. This thesis facilitates the design of compact tuning bar configurations with minimum parasitic effects by analyzing the error attributable to various common tuning bar configurations with a range of parameters and offset distances. The error is primarily determined through electromagnetic simulations, and the accuracy of these simulations is verified by experimental results. The second topic in this thesis involves the design of compact microwave resonators using the transmission line approach to create negative refractive index metamaterials. A survey of the major developments and fundamental concepts related to negative refractive index technology (with focus on the transmission line approach) is given. Following is the design and measurement of the compact resonators. The resonators are also compared to their conventional counterparts to demonstrate both compactness and harmonic suppression...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of dielectric measuring techniques for soil characterisation {{has not been}} fully explored. This is attributed to the complex and incomplete theory on dielectrics, {{as well as to}} the lack of sensors suited for practical applications. The theory on dielectric properties of soils is described, evaluated, and expanded. Colloidal polarisation of soil particles appears to be negligible. The polarisability of air bubbles in the soil matrix is made plausible. The Maxwell-Wagner effect is expressed in the form of a Debye function. A soil texture parameter is introduced that can be derived from dielectric measurements at three frequencies. Newly derived are a relationship between the soil water matric pressure and the dielectric relaxation frequency, a dielectric mixture equation with depolarisation factors that account for electromagnetic field refractions at the boundary between two soil materials, and a model to predict permittivity versus frequency from soil porosity, water content, and matric pressure. A model of sensors for Frequency Domain (FD) measurements as well as for Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is described. An integrated circuit (ASIC) has been developed that is based on synchronous detection and is intended for practical low-cost dielectric sensors. Algorithms correct for phase <b>errors,</b> <b>parasitic</b> impedances of the ASIC and electrical length of electrodes and wiring. These elements are incorporated in a new FD sensor, operated at 20 MHz. The new theory is tested in different ways using the new FD sensor and TDR. Calibration curves of water content versus electrical permittivity of different soil types compare reasonably well with predicted curves. The Maxwell-Wagner effect increases with increasing water content and specific surface area. The electrical conductivity of the extracted soil solution can be determined by simultaneous measurements of the electrical permittivity and bulk conductivity. This method proved accurate for glass beads and for most tested soils. Soil layers polluted with chlorinated solvents or oil are detected by measuring the same parameters as function of depth. The frequency dependence of the bulk electrical conductivity, attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner effect, is analysed by measurements at three frequencies. Hydrating concrete is shown to simulates the dielectric behaviour of soils of different textures. Its dielectric spectrum from 10 MHz to I GHz illustrates the effect of water binding (&gt; 100 MHz) and the Maxwell-Wagner effect (&lt; 100 MHz). Around 100 MHz concrete exhibits only small changes of the dielectric properties; this is known to occur also for soils of different textures. The compressive strength of concrete appears to be predictable from the electrical permittivity at 20 MHz, due to the Maxwell-Wagner effect. Due to the simplification to apply a single sine wave rather than a pulse or step function, existing theory is inadequate to correct TDR measurements of water content for the effect of electrical conductivity. TDR electrical conductivity measurements are found to be low-frequency (< 3 MHz) measurements...|$|R
