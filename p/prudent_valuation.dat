40|$|This {{paper is}} a master’s thesis by Erik Kivilo and Carl Olofsson at the Fac-ulty of Engineering (LTH) at Lund University. The {{research}} and writing {{took place during the}} fall of 2014 under the supervision of Magnus Wiktors-son at the Division of Mathematical Statistics at Lund University, and Per Th̊aström at EY, Copenhagen. The thesis concerns <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> of fair-valued financial instruments under current regulation on capital requirements for credit institutions and investment firms within the EU. The aim is to explain the concept of <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation,</b> and develop statistical methods for the calculation of additional valuation adjustments (AVAs) required by the regulations. As there has been little focus on model risk in previous regulations, the main objective is to quantify model risk AVA {{in a way that is}} compliant, using current research on <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> and model risk. The method suggested in this paper captures the instantaneous valuatio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explains}} why the housing and {{commercial real estate market}} are in a permanent disequilibrium. The real estate market converges towards the equilibrium, but it changes due to credit constraints, expectations and the long investment process. The cycles on this market are much more volatile than those of the whole economy. Moreover, the market is very local. Often, one can observe the accumulation of different factors, which lead to herding and speculations and finally result in a crisis. Because the market is strongly financed by banks, problems on the market affect the whole financial system. Thus, an appropriate and <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> of the property is needed, which helps to smooth the demand and also reduces the risk for the investor and the bank. ...|$|E
40|$|The new Basel II {{enhancements}} {{cover all}} three pillars and they refer mainly to more strict rules and higher capital allocation for resecuritization and liquidity facilities, extension of <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> guidance to the banking book, disclosure of liquidity information, more complex stress testing models, reputational risk coverage, conducting own credit analysis, more detailed disclosures especially trading book quantitative disclosures. In a very dynamic and innovative market, risk coverage {{is one of}} the keys for success and survival. Therefore, each institution should invest in both human capital and IT system {{in order to have a}} complex and advanced risk monitoring system, to be able to implement fast and with transparency the newest risk management regulation, to anticipate the risks and mitigate them. banks, Basel II, risk management, market discipline...|$|E
40|$|In May 2004 the CFO Forum {{harmonized}} {{the various}} efforts of reporting the embedded valueof life insurance companies by issuing the European Embedded Value (EEV) Principles. In this working paper a methodology is proposed to derive a maximum lending amountfrom EEV figures without much additional data requirements from the originating insurer. The approach chosen {{is similar to}} that of other financing areas, e. g. real estate finance, where first a <b>prudent</b> best estimate <b>valuation</b> is done and later risk deductions are performed in the form of applying loan to value ratios, e. g. 60 - 80 % of the prudent amount. Here, this prudent value is called bankable embedded value and the loan to value analysis presented leads to the maximum lending amount. The deductions proposed to arrive at a maximum lending amount are based on parameter adjustments and risk allowances for unexpected risks. There is an analogy with insurers for determining their own capital needs. The methodology proposed is based on the stress test approach which increasingly gains popularity with insurance supervisors in Europe.

40|$|This paper draws {{lessons from}} {{international}} practices {{to determine the}} feasibility of developing mortgage-backed securitization (MBS) to expand housing finance to the underserved market in the country. Despite the risks of securitization, {{as evidenced by the}} recent US subprime crisis, the huge beneficial effects of opening up the capital market to individual investors and to borrowers that were previously out of reach is well-acknowledged in literature. Several countries developed MBS to facilitate and promote housing finance. The international best practices show that efficient securitization can be established based on: (1) clear regulatory framework; (2) <b>prudent</b> underwriting and <b>valuation</b> process; (3) reliable credit rating companies to mitigate moral hazards and adverse selection risks; and (4) the need for originators to have adequate capital so that warranties and representations can be taken seriously. In particular, the US subprime crisis highlights a major lesson that needs to be avoided, that is, the use of securitization as a tool for balance sheet arbitrage instead of funding and investments in the real economy. In the country, the National Home Mortgage Corporation (NHMFC) was established with the same intent as the US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, after three decades of existence, it was only in 2007 that NHMFC laid the building blocks to operate as a secondary mortgage institution (SMI). The corporation's initial securitization issuances were successful and twice oversubscribed. However, to enable NHMFC to efficiently function as an SMI, government needs to undertake the following: (1) strengthen the housing finance industry and rationalize the role of HGC, HDMF, and NHMFC; (2) support NHMFC to improve its balance sheet and strengthen its organizational capabilities; (3) develop standardized housing loan documents and quality underwriting through mortgage insurance; (4) integrate/create credit information data base for all housing loan borrowers; (5) provide incentives to securitization through tax exemptions, reactivation of NHMFC limited sovereign guarantee, recognition of MBS bonds and NHMFC issuances as compliance to statutory liquidity requirements of financial institutions, etc; and (6) automation of MBS servicing and reporting...|$|R
40|$|This book {{presents}} 20 peer-reviewed {{chapters on}} current aspects of derivatives markets and derivative pricing. The contributions, written by leading {{researchers in the}} field as well as experienced authors from the financial industry, present {{the state of the}} art in: • Modeling counterparty credit risk: credit valuation adjustment, debit valuation adjustment, funding valuation adjustment, and wrong way risk. • Pricing and hedging in fixed-income markets and multi-curve interest-rate modeling. • Recent developments concerning contingent convertible bonds, the measuring of basis spreads, and the modeling of implied correlations. The recent financial crisis has cast tremendous doubts on the classical view on derivative pricing. Now, counterparty credit risk and liquidity issues are integral aspects of a <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> procedure and the reference interest rates are represented by a multitude of curves according to their different periods and maturities. A panel discussion included in the book (featuring Damiano Brigo, Christian Fries, John Hull, and Daniel Sommer) on the foundations of modeling and pricing in the presence of counterparty credit risk provides intriguing insights on the debate. ...|$|E
40|$|More {{than two-thirds}} of the $ 25 {{trillion}} of financial assets held in the United States is managed on behalf of investors by financial intermediaries, ranging from trusts, mutual funds, and mortgage pools to insurance companies, pension funds, and banks. Because of their importance, governments have long regulated the activities of these intermediaries to ensure sound financial markets, a foundation of secure economic development. Currently, regulators both here and abroad are considering reforms that not only might foster more efficient domestic financial markets, but also might prepare the way for more equitable global markets. > When not all investors are fully informed about the prospective returns on all assets, the cost of funds for financial intermediaries depends on savers' state of confidence in their investments. Because the regulations that govern intermediaries affect the price of risk in financial markets and because this influence varies with economic conditions, the actions of regulators, like those of the monetary authority, may need to adjust with economic conditions in order to foster the <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> of assets. The prompt enforcement of fixed, risk-based capital requirements, for example, might diminish the ability of financial intermediaries to cope with economic shocks. Because capital ratios measure neither the insurance inherent in intermediaries' balance sheets nor the capacity of this insurance to contend with different risks, more revealing assessments of the safety and soundness of intermediaries should consider how their earnings and cash flows might change with economic conditions.

40|$|This thesis investigates a {{methodology}} for quantification of model risk in option pricing. A set of different pricing models is specified and each model is assigned a probability weight {{based on the}} Akaike Information Criteria. It is then possible to obtain a price distribution of an exotic derivative from these probability weights. Two measures of model risk inspired by the regulatory standards on <b>prudent</b> <b>valuation</b> are proposed based on this methodology. The model risk measures are studied for different equity options which are priced using a set of stochastic volatility models, with and without jumps. The models are calibrated to vanilla call options from the S&P 500 index, {{as well as to}} synthetic option prices based on market data simulated using the Bates model. For comparable options, the model risk is higher for up-and-out barrier options compared to vanilla, digital and Asian options. Moreover, the model risk measure, in relative terms of option price, increases quickly with strike level for call options far out of the money, while the model risk in absolute terms is lowest when the option is deep out of the money. The model risk for up-and-out barrier options tends to be higher when the barrier is closer to the spot price, although the increase in risk {{does not have to be}} monotonic with decreasing barrier level. The methodology is flexible and easy to implement, yielding intuitive results. How-ever, it is sensitive to different assumptions in the structure of the pricing errors...|$|E
