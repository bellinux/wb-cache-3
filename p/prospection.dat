5|$|By 2017, sauropod fossils {{had been}} {{recovered}} from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair of}} claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a <b>prospection</b> for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E

As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical <b>prospection</b> {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{information}} on previous geophysical <b>prospections</b> {{carried out in}} the Archaeological Park of Pontecagnano- Faiano, in order to reconstruct the ancient settlement of Picentia, an Etrusco-Campanian and Roman settlement near Salerno (Southern Italy). Therefore, an integrated geophysical survey based on magnetic, geoelectric and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) <b>prospections</b> was executed in the Park. The methods provided a basic map of buried ancient structures at depth from 0. 1 - 0. 2 to about 1. 5 meters. Magnetic data were processed analyzing the analytical signal of the vertical derivative of the measured gradient and this substantially reduced a strong fence effect. The results of the geophysical <b>prospections</b> showed archaeological structures located close to those discovered in the excavated areas. The shape of the anomalies are usually elongated with well-defined geometrical characteristics. Many anomalies are arranged along orthogonal directions and they are very coherent with the excavated structures, namely the quarters structures of the ancient Picentia...|$|R

25|$|The Eurasian magpie is {{believed}} {{not only to}} be among the smartest of birds but among the most intelligent of all animals. Along with the jackdaw, the Eurasian magpie's nidopallium is approximately the same relative size as those in chimpanzees and humans, significantly larger than the gibbon's. Like other corvids, such as ravens and crows, their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to most great apes' and cetaceans'. A 2004 review suggests that the intelligence of the corvid family to which the Eurasian magpie belongs is equivalent to that of great apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas) in terms of social cognition, causal reasoning, flexibility, imagination, and <b>prospection.</b>|$|E

40|$|SYGIS – the Finnish archaeological {{survey and}} mapping project of Jebel Bishri- is tracing new {{dimensions}} for the Roman eastern frontier or the so-called eastern limes in Syria. It {{has been noted}} in several Roman frontier studies that the Euphrates region is insufficiently studied to clearly define the development of Roman policy {{and the extent of}} the military presence in the east. Jebel Bishri, a mountain between the Euphrates and Palmyra, has largely remained as an empty spot on the maps representing the Roman military presence. This is an illusion {{due to the fact that}} the mountain in its central parts has not been earlier practically studied by archaeological means. The surrounding Euphrates Valley and the Strata Diocletiana have been studied, e. g., by A. Poidebard in his early aerial <b>prospections.</b> However, new satellite image <b>prospections,</b> field surveys and mapping have traced, documented and identified earlier little known or unknown Roman military installations and networks on the side of the Euphrates and in the central parts of the mountain. Especially the <b>prospections</b> with QuickBird satellite images offering good spatial resolution have made it possible to trace new sites which would have been difficult to recognize on the ground. The information gained from the new <b>prospections</b> and mapping enhances our understanding of the Roman military organization on the Euphrates and the fact that the military installations penetrated deeper in the desert-steppe areas and mountain of Jebel Bishri than earlier thought...|$|R

60|$|The offer had {{no sooner}} been made than {{he met her}} son reeling in, drunk, at the front door. As he made his escape the lad had insulted him. This perhaps helped to open his eyes. When he woke the next morning, or rather late in the next day, after his night's work, {{he was no longer}} able to tell himself that the world was all right with him. Who does not know that sudden thoughtfulness at waking, that first matutinal retrospection, and <b>prospection,</b> into things as they have been and are to be; and the lowness of heart, the blankness of hope which follows the first remembrance of some folly lately done, some word ill-spoken, some money misspent,--or perhaps a cigar too much, or a glass of brandy and soda-water which he should have left untasted? And when things have gone well, how the waker comforts himself among the bedclothes as he claims for himself to be whole all over, teres atque rotundus,--so to have managed his little affairs that he has to fear no harm, and to blush {{inwardly}} at no error! Mr Broune, the way of whose life took him among many perils, who {{in the course of his}} work had to steer his bark among many rocks, was in the habit of thus auditing his daily account as he shook off sleep about noon,--for such was his lot, that he seldom was in bed before four or five in the morning. On this Wednesday he found that he could not balance his sheet comfortably. He had taken a very great step and he feared that he had not taken it with wisdom. As he drank the cup of tea with which his servant supplied him while he was yet in bed, he could not say of himself, teres atque rotundus, as he was wont to do when things were well with him. Everything was to be changed. As he lit a cigarette he bethought himself that Lady Carbury would not like him to smoke in her bedroom. Then he remembered other things. 'I'll be d---- if he shall live in my house,' he said to himself.|$|E
