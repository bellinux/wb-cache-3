25|$|In 1959, by {{now well}} known in the trade as a {{creative}} media innovator, Hargreaves was head-hunted by Roy Rich to the new ITV franchised company, Southern Television, both as programme maker and assistant <b>programme</b> <b>controller.</b> He might have been promoted but Independent Television Authority (ITA) regulations prohibited being in charge of programming, while also making programmes.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, on 22 August 1990, the {{soon to be}} UKRD Group formed Infinity Radio (an {{investment}} and radio consultancy company), and started work on a bid to the Radio Authority for the licence for Plymouth, West Devon, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly broadcasting area.

5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the <b>programme</b> <b>controllers</b> have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|R
500|$|In 1969 Barker {{was able}} to write, produce and star as General Futtock in the film Futtocks End which {{featured}} no dialogue and only [...] "grumble and grunt". The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode [...] "Ah, There You Are" [...] by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen. The character returned for the 1969–1970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker. Despite Barker's success on ITV, LWT's <b>programme</b> <b>controller</b> Stella Richman opted to fire Frost's company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.|$|E

2500|$|Virgin Radio's new <b>programme</b> <b>controller</b> Paul Jackson, {{in light}} of {{audience}} figures which had dropped {{from a peak of}} 2.7million to 1.7million, had pruned Evans's [...] "zoo" [...] team and installed a music policy which replaced more eclectic choices with a strict diet of chart pop. As a result, on 20 June Evans was followed throughout the day by tabloid newspaper photographers, and undertook an [...] "18-hour bender" [...] which started after his show at 9.30 in the morning, and ended – after numerous pints of Kronenbourg and Guinness, plus five bottles of Dom Pérignon – with Evans asleep in front of a lap-dancer at Stringfellows. Later photographed by the tabloids that week with new wife Billie Piper in the nearest pub to their home in Hascombe, Surrey while claiming he was too ill to present his show, he was dismissed on 28 June 2001 for repeatedly failing to arrive at work. Evans was replaced by the older Steve Penk, whom Evans criticised for his age – 39 versus Evans's then 35.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Situated within contemporary debates about language, ideology and the media, this thesis represents an attempt to try out and develop recent approaches to language within social psychology, and to argue that popular radio {{can be understood as}} ideological in several respects. Attempting to forge a position between marxism and post structuralism, the thesis argues that discourse analysis should eschew a total relativist position and/Should adopt a critical definition of ideology, which sees ideology as maintaining assymetrical power relations. The thesis consists of a detailed analysis of disc jockeys' on-air talk on BBC Radio One, looking at how particular views of the world are constructed and maintained by disc jockeys in their patter, and at how relations of inequality are brought off as natural and inevitable The research also analyses several interviews with broadcasters, examining the way they see their role and their audience, and looking in particular at the centrality of constructions of gender. Finally the research examines the accounts of disc jockeys and <b>Programme</b> <b>Controllers</b> for the lack of women in popular radio, highlighting the flexibility of sexism and drawing attention to features of the accounts offered which would have been ignored by more traditional approaches...|$|R

40|$|Unmanned, {{underwater}} vehicles {{have been}} developed considerably in recent years. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are increasingly used for routine inspection and maintenance tasks but have a range that {{is limited by the}} umbilical cable. For long range operations, such as oceanographic exploration and surveying, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are emerging which haveon-board power and are equipped with advanced control capabilities to carry out tasks with the minimum of human intervention. AUVs typically resemble torpedoes in that mosthave control surfaces and a single propulsion unit, and must move forwards to manoeuvre. Such vehicles are called flight vehicles. This paper describes techniques which are candidates for control of a flight AUV and identifies controllers used on some existing vehicles. Since underwater vehicle dynamics are nonlinear, fuzzy logic and sliding mode control were felt to have promise for autopilot application due to their potential robustness. Following development using a comprehensive simulation <b>programme,</b> the <b>controllers</b> were tested using the experimental vehicle, Subzero II, and their performance compared with that of a classical linear controller. The relative merits of the methods for practical implementation are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} diploma thesis {{deals with}} the management of asynchronous motor revolutions by a frequency converter MICROMASTER 440 via the programmable controller S 7 - 200. At the beginning, I researched the company documentation of Siemens, which is the producer of the frequency converter and the programmable controller mentioned above. As my work proceeded, I also started to study the company documentation of Mitsubishi Electric, which produces the operating pannel. The first part of my thesis provides a general description of the stated devices {{and the second part}} {{deals with the}} solution of the task itself. My task was to design a way of communication between the converter and the controller. I chose a USS protocol via serial port RS- 485. The operation of the controller was performed by using an operating terminal type GOT 1000 which was connected to the controller. In summary, my diploma thesis primarily deals with the construction of an operating <b>programme</b> for the <b>controller</b> and with creating of a graphical control on the terminal.
