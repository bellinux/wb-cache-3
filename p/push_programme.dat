Location, facilities, hours, and {{specific}} activities offered are easy for parents to see and compare {{so that they may}} tend to be emphasized by providers over aspects that are important but difficult for parents to see (such as the effectiveness and frequency of teacher-child interactions). The long hours that teachers work raise concerns about their effectiveness both because they may become fatigued and lack adequate planning and reflection time. If fees are lowered by reducing quality (as opposed to innovation and increased efficiency, for example), this would likely occur in ways that parents were least able to see the consequences for quality. It may be very difficult for parents to judge differences in the quality of education provided. As a result, parents may make less than optimal choices and competition may <b>push</b> <b>programmes</b> toward services that are less beneficial for child development than otherwise.|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are among the}} {{main causes of death}} and disability in developing countries, and they are a major reason for the health disparity between rich and poor countries. One of the reasons for this public health tragedy is a lack of lifesaving essential medicines, which either do not exist or badly need improvements. In this article, we analyse which of the push and pull mechanisms proposed in the recent literature may serve to promote research into neglected infectious diseases. A combination of <b>push</b> <b>programmes</b> that subsidise research inputs through direct funding and pull programmes that reward research output rather than research input may be the appropriate strategy to stimulate research into neglected diseases. On the one hand, early-stage (basic) research should be supported through push mechanisms, such as research grants or publicly financed research institutions. On the other hand, pull mechanisms, such as prize funds that link reward payments to the health impacts of effective medicines, have the potential to stimulate research into neglected diseases...|$|R

One of Saakashvili's main goals was Georgian NATO membership, which Russia opposed. This {{has been one of the}} main stumbling blocks in Georgia-Russia relations. Russia viewed Georgia’s deepening ties with NATO, the EU and the U.S. as a threat to its security, and employed political and economic levers against Georgia.|$|R

25|$|In 1966 the {{coalition}} of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) fell and a grand coalition between CDU/CSU and SPD was formed {{under the leadership of}} CDU Chancellor Kiesinger. The welfare state was considerably expanded, while social spending was almost doubled between 1969 and 1975. Changes were made to income maintenance schemes which met some of the SPD’s long-standing demands, and many other social reforms were introduced, including the equalising of wages and salaries between white-collar and blue-collar employees, the continuation of wage and salary payments, a law to promote employment, and a vocational training law. Although these measures were largely due to the efforts of the CDU minister Hans Katzer, it is arguable that he would never have been able to <b>push</b> his <b>programme</b> through the cabinet (let alone envisage it) without the SPD.|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{counselling}} programmes in an equilibrium matching model {{where workers}} are heterogeneous in skill levels. Job search effort, labour demand and wages are endogenous. When wages are bargained over, raising {{the effectiveness of}} or the access to counselling <b>programmes</b> <b>pushes</b> wages upwards and leads to lower search effort among nonparticipants. The effects of increasing the access of the low-skilled are evaluated numerically by enlarging successively the set of endogenous behaviours. Induced effects outweigh substantial positive micro effects on low-skilled employment when all "margins" are taken into account. The inter-temporal utility of the low-skilled nevertheless increases because search effort declines. On the contrary, when the net wage of the low-skilled is a fixed proportion of the one bargained by the high-skilled, raising the access to counselling programmes has small positive effects on all criteria...|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{accountability}} has been globally shaping educational systems in many aspects. Teaching practice is normally assessed through the quality assurance mechanism via {{a set of}} mandated performance indicators and measures imposed on schools. In this context, using mentoring to equip new teachers to perform their roles with sufficient skills and knowledge is crucial. Hong Kong is no exception to the accountability regime. Performance indicators have been adopted in schools both through external school review (ESR) and school self-evaluation (SSE). As a result, the impacts {{of accountability}} on such aspects of teacher development as school-based mentoring are starting to emerge. This study applies a qualitative research approach to examine thirty-three mentors’ views on changes of their school-based mentoring scheme {{brought about by the}} accountability era in Hong Kong. Findings show that accountability has shaped school-based mentoring schemes in three ways. Firstly, mentoring now focuses on enhancing professional competency of new teachers with a strong emphasis on school development and improvement. Secondly, the network development aspect of group mentoring tends to be more important. Thirdly, accountability has <b>pushed</b> mentoring <b>programmes</b> towards being formal and structured. Viewing the shifts, two improved ways forward may be proposed. Firstly, the aims of mentoring should strike a balance between the developmental requirements of schools and helping new teachers to be transformed into ‘transformative learners’. Secondly, an emphasis on the development of social capital of schools through partnership schemes with tertiary institutions could be a good move. However, such a practice could exacerbate the inequality of learning opportunities of teachers...|$|R
40|$|Access {{to higher}} {{education}} in Portugal is governed by a quota system (numerus clausus). The {{purpose of this article}} is to answer two questions: First, how does the numerus clausus system shape the demand for medical studies? Second, how do non-enrolled medical candidates influence the global allocation system and generate waves of dissatisfaction? The results show that students who do not succeed in entering medicine register in other programmes, such as pharmacy, veterinary medicine and dental studies, generating a first wave of dissatisfaction. Because students who are not placed in medicine occupy a large share of the places available in those other programmes, the wave of dissatisfaction propagates, with students being <b>pushed</b> to other <b>programmes,</b> especially biology and biochemistry. This process has also been analysed from a spatial perspective. Apparently, when students are competing to obtain a study place in a programme with prestige and good professional career perspectives such as medicine moving to a more peripheral region becomes more frequent.

They aim to highlight specific recommendations and outcomes from the larger reports and present them in a concise, easily consumable format. The original publication is available at [URL] success of Chinese-led SEZs in Africa is important to both the Chinese government and the host governments. Even though these zones are operating under market conditions, the role of both sides in creating effective institutional arrangement for SEZs is crucial. The Chinese-led SEZ programme was initiated in 2006 and 2007, and {{was intended to be}} implemented before 2009. Even though the Chinese government and host governments showed their willingness to <b>push</b> forward SEZ <b>programmes</b> vigorously, most of them have not materialised yet. Most of the SEZs have been under construction and are not yet operating. This paper first provides the brief background of the establishment of SEZs in Africa, then the focus moves to stakeholders involved in the programme. Finally, the paper explores the current situations and navigates the role of the host governments to make the SEZs work. To help the Chinese-led SEZs in Africa to become successful, the host governments must remain actively involved in the SEZs, because their support is more significant than any other aspect. Furthermore, they should provide consistent policies and effective incentives for the investors. On the other hand, the host governments should impose firm requirements in terms of technology transfer and basic working conditions so that their countries can reap the benefits of Chinese investment.

40|$|Leadership {{development}} {{has become an}} issue of paramount importance in Qatar as leaders capable of driving the country forward to achieve the ambitious goals set out in its 2030 Vision are sought in all sectors. Huge resources are being invested in development, but often with minimal results, forcing Qatar to continue its reliance on expatriate expertise. New ideas and concepts are investigated, but only superficially accepted and rarely implemented. What is needed are transformative learning experiences that change the deeply held beliefs, worldviews and frames of reference {{of what it means}} to be a twenty-first century leader in Qatar. The purpose of this research was to look at an Executive Leadership Programme through the experiences of its provider, the participants and their managers, in an attempt to identify the key success factors that foster a transformative learning experience or those that inhibit its occurrence. The method used was a single, local knowledge case study with an instrumental approach aiming to inform the design and implementation of future leadership programmes. A case study is a predominantly qualitative research design looking at a unit of study from multiple angles or perspectives. This was done through in-depth, pre- and post-programme interviews conducted within a ten-month period with the three stakeholders. Additional rich data were obtained through access to the participants’ blogs and assignments, the training institutes’ report and my own observations. These sources provided a thick description of the participants’ experiences. Thematic analysis was used to identify several main themes to answer the posed research question. It was found that the presence of these factors was conducive to fostering transformative experiences, while their absence contributed towards inhibiting them. They included identifying the stakeholder expectations, and conducting a respected selection process, which produces participants with the appropriate English, educational and cognitive skills to participate without undue stress. Furthermore, it was found that the absence of time and commitment allocated for the implementation of well-structured, pre- and post-programme stages impacted negatively on both the leadership programme and its transformative learning outcomes. There should be in-depth awareness of the participants’ professional and cultural contexts during all stages of design and implementation to ensure the right approach is taken regarding autonomous components and personal and cultural interactions. There were indications that the intensity of the <b>programme</b> <b>pushed</b> the participants beyond the required state of disorientation necessary for transformative learning and into one of being overwhelmed and stressed. A balance needs to be achieved for participants to be in a mind-set that is open and receptive to a legitimate lived experience. The group dynamic had a strong and positive influence throughout the implementation stage and this should be encouraged for all stages. The study concludes with recommendations to programme developers and Qatari organisations and suggests the need for more case studies, especially of a longitudinal nature, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches and looking into micro issues such as the role of the group, the balance between stress and disorientation, and maintenance of achieved transformations...|$|R
40|$|Not {{unlike most}} other {{developing}} countries, Jordan has {{a legacy of}} structural problems that impede development and democratisation. Jordan, as an artificially constructed state, has alway {{had to rely on}} assistance from outside. This has created an inability for the state to decide independently. Under Abdallah I, in 1928, the first democratic institution was established. The late King Hussein built on this tradition, using the tribal leaders as links between the monarch and the notables. Hussein sought security in foreign relations to keep his country stable and his family in power. On the home front, Hussein strove to achieve some kind of balance between the different groups, {{while at the same time}} trying to further economic and social development. This development being possible only through relying on foreign aid, Jordan in the course of time slowly distanced herself from Iraq, edging closer to the USA. In spite of many problems it is true that Jordan under Hussein saw development on several levels: nation-building, education, the infrastructure, agriculture, health and urbanisation. Over the years, Jordan went through several difficult periods: 1. In 1957, martial law is declared after an attempted coup, it remains in force until 1992. 2. On several occasions the constitution is suspended. Elections are postponed or, if held at all, they are rigged. 3. 1989 sees the lowest point with regard to Jordan’s economic situation. Problems for the national currency, rising prices, increased unemployment, economic policies mismanaged by both government and opposition, all this produced huge social and economic difficulties for the Jordanian people. These problems caused the unrest of April 1989, which in turn brought the polical elite led by King Hussein to seriously start a process of democratisation. The author outlines several aspects indicating that Jordan is engaged in a process of democratisation. This intention was stressed both by the late King Hussein and his successor, King Abdallah II. These indications are: 1. Jordan is a parliamentary monarchy as set out in the 1952 constitution of King Tal. This constitution, while ensuring absolute power to the monarch and allowing little scope for democracy, also offers certain essential democratic elements. Any democratic elements existing will have to be supported to allow the country to further develop its democracy. 2. The National Charter incorporates principles and regulations that can provide a roadmap for the creation of a new Jordan based on principles of due legal process and popular participation. This Charter however only provides general indications and is not legally binding. 3. Almost none of the political parties existing has managed to make good use of the new openness in order to <b>push</b> their political <b>programmes</b> in Parliament. 4. The opposition groups are also weakened by the fact that they represent different ideological tendencies. They fail to be sufficiently active in the struggle for democracy. Jordanians saw their faith in the political opposition even further eroded when some opposition members of Parliament joined the government. Thus the trade unions had to act as a mouthpiece of what should have been done by the opposition. A thorough analysis of the results of his empirical data lead the author to draw the following conclusions: 1. There is in the Jordanian people an increased understanding of the country’s political opening and democratic ways. 2. The people of Jordan expect a strengthened democracy to ensure the improvement of their lives. 3. The general view held by a majority is that democracy did not occur because the political elite favoured it but as a result of pressure from below. Still it is accepted that without the King‘s support no progress would have been possible. 4. The general view is that education and the individual family are the main agents for strengthening democracy in Jordanian society, followed by activities instituted by the parliament, political parties and the trade unions. 5. There is a greater understanding of political openness and democracy among better educated academics. 6. The analysis also shows there is no discernible difference between attitudes held by people of different income brackets, ages and sex. 7. An important finding of the study is that there is a wide divide between verbal pronouncements in favour of democracy and practical action that might further democracy. The general resume of this thesis is that Jordan is seen by Jordanians as being definitely on the road to democratic rights. Approval of this, however, is on the decrease, early enthusiasm is waning. This does not however mean that the process of of democratisation has not taken certain roots in Jordanian society: The author sees a slow mental process towards the establishment of real democracy that still lies ahead of the people and the political elite of Jordan...|$|R
