The structure of PTX 11 was determined as 34 S-hydroxypectenotoxin- 2 by tandem mass spectrometry and UV and NMR spectroscopy. PTX 11 appears to be only the third <b>pectenotoxin</b> identified as a natural biosynthetic product from algae after pectenotoxin- 2 and pectenotoxin- 12. The LD 50 of PTX 11 determined by mouse intraperitoneal injection was 244 g/kg. The LDmin of PTX 11 in these experiments was 250 g/kg. No signs of toxicity were recorded in mice following an oral dose of PTX 11 at 5000 g/kg. No diarrhea was observed in any of the animals administered with the test substance by either route of administration.

40|$|Toxins {{responsible}} for incidents of shellfish poisoning, including okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxins- 1 and - 2 (DTX 1, DTX 2), <b>pectenotoxins,</b> brevetoxins and spirolides can occur as acyl esters in plankton and shellfish creating complications during routine analysis. Alkaline hydrolysis is usually used to release free OA/DTX and two analyses are conducted, {{before and after}} hydrolysis, to determine the amounts of unesterified and esterified toxin. However, alkaline hydrolysis is not suitable for all acylated compounds such as <b>pectenotoxins</b> or spirolides. Harsh alkaline conditions destroy the parent toxins. An alternative approach to alkaline hydrolysis {{is the use of}} enzymes. Two enzymatic methods were developed for the hydrolysis of 7 -O-acyl fatty acid esters (2 ̆ 01 cDTX 32 ̆ 01 d) and the carboxylate esters of OA (2 ̆ 01 cdiol-esters 2 ̆ 01 d). Lipase (EC 3. 1. 1. 3) was found to be specific for complete conversion of DTX 3 compounds to OA, DTX 1 and DTX 2. OAdiol was hydrolyzed completely to OA by an esterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 1). It has also been determined that the lipase is able to hydrolyze acyl esters of spirolides and the esterase is able to convert the acyl esters of <b>pectenotoxins,</b> without any degradation of parent compounds. Applications to contaminated Norwegian shellfish samples containing acyl esters of OA and DTX 1 have shown complete hydrolysis within 4 hours. Analytes, including the acyl esters, the released toxins and even the released fatty acids, were monitored using LC-MS. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been shown to have potential {{as an alternative to the}} conventional alkaline hydrolysis procedure in preparation of shellfish samples for analysis of toxins.

40|$|<b>Pectenotoxin</b> (PTX) -group toxins are a {{group of}} polyether-lactone toxins. They have been {{detected}} in microalgae and bivalve molluscs in Australia, Japan and New Zealand and {{in a number of}} European countries. Their presence in shellfish was discovered due to their acute toxicity in the mouse bioassay after intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of lipophilic extracts of shellfish. PTX-group toxins are exclusively produced by Dinophysis species. They can be found in filter-feeding bivalve molluscs such as oysters and mussels. To date 15 different analogues have been isolated and characterised. PTX-group toxins are heat stable, but they are easily destroyed under strong basic conditions such as used for hydrolysis of acyl esters of the okadaic acid (OA) -group toxins. PTX-group toxins are also labile under acidic conditions. PTX-group toxins in shellfish are always accompanied by toxins from the OA-group. This appears to be the basis for grouping PTX-group toxins and OA-group toxins in the European regulation. The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) concluded that because PTX-group toxins do not share the same mechanism of action as OA-group toxins they should not be included in the regulatory limit for OA-group toxins.

40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{and their}} {{impacts on the}} Greenshell mussel {{industry}} in New Zealand {{over the last decade}} are reviewed. The response of the regulatory authorities, seafood industry, and scientists to the first significant toxic Gymnodinium blooms in the summer of 1992 / 1993 has resulted in a well-organized interest group including scientists, commercial interests, and public health regulators. Nearly all known toxic species occur in New Zealand and unique and internationally accredited microalgal monitoring programmes have been developed. New methods, such as DNA probes, have been integrated into the system for rapid identification of species that are difficult to differentiate morphologically. Monitoring is carried out weekly, with results being dispatched within 24 h of sample receipt to enable risk assessments of toxicity by shellfish harvesters. The introduction of this system has saved the shellfish industry money and has reduced the amount of contaminated product being harvested and then rejected. All the main marine biotoxins are monitored, including paralytic, neurotoxic, diarrhetic, and amnesic shellfish toxins, and also compounds such as yessotoxin, <b>pectenotoxin,</b> and gymnodimine.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of known marine algal toxins has {{increased}} tremendously, mainly by discovery of new analogues and metabolites within known toxin groups. This is due in particular {{to the use of}} LC-MS/MS. In this presentation, we will outline some new strategies based on various MS/MS scanning techniques {{that can be used for}} comprehensive detection and identification of new structural analogues of toxins. One example is the detection of assorted new analogues of the cyclic imine toxins, spirolides (SPX). Targeting key collision-induced product ions (m/z 150 or 164) in a precursor ion scanning mode and presenting the ion intensity data in a 2 -D contour plot (m/z vs. retention time) allowed the detection of new toxins as individual 'spots' and also determines their masses. Product ion scans of those masses then allow detailed structure information to be generated. Thus, several new SPX analogues including fatty acid acyl ester metabolites have been identified. Examples will also be shown for the yessotoxin (YTX), okadaic acid (OA) and <b>pectenotoxin</b> (PTX) groups. The discovery of all these new toxin analogues raises some important questions such as their toxicological significance and whether we will be able to monitor for the toxins without standards.

40|$|Several Dinophysis species produce diarrhoetic toxins (okadaic {{acid and}} dinophysistoxins) and <b>pectenotoxins,</b> and cause gastointestinal illness, Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP), even at low cell densities (< 103 cells·L− 1). They {{are the main}} threat, in terms of days of {{harvesting}} bans, to aquaculture in Northern Japan, Chile, and Europe. Toxicity and toxin profiles are very variable, more between strains than species. The distribution of DSP events mirrors that of shellfish production areas that have implemented toxin regulations, otherwise misinterpreted as bacterial or viral contamination. Field observations and laboratory experiments have shown {{that most of the}} toxins produced by Dinophysis are released into the medium, raising questions about the ecological role of extracelular toxins and their potential uptake by shellfish. Shellfish contamination results from a complex balance between food selection, adsorption, species-specific enzymatic transformations, and allometric processes. Highest risk areas are those combining Dinophysis strains with high cell content of okadaates, aquaculture with predominance of mytilids (good accumulators of toxins), and consumers who frequently include mussels in their diet.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} lipophilic marine biotoxins in shellfish from the Chinese market, we used hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure levels of okadaic acid (OA), azaspiracid (AZA 1), <b>pectenotoxin</b> (PTX 2), gymnodimine (GYM), and spirolide (SPX 1). We collected and analyzed 291 shellfish samples from main production sites along a wide latitudinal transect along the Chinese coastline from December 2008 to December 2009. Results revealed a patchy distribution of the five toxins and highlighted the specific geographical distribution and seasonal and species variation of the putative toxigenic organisms. All five lipophilic marine biotoxins were found in shellfish samples. The highest concentrations of OA, AZA 1, PTX 2, GYM, and SPX 1 were 37. 3, 5. 90, 16. 4, 14. 4, and 8. 97 μg/kg, respectively. These values were {{much lower than the}} legislation limits for lipophilic shellfish toxins. However, the value might be significantly underestimated for the limited detection toxins.

The new compounds were isolated as minor components from a large collection of a Dinophysis acuta-dominated bloom obtained from Skjer, Sognefjorden, Norway, in October 2002. LC-MS and NMR analyses revealed that the new components, 36 S-PTX- 12 and 36 R-PTX- 12, occurred {{as a pair of}} equilibrating diastereoisomers differing from PTX- 2 in that they contained an exocylic olefinic methylene rather than a methyl group at C- 38. Analyses of shellfish extracts revealed that PTX- 12 accumulated in Norwegian blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and cockles (Cerastoderma edule), along with PTX- 12 seco acids occurring as a complex mixture of diastereoisomers. LC-MS analysis of algal cells picked from the net haul from Fldevigen revealed that PTX- 12 predominated in D. acuta and D. norvegica, whereas PTX- 2 was the predominant <b>pectenotoxin</b> in D. acuminata. Preliminary observations indicate that the relative contents of PTX- 2 and PTX- 12 vary between sites and years in Norway, even within a single species of Dinophysis.

40|$|Most liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) mass spectrometric (MS) methods used for routine monitoring of lipophilic marine toxins {{focus on the}} analysis of the 13 toxins that are stated in European Union legislation. However, to date over 200 lipophilic marine toxins have been described in the literature. To fill this gap, a screening method using LC coupled to high resolution (HR) orbitrap MS (resolution 100 000) for marine lipophilic toxins has been developed. The method can detect a wide variety of okadaic acid (OA), yessotoxin (YTX), azaspiracid (AZA) and <b>pectenotoxin</b> (PTX) group toxins. To build a library of toxins, shellfish and algae samples with various toxin profiles were obtained from Norway, Ireland, United Kingdom, Portugal and Italy. Each sample extract was analyzed with and without collision induced dissociation fragmentation. Based on their mass and specific fragmentation pattern, 85 different toxins were identified comprising 33 OA, 26 YTX, 18 AZA and 8 PTX group toxins. A major complication of full scan HRMS is the huge amount of data generated (file size), which restricts the possibility of a fast search. A software program called metAlign was used to reduce the orbitrap MS data files. The 200 -fold reduced data files were screened using an additional software tool for metAlign: ‘Search_LCMS’.

40|$|LC/MS {{methodology}} {{for the analysis}} of domoic acid and lipophilic toxins in shellfish was developed using a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer. For routine quantitation a scheduled selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method {{for the analysis of}} domoic acid, okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, azaspiracids, <b>pectenotoxins,</b> yessotoxins, gymnodimines, spirolides, and pinnatoxins was developed and validated. The method performed well in terms of LOD, linearity, precision, and trueness. Taking advantage of the high instrument sensitivity, matrix effects were mitigated by reducing the amount of sample introduced to the mass spectrometer. Optionally, samples can be analyzed using information dependent acquisition (IDA) methods, either in positive or negative mode, which can provide an extra level of confirmation by matching the full product ion spectra acquired for a sample with those from a specially constructed spectral library. Methods were applied to the analysis of a new certified reference material and Canadian mussels (Mytilus edulis) implicated in a 2011 diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) incident. The scheduled SRM method enabled the screening and quantitation of multiple phycotoxins. As DSP had not previously been observed in this area of Canada, positive identification of putative toxins was accomplished using the IDA and spectral search method.

The most appropriate matrix system for toxin detection was obtained with 10 μg μL- 1 of DHB in 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (DSP) is {{a severe}} gastrointestinal illness caused by consumption of shellfish contaminated with toxigenic dinoflagellates such as certain Dinophysis and Prorocentrum species. In {{spite of the}} identification of DSP {{as the cause of}} numerous cases of hum. an intoxication throughout the world and comprehensive monitoring for shellfish toxicity, the fate and kinetics of DSP toxins in shellfish are not well described. Major limitations to the detailed study of DSP toxins dynamics in shellfish have been the inability to mass culture Dinophysis species for feeding studies and the chemical complexity of the toxin components associated with this toxin syndrome. The DSP toxin complex includes okadaic acid (OA) and its dinophysistoxin derivatives (DTX 1 - 4) plus various diol- and methyl-esters, as well as related <b>pectenotoxins</b> and yessotoxins.

40|$|RATIONALE: Accurate {{quantitative}} analysis of lipophilic toxins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) requires calibration solution reference materials (RMs) for individual toxin analogs. Untargeted analysis {{is aimed at}} identifying {{a vast number of}} compounds and thus validation of fully quantitative untargeted methods is not feasible. However, a semi-quantitative approach allowing for profiling is still required and will be strengthened by knowledge of the relative molar response (RMR) of analogs in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). METHODS: RMR factors were evaluated for toxins from the okadaic acid (OA/DTXs), yessotoxin (YTX), <b>pectenotoxin</b> (PTX), azaspiracid (AZA) and cyclic imine (CI) toxin groups, in both solvent standards and environmental sample extracts. Since compound ionization and fragmentation influences the MS response of toxins, RMRs were assessed under different chromatographic conditions (gradient, isocratic) and MS acquisition modes (SIM, SRM, All-ion, target MS/MS) on low and high resolution mass spectrometers. RESULTS: In general, RMRs were not significantly impacted by chromatographic conditions (isocratic vs gradient), with the exception of DTX 1. MS acquisition modes had a more significant impact, with PnTX-G and SPX differing notably. For a given toxin group, response factors were generally in the range of 0. 5 to 2. The cyclic imines were an exception. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in RMRs between toxins of a same chemical base structure were not significant enough to indicate major issues for non-targeted semi-{{quantitative analysis}}, where there is limited or no availability of standards for many compounds, and where high degrees of accuracy are not required. Differences in RMRs should be considered when developing methods that use a standard of a single analogue to quantitate other toxins from the same group. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Algal toxins may {{accumulate}} in {{fish and shellfish}} and thus cause poisoning in consumers of seafood. Such toxins and the algae producing them are regularly surveyed in many countries, including Europe, North America, Japan and others. However, very little is known regards the occurrence of such algae and their toxins in most African countries. This paper reports on a survey of phytoplankton and algal toxins in Nigerian coastal waters. Seawater samples were obtained from four sites for phytoplankton identification, on three occasions between the middle of October 2014 {{and the end of}} February 2015 (Bar Beach and Lekki in Lagos State, Port Harcourt in Rivers State and Uyo in Akwa Ibom State). The phytoplankton community was generally dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria; however several species of dinoflagellates were also identified: Dinophysis caudata, Lingulodinium polyedrum and two benthic species of Prorocentrum. Passive samplers (containing Diaion® HP- 20 resin) were deployed for several 1 -week periods on the same four sites to obtain profiles of algal toxins present in the seawater. Quantifiable amounts of okadaic acid (OA) and <b>pectenotoxin</b> 2 (PTX 2), as well as traces of dinophysistoxin 1 (DTX 1) were detected at several sites. Highest concentrations (60 ng OA g- 1 HP- 20 resin) were found at Lekki and Bar Beach stations, which also had the highest salinities. Non-targeted analysis using full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry showed that algal metabolites differed from site to site and for different sampling occasions. Screening against a marine natural products database indicated the potential presence of cyanobacterial compounds in the water column, which was also consistent with phytoplankton analysis. During this study, the occurrence of the marine dinoflagellate toxins OA and PTX 2 has been demonstrated in coastal waters of Nigeria, despite unfavourable environmental conditions, with regards to the low salinities measured. Hence shellfish samples should be monitored in future to assess the risk for public health through accumulation of such toxins in seafood...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{of marine}} algal toxins has {{traditionally}} focussed on shellfish monitoring while, {{over the last}} decade, passive sampling has been introduced as a complementary tool for exploratory studies. Since 2011, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been adopted as the EU reference method (No. 15 / 2011) for detection and quantitation of lipophilic toxins. Traditional LC-MS approaches {{have been based on}} low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS), however, advances in instrument platforms have led to a heightened interest in the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for toxin detection. This work describes the use of HRMS in combination with passive sampling as a progressive approach to marine algal toxin surveys. Experiments focused on comparison of LRMS and HRMS for determination of a broad range of toxins in shellfish and passive samplers. Matrix effects are an important issue to address in LC-MS; therefore, this phenomenon was evaluated for mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and passive samplers using LRMS (triple quadrupole) and HRMS (quadrupole time-of-flight and Orbitrap) instruments. Matrix-matched calibration solutions containing okadaic acid and dinophysistoxins, <b>pectenotoxin,</b> azaspiracids, yessotoxins, domoic acid, pinnatoxins, gymnodimine A and 13 -desmethyl spirolide C were prepared. Similar matrix effects were observed on all instruments types. Most notably, there was ion enhancement for pectenotoxins, okadaic acid/dinophysistoxins on one hand, and ion suppression for yessotoxins on the other. Interestingly, the ion selected for quantitation of PTX 2 also influenced the magnitude of matrix effects, with the sodium adduct typically exhibiting less susceptibility to matrix effects than the ammonium adduct. As expected, mussel as a biological matrix, quantitatively produced significantly more matrix effects than passive sampler extracts, irrespective of toxin. Sample dilution was demonstrated as an effective measure to reduce matrix effects for all compounds, and was found to be particularly useful for the non-targeted approach. Limits of detection and method accuracy were comparable between the systems tested, demonstrating the applicability of HRMS as an effective tool for screening and quantitative analysis. HRMS offers the advantage of untargeted analysis, meaning that datasets can be retrospectively analysed. HRMS (full scan) chromatograms of passive samplers yielded significantly less complex data sets than mussels, and were thus more easily screened for unknowns. Consequently, we recommend the use of HRMS in combination with passive sampling for studies investigating emerging or hitherto uncharacterised toxins...|$|E
40|$|Dinophysis acuminata and D. norvegica were {{observed}} in plankton net samples {{during the summer of}} 2002 from the Kandalaksha Gulf in the White Sea (North European Russia). Prorocentrum lima was found as an epiphyte on subtidal macroalgae in August, but not observed in plankton net samples.

40|$|Samples of Mytilus galloprovincialis, were {{harvested}} from five different locations in Thermaikos gulf, Greece after harmful algae bloom. All of the mussel samples were found positive by mouse bioassay for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins.

40|$|Marine toxins are {{currently}} monitored {{by means of}} a bioassay that requires the use of many mice, which poses a technical and ethical problem in many countries. With the exception of domoic acid, there is a legal requirement for the presence of other toxins (yessotoxin, saxitoxin and analogs, okadaic acid and analogs, <b>pectenotoxins</b> and azaspiracids) in seafood to be controlled by bioassay, but other toxins, such as palytoxin, cyclic imines, ciguatera and tetrodotoxin are potentially present in European food and there are no legal requirements or technical approaches available to identify their presence. The need for alternative methods to the bioassay is clearly important, and biosensors have become in recent years a feasible alternative to animal sacrifice.
