40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze relation-ships between usage of antimicrobial drugs on dairy farms and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of mastitis pathogens. Exposure to selected antimicro-bial drugs (n = 10) was standardized by calculation of the number of defined daily doses used per cow. Farms (n = 40) were categorized based on amount of antimicro-bial exposure: organic (no usage); conventional–low us-age (conventional farms not using or using less than or equal to the first quartile of use of each compound); and conventional–high usage (conventional farms using more than the first quartile of a particular compound). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of se-lected antimicrobial drugswas determined using a com-mercial microbroth dilution system for isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 137), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS, n = 294), and Streptococcus spp. (n = 95) obtained from subclinical mastitis infections. Most isolates were inhibited at the lowest dilution tested of most antimicrobial drugs.

40|$|International audienceAbstractStaphylococcus aureus {{intramammary}} infections (IMIs) {{have low}} cure rates using standard antibiotic treatment {{and increasing the}} duration of treatment usually improves therapeutic success. Chronic IMIs {{are thought to be}} caused by bacteria presenting a specific virulence phenotype that includes the capacity to produce greater amounts of biofilm. In this study, antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm production by S. aureus isolates recovered from IMIs that were cured or not following an extended therapy with cephapirin, <b>pirlimycin</b> or ceftiofur for 5, 8 and 8  days, respectively, were compared. An isolate was confirmed as from a persistent case (not cured) if the same S. aureus strain was isolated before and after treatment as revealed by the same VNTR profile (variable number of tandem repeats detected by multiplex PCR). The antibiotic minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for these isolates as well as the capacity of the isolates to produce biofilm. Isolates from persistent cases after extended therapy with cephapirin or ceftiofur had higher MICs for these drugs compared to isolates from non-persistent cases (p <  0. 05) even though the antibiotic susceptibility breakpoints were not exceeded. Isolates of the ceftiofur study significantly increased their biofilm production in presence of a sub-MIC of ceftiofur (p <  0. 05), whereas isolates from the <b>pirlimycin</b> group produced significantly less biofilm in presence of a sub-MIC of <b>pirlimycin</b> (p <  0. 001).

40|$|Manure {{composting}} has general {{benefits for}} production of soil amendment, but {{the effects of}} composting on antibiotic persistence and effects of antibiotics on the composting process are not well-characterized, especially for antibiotics commonly used in dairy cattle. This study provides a comprehensive, head-to-head, replicated comparison {{of the effect of}} static and turned composting on typical antibiotics used in beef and dairy cattle in their actual excreted form and corresponding influence on composting efficacy. Manure from steers (with or without chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and tylosin feeding) and dairy cows (with or without <b>pirlimycin</b> and cephapirin administration) were composted at small scale (wet mass: 20 - 22 kg) in triplicate under static and turned conditions adapted to represent US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Thermophilic temperature (> 55 °C) was attained and maintained for 3 d in all composts, with no measureable effect of compost method on the pattern, rate, or extent of disappearance of the antibiotics examined, except tylosin. Disappearance of all antibiotics, except <b>pirlimycin,</b> followed bi-phasic first-order kinetics. However, individual antibiotics displayed different fate patterns in response to the treatments. Reduction in concentration of chlortetracycline (71 - 84 %) and tetracycline (66 - 72 %) was substantial, while near-complete removal of sulfamethazine (97 - 98 %) and <b>pirlimycin</b> (100 %) was achieved. Tylosin removal during composting was relatively poor. Both static and turned composting were generally effective for reducing most beef and dairy antibiotic residuals excreted in manure, with no apparent negative impact of antibiotics on the composting process, but with some antibiotics apparently more recalcitrant than others...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus uberis {{isolates}} (n = 55) {{were obtained}} from milk samples of cases of mild clinical mastitis in 55 dairy cows from 35 herds serviced by one veterinary practice in Mayenne, France. Isolates were tested for macrolide and lincosamide resistance by using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Erythromycin resistance was detected in 12 of the 55 (22 %) isolates based on agar disc diffusion testing and MIC measurements, and was encoded by ermB. This gene also conferred phenotypic resistance to <b>pirlimycin</b> based on MIC measurements, but the D-test was needed for detection of the resistance phenotype in the agar disc diffusion test. Isolates with ermB were also highly resistant to the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin. Seventeen of the 55 isolates (31 %) were classified as resistant to spiramcyin only and as having intermediate susceptibility to spiramycin based on agar disc diffusion testing and MIC measurements, respectively. The genetic mechanism behind this phenotype and its clinical relevance are unknown. The efflux pump gene mefA was not detected {{in any of the}} 55 isolates in this study. <b>Pirlimycin</b> resistance without macrolide resistance was encoded by the lincosamide resistance gene linB in 4 isolates. Based on current guidelines, some linB-positive isolates would be classified as susceptible by using phenotypic tests, and alternative values for the interpretation of the agar disc diffusion test are suggested. We conclude that the agar disc diffusion test is a useful indicator for macrolide and lincosamide resistance of Strep. uberis in veterinary practice, provided that the D-test is used for detection of <b>pirlimycin</b> resistance...|$|E
40|$|Surveillance of {{antimicrobial}} use {{and resistance}} {{is needed to}} manage antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. In this study, data were collected on antimicrobial use and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (n= 562), isolated from intramammary infections and (sub) clinical mastitis cases on 89 dairy farms in 4 regions of Canada [Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and the Maritime Provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) ]. Dairy producers were asked to deposit empty drug containers into specially provided receptacles, and antimicrobial drug use rate was calculated to quantify antimicrobial use. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the Sensititer bovine mastitis plate system (TREK Diagnostic Systems Inc., Cleveland, OH), containing antimicrobials commonly used for mastitis treatment and control. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine herd-level risk factors of penicillin, ampicillin, <b>pirlimycin,</b> penicillin-novobiocin combination, tetracycline and sulfadimethoxine resistance in Staph. aureus isolates. Intramammary administration of the penicillin-novobiocin combination for dry cow therapy was associated with penicillin and ampicillin resistance [odds ratio (OR) : 2. 17 and 3. 10, respectively]. Systemic administration of penicillin was associated with penicillin resistance (OR: 1. 63). Intramammary administration of <b>pirlimycin</b> for lactating cow mastitis treatment was associated with <b>pirlimycin</b> resistance as well (OR: 2. 07). Average herd parity was associated with ampicillin and tetracycline resistance (OR: 3. 88 and 0. 02, respectively). Average herd size was also associated with tetracycline resistance (OR: 1. 02). Dairy herds in the Maritime region had higher odds of penicillin and lower odds of ampicillin resistance than dairy herds in Québec (OR: 2. 18 and 0. 19, respectively). Alberta dairy herds had lower odds of ampicillin and sulfadimethoxine resistance than dairy herds in Québec (OR: 0. 04 and 0. 08, respectively). Ontario dairy herds had lower odds of tetracycline and sulfadimethoxine resistance than dairy herds in Québec (OR: 0. 05 and 0. 33, respectively). Herd-level use of certain antimicrobials administered for mastitis treatment and control, such as intramammary penicillin and <b>pirlimycin</b> as well as systemically administered penicillin and florfenicol, was positively associated with antimicrobial resistance in bovine mastitis pathogens in the field conditions.

Initial percentages (October) of cows (quarters) uninfected or infected with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, alpha hemolytic strep., and Strep. uberis, were 42 (65); 33 (15 %); 20 (9); 3 (1); and 2 (0. 4), respectively. Overall streptococci cure rates were 91 % and 89 % of cows and quarters, respectively and was higher than average published values (65 - 70 %). Cure rates for Staph. aureus (extended <b>pirlimycin</b> therapy) were very low at 7 % and 4 % of cows and quarters, respectively. Overall results showed excellent therapy response for Strep.

40|$|A {{clinical}} trial {{was conducted to}} determine whether prepartum intramammary <b>pirlimycin</b> reduces the proportion of nulliparous heifers with intramammary infection (IMI) during early lactation and improves milk production. Quarter milk samples were collected from 428 heifers, systematically allocated to treatment and control groups, 6 to 12 d before the expected calving date and 2 to 8 d after calving. At the prepartum visit, heifers in the treatment group (n = 219) received an infusion of <b>pirlimycin</b> hydrochloride in all 4 quarters; the control heifers (n = 209) received no infusions. Intramammary infection was detected in 69 % of the heifers and 33 % of the quarters before calving. After calving, the proportion of treated heifers with IMI was {{significantly lower than the}} proportion of control heifers (31 % versus 45 %). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 10 % of the heifers and 3 % of the quarters before calving. After calving, the proportion of IMIs due to S. aureus was significantly lower in the treated heifers than in the control heifers (5. 6 % versus 10 %). Antibiotic treatment increased the percentage of cures and prevented new IMIs caused by gram-positive bacteria after calving. The incidence of new IMIs caused by gram-negative bacteria and yeast was higher among treated heifers than among control heifers. There was no overall effect of treatment on milk production, but there was a significant interaction effect of treatment and the interval between treatment and calving.

Percentages of cows (quarters) infected with Strep. agalactiae, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Staph. aureus were 15 (5); 54 (23); 46 (24); respectively. Cow and quarter cure rates were: Strep. ag. - 100, 100; Strep. dysgalactiae- 77, 86; Staph. aureus- 74, 85 %. High cure rates were seen for all organisms possibly due to bacterial strains involved or the limited antibiotic therapy seen in this herd over the previous 10 years. Observations at the final herd visit showed significantly improved teat end health and low new infection rate due to adoption of immediate proposed strategies. Herd SCC was down to 256, 000 cells/ml within 1 month post treatment and continued to be 250 - 350, 000 cells/ml 12 months later. Targeting prevention and therapy strategies based on causative organisms, and having a monitoring system in place can result in sustained lower SCC and improved milk quality and farm profitability. The objectives of this field investigation were to: 1) examine the etiology and mastitis infection dynamics in a 45 cow herd during the fall-winter whose normal herd bulk tank SCC was 500, 000 cells/ml but had jumped to 1 million for 3 months; 2) investigate herd management and procedures and develop and prioritize necessary changes for mastitis prevention; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of recommended and extended therapy with <b>pirlimycin</b> hydrochloride (Pirsue, Pharmacia/Upjohn Co.

40|$|Abstract Lincosamides are a {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} used both in clinical and veterinary practice {{for a wide range}} of pathogens. This group of drugs inhibits the activity of the bacterial ribosome by binding to the 23 S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit and blocking protein synthesis. Current-ly, three X-ray structures of the ribosome in complex with clindamycin are available in the Protein Data Bank, which reveal that there are two distinct conformations of the pyrrolidinyl propyl group of the bound clindamycin. In this work, we used quantum mechanical methods to investigate the probable conformations of clindamycin in order to explain the two binding modes in the ribosomal 23 S RNA. We studied three lincosamide antibiotics: clindamycin, lincomycin, and <b>pirlimycin</b> at the B 3 LYP level with the 6 - 31 G* * basis set. The focus of our work was to connect the conformational landscape and electron densities of the two clindamycin conformers found experimentally with their physicochemical properties. For both functional conform-ers, we applied natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and the atoms in molecules (AIM) theory, and calculated the NMR parameters. Based on the results obtained, we were able to show that the structure with the intramolecular hydrogen bond C=O…H–O is the most stable conformer of clindamy-cin.

This {{study was conducted to}} predict the diagnostic accuracy of the Sensititre MIC mastitis panel (Sensititre) and agar disk diffusion (ADD) method with reference to the manual broth microdilution test method for antimicrobial resistance profiling of Escherichia coli (n = 156), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 154), streptococcal (n = 116), and enterococcal (n = 31) bovine clinical mastitis isolates. The activities of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cephalothin, erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin, the penicillin-novobiocin combination, <b>pirlimycin,</b> and tetracycline were tested against the isolates. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; intertest essential and categorical agreements were determined as well. Sensititre and the ADD method demonstrated moderate to highly accurate (71 to 99 %) and moderate to perfect (71 to 100 %) predictive accuracies for 74 and 76 % of the isolate-antimicrobial MIC combinations, respectively. However, the diagnostic accuracy was low for S. aureus-ceftiofur/oxacillin combinations and other streptococcus-ampicillin combinations by either testing method. Essential agreement between Sensititre automatic MIC readings and MIC readings obtained by the broth microdilution test method was 87 %. Essential agreement between Sensititre automatic and manual MIC reading methods was 97 %. Furthermore, the ADD test method and Sensititre MIC method exhibited 92 and 91 % categorical agreement (sensitive, intermediate, resistant) of results, respectively, compared with the reference method. However, both methods demonstrated lower agreement for E. coli-ampicillin/cephalothin combinations than for Gram-positive isolates. In conclusion, the Sensititre and ADD methods had moderate to high diagnostic accuracy and very good essential and categorical agreement for most udder pathogen-antimicrobial combinations and can be readily employed in veterinary diagnostic laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Treatment of {{subclinical}} mastitis during lactation can have both direct (individual animal level) and indirect (population level) effects. With a few exceptions, prior {{research has focused}} on evaluating the direct effects of mastitis treatment, and to date no controlled field trials have been conducted to test whether beneficial indirect effects of lactation treatment strategies targeting {{subclinical mastitis}} can be demonstrated on commercial dairy farms. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge on the impact of such interventions on the population dynamics of specific bacterial strains. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that lactation therapy targeting S. aureus subclinical intramammary infection reduces transmission of S. aureus strains within dairy herds. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used to determine strain specific infection dynamics in treated and control groups in a split herd trial conducted on 2 commercial dairy farms. Results The direct effect of 8 [*]days intramammary lactation therapy with <b>pirlimycin</b> hydrochloride was demonstrated by an increased proportion of cure and a reduction in duration of infection in quarters receiving treatment compared to untreated controls. The indirect effect of lactation therapy was demonstrated by reduction of new S. aureus intramammary infections (IMI) caused by the dominant strain type in both herds. Strain typing of representative isolates taken over the duration of all IMI, including pre- and post-treatment isolates, provided more precise estimates of new infection, cure, and re-infection rates. New S. aureus infections in recovered susceptible quarters and the emergence of a new strain type in one herd influenced incidence measures. Conclusion In addition to demonstrating positive direct effects of lactation therapy, this study provides evidence that treatment of subclinical S. aureus mastitis during lactation can have indirect effects including preventing new IMI and reducing incidence of clinical mastitis within dairy herds. Strain specific transmission parameter estimates for S. aureus MLST clonal complexes 5, 97 and 705 in 2 commercial dairy herds are also reported. </p...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial use (AMU) {{data are}} {{critical}} for formulating policies for containing antimicrobial resistance. The present study determined AMU on Canadian dairy farms and characterized variation in AMU based on herd-level factors such as milk production, somatic cell count, herd size, geographic region and housing type. Drug use data were collected on 89 dairy herds in 4 regions of Canada, Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and the Maritime provinces (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia) {{for an average of}} 540 d per herd. Dairy producers and farm personnel were asked to deposit empty drug containers into specially provided receptacles. Antimicrobial use was measured as antimicrobial drug use rate (ADUR), with the unit being number of animal defined-daily doses (ADD) / 1, 000 cow-days. Antimicrobial drug use rates were determined at farm, region, and national level. Combined ADUR of all antimicrobial classes was 14. 35 ADD/ 1, 000 cow-days nationally. National level ADUR of the 6 most commonly used antimicrobial drug classes, cephalosporins, penicillins, penicillin combinations, tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations, and lincosamides were 3. 05, 2. 56, 2. 20, 1. 83, 0. 87, and 0. 84 ADD/ 1, 000 cow-days, respectively. Dairy herds in Ontario were higher users of third-generation cephalosporins (ceftiofur) than in Québec. Alberta dairy herds were higher users of tetracyclines in comparison to Maritimes. Antimicrobial drug use rate was higher via systemic route as compared with intramammary and other routes of administration (topical, oral, and intrauterine). The ADUR of antimicrobials used intramammarily was higher for clinical mastitis treatment than dry cow therapy. For dry cow therapy, penicillin ADUR was greater than ADUR of first-generation cephalosporins. For clinical mastitis treatment, ADUR of intramammary penicillin combinations was greater than ADUR of cephapirin. Herd-level milk production was positively associated with overall ADUR, ADUR of systemically administered ceftiofur, cephapirin administered for dry cow therapy, and <b>pirlimycin</b> administered for clinical mastitis treatment. Herd size and ADUR of systemically administered ceftiofur were also positively associated. In conclusion, β-lactams were most commonly used on Canadian dairy farms. Among antimicrobials of very high importance in human medicine, the use of fluoroquinolones was rare, whereas third-generation cephalosporins and penicillin combinations containing colistin were used very frequently on Canadian dairy farms...|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{accuracy}} and precision of a measuring instrument is pertinent in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This {{study was conducted to}} predict the diagnostic accuracy of the Sensititre MIC mastitis panel (Sensititre) and agar disk diffusion (ADD) method with reference to the manual broth microdilution test method for antimicrobial resistance profiling of Escherichia coli (n = 156), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 154), streptococcal (n = 116), and enterococcal (n = 31) bovine clinical mastitis isolates. The activities of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cephalothin, erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin, the penicillin-novobiocin combination, <b>pirlimycin,</b> and tetracycline were tested against the isolates. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; intertest essential and categorical agreements were determined as well. Sensititre and the ADD method demonstrated moderate to highly accurate (71 to 99 %) and moderate to perfect (71 to 100 %) predictive accuracies for 74 and 76 % of the isolate-antimicrobial MIC combinations, respectively. However, the diagnostic accuracy was low for S. aureus-ceftiofur/oxacillin combinations and other streptococcus-ampicillin combinations by either testing method. Essential agreement between Sensititre automatic MIC readings and MIC readings obtained by the broth microdilution test method was 87 %. Essential agreement between Sensititre automatic and manual MIC reading methods was 97 %. Furthermore, the ADD test method and Sensititre MIC method exhibited 92 and 91 % categorical agreement (sensitive, intermediate, resistant) of results, respectively, compared with the reference method. However, both methods demonstrated lower agreement for E. coli-ampicillin/cephalothin combinations than for Gram-positive isolates. In conclusion, the Sensititre and ADD methods had moderate to high diagnostic accuracy and very good essential and categorical agreement for most udder pathogen-antimicrobial combinations and can be readily employed in veterinary diagnostic laboratories.
