25|$|Helium was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} lifting gas {{because it was the}} safest to use in airships, as it is not flammable. One <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> to save helium was to make double-gas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells; an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium, with vertical ducting to the dorsal area of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells. At the time, however, helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was only available in industrial quantities from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the United States. Hydrogen, by comparison, could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift. Because of its expense and rarity, American rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation.|$|E

Mr. Blake refused to apologize after his speech, and a mêlée burst out among the spectators standing on the galleries. The speaker of the House had them expelled and a confrontation between MacNab and Blake was avoided by the intervention of the Sergeant at Arms.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 {{after the}} end of the regular 2006 {{legislative}} session, Anderson registered with the Municipality of Anchorage as a municipal lobbyist and worked briefly again for Anchorage CHARR in opposition to a <b>proposed</b> <b>measure</b> to extend a smoking ban in Anchorage restaurants and most indoor public spaces to also cover bars and bingo halls. By Alaska state law, legislators are not permitted to perform lobbyist work that would require them to register with the Alaska Public Offices Commission for a full year after they leave office, but lobbying the municipality on local issues did not appear to require registration with APOC. In July Anderson was hired by the Anchorage Home Builders Association for $2,500 per month. The following month he testified before the Anchorage Assembly in favor of two stores that Wal-Mart wanted to build in his legislative district. The Northeast Community Council opposed the stores. At the Assembly meeting, Assembly chair Dan Sullivan introduced Anderson as [...] "Representative Anderson," [...] but Anderson corrected him, stating that he was at the meeting in representation of the home builders association, which favored the Wal-Mart stores.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – There is an {{emerging}} consensus that systemically important banks should face stricter regulations and systemic surcharges. To make this latter principle operational the regulator {{will need to}} quantify the systemic importance of individual banks. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review the <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> of systemic importance from the research community and discuss their merits relative to how a regulator would ideally wish to calibrate surcharges on systemically important banks, and to evaluate how useful <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> of the systemic importance of financial institutions will be to regulators. Design/methodology/approach – The author reviews the main contributions to the research literature and discusses their relevance for the problem faced by regulators. Findings – There are five main caveats that make the <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> of systemic importance less useful for regulators. Practical implications – The <b>proposed</b> <b>measures</b> may help identify relevant aspects of systemic importance, but the regulators will need to construct their own measures for practical use. Originality/value – The paper provides a critical review of a research literature that could potentially have large practical implications. Banks, Financial regulation, Systemic institutions...|$|R
