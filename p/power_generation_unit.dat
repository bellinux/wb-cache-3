50|$|On September 14, 1995 {{there was}} an {{agreement}} between government of Madhya Pradesh and a renowned Power generation firm (ESSAR) {{to set up a}} <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> in Bhander, Madhya Pradesh. Land was identified and allocation was done for this <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> after paying around 1 crore and 82 lakhs to the land owners (Farmers). But the project could never take off due to financial turmoil faced by Power Generation firm. The Sangharsh Samiti has been formed to request government of Madhya Pradesh and Govt. of India to invite other Power Generation firms when land has already been allocated for the power plant 20 years back.

50|$|Lower-temperature {{fuel cell}} types {{such as the}} proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell, phosphoric acid fuel cell, and alkaline fuel cell require pure hydrogen as fuel, typically produced from external reforming of natural gas. However, fuels cells operating at high temperature such as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) are not poisoned by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in fact can accept hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, and methane mixtures as fuel directly, because of their internal shift and reforming capabilities. This opens up the possibility of efficient fuel cell-based power cycles consuming solid fuels such as coal and biomass, the gasification of which results in syngas containing mostly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane which can be cleaned and fed directly to the SOFCs without the added cost and complexity of methane reforming, water gas shifting and hydrogen separation operations which would otherwise be needed to isolate pure hydrogen as fuel.A power cycle based on gasification of solid fuel and SOFCs is called an Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (IGFC) cycle; the IGFC power plant is analogous to an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant, but with the gas turbine <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> replaced with a fuel cell (high temperature type such as SOFC) <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit.</b> By taking advantage of intrinsically high energy efficiency of SOFCs and process integration, exceptionally high power plant efficiencies are possible. Furthermore, SOFCs in the IGFC cycle can be operated so as to isolate a carbon dioxide-rich anodic exhaust stream, allowing efficient carbon capture to address greenhouse gas emissions concerns of coal-based power generation.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} optimal {{reactive}} power planning of radial distribution systems with distributed generation is proposed. The wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>units</b> installed in distribution systems may cause {{reverse power flow}} and voltage variations due to the random-like output of wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>units.</b> To conquer that disturbance, an optimal reactive power planning model is proposed to combine the reactive power support from SVC and distributed diesel units, and the optimal object is consist of power loss cost, SVC installation cost, reactive power production cost of diesel units. With the genetic algorithm as the optimization method and using Monte-Carlo simulation, the location and the output of SVC and distributed diesel units are determined.

50|$|A triboelectric nanogenerator is {{an energy}} {{harvesting}} device that converts the external mechanical energy into electricity by a conjunction of triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction. This new type of nanogenerator was firstly demonstrated in Prof. Zhong Lin Wang's group at Georgia Institute of Technology {{in the year of}} 2012. As for this <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit,</b> in the inner circuit, a potential is created by the triboelectric effect due to the charge transfer between two thin organic/inorganic films that exhibit opposite tribo-polarity; in the outer circuit, electrons are driven to flow between two electrodes attached on the back sides of the films in order to balance the potential. Since the most useful materials for TENG are organic, it is also named organic nanogenerator, which is the first of using organic materials for harvesting mechanical energy.|$|E
50|$|This {{power plant}} works only for 76 hours in reality.At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s Nicolae Ceauşescu, then President of Romania, decided to build a large thermal power station in Caraş-Severin County to exploit the large oil shale deposits located in the area. At first the power station was intended to be built in Ticvaniu Mic commune, now part of the Ticvaniu Mare commune, near Oraviţa but the chosen site had a very small water supply that was not sufficient for the power station. In 1976 a new location was found at Crivina, located in the mountains near Anina. In 1983 the construction of the power station was complete and the first 330 MW electric <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> was put online. The turbine could not reach its highest potential capacity due to the low quality of the oil shale deposits. The communist regime also built a town that was used to house the power station's workers. It was intended to have 10,000 inhabitants, and a part of Anina had to move to this new location to make way for oil shale surface mines.|$|E
50|$|Badin Lake {{is one of}} {{a series}} of lakes created by the damming of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River in the Uwharrie Lakes Region of the United States.
