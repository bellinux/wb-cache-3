25|$|If {{the laser}} use {{is for a}} show or display in the U.S., {{there is a more}} {{stringent}} regulatory process. In the U.S., any use of lasers in a show or display requires <b>pre-approval</b> from the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This is required both for the laser equipment, and separately for the show itself (site, audience configuration, beam effects, etc.). As part of the CDRH's show approval ("variance") process, the CDRH will require a letter of non-objection from the FAA. Without this, the laser show cannot legally proceed.|$|E

40|$|Advertisements of {{medicinal}} products can empower consumers with information. Ideally, this information might {{enable them to}} make informed decisions, or lead to an early diagnosis or treatment of illnesses, or assist discussions with physicians regarding embarrassing conditions such as erectile dysfunction, weight loss and baldness. However, the content of advertisements is not always true and accurate. On many occasions, consumers have been misled by exaggerated claims or false claims of miracle cures. The increasing deceptive health claims in advertisements has resulted {{in an environment of}} confusion and mistrust amongst consumers and patients. Medicinal products and these include prescription drugs and non-prescription drugs as well as products such as food, dietary supplements and cosmetics which are classified as {{medicinal products}} (the latter referred to as health-related products in the thesis), are at times promoted through the use of deceptive claims. In some instances, important information regarding the side effects of products and contraindications, where it is inadvisable to use the products, is omitted as this may {{have a negative impact on}} the purchase of the products. The consequence is that consumers are harmed by false and misleading advertising. Countries adopt a variety of measures to address the problems posed by deceptive advertising. These include use of different types of rules and regulatory controls. In some instances varied advertising standards are used so as not to unduly restrict information. There are also differing levels of participation from industry in the regulation. This thesis compares and assesses the regulation of the advertising of medicinal products in three jurisdictions, namely Malaysia, Australia and the United States. The study analyses significant reforms to the regulation of two types of advertising: (1) advertising of prescription drugs and (2) advertising of non prescription drugs and health related products. The issues therein analysed include: the classification of products as medicinal products in the respective regulatory regimes; the modes of regulation adopted in the regulation of advertising and the respective systems of regulatory controls, including <b>pre-approvals</b> of advertisements, monitoring of infringement and the respective enforcements. The thesis argues that DTCA (direct-to-consumer advertising) of prescription drugs should not be allowed in Malaysia. It presents analysis that demonstrates why DTCA of prescription drugs may be appropriately regulated through its prohibition. With regard to advertising of non prescription drugs and health-related products, it argues that collaboration between regulatory agencies and industry associations would be beneficial in their regulation. The thesis considers the use of modes of regulation such as co-regulation and enforced self-regulation in the regulation of advertising of medicinal products, and uses economic analyses to gauge their effectiveness. The thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge by exploring this under studied topic through the means of a comparative and economic analysis. It is hoped that the analysis drawn in this thesis will be of use to the regulator in Malaysia when considering an improvement to the regulation of advertising of medicinal products...|$|R
25|$|Justice Frankfurter {{noted that}} the Court had {{jurisdiction}} as a constitutional issue had been raised. He next reviewed the extensive problems with organized crime which had given rise to the Act, the investigations by the U.S. Senate committee {{and the state of}} New York, the structure of the Act, and supplementary enacting legislation passed by both New York and New Jersey. Section 8 of the New York supplementary legislation was at issue. Frankfurter {{noted that the}} compact expressly provided for congressional <b>pre-approval</b> of supplementary legislation, that Sec. 8 had been enacted after the compact had been submitted to Congress but before Congress had approved the original compact, and that Sec. 8 was not bi-state in nature (even though New York and New Jersey had enacted substantively identical legislation).|$|E
25|$|The goal of luring a {{computer}} chip fabrication plant (chip fab) {{was one of}} the earliest goals of, and reasons underlying, the Tech Valley name. The plan to get a chip fab to the Capital District predates the Tech Valley slogan. In 1997, New York set out submissions for possible chip fab sites that it could whittle to 10 sites around the state that would be pre-approved and pre-permitted for a chip plant. Years before that the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's RPI Tech Park had been visited by semiconductor companies, but they had chosen not to build. The renewed interest by the region in luring them was spurred by the research centers and training of specialists for the industry by area colleges such as the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Hudson Valley Community College. Responding to the state's request for potential sites, Rensselaer County proposed the same RPI Tech Park site; Schenectady County proposed two sites, one of which was in Hillside Industrial Park in Niskayuna; Saratoga County proposed two sites; and Albany County proposed three sites, two in Bethlehem and one in Guilderland. The state ultimately decided on 13 sites it would aggressively promote, most of which were in Tech Valley. As one of the thirteen sites chosen, the RPI Tech Park site originally met little opposition from the town of North Greenbush in which it sat. As time progressed opposition grew in response to concerns about potential impacts on traffic and the environment. The RPI Tech Park site, which by October 1999 had become one of only nine sites still being marketed by the state, ended when the North Greenbush town council voted to terminate the review process. A site in Wallkill, Orange County was the first site in Tech Valley and in the entire state to receive <b>pre-approval</b> for a chip fab.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, during National Brotherhood Week Atlas {{spoke on}} a panel of clergy at the local WRMA radio station, which also {{included}} Michael Caswell, a white Roman Catholic priest from nearby Gunter Air Force Base, Roy Bennett, a black Baptist minister, and black activist Ralph Abernathy; Bennett and Abernathy were subsequently arrested [...] "on an obscure conspiracy charge". A picture of Atlas, Bennett, and Abernathy appeared in Life magazine in {{an article about the}} boycott, and the leadership of Agudath Israel grew concerned that Atlas's activism would lead to an antisemitic backlash. The trustees called an emergency meeting, and sent then congregational president Yale Friedlander to demand Atlas recant his support of the boycott, ask Life to withdraw the article, and agree to submit all public speeches to the board in advance for <b>pre-approval.</b> Atlas refused, and insisted that his participation in Brotherhood Week was not an endorsement of the boycott. However, Atlas wrote a sermon for the following Shabbat which included a prayer for the participants of the boycott. The sermon, as with all others, was to be printed beforehand in the Montgomery Advertiser, and a typesetter there called one of the synagogue's trustees to inform him of the contents. The trustee asked Atlas to modify the sermon, but he refused.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pre-approval</b> Phase III {{clinical}} trials, {{like the}} APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events {{for the first}} eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others {{have pointed out that}} [...] "study 090," [...] a <b>pre-approval</b> trial, showed a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a 7-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another [...] ), and an 8-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.|$|E

Indeed, the purely local problem faced by New York and New Jersey had prompted a purely local solution, one which Congress had [...] "unambiguously" [...] supported, he said. Indeed, Sec. 8 had already been enacted by both states prior to Congressional approval of the compact, and Sec. 8 had clearly {{been brought to the}} attention of Congress during debate over the original compact. Furthermore, Congress had expressly approved of supplementary legislation in its enabling bill, and neither the extensive federal and state acknowledgement of corruptionnor the congressional debate over <b>pre-approval</b> of supplementary legislation had occurred in the Florida case.|$|E
2500|$|EchoStar Crop. {{appealed the}} District Court’s {{contempt}} ruling {{on the grounds}} that issues relating to continued infringement are impermissible in a contempt proceeding due to changes made during the redesign. The Federal Circuit disagreed and held that the District Court “used the proper standard in its analysis,” the KSM test. The Federal Circuit concluded there was no “abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to hold contempt proceedings,” In addition, the Federal Circuit was persuaded that the District Court could find EchoStar in contempt of the Infringement Provision and that there was “clear and convincing evidence" [...] to do so. With regards to the Disablement Provision, the Federal Circuit held a plain reading “would have provided EchoStar with notice of what is now being held in contempt;” furthermore, the chance to appeal the provision language has passed. The amendment to the permanent injunction which required EchoStar Crop. to seek <b>pre-approval</b> for any new design-around effort was affirmed.|$|E
2500|$|Obesity {{prevalence}} {{is affected}} by access to care for truckers. Company drivers often have issues with insurance, such as necessary <b>pre-approval</b> if out of network. Most owner-operator drivers {{do not have any}} kind of medical insurance (that is, in the USA where medical treatment isn't free of charge like most countries). [...] Moreover, truckers have difficulties making an appointment on the road and often do not know where to stop for assistance. Many self-diagnose or ignore their health issue altogether. [...] Some are able to be seen at doctor’s offices or private clinics while a large percentage depend on emergency rooms and urgent care visits. The Department of Transportation has Convenient Care Clinics across the U.S., but those are hard to find and are few and far between. Health care costs are substantially higher for overweight and obese individuals, so obesity in the truck driver population puts a greater financial demand on the industry.|$|E
2500|$|Concerns {{about the}} length of the drug {{approval}} process were brought to the fore early in the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988 action at the FDA campus which resulted in nearly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded <b>pre-approval</b> access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a [...] "treatment IND" [...] was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. Three of the first 5 HIV medications were approved in the United States before they were approved in any other country.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Vioxx, a <b>pre-approval</b> study {{indicated}} that a group taking the drug had four times {{the risk of heart}} attacks when compared to another group of patients taking another anti-inflammatory, naproxen. The FDA approval board accepted the manufacturer's argument that this was due to a previously unknown cardioprotective effect of naproxen, rather than a risk of Vioxx, and the drug was approved. In 2005, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that Vioxx users suffered a higher rate of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disorders than patients taking no medication at all. The manufacturer, Merck, withdrew the drug after disclosures that it had withheld information about its risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease of which roughly half died. [...] David Graham, a scientist in the Office of Drug Safety within the CDER, testified to Congress that he was pressured by his supervisors not to warn the public about dangers of drugs like Vioxx. He argued that an inherent conflict of interest exists when the office responsible for post-approval monitoring of drug safety is controlled by the same organization which initially approved those same drugs as safe and effective. [...] He said that after testifying against Vioxx, he was [...] "marginalized by FDA management and not asked to participate in the evaluation of any new drug safety issues. It's a type of ostracism." [...] In a 2006 survey sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, almost one-fifth of FDA scientists said they [...] "have been asked, for non-scientific reasons, to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in a FDA scientific document." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, a {{great part}} of the Ukrainian {{population}} considered the German troops as liberators after the two years of genocidal Soviet regime, similarly to many Jewish and Ukrainian inhabitants who had earlier welcomed the Soviets as their liberators from the rule of [...] "bourgeois" [...] Poland. City's Ukrainian minority initially associated Germans with the previous Austrian times, happier for Ukrainians in comparison to the later Polish and especially Soviet periods. However, already {{since the beginning of the}} German occupation of the city, the situation of the city's Jewish inhabitants became tragic. After being subject to deadly pogroms, the Jewish inhabitants of the area were rushed into a newly created ghetto and then mostly sent to various German concentration camps. The Polish and smaller Ukrainian populations of the city were also subject to harsh policies, which resulted in a number of mass executions both in the city and in the Janowska camp. Among the first to be murdered were the professors of the city's universities and other members of Polish elite (intelligentsia). [...] On June 30, 1941, the first day of the German occupation of the city, one of the wings of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) declared restoration of the independent Ukrainian state. Yaroslav Stetsko proclaimed in Lviv the Government of an independent which [...] "will work closely with the National-Socialist Greater Germany, under the leadership of its leader Adolf Hitler which is forming a new order in Europe and the world" [...] - as stated in the text of the [...] "Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian Statehood". This was done without <b>pre-approval</b> from the Germans and after 15 September 1941 the organisers were arrested. [...] Stepan Bandera, Yaroslav Stetsko and others, were arrested by Nazi Einsatzgruppe and sent to Nazi concentration camps, where both of Bandera's brothers were executed. The policy of the occupying power turned quickly harsh towards Ukrainians as well. Some of the Ukrainian nationalists were driven underground, and from that time forward, they fought against the Nazis, but continued also to fight against Poles and Soviet forces (see Ukrainian Insurgent Army).|$|E
2500|$|The trend {{away from}} big band swing was {{accelerated}} by wartime conditions and royalty conflicts. [...] In 1941 the American Society of Composers and Producers (ASCAP) demanded bigger royalties from broadcasters and the broadcasters refused. [...] Consequently, ASCAP banned the large repertoire they controlled from airplay, severely restricting what the radio audience could hear. [...] ASCAP also demanded <b>pre-approval</b> of set lists and even solos for live broadcasts, {{to assure that}} not even a quoted fragment of ASCAP repertoire was broadcast. [...] Those restrictions made broadcast swing much less appealing for {{the year in which}} the ban was in place. [...] Big band swing remained popular during the war years, but the resources required to support it became problematic. [...] Restrictions on automotive and rail travel, coupled with rising expenses, curtailed road touring. [...] The manpower requirements for big swing bands placed a burden on the scarce resources available for touring and were impacted by the military draft. In July 1942 the American Federation of Musicians called a ban on recording until record labels agreed to pay royalties to musicians. [...] That stopped recording of instrumental music for major labels for over a year, with the last labels agreeing to new contract terms in November 1944. In the meantime, vocalists continued to record backed by vocal groups and the recording industry released earlier swing recordings from their vaults, increasingly reflecting the popularity of big band vocalists. [...] In 1943 Columbia Records re-released the 1939 recording of All or Nothing at All by the Harry James Orchestra with Frank Sinatra, giving Sinatra top billing ("Acc. Harry James and his Orchestra"). [...] The recording found the commercial success that had eluded its original release. [...] Small band swing was recorded for small specialty labels not affected by the ban. [...] These labels had limited distribution centered in large urban markets, which tended to limit the size of the ensembles with which recording could be a money-making proposition. [...] Another blow fell on the market for dance-oriented swing in 1944 when the federal government levied a 30% excise tax on [...] "dancing" [...] nightclubs, undercutting the market for dance music in smaller venues.|$|E
50|$|The second meaning {{relates to}} {{mortgage}} lending. People {{interested in buying}} a house can often approach a lender, who will check their credit history and verify their income, and then can provide assurances {{they would be able}} to get a loan up to a certain amount. This <b>pre-approval</b> can then help a buyer find a home that is within their loan amount range. Buyers can ask for a letter of <b>pre-approval</b> from the lender, and when shopping for a home can have possibly an advantage over others because they can show the seller that they are more likely to be able to buy the house. Often real estate agents prefer to work with a buyer who has a <b>pre-approval</b> as it demonstrates that they are well-qualified to receive financing and are serious about buying a home. A <b>pre-approval</b> is based on the documentation the borrower supplies at the time of application, and any actual eligibility to receive the pre-approved loan depends on the terms and conditions of the <b>pre-approval</b> and ability to secure the loan before the <b>pre-approval</b> expires.|$|E
