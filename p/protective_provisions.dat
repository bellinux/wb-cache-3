This Article reports the results of an empirical study of all Department of Labor Sarbanes-Oxley determinations during this time, consisting of over 700 separate decisions from administrative investigations and hearings. The results of this detailed analysis demonstrate that administrative decision-makers strictly construed, and in some cases misapplied, Sarbanes-Oxley’s substantive protections to the significant disadvantage of employees.

40|$|Coastal squeeze is the {{reduction}} in the space of coastal habitats to operate (Phan et al, 2014) and an important cause for coastline retreat, increase in flood risk, salinity intrusion etc. Land use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization, reduce the space of natural habitats, such as mangrove forests, and cause deterioration of these habitats, that leads to reduction of their natural <b>protective</b> and <b>provisioning</b> functions. Costs related to these function losses can be avoided by early recognition of coastal squeeze and early action. In this research we investigate how remote sensing imagery data can contribute to early recognition of coastal squeeze. The case study is the lower Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar, a crucial agricultural zone nicknamed the ‘Ricebowl of Myanmar’. The coastal zone in Myanmar is subject to climate change, urbanization, extreme weather conditions (cyclones), increase in agri- and aquaculture and (illegal) felling of mangrove. This has already led to large loss of biodiversity and increased flood risk. Remote sensing analysis based on LANDSAT imagery has been done in attempt to identify land use and coastline change.

In pursuance to this requirement, the Municipal Extension to Scheduled Areas Act (MESA) was introduced in Parliament. However, it was never passed. technically, no areas in Scheduled Areas can be converted into a municipality till the Act is passed. it is expected that if and when such an Act is passed it shall through certain modifications in Part IX A of the Constitution provide adequate safeguards for the people of Scheduled Areas. [...] However, absence of MESA has not prevented many states from creating municipalities leading to much heartburn in scheduled areas and legal challenges. [...] "C R Bijoy of Campaign for Survival and Dignity, a non-profit in Delhi, says state governments are upgrading the panchayati areas within the scheduled area into municipal areas and are taking the areas out of the purview of PESA provisions, which mandate village council’s approval for setting up any project. Worse, they are doing so without providing alternative <b>protective</b> <b>provisions</b> to the municipal areas. This is creating legal infirmity, Bijoy adds. As per the 1991 census, there were 167 urban local bodies in Schedule Five areas. Their number has increased since.

Alok Pandey of PRIA, a Delhi-based non-profit that works on local governance, cites another reason for such upgrade. Before the general election of 2009, the Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh governments upgraded 79 and 100 panchayats, respectively.

40|$|The {{potential}} of beekeeping {{to mitigate the}} exposure of rural sub-Sahara African farmers to economic stochasticity has been widely promoted by an array of development agencies. Robust outcome indicators {{of the success of}} beekeeping to improve household well-being are unfortunately lacking. This study aimed to identify the key drivers and barriers of beekeeping adoption at the household level, and quantified the associated income contribution in three agro-ecological zones in Uganda. Beekeepers were generally the most economically disadvantaged people in the study areas and tended to adopt beekeeping following contact with non-government organisations and access to training. Whilst incomes were not statistically lower than their non-beekeeping counterparts; their mean household well-being scores were significantly lower than non-beekeeping households. The inability of beekeeping to significantly improve well-being status can in part be attributed to a lack of both training in bee husbandry and <b>protective</b> equipment <b>provision</b> such as suits, gloves and smokers. These are critical tools for beekeepers as they provide the necessary confidence to manage honey bees.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) together account {{for the vast majority of}} cases. The Directive 2010 / 32 /EU “Prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector”, issued to protect workers from these risks, requires an integrated approach to prevention including awareness-raising, education, training, elimination of unnecessary needles, safe procedures for sharps use and disposal, banning of recapping, vaccination, use of personal <b>protective</b> equipment, <b>provision</b> of safety-engineered devices, and appropriate surveillance, mo-nitoring, response and follow-up. As laboratories represent a high-risk setting both in the preanalytical and analytical phase, we reviewed accidents and prevention in this setting in the light of the new legislation. Phlebotomy is the procedure carrying the highest risk of exposure and infection, involved in 30 - 50 % of HIV and HCV cases detected in nationwide systems following accidental blood exposures implemented since the 1990 s in Italy and France. In laboratories, problems in the management of sharps containers, recapping, needle disassembly by hand and blood transfer from syringes into tubes were observed and accounted for two-thirds of injuries. These accidents could be reduced through education and monitoring of behaviours, and introduction of medical devices incorporating safety-engineered protection mechanisms with appropriate training.
