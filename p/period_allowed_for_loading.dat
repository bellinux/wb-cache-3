30|$|While the ICD {{model used}} to revise each class <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> some {{consistency}} in lesson design, the student activities that were created often dictated the format {{and structure of}} each class.

50|$|The {{process of}} damage control {{resuscitation}} {{has had a}} dramatic impact on how care for critically ill patients is administered.. The core principles of resuscitation involve permissive hypotension, transfusion ratios, and massive transfusion protocol.

50|$|The {{extinction}} {{of nearly all}} animal species {{at the end of}} the Permian <b>Period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> the radiation of many new lifeforms.

Some were filled by the surviving cynodonts and dicynodonts, the latter of which subsequently became extinct.|$|R

50|$|The Transitional Period (850-1000 AD) at San Jose de Moro {{represents}} {{a time of}} change as the hegemony of the Moche empire waned and the Lambayeque state rose in power in the valley.

5000|$|Beginning in 2012-13, in {{accordance}} with a new District Transformation Plan, Indian Trail implemented a new, more flexible 8-block schedule which <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> core classes to meet year-round, as well as allowing some classes to meet as before in ninety-minute blocks, based on student class preferences. [...] In 2013-14, the District implemented a slightly modified version of this schedule which removed one class <b>period,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> slightly longer class periods and an additional lunch hour.|$|R
50|$|A {{transfer}} switch {{can be set}} up to provide power only to critical circuits or to entire electrical (sub)panels. Some {{transfer switch}}es <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>load</b> shedding or prioritization of optional circuits, such as heating and cooling equipment. More complex emergency switchgear used in large backup generator installations permits soft loading, allowing load to be smoothly transferred from the utility to the synchronized generators, and back; such installations are useful <b>for</b> reducing peak <b>load</b> demand from a utility.|$|R

It has been stated that interdomain routing loops may appear in this case. We show that under reasonable assumptions (which reflect commercial relationships between ASes) such routing loops cannot appear. Furthermore we show that even if theses assumptions are not met, routing loops can only be transient. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Our strategy relies on dynamic monitoring and application profiling to manage workloads {{and improve the}} system performance of nondedicated clusters of heterogeneous computers. Application profiling and the combined use of load balancing mechanisms have proven useful to deal with services with a differentiated demand for resources. The use of this strategy <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>load</b> balancing and performance improvement with low overhead. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Japanese defense {{industry}} {{is the major}} supplier of the nation's own Self-Defense Forces. Production costs are high, due to several factors: the successful Japanese economy of the postwar <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> generous defense spending; few products are exported, keeping production numbers low; research and development is done independently where possible, securing national self-sustainability; public investment in Japan tends to be uneconomic, aimed largely at gaining local voter support.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} land {{sales in}} the suburb included the Palace Hotel and a Wesleyan Church, both acquired in 1879. In 1886, the borough had a population of approximately 6,000, with approximately 20 new buildings opening each month. Low-lying land {{in the south of}} the suburb, near the present-day JJ Holland Park, was filled in around the same <b>period,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> the construction of the Gillespie Mill adjacent to the railway line.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic premise}} of dynamic {{infrastructures}} is to leverage pooled IT resources to provide flexible IT capacity, enabling {{the allocation of}} resources in line with demand from business processes. This is achieved by using server virtualization technology to pool computing resources wherever possible, and allocating these resources on-demand using automated tools. This <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>load</b> balancing and is a more efficient approach than keeping massive computing resources in reserve to run tasks that take place, for example, once a month, but are otherwise under-utilized.|$|R
50|$|This <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> {{the fusion}} of single protons and {{deuterium}} nuclei to form helium and lithium nuclei but was too short for every H+ ion to be reconstituted into heavier elements. In this case, helium, atomic number 2, remains the even numbered counterpart to hydrogen. Thus, neutral hydrogen - or hydrogen paired with an electron, the only stable lepton - constituted {{the vast majority of}} the remaining unannihilated portions of matter following the conclusion of inflation.|$|R

5000|$|Some breads begin {{mixing with}} an autolyse.

[...] This rest <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> better absorption of water and helps the gluten and starches to align. The autolyse is credited to Raymond Calvel, who recommended {{it as a way}} to reduce kneading time and thereby improve the flavor and color of bread.|$|R
