40|$|Recently, {{the notion}} of Multicast Service Overlay Network (MSON) has been {{introduced}} {{to address some of}} the deployment and maintenance problems of IP multicast and application-level multicast. Basically, an MSON is a backbone service overlay provisioned by an MSON provider and designed to "multiplex" several user overlays. The MSON provider designs the backbone overlay for a large user population and can therefore enjoy large scale economies and benefits. Since the deployment of an MSON is a capitalintensive investment, it is very imperative to carefully design the MSON so that the ISP can make the best <b>revenue</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this investment. In this paper, we formulate the backbone design problem by taking into account ISP operational costs. We divide it into three sub-problems: overlay proxy placement, overlay link selection, and bandwidth dimensioning. We propose several algorithms for each of these subproblems. Through simulations, we study the e#ectiveness of di#erent overlay design algorithms, analyze their impact on multicast performance, and suggest some practical solutions for MSON design...|$|R
