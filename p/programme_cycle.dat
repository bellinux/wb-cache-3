40|$|Since {{the era of}} one-party rule, Malawi's {{relationship}} with the donor community has proved erratic and contentious. During the second term of Malawi's current president, Bingu wa Mutharika, this trend has continued apace, with important implications for the consolidation of the country's nascent democracy. Donors providing democracy aid have assisted with the conduct of elections and improved the technical capacity of parliamentarians. However, inconsistency across <b>programme</b> <b>cycles,</b> the concentration of funding around elections, and a reluctance to support political parties hinders the size of democracy aid's long-term impact. Development aid, particularly general budget support, has tended to further sideline the role of parliament and indirectly has provided the incumbent party with an electoral advantage through support for the country's fertilizer input subsidy programme. To prevent an erosion of democracy caused by violations of civil liberties, donors often have threatened to withhold aid to Malawi.

40|$|Training and {{exercises}} programmes are not independent activities, forming {{part of a}} larger, risk-based, process of disaster management preparedness. In order {{to have an impact}} on an individual's skills knowledge or behaviours, or to influence organizational learning or procedures, the programmes needs a cyclic and holistic approach. It should focus on clearly identified outcomes that are designed to meet the demands of identified gaps and emerging threats. This will support meaningful evaluations against clear indicators. Without having clear outcomes, standards or values, it is not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of a programme. These outcomes form measurable performance indicators around which a detailed programme can be designed. Following delivery, analysis of the evaluation observations will identify critical gaps in knowledge, skills, behaviour or policy. This analysis allows clear, structured recommendations to be formulated that provide guidance as to the content of the continuing training <b>programme</b> <b>cycle,</b> prioritising key needs and ensuring maximum efficiency and utilisation of resources at all levels. By analysing and comparing six European Modules exercises (EU ModEx 2010 - 2011) and their outcomes we can demonstrate the benefits of this approach.

40|$|Introduction: According to UNAIDS, {{the world}} {{currently}} has an adequate collection of proven HIV prevention, treatment and diagnostic tools, which, if scaled up, can {{lay the foundation}} for ending the AIDS epidemic. HIV operations research (OR) tests and promotes the use of interventions that can increase the demand for and supply of these tools. However, current publications of OR mainly focus on outcomes, leaving gaps in reporting of intervention characteristics, which are essential to address for the utilization of OR findings. This has prompted WHO and other international public health agencies to issue reporting requirements for OR studies. The objective of this commentary is to review experiences in HIV OR intervention design, implementation, process data collection and publication in order to identify gaps, contribute to the body of knowledge and propose a way forward to improve the focus on “implementation” in implementation research. Discussion: Interventions in OR, like ordinary service delivery programmes, are subject to the <b>programme</b> <b>cycle,</b> which continually uses insights from implementation and the local context to modify service delivery modalities. Given that some of these modifications in the intervention may influence study outcomes, the documentation of process data becomes vital in OR. However, a key challenge is that study resources tend to be skewed towards documentation and the reporting of study outcomes to the detriment of process data, even though process data is vital for understanding factors influencing the outcomes. Conclusions: Interventions in OR should be viewed using the lens of programme evaluation, which includes formative assessment (to determine concept and design), followed by process evaluation (to monitor inputs and outputs) and effectiveness evaluation (to assess outcomes and effectiveness). Study resources should be equitably used between process evaluation and outcome measurement to facilitate inclusion of data about fidelity and dose in publications in order to enable explanation of the relationship between dosing and study outcomes for purposes of scaling up and further refinement through research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Timor-Leste Ministry of Health has {{recently}} finalized the National Malaria Control Strategy for 2010 - 2020. A {{key component of}} this roadmap is to provide universal national coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in support of achieving {{the primary goal of}} reducing both morbidity and mortality from malaria by 30 % in the first three years, followed by a further reduction of 20 % by end of the <b>programme</b> <b>cycle</b> in 2020 1. The strategic plan calls for this target to be supported by a comprehensive information, education and communication (IEC) programme; however, there is limited prior research into household and personal usage patterns to assist in the creation of targeted, effective, and socio-culturally specific behaviour change materials. Methods Nine separate focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Dili, Manatuto, and Covalima districts, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, in July 2010. These focus groups primarily explored themes of perceived malaria risk, causes of malaria, net usage patterns within families, barriers to correct and consistent usage, and the daily experience of users (both male and female) in households with at least one net. Comprehensive qualitative analysis utilized open source analysis software. Results The primary determinants of net usage were a widespread perception that nets could or should only be used by pregnant women and young children, and the availability of sufficient sleeping space under a limited number of nets within households. Both nuisance biting and disease prevention were commonly cited as primary motivations for usage, while seasonality was not a significant factor. Long-term net durability and ease of hanging were seen as key attributes in net design preference. Very frequent washing cycles were common, potentially degrading net effectiveness. Finally, extensive re-purposing of nets (fishing, protecting crops) was both reported and observed, and may significantly decrease availability of nighttime sleeping space for all family members if distributed nets do not remain within the household. Conclusions Emphasizing that net usage is acceptable and important for all family members regardless of age or gender, and addressing the complex behavioural economics of alternative net usages could have significant impacts on malaria control efforts in Timor-Leste, as the country's programmes make progress towards universal net coverage. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Uq {{transposable element}} {{is one of}} two transposable {{elements}} consistently found in maize (Zea mays L.) populations. Populations developed from two independent recurrent selection programs initiated in the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) maize population were tested for the frequency of Uq transposable elements to determine how Uq frequency has changed with cycles of recurrent selection. In the first <b>programme,</b> 13 <b>cycles</b> of half-sib and S 2 progeny recurrent selection [BSSS(S) C 13] have been completed and 10 of the 13 cycles were assayed for active Uqelements. In the second <b>programme,</b> 11 <b>cycles</b> of reciprocal recurrent selection [BSSS(R) C 11] have been completed and five of the 11 cycles were assayed for active Uq elements. The frequency of Uq was different for the two recurrent-selection programmes. The percentage of plants containing active Uq elements increased from 19 % (BSSS) to 91 % [BSSS(S) C 13] at a linear rate after 13 cycles of half-sib and S 2 progeny recurrent selection, whereas the percentage of plants containing active Uq elements decreased from 19 % (BSSS) to 0 % [BSSS(R) C 11] after 11 cycles of reciprocal recurrent selection, with extinction of the Uq element occurring between the fifth and sixth cycles of selection. Our data suggest that the increase in frequency of Uq with half-sib and S 2 progeny recurrent selection was predominantly due to random genetic drift coupled with a selective advantage possibly associated with a region of the genome linked to Uq. Neither replicative transposition or chromosome assortment and segregation can be invoked to explain the change in frequency of Uq in these populations. The extinction of Uq after reciprocal recurrent selection was best explained by random genetic drift...|$|R
