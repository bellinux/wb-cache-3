40|$|Abstract. Lewis [L 1] invented {{signaling}} {{games to}} show that meaning convention can arise simply from regularities in communicative behav-ior. The precondition {{for the emergence of}} such conventions are so-called <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> systems. In a series of articles the emergence of such sig-naling systems was addressed by combining signaling games with learning dynamics; and not uncommonly researchers examined the circumstances aggravating the emergence of <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling.</b> It could be shown that especially by increasing the number of states, messages and actions for a <b>signaling</b> game <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> becomes more and more improbable. This paper contributes to the question how the capability of innovation through emergence of new messages and extinction of unused messages would change these outcomes. Our results show that innovation in fact supports the emergence of <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling.</b> ...|$|R

We explicitly describe a nonsignaling device which becomes a <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> device under time reversal, where time reversal can be conceptualized as playing backwards a videotape of an agent manipulating the device. This leads to an arrow of time that is identifiable when studying the correlations of events for spacelike separated regions. Somewhat surprisingly, although the time reversal of Popescu-Rohrlich boxes also allows agents to signal, it does not yield a <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> device.

50|$|A {{major concern}} is that the {{broadcast}} technology used for ATSC signals called 8VSB has problems receiving signals inside buildings and in urban areas, largely due to multipath reception issues which cause ghosting and fading on analog images, but can lead to intermittent signal or no reception at all on ATSC programs. DTV broadcasts exhibit a digital cliff effect, by which viewers will receive either a <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> or no signal at all with little or no middle ground. Digital transmissions do contain additional data bits to provide error correction for a finite number of bit errors; once signal quality degrades beyond that point, recovery of the original digital signal becomes impossible, and the image on the screen freezes, or blinks back and forth to totally blank black.|$|E
30|$|Other {{kinds of}} perfect {{sequence}} are studied, such as perfect ternary sequences [20], perfect three-level and three-phase sequences [21], almost-perfect binary sequence [22], odd-periodic-perfect binary sequences [23], and Alexis sequences [24]. Current researches define the <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> by the inner product of sequence {{itself and its}} delay sequence. However, these traditional sequences based on second-order statistics cannot handle colored Gaussian measurement noise automatically, thus affecting the accuracy of their properties in engineering application. Since high-order cumulants are blind {{to any kind of}} Gaussian process, this paper introduces HOC into the field of perfect binary sequence, which breaks through the limitations of the <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> defined by second-order statistics, to fill out the blank of <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> in the area of research on Gaussian noise suppression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{extend the}} Surfliner on-chip distortionless {{transmission}} line scheme and provide more details {{for the implementation}} issues. Surfliner seeks to approach distortionless transmission by intentionally adding shunt resistors between the signal line and the ground.

Since the higher-order cumulant is more robust to additive measurement noise than correlation, even if that noise is colored, this article introduces higher-order cumulants into the research of perfect binary sequence, which can enrich the research field of <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> theory. According to the properties of HOC, the PBTOCAS can draw itself out of Gaussian noise, thereby boosting their signal-to-noise ratios in engineering application.|$|E
40|$|The {{paradigmatic}} view where {{information is}} seen as a more fundamental concept than the laws of physics leads to a different understanding of spacetime where the causal order of events emerges from correlations between random variables representing physical quantities. In particular, such an information-theoretic approach does not enforce a global spacetime structure. By following this path, we conclude that <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> correlations among three parties are possible which do not obey the restrictions imposed by global spacetime. We show this using a recent framework based on the sole assumptions that locally, quantum theory is valid and random variables can be described by probability distributions. Our result is of zero-error type and is an analog to a tripartite appearance of quantum non-locality which manifests itself by satisfying a condition with certainty whereas the same is impossible for any local theory.

30|$|This paper {{focus on}} {{avoiding}} {{the transmission of}} the explicit SI in MIMO-OFDM systems. To achieve this goal, we propose two efficient blind methods. In the first part, we propose a new blind technique, one inspired from classical SLM techniques, referred to as Blind Space Time Bloc Codes (BSTBC). This method requires, at the transmitter side, a special precoder codebook containing different configurations of two Space Time Bloc Codes (STBC) patterns. Among them, the one leading to the minimum PAPR will be kept in the PAPR reduction process. Consequently, this leads to an embedded signaling that guarantees a reliable and <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> recovery at the receiver side through a hard or a soft decision process. The second method consists of combining the BSTBC method with BSLM scheme already investigated in [18]. This combined method, referred to as Blind SLM-STBC (BSLM-STBC), exploits two forms of signaling which are the set of rotated and unrotated constellations and a precoders codebook containing different configurations of STBC patterns. In this paper, we show that BSLM-STBC approach does not only lead to significant reduce of the PAPR level but also enhances the recovery process at the receiver side. Furthermore, both methods consider a MAX-Log-MAP estimation technique which takes an optimal advantage from these embedded signaling. Compared to the existing works, our proposed methods have the advantage to consider an embedded signaling process that exploits both the transmitter and the receiver sides to jointly reduce the PAPR and guarantee a <b>perfect</b> <b>signal</b> reconstitution without use of an explicit SI.|$|E
40|$|David Lewis (1969) {{introduced}} sender-receiver {{games as}} a way of investigating how meaningful language might evolve from initially random signals. In this report I investigate the conditions under which Lewis signaling games evolve to <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> systems under various learning dynamics. While the 2 -state/ 2 -term Lewis signaling game with basic urn learning always approaches a signaling system, I will show that with more than two states suboptimal pooling equilibria can evolve. Inhomogeneous state distributions increase the likelihood of pooling equilibria, but learning strategies with negative reinforcement or certain sorts of mutation can decrease the likelihood of, and even eliminate, pooling equilibria. Both Moran and APR learning strategies (Bereby-Meyer and Erev 1998) are shown to promote successful convergence to signaling systems. A model is presented that illustrates how a language that codes state-act pairs in an order-based grammar might evolve {{in the context of a}} Lewis signaling game. The terms, grammar, and the corresponding partitions of the state space co-evolve to generate a language whose structure appears to reflect canonical natural kinds. The evolution o...|$|R

The intended use of the subsystem should be as a radiofrequency (RF) receiver chain in a low-cost dedicated MRI scanner (e. g., suitable for musculoskeletal limbs studies). The digital receiver consists of a passband (antialiasing) filter, an ADC (analog to digital converter) to digitalize the signal with the undersampling technique, and a DDC (digital down converter) for the frequency translation and filtering to process the signal using a PC.

We find that there are devices which admit a local hidden variable representation, but for which time-reverses enable <b>perfect</b> <b>signaling</b> between Alice and Bob. That is, a `perfect channel in one time direction' becomes a `non-channel in the other direction'. Also, for PR boxes time-reverses enable signaling between Alice and Bob, but never as a perfect channel.

They also provide new insights into the structure of the polytope of generalized probabilistic correlations, and contribute to the growing area of research into quantum information processing in relativistic spacetimes.
