Following the inaugural meeting AASP had a membership of around 40; it now stands at just over 500. The maximum membership was approximately 1000 in 1987. AASP collaborates with other scientific bodies and has an extensive range of publications. The Association runs a comprehensive and widely-perused website, organises annual meetings, and gives several types of awards to deserving professional and student <b>palynologists.</b> The most ambitious project of the Association was the establishment of The AASP Center for Excellence in Palynology (CENEX) at Louisiana State University.

50|$|Since 1916 and {{the onset}} {{and then the}} {{refinement}} of pollen analytical techniques and a steadily-growing number of pollen diagrams, <b>palynologists</b> {{have concluded that the}} Younger Dryas was a distinct period of vegetational change in large parts of Europe during which vegetation of a warmer climate was replaced by that of a generally-cold climate, a glacial plant succession that often contained Dryas octopetala. The drastic change in vegetation is typically interpreted to be an effect of a sudden decrease in (annual) temperature, unfavorable for the forest vegetation that had been speaking northward rapidly. The cooling not only favored the expansion of cold-tolerant, light-demanding plants and associated steppe fauna but also led to regional glacial advances in Scandinavia and a lowering of the regional snow line.|$|R
40|$|Premise of research. Pollen and spores (sporomorphs) are a {{valuable}} record of plant life and have provided information on subjects {{ranging from the}} nature and timing of evolutionary events {{to the relationship between}} vegetation and climate. However, sporomorphs can be morphologically similar at the species, genus, or family level. Studies of extinct plant groups in pre-Quaternary time often include dispersed sporomorph taxa whose parent plant is known only to the class level. Consequently, sporomorph records of vegetation suffer from limited taxonomic resolution and typically record information about plant life at a taxonomic rank above species. Methodology. In this article, we review the causes of low taxonomic resolution, highlight examples where this has hampered the study of vegetation, and discuss the strategies researchers have developed to overcome the low taxonomic resolution of the sporomorph record. Based on this review, we offer our views on how greater taxonomic precision might be attained in future work. Pivotal results. Low taxonomic resolution results from a combination of several factors, including inadequate reference collections, the absence of sporomorphs in situ in fossilized reproductive structures, and damage following fossilization. A primary cause is the difficulty of accurately describing the very small morphological differences between species using descriptive terminology, which results in <b>palynologists</b> classifying sporomorphs conservatively at the genus or family level to ensure that classifications are reproducible between samples and between researchers. Conclusions. In our view, the most promising approach to the problem of low taxonomic resolution is a combination of high-resolution imaging and computational image analysis. In particular, we encourage <b>palynologists</b> to explore the utility of microscopy techniques that aim to recover morphological information from below the diffraction limit of light and to employ computational image analyses to consistently quantify small morphological differences between species...|$|R
