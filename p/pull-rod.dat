5|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} into Wheldon's death were released on December 15, 2011. In a report prepared by crash investigators, it was found that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the right front pull rod of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause him any injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The <b>pull-rod</b> suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|E
5000|$|The rear used a <b>pull-rod</b> {{suspension}} system {{to keep everything}} compact and as far {{to the rear of}} the car as possible ...|$|E
50|$|The 125 Bronco was a tubular steel/full-duplex-framed, {{base model}} {{motorcycle}} made by Ducati from 1960 to 1966, produced mainly for American distributor Berliner Motor Corporation. It {{was the second}} to last example, before the Ducati 125 Cadet/4, of Ducati pushrod technology which began in 1952 with the pressed-frame Ducati 98 models, which themselves had followed the Cucciolo T3, <b>pull-rod</b> (Ducati 60) and pushrod (60 Sport, 65 Sport, 65T Tourist) design singles.|$|E
50|$|The major {{difference}} {{was in the}} brake rods of which there were two inboard of the wheels. The earlier SO and 562 locomotives had four <b>pull-rods,</b> the outer ones being outside of the wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{brake and}} other pedals are {{independent}} of the frame. Beneath the floor boards there is a hand wheel for primary adjustment of the 4-wheel brakes which have enclosed brake drums. The hand brake operates separate shoes in the rear drums and may be adjusted {{from the top of}} the lever. The rear brakes are operated by a single cable which gives compensation and an even pressure to each rear wheel and the front brakes are operated by <b>pull-rods.</b> Unusually for this period and price range there is a brake servo motor in the bottom of the gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{the first}} Brabham to use Alfa Romeo type 115-12 flat 12-cylinder engine with [...] and 340 Nm of torque. It was {{equipped}} with a Hewland six-speed transmission. It used the front air intakes of the previous Brabham, but by regulation {{no longer has the}} air-brooms behind the cockpit and has side panels with larger air intakes to feed the engine and more radiant surfaces. The frame was an aluminum monocoque, while the braking system was constituted by ventilated disc brakes produced by Girling. The front suspension consisted of double wishbones with <b>pull-rods,</b> coil springs and stabilizer bars, while the rear used coil springs and stabilizer bars.For the [...] season, pending the development of BT46, a C version of the BT45 was created. This model was equipped with a revised radiator.|$|R

5000|$|The {{arrival of}} Harvey Postlethwaite {{led to a}} total {{overhaul}} of the car {{in time for the}} [...] season. The turbo engine was further developed and reliability found, while an all-new chassis and bodywork were designed, featuring Ferrari's first genuine full monocoque chassis with honeycomb aluminum panels for the structure, which made it more similar to its British specialist competitors' cars than the previous year's car had been. Smaller, nimbler and with vastly improved aerodynamics, the 126C2 handled far better than its predecessor. Villeneuve and Didier Pironi posted record times in testing with the new car and began the season with several solid results. At the Long Beach Grand Prix, the car was fitted with an unusual configuration of two thin rear wings, each individually as wide as the regulations allowed, but placed side-by-side and staggered fore and aft, making it effectively a single double-wide wing. This was done as a deliberate exploitation of rule loopholes in retaliation for Williams' [...] "water-cooled brakes" [...] exploit, part of the FISA-FOCA wars, and resulted in disqualification. Then came the infamous race at San Marino after which Villeneuve accused Pironi of having disobeyed team orders. The fallout from the race preceded Villeneuve's death in an horrific accident during qualifying at the next round in Belgium, which left Pironi as team leader. Pironi himself was nearly killed in a similar accident in Germany, putting an end to his motor racing career, but this did not stop Ferrari from winning the constructors' championship that year. The 126C2 was further developed during the season, with new wings and bodywork tried, and the engine's power boosted to [...] in qualifying trim and around [...] in races. An improved chassis was designed and developed mid-season that was introduced for the French Grand Prix that changed the rocker arm front suspension to a more streamlined <b>pull-rod</b> suspension. A thinner longitudinal gearbox was also designed and developed to replace the transverse gearbox to promote better undisturbed airflow from the underside of the ground-effects chassis's side-pods.|$|E
