25|$|CD-4 LPs contain two sub-carriers, one in {{the left}} groove wall and {{one in the}} right groove wall. These sub-carriers use special FM-PM-SSBFM (Frequency Modulation-Phase Modulation-Single Sideband Frequency Modulation) and have signal {{frequencies}} that extend to 45kHz. CD-4 sub-carriers could be played with any type stylus as long as the <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge</b> had CD-4 frequency response. The recommended stylus for CD-4 as well as regular stereo records was a line contact or Shibata type.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, fidelity, {{dynamic and}} noise levels {{improved}} {{to the point}} that it was harder to tell the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version. This was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance magnetic <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge</b> by General Electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well-designed audio systems. The Capehart radio/phonographs of the era with large diameter electrodynamic loudspeakers, though not ideal, demonstrated this quite well with [...] "home recordings" [...] readily available in the music stores for the public to buy.|$|E
5000|$|Modern amplifier-component {{manufacturers}} {{continue to}} label the input jack which accepts the output from a modern magnetic <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge</b> as the [...] "phono" [...] input, abbreviated from [...] "phonograph".|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other types of input {{transducers}} which may be used occasionally, including magnetic pickups used in electric guitars and electric basses, which are plugged first into a DI box {{and then into the}} snake, contact microphones used on stringed instruments, and pianos and phonograph <b>pickups</b> (<b>cartridges)</b> used in record players. As well, some electronic instruments such as synthesizers can have their output signal routed to the mixing console.|$|R
50|$|The {{principles}} of audio feedback were first discovered by Danish scientist SÃ¸ren Absalon Larsen. Microphones {{are not the}} only transducers subject to this effect. Record deck <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridges</b> can do the same, usually in the low frequency range below about 100 Hz, manifesting as a low rumble. Jimi Hendrix helped to develop the controlled and musical use of audio feedback in electric guitar playing, and later Brian May was a famous proponent of the technique.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the {{business}} {{moved to a}} bigger facility and expanded its engineering efforts. In 1948, they began successfully producing phonograph <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridges.</b> In 1950, they started production of the first automatic TV booster, which sold in great quantities. They also started to design and produce a consumer loudspeaker line, a timely move for {{the advent of the}} Hi-Fi boom. The Compound Diffraction Horn invention, changed the look and performance the traditional cone-shaped paging horn. Known for its high output, the CDP was deployed by the Navy for carrier and other high noise environments.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} this case usually {{does not happen}} because the <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge,</b> an inductive voltage source, need have no connection to the turntable metalwork, and so the signal ground is isolated from the chassis or protective ground at that end of the link. Therefore there is no current loop, and no hum problem due directly to the grounding arrangements.|$|E
50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge</b> over the groove, the stylus {{tracking}} the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and record groove. At its simplest, a tone arm is a pivoted lever, free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|E

50|$|An {{audio signal}} is a {{representation}} of sound, typically as an electrical voltage. Audio signals have frequencies in the audio frequency range of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz (the limits of human hearing). Audio signals may be synthesized directly, or may originate at a transducer such as a microphone, musical instrument <b>pickup,</b> phonograph <b>cartridge,</b> or tape head. Loudspeakers or headphones convert an electrical audio signal into sound. Digital representations of audio signals exist {{in a variety of}} formats.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the crystal}} and ceramic <b>pickups,</b> the {{magnetic}} <b>cartridge</b> usually gives improved playback fidelity and reduced record wear by tracking the groove with lighter pressure. Magnetic cartridges use lower tracking forces and thus reduce {{the potential for}} groove damage. They also have a lower output voltage than a crystal or ceramic pickup, {{in the range of}} only a few millivolts, thus requiring greater amplification.|$|R
5000|$|In 1930, two amateur radio operators, Creed M. Chorpening, W8WR (later W8MJM) and F.H. Woodworth, W8AHW began {{experimenting with}} {{different}} types of microphones for their [...] "ham' stations. Their mutual friend, Charles Semple, worked for Brush Development Company {{where he had been}} experimenting with Rochelle salt crystals. Semple demonstrated some crystal pick-ups that Brush was working with, leading Chorpening and Woodworth to found The Astatic Microphone Laboratory, Inc. in Youngstown, Ohio in 1933. Semple was brought into the company as general manager to manufacture and market the company's model D-104 Crystal Microphone as well as other crystal microphones, crystal phonograph pickups and recording heads. In 1944, Astatic moved operations to Conneaut, Ohio and supplied microphones, <b>pickups</b> and crystal <b>cartridges</b> as well as hydrophone and Sonar devices to the military during World War II.|$|R

5000|$|If, for example, a {{domestic}} HiFi system has a grounded turntable and a grounded preamplifier {{connected by a}} thin screened cable (or cables, in a stereo system) using phono connectors, the cross-section of copper in the cable screen(s) {{is likely to be}} less than that of the protective ground conductors for the turntable and the preamplifier. So, when a current is induced in the loop, there will be a voltage drop along the signal ground return. This is directly additive to the wanted signal, and will result in objectionable hum. For instance, if a current [...] of 1mA at the local power frequency is induced in the ground loop, and the resistance [...] of the screen of the signal cable is 100 milliohms, the voltage drop will be [...] = 100 microvolts. This is a significant fraction of the output voltage of a moving coil <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and a truly objectionable hum will result.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the 33 rpm vinyl LP [...] "album" [...] in 1948 and the 45 rpm vinyl [...] "single" [...] in 1949 prompted consumers to upgrade to a new multi-speed record player with the required smaller-tipped [...] "microgroove" [...] stylus. Sapphire and diamond then became the standard stylus tip materials. At first, the new styli came installed in smaller, lighter piezoelectric crystal or ceramic cartridges of the general type found in inexpensive self-contained portable record players throughout the vinyl era. Ceramic cartridges continue {{to be used in}} most of the [...] "retro" [...] and compact record players currently being made, in part because they are comparatively robust and resistant to damage from careless handling, but mostly because they are inexpensive. However, during the 1950s, a new generation of small, lightweight, highly compliant magnetic cartridges appeared and quickly found favor among high-fidelity enthusiasts because of their audibly superior performance. The high compliance also reduced record wear. They soon became standard in all but the cheapest component audio systems and are {{the most common type of}} <b>pickup</b> <b>cartridge</b> in use today.|$|E
