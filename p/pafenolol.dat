40|$|The rat {{isolated}} right atrium (frequency response) and progesterone-treated rat uterus (relaxation) {{were used}} to examine the beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulatory effects of alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol. In addition, the beta 1 -adrenoceptor stimulatory effect of practolol was studied in the right atrium. All the compounds studied caused a concentration-dependent increase in atrial frequency and relaxation of the uterus. The atrial response to pindolol was competitively inhibited by the beta 1 -selective blocker <b>pafenolol</b> (10 (- 7) M), while the beta 2 -selective blocker ICI 118551 (10 (- 8) M) was without effect. <b>Pafenolol</b> (10 (- 7) M) was also shown to inhibit the atrial frequency effect of alprenolol and oxprenolol. In the uterus, ICI 118551 (3 X 10 (- 9) M, 3 X 10 (- 8) M, 3 X 10 (- 7) M) blocked the pindolol effect with a pKB of 9. 28. In addition, ICI 118551 (10 (- 8) M) competitively inhibited the relaxation of the uterus induced by alprenolol and oxprenolol. For alprenolol (right atrium and uterus), oxprenolol (right atrium), and pindolol (right atrium), the concentrations needed for half-maximal response were significantly greater than those required for occupation of half the receptors. This dissociation was most pronounced for pindolol in the right atrium. In this tissue, 80 - 85 % of the beta 1 -adrenoceptors had to be occupied by pindolol to initiate a tissue response corresponding to 50 % of the maximal effect generated by the compound. The intrinsic activities of alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol (expressed as % of the maximal tissue response to isoprenaline) were significantly higher in the uterus than in the right atrium.
