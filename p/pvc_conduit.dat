50|$|<b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> {{has long}} been {{considered}} the lightest in weight compared to steel conduit materials, and usually lower in cost than other forms of conduit. In North American electrical practice, it is available in three different wall thicknesses, with the thin-wall variety only suitable for embedded use in concrete, and heavier grades suitable for direct burial and exposed work. Most of the various fittings made for metal conduit are also available in PVC form. The plastic material resists moisture and many corrosive substances, but since the tubing is non-conductive an extra bonding (grounding) conductor must be pulled into each conduit. <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> may be heated and bent in the field, by using special heating tools designed for the purpose.|$|E
50|$|SAA is {{typically}} installed in 1” (26 mm ID) <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> which is grouted within a borehole. The {{flexibility of the}} SAA joints enables it to bend up to 90° and withstand large deformations. Data can be sent wirelessly to a server for automated processing and to enable remote data analysis in real-time. Data can also be periodically downloaded using a PC for analysis. Millimeter level precision can be achieved using this sensor.|$|E
5000|$|In {{commercial}} and industrial, unenclosed NM cable is often prohibited {{in certain areas}} or altogether (depending on what the building is used for and local/state building codes). Therefore, it is almost never used by commercial electrical contractors. Most wiring is put in non-flexible conduit, usually EMT because of its cost and durability. Rigid may be required for certain areas and additionally, vapor-lock fittings may be required in areas where a fire or explosion hazard is present (such as gas stations, chemical factories, grain silos, etc.) PVC can be used where wire is run underground or where concrete will be poured. A duct bank is usually made of multiple <b>PVC</b> <b>conduits</b> encased in concrete. FMC or Flex is used where EMT or other non-flexible conduit is impractical or for short runs, known as [...] "whips", to lights or other devices. For power circuits, the color-coding uses the same colors as residential construction, and adds the additional wires used for three-phase systems. Black, Red and Blue are used for hot wires and White is used as the neutral wire in a 120/208 V circuit. Brown, Orange and Yellow are used as hot wires and gray is used as the neutral wire in a 277/480 V. For grounding, regardless of the voltage, Green is used.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were performed}} to study the turbulent mixing of a scalar species in straight tube, single and double elbow flow configurations. Different Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models were used to model the turbulence in the flow. Conventional and dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale models {{were used for the}} LES simulations. Wall functions were used to resolve the near wall boundary layer. These simulations were run with both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries. The velocity and tracer gas concentration Coefficient of Variations were compared with experimental results. The results from the LES simulations compared better with experimental results than the results from the RANS simulations. The level of mixing downstream of a S-shaped double elbow was higher than either the single elbow or the U-shaped double elbow due to the presence of counter rotating vortices. Penetration of neutralized and non-neutralized aerosol particles through three different types of tubing was studied. The tubing used included standard <b>PVC</b> pipes, aluminum <b>conduit</b> and flexible vacuum hose. Penetration through the aluminum conduit was unaffected by {{the presence or absence of}} charge neutralization, whereas particle penetrations through the PVC pipe and the flexible hosing were affected by the amount of particle charge. The electric field in a space enclosed by a solid conductor is zero. Therefore charged particles within the conducting aluminum conduit do not experience any force due to ambient electric fields, whereas the charged particles within the non-conducting PVC pipe and flexible hose experience forces due to the ambient electric fields. This increases the deposition of charged particles compared to neutralized particles within the 1. 5 ?????? PVC tube and 1. 5 ?????? flexible hose. Deposition 2001 a (McFarland et al. 2001) software was used to predict the penetration through transport lines. The prediction from the software compared well with experiments for all cases except when charged particles were transported through non-conducting materials. A Stairmand cyclone was designed for filtering out large particles at the entrance of the transport section...|$|R

Apart from this, there are shell and wood based handicraft units. There are also four medium-sized industrial units. SSI units are engaged in the production of polythene bags, <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> pipes and fittings, paints and varnished, fibre glass and mini flour mills, soft drinks and beverages, etc. Small scale and handicraft units are also engaged in shell crafts, bakery products, rice milling, furniture making, etc.|$|E
50|$|Joints to {{fittings}} {{are made}} with slip-on solvent-welded connections, which set up rapidly after assembly and attain full strength in about one day. Since slip-fit sections {{do not need to}} be rotated during assembly, the special union fittings used with threaded conduit (such as Ericson) are not required. Since <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than other types, it must be mounted to allow for expansion and contraction of each run. Care should be taken when installing PVC underground in multiple or parallel run configurations due to mutual heating effect of densely packed cables, because the conduit will deform when heated.|$|E
50|$|To {{maximise}} {{and create}} the effect thin, flexible, white props are used, although variations on size and colour offer a different effect. White props allow the greatest reflection of projected light, and when the prop repeatedly intercepts the light beam at high speed the flexibility and thinness of the prop give the illusion that a whole image can be seen (if the prop were to stop you'd only see {{a section of the}} image). Ropes, bungee chords, staffs, <b>pvc</b> <b>conduit</b> and the edges of handheld fans have been used publicly, although a number of props have been used in theatre laboratory. Ideally the flexibility will become more apparent when the prop is manipulated for example: the curve of a rope when it is spun.|$|E

In that direction, new polyurethane-based composites have been developed by incorporating 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> discarded by the construction industry. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the interaction between the phases of waste incorporation and the effect upon the new material properties. The samples were produced by the polycondensation process. Microstructural analysis revealed a reduction in pore size across the polymer matrix. However, there were no changes in thermal insulation, water absorption, compressive strength, and burning rate tests and in the thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The results from this study showed that the replacement of raw material by waste did not affect its properties...|$|E
40|$|Root growth {{patterns}} of Glycine javanica, Setaria anceps, and Medicago sativa were studied by uptake of 32 P from a sandy loam. Placement of isotope was through permanently positioned <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> on a grid over a 90 ¦ quadrant {{of the root}} system. Detection of radioactivity was in in situ plant material. Lucerne had strong initial root development but was slow to form lateral roots. Glycine and Setaria had quite similar root systems although Setaria had more rapid vertical root development than Glycine. Both these species had strong lateral root systems. When a regression of minimum root length against time was calculated, lateral root growth was shown to be independent of depth and distance from the plant, suggesting that roots behave as if growing from a point source in random directions at a constant rate. This rate was {{the same for all}} species. There were also indications of strong vertical root systems in lucerne and Setaria...|$|E
40|$|Inductance loops play a {{major role}} in vehicle {{detection}} systems that provide data for use in traffic-actuated signal control and other surveillance systems. Considering the wide variety of vehicles on the road today, it has become increasingly important to find a loop configuration that can accurately detect oddsized vehicles. Odd-sized vehicles include motorcycles, mopeds, bicycles, and high-profile trucks. This loop type should also be easy to install and maintenance-free. Surface loops are typically used, and many loop configurations have been developed for detecting different vehicle types. More recently, deep-buried loops have been developed. Deep-buried loops are located below the pavement surface. They remain undamaged by pavement movements, traffic flow, and construction equipment. The detection ability of these loops, however, is questionable for many vehicle types. Modern practice for wire in a slot, wire in a protective jacket, and wire in a <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> requires complete encapsulation of the loop wire. Many professionals believe that water around a loop wire has an adverse effect on a loop’s detection accuracy. Therefore, it is desirable to determine what effect, if any...|$|E

Uma vez que, para cada 100 L de biodiesel sÃo produzidos 10 kg de glicerina bruta, isto implica o desenvolvimento de estudos para o aproveitamento economicamente viÃvel da glicerina. O objetivo principal deste trabalho foi avaliar a adiÃÃo de glicerina bruta na digestÃo anaerÃbia de efluente de fecularia, em reator de fluxo semi-contÃnuo horizontal de uma fase, em escala de laboratÃrio. Foi utilizado reator com volume Ãtil de 8, 77 L, com meio suporte em conduÃtes de PVC, temperatura de 26 Â 1 Â C, alimentado com manipueira e glicerina, com tempos de detenÃÃo hidrÃulica de 4 e 5 d e cargas orgÃnicas de 3, 05, 9, 32, 14, 83 e 13, 59 g DQO L- 1 d- 1, nesta ordem, obtidas com a adiÃÃo de glicerina aos nÃveis de 0, 2, 3 e 2 %, respectivamente. A produÃÃo de biogÃs por volume de reator aumentou com a adiÃÃo de 2 % de glicerina em relaÃÃo ao tratamento controle. PorÃm, nos tratamentos seguintes, a produÃÃo de biogÃs diminuiu com o aumento da carga orgÃnica. A maior produÃÃo mÃdia de biogÃs por volume de reator foi de 1, 979 L biogÃs L- 1 d- 1, para a carga de 9, 32 g DQO L- 1 d- 1. As maiores produÃÃes mÃdias de biogÃs por g DQO e g STV consumidos foram de 0, 397 e 0, 661 L, para o tratamento controle, sem adiÃÃo de glicerina. A maior remoÃÃo de DQO, 98, 69 %, ocorreu para o tratamento com 2 % de glicerina e carga de 9, 32 g DQO L- 1 d- 1, seguida de 96, 41 % para o tratamento controle. As maiores remoÃÃes de ST e STV ocorreram para o tratamento controle, para o tratamento com 2 % de glicerina e carga de 9, 32 g DQO L- 1 d- 1, na ordem de 81, 19 e 75, 47 % de ST e 90, 21 e 81, 18 % de STV para os respectivos tratamentos. Assim, o reator avaliado neste trabalho pode ser utilizado para o tratamento de efluente de fecularia com adiÃÃo de glicerina bruta como forma de dar destinaÃÃo correta a essa Ãltima, sem a utilizaÃÃo de neutralizantes e nutrientes. The National Biodiesel Production and its Application Program, {{created by}} the Federal Government, introduces biodiesel in the Brazilian energetic matrix, bringing along the perspective to improve glycerin offer, a co-product of biodiesel production. Since for each 100 L of biodiesel, 10 kg of raw glycerin are produced, this implies {{on the development of}} studies for an economically viable use of glycerin. So, the main objective of this paper was to evaluate the addition of raw glycerin in anaerobic digestion of cassava starch production wastewater, in a semi-continuous-flux reactor of one-phase in bench scale. A 8. 77 L reactor, with useful volume, was used, with <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> as a support medium, temperature of 26 Â 1 Â C, supplied with cassava starch production wastewater and glycerin, with hydraulic detention times of 4 and 5 d and organic loads of 3. 05, 9. 32, 14. 83 e 13. 59 g COD L- 1 d- 1, in this order, obtained with the addiction of glycerin at 0, 2, 3 and 2 %, respectively. The biogas production per reactor volume increased with the 2 % glycerin addiction with regard to the control treatment. However, in the next treatments, biogas production decreased when organic load increased. The major average biogas production per reactor volume was 1. 979 L biogas L- 1 d- 1, for the organic load of 9. 32 g COD L- 1 d- 1. The major averages of biogas production per g COD and g TVS consumed were 0. 397 and 0. 661 L, for the control treatment, without glycerin addition. The best COD removal, 98. 69 %, occurred for 2 % glycerin treatment and 9. 32 g COD L- 1 d- 1 organic load, followed by 96. 41 % for the control treatment. The major removal of TS and TVS occurred for the control treatment, for 2 % glycerin treatment and organic load of 9. 32 g COD L- 1 d- 1, by 81. 19 and 75. 47 % TS and 90. 21 and 81. 18 % TVS for the respective treatments. Thus, the evaluated reactor in this trial can be used for the treatment of cassava starch production wastewater with crude glycerin addition as a way of giving a correct destination to the last one, without using neutralizers and nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Reagent {{injections}} {{designed to}} provide in stiu mass destruction of soil and groundwater contaminants are commonly prone to failure due to inadequate distribution of the injected reagent. Reagent injections, in particular in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) injections, require contact between the treatment reagent and targeted contaminant to allow for mass destruction in source zones and plumes. Subsurface heterogeneities that exist at all spatial scales prevent remediation specialists from accurate prediction of reagent distribution in the subsurface, even when significant site characterization and hydraulic testing has previously taken place. A prototype probe system was developed to provide real-time monitoring {{of the distribution of}} injected reagents. This thesis focused on laboratory testing of the system to verify that the design was capable of indicating the presence of an injected reagent in the field. Temperature and two-wire dipole resistance sensors were developed with low-cost materials to provide feedback on the electrical conductivity (EC) signatures produced by typical reagents mixed as salt solutions. Sensors were attached to sections of <b>PVC</b> <b>conduit</b> and wired to a data acquisition system to control measurements and store data. The temperature sensor was found to accurately respond to temperature changes in comparison to a commercial datalogger. Measured temperature differences between the constructed sensor and commercial datalogger were relatively constant, indicating that the constructed sensor could be calibrated to measurements from a commercial logger. Static cell experiments were conducted in beakers with varying concentration sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) and sodium persulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 8) solutions to determine dipole resistance sensor response to variations in EC. Different fixed resistors were wired with the dipole sensor circuit to determine the impact on sensor readings. Results indicated a nonlinear correlation between two-wire dipole resistance sensor response and increasing EC. Each constructed dipole sensor behaved uniquely. Raw sensor response was calibrated to EC by accounting for the influence of the fixed resistor. Data was fit to a second-order polynomial with form y = aEC 2 + bEC + c, with r 2 ranging from 0. 92 - 1. 00 for experiments with 4 - 6 measurement points. Calibrations were accurate within the range of EC for each static cell experiment; trends extrapolated beyond the measurement range were subject to significant error. The choice of fixed resistor did not appear to alter the accuracy of probe calibrations. Flow cell experiments were designed to analyze dipole resistance sensor response to continuous changes in EC. EC breakthrough curves (BTCs) were produced by injecting NaCl tracer solutions into the flow cell. Initial flow cell experiments conducted in an open water system showed agreement between dipole sensor measurement and handheld EC measurements on the rising limb of BTCs and divergence between the two datasets on the falling limb of BTCs. To resolve these issues, a more sophisticated tank with a porous medium was built and tested to compare sensor response from s prototype probe and a commercial EC datalogger. EC BTCs were measured under two scenarios: (1) conditions with deionized water (DI) circulating through the tank as the background solution, and (2) conditions with a simulated groundwater solution with elevated EC circulating through the tank as the background solution. BTCs produced agreement between EC recorded by the commercial logger and dipole resistance measurements for both the rising and falling limbs of BTCs. Results indicated the dipole resistance sensor was not capable of resolving fine changes in EC that occurred during breakthrough. A calibration of all in situ measurements from the experiments with porous medium confirmed the simulated groundwater experiments were subject to significantly less variability than the deionized water experiments. The calibration applied to the simulated groundwater measurements produced BTCs that matched very closely with those recorded by the commercial logger. Two field trials were also conducted during ISCO injections at contaminated sites where probes were installed in existing monitoring wells. The field trials did not successfully correlate dipole resistance sensor measurements with oxidant concentration. Observations from the second trial indicated the dipole sensor measurements correlated with EC of water samples. This work has provided a theoretical representation of two-wire dipole resistance sensor response to EC and has verified expected results through laboratory experiments. It has analyzed the influence of temperature and choice of fixed resistors on two-wire dipole resistance sensor readings, has extensively tested sensor response to EC during static cell and BTC experiments, and has displayed the prototype probe is capable of indicating the presence of injected reagents that have an EC signature. Further research avenues include pilot-scale testing in the field and developing a design for use with a direct-push rig...|$|E
