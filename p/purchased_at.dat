5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of upkeep. By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up. Blacklight reactant paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes.

After the announcement, each school sold its allotment of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were <b>purchased</b> <b>at</b> a rapid pace. ACC officials and Charlotte boosters each said they {{were satisfied with the}} pace and quantity of ticket sales.|$|E

5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each earring on a child had to be <b>purchased</b> <b>at</b> an expensive potlatch. Earrings were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in their ears.|$|E

The day that Enron {{filed for bankruptcy}}, the employees were told to pack their belongings and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building.
