5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the <b>plant</b> <b>material.</b> Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other species}} of the family Cotingidae, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves {{rather than in the}} trees. The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and <b>plant</b> <b>material,</b> which is {{attached}} by saliva to a vertical rock. The male does not participate in the building of the nest or the incubation of the eggs. Eggs typically incubate for 27–28 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins.|$|E

40|$|Cultural {{practices}} {{can affect}} the quality of pineapple fruits and its variation. The objectives of this study were to investigate (a) effects of weight class and type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> on fruit quality, heterogeneity in quality and proportion and yield of fruits meeting European export standards, and (b) the improvement in quality, proportion and yield of fruits meeting export standards when flowering was induced at optimum time. Experiments were conducted in Benin with cvs Sugarloaf (a Perola type) and Smooth Cayenne. In cv. Sugarloaf, experimental factors were weight class of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> (light, mixed, heavy) and time of flowering induction (farmers', optimum) (Experiment 1). In cv. Smooth Cayenne an additional experimental factor was the type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> (hapas, ground suckers, a mixture of the two) (Experiment 2). Fruits from heavy <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> had higher infructescence and fruit weights, longer infructescences, shorter crowns, and smaller crown: infructescence length than fruits from light <b>planting</b> <b>material.</b> The type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> in Experiment 2 did not significantly affect fruit quality except crown length: fruits from hapas had shorter crowns than those from ground suckers. Crops from heavy <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> had a higher proportion and yield of fruits meeting export standards than those from other weight classes in Experiment 1 only; also the type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> in Experiment 2 did not affect these variates. Heterogeneity in fruit quality was usually not reduced by selecting only light or heavy <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> instead of mixing weights; incidentally the coefficient of variation was significantly reduced in fruits from heavy slips only. Heterogeneity was also not reduced by not mixing hapas and ground suckers. Flowering induction at optimum time increased the proportion and yield of fruits meeting export standards in fruits from light and mixed slip weights and in those from the mixture of heavy hapas plus ground suckers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} sweetpotato seed systems was {{conducted}} in Mukono, Kamuli, Bukedea and Soroti districts in Uganda, and in Mwanza, Shinyanga and Meatu regions in the Lake Zone of Tanzania during 2007 – 2011. It aimed at developing simple, affordable and applicable technologies for conserving and multiplying sweetpotato <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> for early season planting after the long dry season. The study sought to understand and describe farmers’ existing approaches, improve on rapid multiplication techniques and develop rational use of available <b>planting</b> <b>material.</b> Complete lack of or insufficient <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> for early <b>planting</b> immediately following the long dry season was reported. Farmers recognised that obtaining <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> early was beneficial as it resulted in increased root yield, an early source of food and sales at high prices. The Triple S (Sand, Storage and Sprouting) method of producing ample <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> for early season planting was developed in Uganda after testing various ways of storing the roots {{during the dry season}} so as to eliminate dry season mortality. Using roots obtained from crops planted in the conventional time and planting them out in watered gardens 1 - 2 mths before the rains to act as sources of sprouts for vine cuttings was the most appropriate. The method was validated in Tanzania which has a longer dry season. The use of 20 cm cuttings instead of the mini cuttings (10 cm) in rapid multiplication of vines needed less labour and care. Pre-planting fertiliser (NPK: 25 : 5 : 5) doubled the quantity of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> generated, and <b>planting</b> shorter and fewer cuttings than recommended saved <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> to enable more extensive plant coverage and doubled potential production. All these findings greatly contribute to the improvement of the conservation and multiplication of <b>planting</b> <b>material,</b> especially to improving the availability of early <b>planting</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R

40|$|The current {{fight against}} Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{has focused on}} promoting biofortified staples that are rich in beta carotene, such as Orange Fleshed Sweetpotato (OFSP). These efforts usually entail providing quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> to vulnerable households accompanied by sensitization {{about the benefits of}} OFSP. Most such interventions heavily subsidize the <b>planting</b> <b>materials,</b> with subsidies ranging from 50 - 100 %. The subsidies are often premised on the hope that farmers will eventually absorb the full cost of the <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> once they experience the benefits of consuming OFSP. This study uses data from 481 farmers drawn from different regions that benefited from a sweetpotato project, and the ANOVA and descriptive statistics, to examine farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for OFSP <b>planting</b> <b>materials.</b> It specifically compares the WTP for quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of OFSP and non-OFSP varieties and assesses differences in WTP by region and agroecology. It finds a higher WTP for clean <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of a non-OFSP variety than for all OFSP varieties studied. It also finds that WTP differs by region and agroecology. The study concludes that there is higher demand for quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of some of the non-OFSP varieties of sweetpotato than for OFSP varieties, and that WTP for differs by intervention area. These findings imply that farmers’ demand for clean <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of non-OFSP varieties is higher than for the OFSP varieties. They suggest the need for sweetpotato breeding to continue considering some of the attributes that make local varieties popular, e. g., taste and dry matter content, in their breeding programs...|$|R
