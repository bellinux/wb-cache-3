40|$|Thermodynamic {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} assess the energy efficiency of hybrid desalination cycles that are driven by simultaneous mixed inputs, including heat, electrical work, and chemical energy. A seawater desalination cycle using work and a chemical input stream is analyzed using seawater properties. Two system models, a reversible separator and an irreversible component based model, are developed to find the least work required to operate the system with and without osmotic recovery. The component based model represents a proposed desalination system which uses a reverse osmosis membrane for solute separation, a pressure exchanger for recovering {{a fraction of the}} flow work associated with the <b>pressurized</b> <b>discharge</b> brine, and a forward osmosis (FO) module for recovering some of the chemical energy contained within the concentrated discharge brine. The energy attained by the addition of the chemical input stream serves to lower the amount of electrical work required for operation. For this analysis, a wastewater stream of varying solute concentration, ranging from feed to brackish water salinity, is considered as the chemical stream. Unlike other models available in the literature, the FO exchanger is numerically simulated as a mass exchanger of given size which accounts for changing stream concentration, and consequently, stream-wise variations of osmotic pressure throughout the length of the unit. A parametric study is performed on the models by varying input conditions. For the reversible case it is found that significant work reductions can be made through the use of an energy recovery device when the inlet wastewater salinity used is less than the feed salinity of 35 g/kg. For the irreversible case with a typical recovery ratio and feed salinity, significant work reductions were only noted for a wastewater inlet of {{less than half of the}} feed salinity due to pump work losses. In the irreversible case, the use of a numerical model to simulate the FO exchanger resulted in a maximum work reduction when the pressure difference between streams was around one half of the osmotic pressure difference as opposed to the precise value of one half found in zero-dimensional exchanger models.

A seal test rig designed at Heriot-Watt University and commissioned at Weir Pumps Research Laboratory in Alloa permits the identification of mass, stiffness, and damping coefficients using a least-squares technique based on the singular value decomposition method.

The blown channel CCW includes a channel {{that has a}} rounded or near-round trailing edge. The channel further has a trailing-edge slot that is adjacent to the rounded trailing edge of the channel. The trailing-edge slot has an inlet connected to a source of pressurized air and is capable of tangentially <b>discharging</b> <b>pressurized</b> air over the rounded trailing edge. The aircraft further has a propeller that {{is located in the}} channel and ahead of the rounded trailing edge of the channel. The propeller provides a propeller thrust exhaust stream across the channel wing to propel the aircraft through the air and to provide high lift.

In this paper the influence of pressurized liquid nitrogen on the discharge voltage is observed. Therefore, a cryostat was used, that can be <b>pressurized</b> and the <b>discharge</b> voltages at 3 barabs and 5 barabs were investigated.

Three different flow regimes are experienced: a “weir flow” for low head values, where an air–water mixture at the atmospheric pressure can be observed; a “pressurized flow” for high head values, where water flows in a pressurized regime along the shaft; a “transitional flow” for intermediate water head values, consisting of a continuous, spontaneous switch between weir flow and pressurized flow with consequent water head variation for a fixed <b>discharge.</b> <b>Pressurized</b> flow regime is analytically explained, so that a head–discharge relation can be provided both for the non-vented and for the vented configurations, with specific assumptions about intake losses...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{engineered}} {{safety systems}} in the advanced boiling water reactor is a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) which is composed {{of a number of}} vertical heat exchanger. After a loss of coolant accident, the <b>pressurized</b> steam <b>discharged</b> from the reactor and the noncondensable (NC) gases mixture flows into the PCCS condenser tube. The PCCS condenser must be able to remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure. The efficient performance of the PCCS condenser is thus vital to the safety of the reactor. In PCCS condenser tube three flow conditions are expected namely the forced flow, cyclic venting and complete condensation modes. The PCCS test facility consists of steam generator (SG), instrumented condenser with secondary pool boiling section, condensation tank, suppression pool, storage tank, air supply line, and associated piping and instrumentation [...] The specific design of condensing tube is based on scaling analysis from the PCCS design of ESBWR. The scaled PCCS is made of four tubes of diameter 52. 5 mm and height 1. 8 m arranged in square pitch. Steam air mixture condensation tests were carried out in a through flow mode of operation where the mixture flows through the condenser tube with some steam condensation. Data on condensation heat transfer were obtained for two nominal pressures, 225 kPa and 275 kPa and for air concentration fraction from 0 to 13 %. Test results showed that with increase in pressure the condensation heat transfer increased. The presence of the air in the steam decreased the condensation heat transfer coefficient from 10 to 45 % depending on air fraction in the steam...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{technology}} disclosure {{presents a}} concept for a monopropellant thermal spacecraft thruster that would feature both {{the simplicity of}} a typical prior pressure-fed propellant supply system and the smaller mass and relative compactness of a typical prior pump-fed system. The source of heat for this thruster would likely be a nuclear- fission reactor. The propellant would be a cryogenic fluid (a liquefied low-molecular-weight gas) stored in a tank at a low pressure. The propellant would flow from the tank, through a feedline, into three thick-walled spherical tanks, denoted pressure balls, that would be thermally connected to the reactor. Valves upstream and downstream of the pressure balls would be operated in a three-phase cycle in which propellant would flow into one pressure ball while the fluid underwent pressurization through heating in another ball and <b>pressurized</b> propellant was <b>discharged</b> from the remaining ball into the reactor. After flowing through the reactor, wherein it would be further heated, the propellant would be discharged through an exhaust nozzle to generate thrust. A fraction of the pressurized gas from the pressure balls would be diverted to maintain the desired pressure in the tank...|$|R
40|$|High speed {{separators}} from Alfa Laval {{are widely}} in use for processing flammable and non-flammable liquids. The following work {{is focusing on}} the case of non-flammable liquid as the process liquid in case the working area around the equipment may contain quantities of explosive gases. As stated by Alfa Laval documentation, the major risk is leaking of the explosive atmosphere into the separator from the surrounding environment which may result in producing zone 1 or zone 2 of hazardous area classification. Zone 1 : Area in which an explosive gas-air mixture is likely to occur for short periods in normal operation. 1 Zone 2 : Area in which an explosive gas-air mixture is not likely to occur, and if it occurs it will only exist for a very short time due to an abnormal condition. 1 According to Alfa Laval design package, there is a need of continuous inert gas injection into the separator during the process {{in order to reduce the}} oxygen concentration and keep it in the safe level (inert gas purging) and this policy is aimed to meet the requirements of ATEX-directive 94 / 9 /EC/ 2003. The objective of the current thesis is a wish to have a better understanding of the potential risks, evaluating them and try to find ways to ease the process. The outcome can be useful to make a basic instruction for further tests and simplifications as well. The separator GTN 50 is selected and hydrogen (1 % concentration) is used to simulate the explosive atmosphere. The result of the tests indicates that the cooling down stage after normal operation is the only period in which hydrogen will leak into the separator, frame top part and it should be cleaned up before the next start up.
