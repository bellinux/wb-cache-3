During his tenure in the House, which lasted five terms, he was the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Militia.

He also opposed restrictions on slavery in Missouri and the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the <b>preemption</b> right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we compare the {{occurrence}} of <b>preemptions</b> under the rate monotonic (RM) and earliest deadline (ED) policies at a single server. It is shown {{that the number of}} <b>preemptions</b> at the server using RM is always larger than or equal to the number of <b>preemptions</b> that would be obtained if ED was used. A quantitative characterization of this difference is provided by simulating the service provided to an avionics task-set and an inertial navigation system task-set. We observe that for the avionics task-set, for some initial phasings, the number of <b>preemptions</b> at a processor using RM can be over 20 % greater than the number of <b>preemptions</b> obtained when ED is used. 1 Introduction The problem of CPU scheduling in real-time systems is an intriguing one and several different factors must be weighed before arriving at a suitable discipline. The most frequently studied scheduling algorithms are deadline-based dynamic algorithms and rate-based static algorithms. Of these, the earlies [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Known {{algorithms}} {{capable of}} scheduling implicit-deadline sporadic tasks over identical processors {{at up to}} 100 % utilisation invariably involve numerous <b>preemptions</b> and migrations. To the challenge of devising a scheduling scheme with as few <b>preemptions</b> and migrations as possible, for a given guaranteed utilisation bound, we respond with the algorithm NPS-F. It is configurable with a parameter, trading off guaranteed schedulable utilisation (up to 100 %) vs <b>preemptions.</b> For any possible configuration, NPS-F introduces fewer <b>preemptions</b> than any other known algorithm matching its utilisation bound. A clustered variant of the algorithm, for systems made of multicore chips, eliminates (costly) off-chip task migrations, by dividing processors into disjoint clusters, formed by cores on the same chip (with the cluster size being a parameter). Clusters are independently scheduled (each, using non-clustered NPS-F). The utilisation bound is only moderately affected. We also formulate an important extension (applicable to both clustered and non-clustered NPS-F) which optimises the supply of processing time to executing tasks and makes it more granular. This reduces processing capacity requirements for schedulability without increasing <b>preemptions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Some level {{crossings}} that are located close to intersections with traffic lights program the signals with a <b>preemption</b> sequence {{so when the}} approaching train trips the track circuit, it not only activates the crossing signals, but also changes the traffic lights facing the crossing to green, to clear any traffic that may be queued on the crossing. If the intersection's stop line is right before the tracks (typically sharing the crossing's stop line), the track circuits would change the traffic lights to red (often without a yellow phase).
