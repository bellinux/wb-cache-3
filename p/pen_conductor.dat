50|$|TN−C−S: Part of {{the system}} uses a {{combined}} <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor,</b> which is at some point split up into separate PE and N lines. The combined <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor</b> typically occurs between the substation and the entry point into the building, and earth and neutral are separated in the service head. In the UK, this system {{is also known as}} protective multiple earthing (PME), because of the practice of connecting the combined neutral-and-earth conductor to real earth at many locations, {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock in the event of a broken <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor.</b> Similar systems in Australia and New Zealand are designated as multiple earthed neutral (MEN) and, in North America, as multi-grounded neutral (MGN).|$|E

5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor,</b> then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of concentric cable construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyze {{earthing}} systems for houses. By practical measurements and theoretical analyzes consequences of possible faults, that can occur within the facility and in the low-voltage distribution network, is illustrated.    The reason for this project is that nowadays one has to arrange with a main equipotential bonding system for buildings. Apart from that, if necessary, bathrooms must be provided with a supplementary equipotential bonding system. The practical measurements verify that potential differences in facilities {{may be due to}} voltage drops in the <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor</b> between the origin of the electrical installation and the power transformer. Based on the theoretical analyzes of possible faults, it is considered that the requirement for  supplementary equipotential bonding systems for bathrooms in most cases can be questioned, when basic insulation, fault protection, residual current devise and main equipotential bonding system already provides an adequate level of protection. A <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor</b> loss may result in a situation where metallic parts attached to the equipotential bonding system starts working as earth electrodes. Equipotential bonding system may also increase the incidence of stray currents. If TN-C-S systems is provided with a local connection to earth a redundant system against <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor</b> loss is obtained. That is not the case for neutral conductor loss in TN-S systems with a local connection to earth. If district heating pipes is supplied with insulated flanges it prevents stray currents and foreign potential to be spread in the district heating network...|$|E
40|$|In {{electric}} power supply systems, an earthing system determines the electric potential of the conductors related {{to that of the}} Earth’s surface. The choice of earthing system has implications {{for the safety of the}} power supply systems. There are considerably different regulations for earthing (grounding) systems in each country. A protective earth(PE) conductor ensures that all exposed conductive surfaces are at the same electric potential as the earth surface. This paper deals with that when <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor</b> of TN-C-S system is disconnected, dangerous touch voltage causes personnel body to be harmed and human being’s property to be damaged seriously. For this reason, this paper explains how serious problems can occur when the fault current flows. As a consequence, we can understand how we can design earthing system properly to ensure the personnel safety against eart...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the issue of an {{unbalanced}} power load of a three-phase main load and the associated network load of a <b>PEN</b> <b>conductor.</b> The introduction discusses the various types of systems where the distribution networks are implemented. Followed by the description of network segments causing issues discussed in this paper. The theoretical part discusses the possible operating conditions which lead to balancing the flow of neutral current, also shows the relation of the size of countervailing power charges and the form of the network load. There are also hints of possible risks that the mentioned situations may cause to the network operation in terms of function and safety. The practical part {{deals with the}} mathematical simulation model created in MATLAB. There are simulations based on which there is a description of the network behavior for the cases of induced adverse factors. The conclusion summarizes the most important results and findings produced by the simulations...|$|E
