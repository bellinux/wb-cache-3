5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los Angeles with Rubin. The album was the label boss' first <b>professional</b> <b>experience</b> with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.|$|E

5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no <b>professional</b> <b>experience</b> with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E

The examined <b>professional</b> development <b>experience</b> was deemed as highly effective by the participants and the participants recommended that principles of adult learning be foundational to all future professional development efforts...|$|R

40|$|This {{grounded}} theory project asked "how to library and information science (LIS) graduates in non-library roles <b>experience</b> <b>professional</b> identity?" This {{is an important}} question for current LIS practitioners and students because job opportunities are increasingly available in non-library work settings. There is limited research available on the <b>professional</b> identity <b>experiences</b> of LIS graduates in general and even less available on the <b>professional</b> <b>experiences</b> of LIS graduates in non-library roles. The study produced the theory of personalizing professionalism which found that individuals possess two identities which {{interact with each other}} throughout one's career. The first is an internal appraisal of self which represents an individual's assessment of who they "really" are as a professional. The second is an externally expressed identity, which represents who that individual presents him or herself to be. Interactions with others impact individuals' internal appraisal of self and externally expressed identity and represent an area of potential conflict. This study contributes to the research literature on professional identity and identity formation and expression. For the LIS community, understanding how these <b>professionals</b> <b>experience</b> <b>professional</b> identity can help practitioners, educators, and professional associations {{to take advantage of a}} wide range of employment options...|$|R
