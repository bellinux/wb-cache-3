50|$|In 2010, the {{interior}} of the 737 Next Generation was updated to look {{similar to that of the}} Boeing 787. Known as the Boeing Sky Interior, it introduces new pivoting overhead bins (a first for a Boeing narrowbody aircraft), new sidewalls, new <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> <b>units,</b> and LED mood lighting. Boeing also offers BSI retrofits for older 737NG aircraft. Boeing's Space Bins carry 50% more than the pivoting bins, allowing a 737 to hold 174 carry-on bags.|$|R

5000|$|On August 19, 1998, United Express Flight 1605 {{operated}} by Great Lakes Airlines, a Beechcraft 1900, was substantially damaged. Shortly after the airplane took off, the crew {{heard a loud}} noise and felt a slight vibration from the left propeller. They returned and landed. It was discovered that the propeller erosion shield had debonded and a portion had penetrated the passenger cabin just aft of the airstair door, knocked ajar Seat 1A <b>Passenger</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Unit,</b> ricocheted off the ceiling, and penetrated the inner window pane at Seat 2C. One passenger was injured.|$|R
5000|$|Above the {{passenger}} seats are <b>Passenger</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Units</b> (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and {{a flight attendant}} call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some Airbus A300s and A310s), the flight attendant call button and the buttons to control the reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, the flight attendant call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the in-flight entertainment system. The units frequently have small [...] "Fasten Seat Belt" [...] and [...] "No Smoking" [...] illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system.|$|R
5000|$|The 707 {{aircraft}} model {{marked a}} [...] "new flight era" [...] for passengers, with more windows, a <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> <b>unit,</b> illuminated seat-belt signs, and 1,300 {{square feet of}} interior space. Boeing's 747, the world's first wide-body commercial jetliner, {{two and a half}} times the size of the 707, was used to create the Reagan-era Air Force One in 1988. The Boeing-Teague team's Air-Force One project received tremendous media attention throughout its development, as the aircraft designed to transport the US President and White House staff included 100 telephones, two fully equipped kitchens, 16 televisions, seven bathrooms, 31 executive sleeper suites, and other extravagant amenities.|$|R
50|$|The last six-car {{units were}} {{withdrawn}} in 1986, when the Hastings line was electrified. The {{line through the}} tunnels was reduced to single track, allowing standard loading gauge Class 411 electrical multiple units to replace the diesel <b>units</b> on <b>passenger</b> <b>services.</b> One <b>unit</b> was subsequently reinstated to provide emergency cover, and was renumbered as 202001 to conform with the TOPS numbering system.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the research being conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop fire safe cabin materials for commercial aircraft. The objective of the Fire-Resistant Materials program is to eliminate burning cabin materials as a cause of death in aircraft accidents. Long-term activities include the synthesis of new, thermally stable, low fuel value organic and inorganic polymer systems. The synthesis effort is supported by fundamental research to understand polymer combustion and fire resistance mechanisms using numerical and analytic modeling and the development of new characterization techniques. Aircraft materials which are targeted for upgraded fire resistance are (1) thermoset resins for interior decorative panels, secondary composites, and adhesives, (2) thermoplastics for decorative facings, telecommunication equipment, <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> <b>units,</b> molded seat parts, transparencies, and electrical wiring, (3) textile fibers for uphols [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> that was fitted front to back. The <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter <b>service</b> <b>units</b> with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|R
50|$|The Encore's {{standard}} equipment list have been increased and many {{systems have been}} upgraded. Bleed air is used to anti-ice the wing leading edge, and several boundary layer energizers, plus a stall fence, {{have been added to}} the wing to improve stall characteristics. A digital pressurization controller reduces pilot workload and an improved wheel brake system offers better modulation. Redesigned interior fittings and passenger seats provide more seated headroom. New <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> <b>units</b> provide more even airflow and temperature control.The Encore's MTOW is bumped 330 pounds to 16,630 pounds, enabling it to carry five passengers with full fuel. The additional weight increases takeoff field length to 3,561 feet, compared with 3,180 feet for the Ultra. The much improved high altitude thrust output of the PW535 engines, however, allow the Encore to climb faster and cruise higher. Its maximum cruise altitude is FL 450.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-five {{large scale}} {{aircraft}} flammability {{tests were conducted}} in a Boeing 737 fuselage at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). The objective of this test program {{was to provide a}} data base on the propagation of large scale aircraft fires to support the validation of aircraft fire mathematical models. Variables in the test program included cabin volume, amount of fuel, fuel pan area, fire location, airflow rate, and cabin materials. A number of tests were conducted with jet A- 1 fuel only, while others were conducted with various Boeing 747 type cabin materials. These included urethane foam seats, <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> <b>units,</b> stowage bins, and wall and ceiling panels. Two tests were also included using special urethane foam and polyimide foam seats. Tests were conducted with each cabin material individually, with various combinations of these materials, and finally, with all materials in the cabin. The data include information obtained from approximately 160 locations inside the fuselage...|$|R
50|$|A {{community}} grew {{up around}} a sawmill that was established in 1891, and it would grow in size. The last stagecoach stopped in Okotoks in 1891 when rail service between Calgary and Fort Macleod replaced horse-drawn travel. By 1897 the community name had changed three times: from Sheep Creek to Dewdney to Okotoks, assigned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The rail line is still a main line south to the U.S. border, but {{the last of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>service</b> (Dayliner <b>unit)</b> ended in 1971.|$|R
50|$|PKP class ET22 is a Polish six-axle {{electric}} {{freight locomotive}} built by Pafawag from 1969 to 1989. Factory designation is 201E.

50|$|Racehorses, {{and those}} kept as {{breeding}} stock, were highly valued animals that required special handling. In 1885 a livery and stable operator from Toledo, Ohio {{by the name}} of Harrison Arms formed the Arms Palace Horse Car Company to service this market niche. Arms' cars resembled the passenger cars of the day; they featured clerestory roofs and end platforms and came equipped with passenger car trucks (as they were intended for <b>passenger</b> train <b>service).</b> The <b>units</b> were segregated into two separate compartments, each containing eight individual stalls. By the late 1880s Arms had acquired two competing firms, Burton and Keystone. While the cars operated by George D. Burton closely resembled the Arms design, the Keystone Company's cars were much more utilitaran in design as they were intended for transporting animals of lesser value and inclusion in standard freight train consists. The Keystone fleet eventually grew to more than 1,000 cars.|$|R
