5|$|Temple 27 (Structure 5D-27) forms a <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> Temple 25. It is {{situated}} on {{the southeast corner of}} the basal platform. Archaeologists presume that this structure underwent the same two Early Classic construction phases as its twin. It was built around AD 250.|$|E
5|$|A {{paternity}} {{analysis of}} yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting <b>pair,</b> <b>with</b> clear evidence for extra-pair paternity {{in the case}} of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood rearing, and to sexual monomorphism; characteristics exhibited by the yellow honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E

5|$|After the election, {{rather than}} take a job with Roosevelt's {{administration}} in Albany, Howe remained in New York City to prepare for Roosevelt's 1932 presidential run. During this period, he worked closely with James Farley, chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and another devoted Roosevelt supporter. Roosevelt would later publicly credit the <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> being {{the two men who}} had done the most to secure his election.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Montgomery Street, MD 2 splits into another one-way <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> the northbound direction running east on Montgomery Street and then turning north on Light Street, intersecting MD 2 Truck (Key Highway) and passing by the Maryland Science Center, and the southbound direction following Hughes Street to Hanover Street. Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another one-way <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul Street. The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street. The one-way pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before coming to US 40. Calvert Street passes under US 40 (the Orleans Street Viaduct) while St. Paul Street intersects US 40 as it follows the one-way pair of Franklin Street westbound and Mulberry Street eastbound.|$|E

5|$|Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, {{including}} mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, {{and other}} non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow {{parts of the}} RNA to fold and <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E

5|$|The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012. The Yankees {{needed a}} top-tier {{starting}} pitcher to <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> CC Sabathia, and the Mariners {{felt they could}} afford to part with Pineda because of their depth of top-tier pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan Walker.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} forms a species <b>pair</b> <b>with</b> the Eurasian white-tailed eagle. This species pair {{consists}} of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles {{at the beginning of}} the Early Miocene (c. 10Ma BP) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.|$|E
5000|$|... xDNA is a {{modified}} form of DNA with 8 nucleobases: the four natural bases A, C, G, and T, and four artificial modifications of these made longer {{by the addition}} of an extra benzene ring: xA, xC, xG, and xT. A <b>pairs</b> <b>with</b> xT, C <b>pairs</b> <b>with</b> xG, G <b>pairs</b> <b>with</b> xC, and T <b>pairs</b> <b>with</b> xA, so the distance between the two halves of the double helix is consistently greater. The double helix is thus wider and has a longer pitch.|$|R

40|$|This {{study will}} explore the effects of {{conscious}} primes upon implicit perceptions about {{people who have a}} disability, whether that disability is physical, mental, learning, etc. These subcategories will be broadly grouped under the term ???disability???, which is the main focus of this study. A sample of Cal Poly Pomona college students, consisting mostly of first and second year students taking introductory psychology courses, will be asked to participate. Participants will take an Implicit Association Test (hereafter referred to as ???IAT???) and be tested under one of six conditions: a positively connotative definition of the word ???disabled [persons]??? <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> the antonym of ???abled [persons]???, a negative definition of ???disabled??? <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> ???abled???, a neutral definition of ???disabled??? <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> ???abled???, a positive definition of ???disabled??? <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> ???non-disabled [persons]???, a negative definition of ???disabled??? <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> ???non-disabled???, or a neutral definition of ???disabled??? <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> ???non-disabled???. It is predicted that the negative definition <b>paired</b> <b>with</b> the word that most contrasts ???disabled??? (which is ???abled???) will have the most adverse effect upon the IAT scores...|$|R
