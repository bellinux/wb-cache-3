50|$|Around {{the year}} 1900 in the United States, G) had skiesifford Pinchot lead a {{movement}} of conservation. Gifford Pinchot made conservation a popular word in its application to natural resources. Throughout the next two decades, forestry professions became widespread. Following World War I, forestry became a cooperation between private landowners, the states, and the federal government. On March 21, 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{sent a message to}} the United States Congress to strengthen the United States forest resources. In the following days, congress enacted the establishment of emergency conservation work. This project consisted of twenty five thousand men working on forest <b>protection</b> <b>by</b> <b>planting</b> trees, watershed restoration and erosion control. About 2.2 billion seedlings were planted which marked a start of conservation in the United States. In 1935, the Natural Resources Committee was created to understand, plan and use natural resources. Following World War II, the first Smokey Bear symbol appeared on a poster to represent a fire prevention cooperation. The Smokey Bear icon soon became one of the best advertisement icons in the United States. When people started to realize that the resources were not unlimited within the forests, conservation efforts began to start.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{designed}} to find out the protective effect of aqueus extract of Terminalia arjuna against dehydration induced oxidative stress and uremia, <b>protection</b> <b>by</b> <b>plant</b> extract in male Wister strain albino rats, and therefore to find out the scientific basis of local use of Terminalia arjuna bark extract by village ayurved doctors to protect the progressive kidney disorder (renal failure) relating to dehydration and other related problems. Water withdrawing for 15 days in male Wister strain albino rats resulted in a significant elevation in the level of blood nitrogenous products (i. e. urea and creatinine). On the other hand, it increased the levels of free radicals, melondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (CD) along with a significant diminution in the activities of superoxide dismutse (SOD) and catalase in blood. All these water markers were significantly prevented after administration of aqueous extract of Terminalia arjuna bark. These results suggest that dehydration induced oxidative stress and uremia in male rats may be protected by using the above mentioned medicinal plants extract. This herbal extract showed no toxic effect on blood and kidney, based on the measurements of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase activities (data not shown) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the current legal protection for agricultural biotechnological inventions in Europe and the U. S. It has been a subject of debate whether plants and agricultural biotechnological inventions which includes plants, transgenic plants and plant varieties, can {{be the subject of}} patent protection, in addition to or {{as an alternative to the}} <b>protection</b> afforded <b>by</b> <b>plant</b> variety rights. Biotechnological patents have been criticized for granting an excessive scope of protection to proprietors, whereas plant variety rights have been slighted for not providing enough protection. Hence, this research is built on a few main themes, namely; the discussion of IP protection for agricultural biotechnological inventions as currently in practice in Europe and the U. S., as well as the deliberation on the current system as practised in Malaysia. The research also discusses the issue of the interface between the patent regime and plant variety rights over agricultural biotechnological inventions as there are possible overlaps between the two systems, notwithstanding the exclusivity of protection of plant varieties under the PVR system. The research looks at the prospect for Malaysia as a developing country to enhance its current IP framework and legislation in order to develop its agricultural biotechnology industry. Hence, it focuses on whether there is a single system as a model of IP regime to be adopted by Malaysia in order to provide the best IP protection for its agricultural biotechnology industry. The comparative approach is inevitable, in referring to the European model and the American model as a guide. The relevant factors such as the different setting, society and economic strength are given due consideration in coming up with the proposal to amend the current intellectual property law and legal system in Malaysia. At the end, the thesis puts forward a model for Malaysia to further develop its system...|$|R

Considering {{the fact that}} arbuscular mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) improve plant growth giving <b>protection</b> against damages <b>by</b> <b>plant</b> pathogens, this work was carried out to select AMF efficient to increase production of guava seedlings and their tolerance to M. enterolobii. Seedlings of guava were inoculated with 200 spores of Gigaspora albida, Glomus etunicatum or Acaulospora longula and 55 days later with 4, 000 eggs of M. enterolobii. The interactions between the AMF and M. enterolobii were assessed by measuring leaf number, aerial dry biomass, CO₂ evolution and arbuscular and total mycorrhizal colonization. In general, plant growth was improved by the treatments with A. longula or with G. albida. The presence of the nematode decreased arbuscular colonization and increased general enzymatic activity. Higher dehydrogenase activity occurred with the A. longula treatment and CO₂ evolution was higher in the control with the nematode. More spores and higher production of glomalin-related soil proteins were observed in the treatment with G. albida. The numbers of galls, egg masses and eggs were reduced {{in the presence of}} A. longula. Inoculation with this fungus benefitted plant growth and decreased nematode reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In Mexico, {{medicinal}} plants are widely used. The use of Randia aculeata by healers against snakebites {{has never been}} scientifically tested in relation to possible effects on blood parameters and muscle tissue damage. Interviews were carried out in Jamapa, Veracuz, Mexico, with local residents to collect information about the traditional use of Randia aculeata. In this locality, seven pieces of fruit from the plant are mixed in a liter of alcohol, and then administered orally against snakebites. By using histological techniques and a murine model, we explored its cytoprotective properties against the effects of Crotalus simus and Bothrops asper venoms. Possible <b>protections</b> provided <b>by</b> the <b>plant</b> against tissue damage to skeletal and cardiac muscles and against the typical loss of red blood cells were analyzed. Randia aculeata caused an increase in microhematocrit and total hemoglobin, parameters that are often decremented {{in association with the}} loss of red blood cells, which is a characteristic effect of animal venom. Randia aculeata was also shown to protect against the lowering of platelet levels caused by Bothrops asper venom. Finally, Randia aculeata produced a partial inhibition of necrosis following administration of snake venom in skeletal and myocardial muscles. The present results provide solid evidence for the traditional use of Randia aculeata against snakebites, as demonstrated <b>by</b> <b>protection</b> against muscular tissue damage and the diminution of red blood cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{repellent}} {{materials from}} plants against nuisance insects is common with great potential to compliment existing malaria control programmes and this requires evaluation {{in the field}}. Ocimum plant species, Ocimum suave (Willd) and O. kilimandscharicum (Guerke) materials and their essential oils extracted by steam distillation were evaluated {{in the field and}} experimental huts for repellence, exophily and feeding inhibition effects against three mosquito species, Anopheles arabiensis (Patton), An. gambiae ss (Giles) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). The protective effect of essential oils from Ocimum plants were compared with N, N-diethly- 3 - methylbenzamide (DEET), a standard synthetic repellent. Also, the protective effect of fumigation by burning of repellent plants; Ocimum suave, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globules and Lantana camara were tested in experimental huts and selected local houses. Results In the field, <b>protection</b> <b>by</b> Ocimum <b>plants</b> from mosquito bites was high and there was small variation among different mosquito species. Protection efficiency was 93. 4 %, 91. 98 % and 89. 75 % for An. arabiensis while for Cx. quinquefaciatus it was 91. 30 %, 88. 65 % and 90. 50 % for DEET, Ocimum suave and O. kilimandscharicum respectively. In the experimental hut, deterrence induced by burning of Ocimum and other plants ranged from 73. 1. 0 % to 81. 9 % for An. arabiensis and 56. 5 % to 67. 8 % for Cx. quinquefaciatus, while feeding inhibition was 61. 1 % to 100 % for An. arabiensis and 50 % to 100 % for Cx. quinquefaciatus. Evaluations under field conditions confirmed high protective efficacy, enhanced feeding inhibition and house entry inhibition (Deterrence). Conclusion This study shows the potential of Ocimum suave and Ocimum kilimandscharicum crude extracts and whole plants of Ocimum suave, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globules and Lantana camara for use in protecting against human biting while the burning of plants reduces significantly the indoor resting mosquitoes. </p...|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} 1985. First paperback edition 2010. Mutualistic {{interactions between}} ants and plants involve rewards offered <b>by</b> <b>plants</b> and services performed by ants in a mutually advantageous relationship. The rewards are principally food and/or nest sites, and ants in turn perform {{a number of}} services for plants: they disperse and plant seeds; they protect foliage, buds, and reproductive structures from enemies such as herbivores and seed predators; they fertilize plants with essential nutrients; and they may sometimes function as pollinators. In this book, initially published in 1985, Professor Beattie reviews the fascinating natural history of ant–plant interactions, discusses the scientific evidence for the mutualistic nature of these relationships, and reaches some conclusions about the ecological and evolutionary processes that mold them. This important work explores the natural history, experimental approach, and integration with contemporary evolutionary and ecological literature of the time will appeal {{to a wide variety}} of biologists.

40|$|Abstract Background Worldwide used {{pesticides}} containing different adjuvants like Roundup formulations, {{which are}} glyphosate-based herbicides, can provoke some in vivo toxicity and in human cells. These pesticides are {{commonly found in}} the environment, surface waters and as food residues of Roundup tolerant genetically modified plants. In order to know their effects on cells from liver, a major detoxification organ, we have studied their mechanism of action and possible <b>protection</b> <b>by</b> precise medicinal <b>plant</b> extracts called Dig 1. Methods The cytotoxicity pathways of four formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides were studied using human hepatic cell lines HepG 2 and Hep 3 B, known models to study xenobiotic effects. We monitored mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity and caspases 3 / 7 for cell mortality and <b>protection</b> <b>by</b> Dig 1, as well as cytochromes P 450 1 A 1, 1 A 2, 3 A 4 and 2 C 9 and glutathione-S-transferase to approach the mechanism of actions. Results All the four Roundup formulations provoke liver cell death, with adjuvants having stronger effects than glyphosate alone. Hep 3 B are 3 - 5 times more sensitive over 48 h. Caspases 3 / 7 are greatly activated in HepG 2 by Roundup at non-cytotoxic levels, and some apoptosis induction by Roundup is possible together with necrosis. CYP 3 A 4 is specifically enhanced by Roundup at doses 400 times less than used in agriculture (2 %). CYP 1 A 2 is increased {{to a lesser extent}} together with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) down-regulation. Dig 1, non cytotoxic and not inducing caspases by itself, is able to prevent Roundup-induced cell death in a time-dependant manner with an important efficiency of up to 89 %, within 48 h. In addition, we evidenced that it prevents Caspases 3 / 7 activation and CYP 3 A 4 enhancement, and not GST reduction, but in turn it slightly inhibited CYP 2 C 9 when added before Roundup. Conclusion Roundup is able to provoke intracellular disruption in hepatic cell lines at different levels, but a mixture of medicinal plant extracts Dig 1 can protect to some extent human cell lines against this pollutants. All this system constitutes a tool for studying liver intoxication and detoxification. </p...|$|R

Of the 14 datum pegs remeasured nearly 4 years after they were positioned {{around the edges of}} the remnant, 11 indicate that the vegetation has retreated from 70 cm to 1. 5 m (Plate 3). The level of the substrate has decreased by 10 cm (Plate 4). However, at one inland site, there was expansion of the salt marsh vegetation by 60 cm. 6. CONCLUSIONS 6. 1 Transplanting trial This trial demonstrates the two major indigenous rush species at Maketu Estuary, J. maritimus and L. similis can be successfully transplanted to sheltered mudflats. The assessment 3. 5 years after planting confirms general conclusions reached at the first assessment 5 months after planting (Bergin 1991). On a sheltered site J. maritimus can be successfully transplanted using a medium clump-size and L. similis using a large clump-size. The trial confirmed earlier work of Partridge and Wilson (1988) who found that transplanting of small clumps ofJ. maritimus results largely in failure. On a sheltered mudflat, transplants planted at a close spacing or immediately adjacent to the existing salt marsh remnant do not benefit from the extra <b>protection</b> afforded <b>by</b> neighbouring <b>plants</b> at close proximity.

Aim of the study: This study investigated the protective property of AC leaf against liver damage in animals {{with a view to}} exploring its use for the treatment of hepatotoxicity in humans. Material and methods: Ethanol extract of A. cordifolia was used to study the hepatoprotective activity in acetaminophen-induced Albino rats (150 - 200 g). Animals in Group 1 served as vehicle control, Group 2 served as hepatotoxin (Acetaminophen 2 g/kg treated) group, Groups 3 and 4 served as positive control (Vitamin E and Curcumin 100 mg/kg bw respectively) groups, and Groups 5 - 8 served as (200 - 500 mg/kg bw) AC leaf extract treated groups while Group 9 served as normal group (AC extract only 300 mg/kg bw). Results: The hepatotoxic group showed hepatocytic necrosis, cellular infiltration and inflammation in the liver. The treatment group restored the liver cells to their normal lobular architecture in a dose dependent manner. The <b>protection</b> offered <b>by</b> the <b>plant</b> extract compared well with the standard antioxidant agents (Curcumin and Vitamin E).

40|$|Although {{limited in}} coverage, perched sand dunes {{situated}} on high coastal bluffs {{are considered the}} most prized of Great Lakes dunes. Grand Sable Dunes on Lake Superior and Sleeping Bear Dunes on Lake Michigan are featured attractions of national lakeshores under National Park Service management. The source of sand for perched dunes is the high bluff along their lakeward edge. As onshore wind crosses the bluff, flow is accelerated upslope, resulting in greatly elevated levels of wind stress over the slope brow. On barren, sandy bluffs, wind erosion is concentrated in the brow zone, and for the Grand Sable Bluff, it averaged 1 m 3 /yr per linear meter along the highest sections for the period 1973 – 1983. This mechanism accounts for about 6, 500 m 3 of sand nourishment to the dunefield annually and clearly has been the predominant mechanism for the long-term development of the dunefield. However, wind erosion and dune nourishment are possible only where the bluff is denuded of <b>plant</b> cover <b>by</b> mass movements and related processes induced by wave erosion. In the Great Lakes, wave erosion and bluff retreat vary with lake levels; the nourishment of perched dunes is favored by high levels. Lake levels have been relatively high for the past 50 years, and shore erosion {{has become a major}} environmental issue leading property owners and politicians to support lake-level regulation. Trimming high water levels could reduce geomorphic activity on high bluffs and affect dune nourishment rates.
