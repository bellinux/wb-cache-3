50|$|The verbs of most aspect pairs {{differ in}} one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the {{perfective}} verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and <b>prodat</b> (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jít (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodívat (to go regularly).|$|E

The <b>PRODAT</b> object model is a derivative of the Entity-Relationship Model with a special focus on complex objects. It provides attributed objects with longfields and a structuring mechanism to build arbitrary acyclic object graphs. Further <b>PRODAT</b> concepts implemented in APRIL are versions, a transaction concept taylored to the data model, and an integrated archiving component. Some other parts defined in <b>PRODAT</b> are emitted in APRIL, among others because it is directed to graphics applications and their data handling. In APRIL, interfaces are offered on three different levels: There is a procedural C interface which covers the whole functionality, two alphanumeric interpeters (e. g. for batch jobs), and a graphical interactive database editor, the so-called object editor...|$|E

Conceptually we have developed {{the part of the}} data model for object handling. An integrated archiving component has been defined and a first prototype of this archive has been implemented. Furthermore an adapted transaction mechanism has been proposed. Direct access to <b>PRODAT</b> databases requires interactive interfaces which have been realized through the PQL interpreter and a graphical interactive object editor...|$|E

Therefore, a non-standard database system called <b>PRODAT</b> has evolved to fulfil the requirements imposed by the appliations. The main goal of <b>PRODAT</b> is to be application-oriented i. e. it allows for a powerful, yet comfortable representation of design objects, it supports the design process during the whole life-cycle, and of course, the co-operation between several designers or design tools. Therefore, mechanisms are offered to keep the "semantic gap" between the application model and the terms of the data model - e. g. objects and relationships - as small as possible. In this contribution, the data model of <b>PRODAT</b> will be presented. It will be restricted to the notion of simple and structured objects and the version and configuration management facilities. The practical usability of the model is demonstrated by a case study. (IITB...|$|E

PROSYT is a frame system including a dialog component (PRODIA) and a database component (<b>PRODAT).</b> The integration of different tools, which cover special aspects of the system life-cycle and which were not developed for working together, is done via the exchange of data using the non standard database <b>PRODAT.</b> PRODIA supports the integration of tools under a common graphical dialogue interface. Some results of our prototype implementations - showing the correctness of the conception - are discussed. The paper closes with some statements about the necessity of a standard to achieve widely accepted and used SEEs...|$|E

Population unit is the manufacturer Bakery and Pastry in Jakarta and Bandung, which has become a customer minimal 1 year, totaling 468 employers. Research is using SEM analysis tools, with 150 respondents drawn proportionally in the two study areas. Research results inform that: (1) Product attributes (<b>ProdAt)</b> does not directly influence the Corporate Brand Equity (CBE); (2) Service Quality (ServQ) directly influence the CBE; (3) CBE affect the Customers Loyalty (CustLoy); (4) <b>ProdAt</b> directly influence CustLoy; and (5) ServQ directly influence CustLoy. Recommended for: 1) Increase the required CustLoy CBE intervening variables. 2) Maintain and develop the dimensions of each variable, except the dimensions of the variable ServQ distribution services must be improved in order to simultaneously improveCustLoy through CBE...|$|E

In this report, we briefly describe several projects, such as the French NADIR, the European STELLA, UNIVERSE and SATINE- 2, some experiments performed by the European Space Agency ESA, such as <b>PRODAT</b> and CODE as well as a special internetworking experiment.

40|$|The {{relation}} of conversion is a semantic relation between lexemes (or between other typ es of language expressions) that is assessed- {{as far as}} its appurtenance to the system oflanguage is concemed - in various theories of language in a different way. Informally, these expressions are usually considered {{to be in the}} {{relation of}} conversion which "denote the same situation always from a different perspective", such as e. g. the verbs dát - dostat, <b>prodat</b> - koupit, půjčit- půjčit si, vyhrát- prohrát or the nouns vítězství- porážka. In this thesis, the relation of conversion is regarded as a type of a semantic relation that is inherent in the language system and therefore it {{should be included in the}} whole theoretical description of language. The author tries to support this standpoint that issues from a more or less intuitive observation of the properties of lexemes in the conversion relation and from their comparison with other lexemes by a consequent description of the nature of the semantic relation of conversion within the formally constructed theory of the Functional Generative Description of Language (FGD). This task is necessarily associated with specific modifications (extensions) of the terrninological framework of FGD because in the theory of FGD the field of lexical semantics has not yet been [...] ...|$|E

Druhá část je věnována popisu společnosti České aerolinie. V poslední části jsou aplikovány oceňovací metody. Metodou DCF equity bylo dosaženo částky 1 574 398 tis. Kč. Metodou kapitalizovaných čistých výnosů pomocí analytické metody vyšla hodnota 2 348 871 tis. Kč a paušální metodou byla dosažena částka – 1 873 415 tis. Kč. The {{aim of the}} diploma {{thesis is}} the {{valuation}} of Czech Airlines Company. The valuation day has been selected 1 st January 2008. The main shareholder owning about 93 % of all shares is {{the government of the}} Czech Republic or, more precisely, the Ministry of Finance. Due to bad economical situation of company, the government has decides to sell the company to strategic buyer. There are three methods of valuation that were applied in the diploma thesis. In the first part, there is methodology of valuation described The second part, some facts about Czech Airlines Company is stated. The last part includes application of valuating methods. The result of DCF equity method is the equity value equal to 1 574 398 thousand crowns. Method of capitalized net earnings in the analytical form values company equity 2 348 871 thousand crowns and in the sweeping form – 1 873 415 thousand crowns.
