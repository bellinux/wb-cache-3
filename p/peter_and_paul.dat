5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks, and Russia became part of the new Soviet Union. As the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist–Leninist ideology, the Soviet government ordered many churches closed. The <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> parish was formally dissolved by the communist government in 1929, and celebrating Mass was forbidden. The church lost much of its surrounding gardens in 1935—a school was built there the following year—and the church was finally closed on 30 July 1938 (the St. <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> church had met the same fate nine days earlier). The church was plundered after its closure, and many items, including the main altar and the organ, were irretrievably lost. The church was used for several months as a vegetable store, and was then reconstructed as a hostel and its interior divided into four floors.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, 2002, Pollard died at {{his home}} in Devon, Pennsylvania, at the age of 73. The stated cause of death was lymphoma.

5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival, Augustine founded the monastery of Saints <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul,</b> which later became St Augustine's Abbey, on land {{donated by the}} king. This {{foundation}} has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the Rule of St. Benedict into England, {{but there is no}} evidence that the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.|$|E

5|$|Conwell died on April 22, 1842, {{at about}} the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for {{possession}} of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim. Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard. In 1864 the remains were transferred to the Cathedral Basilica of Saints <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, {{the monastery}} {{frequently}} lost and regained its ownership rights. On the funds of the monastery's new hegumen Afanasiy (a protégé of prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski), the monastery's old buildings were demolished, and new ones {{were built in}} their place. In 1604, the Gate Church of Ss. <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska Refectory, and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered as the second lavra (cave monastery) in Ukraine.|$|E

5|$|Olga was the {{youngest}} daughter of Tsar Alexander III and his consort, Marie Feodorovna, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She {{was born in the}} purple, i.e. during her father's reign, on 13 June 1882 in the Peterhof Palace, west of central Saint Petersburg. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from the ramparts of the <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> Fortress, and similar salutes throughout the Russian Empire. Her mother, advised by her sister, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Olga's murder {{following}} the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later years, when {{dozens of people}} made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family, a woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but her claim was not taken seriously. Olga was murdered along with her family at Yekaterinburg. Her remains were identified through DNA testing and were buried during a funeral ceremony in 1998 at <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> Cathedral in St. Petersburg {{along with those of}} her parents and two of her sisters.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Canterbury or Petrus (died c. 607 {{or after}} 614) {{was the first}} abbot of the monastery of SS. <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> in Canterbury (later St Augustine's Abbey) and a {{companion}} of Augustine in the Gregorian mission to Kent. Augustine sent Peter as an emissary to Rome around 600 to convey news of the mission to Pope Gregory I. Peter's death has traditionally been dated to around 607, but evidence suggests that he was present at a church council in Paris in 614, so he probably died after that date.|$|E

5|$|Van der Paele {{may have}} kept the panel in his private {{chambers}} or as a church altar. He donated it to the church either in 1436 or on his death in 1443; it remained there until the church was demolished in 1779. Most likely the work was situated in the nave as an accompaniment to an altar for Saints <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> and used for memorial masses for van der Paele and his family. It was installed on the main altar after the Iconoclasm of 1566.|$|E
5|$|A chapel {{dedicated}} to St Catherine of Alexandria {{is known to}} have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval. In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24sheaves of oats for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, Whitsuntide and Saints <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul.</b> In 1322, there was a chantry {{dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370.|$|E
5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children {{and the children of}} Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the <b>Peter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Paul</b> Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E
