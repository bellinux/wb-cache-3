Conversation analysis, a data-driven qualitative methodology utilized to study naturally occurring talk-in-interaction, {{was used in}} this study to uncover the mechanisms behind meeting talk. In a meeting shared understanding is essential and must be done in an economical manner. One interactional device to reach common agreement are formulations that summarize what has been said or draw out its relevant implication. In this essay, a sub-class of formulations, <b>pre-closing</b> formulations, are in focus. They serve to close the current topic and move on to the next. The aim of this thesis was to find out what kind of interactional devices are used in pre-closure formulations. The findings from the analysis of data, from a cross-functional team meeting at Ericsson in Stockholm, show how a <b>pre-closing</b> formulation followed by silence from the participants is the basis for an agreement. Furthermore the chair can utilize a <b>pre-closing</b> formulation to emphasize the topic of discussion and to influence the sense-making and thus “do” leadership. With a <b>pre-closing</b> formulation the meeting participants can be prepared {{to be held accountable for}} the status in a project.

40|$|The {{volume of}} non-audited {{information}} released by companies is extensive, and growing. This information {{has the power}} to move the share price. However, there are few regulations concerning this information, and practices differ widely. The tone of such information is often as important as the underlying content. A hierarchy of oversight is necessary. Not all of the information disclosed should or could be reviewed by non executives. Companies have to determine the significance of each statement and judge whether it is a matter for Board review, for delegation to the audit committee, or for the executive management. The Board should confirm that appropriate processes are in place to ensure the probity of the disclosures. Narrative disclosures in the financial statements are generally reviewed in some detail by the Board and the audit committee. The preliminary statement of results is reviewed by either the Board or the audit committee, or both. Particular attention is paid to the tone and outlook of this document. The level of review of interim statements by audit committees varies between companies. The level of audit committee or non executive involvement in the <b>pre-close</b> statement also differs significantly between companies. Practices regarding investor/analyst presentations vary. In a few companies the non executives see both the slides and the scripts for the presentation before the event, and have the time to make comments. However, in a significant number of organisations there is little non executive input or review. This was seen as a matter for some concern. It was felt that it would be useful for there to be broad guidelines concerning what is expected with regard to the non-audited information in investor/ analyst presentations and in the <b>pre-close</b> statement. This would be of use to non executives and also to finance directors. However, it would be inappropriate for standards or regulations to be introduced in this area...|$|R

Furthermore, by comparing the AR-XPS spectra of finger arrays <b>pre-closed</b> before exposure to BPE with the spectra of arrays that closed after exposure to BPE, we observed at decreasing take-off angles, for which the surface sensitivity is enhanced, an increasing component of the nitrogen photoelectron peaks in the latter case which was associated with pyridyl nitrogen atoms residing on bridging sites. These results demonstrate that BPE molecules were trapped between the neighboring gold finger tips during the finger closing process. This resulted in a substantial increase in the SERS signal intensity since the self-limiting sub-nm gap between the fingertips is Raman hot spot...|$|R
50|$|Collier {{begins his}} {{pamphlet}} with this conclusion: “Nothing has gone farther in Debauching the Age than the Stage Poets, and Play-House” (Collier A2). He goes on, in great detail—despite the title—to give his evidence. For Collier, the immorality {{of the title}} stems from Restoration comedy’s lack of poetic justice. With his exhaustively thorough readings—in a sense, <b>pre-close</b> reading close readings—he condemns the characters of Restoration comedies as impious and wicked and he condemned their creators (the playwrights) for failing to punish the playwrights’ wicked “favorites.” As the title suggests, Collier also charges the playwrights with profaneness, supporting his allegations with a number quotations from the plays (i.e. The Provoked Wife, The Relapse, et cetera). However, most of these charges are rather mild (at least according {{to the standards of}} most modern readers). Collier is, of course, unable to give examples of blatant blasphemy, for at the time, they were neither allowed on stage nor in print (Cordner 213). However, Collier’s strategy was innovative for his time (not to mention effective). Before A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, most anti-theatre pamphlets were merely nondescript diatribes (e.g. William Prynne’s Histriomastix (1633)), but with his innovative techniques, Collier comprehensively indicted the entire Restoration stage (Cordner 215).|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{interesting}} area within conversation {{analysis on}} which {{few studies have}} been done is strategies employed by interlocutors for topic termination. Not only non-native speakers, but also native speakers have difficulty in order to develop the tact required for topic termination. This study aimed to examine strategies which Persian speakers employ for terminating a conversation. The participants were two groups of 30 graduate native speakers of Persian and English and the natural data collected via various means in English. The data incorporated male and female speakers with an age range of 20 - 33. Spontaneous interviews were used to gather data, then an open-ended DCT was formed based upon the results of the interviews. According to the results of data analysis, native Persians were observed to use a greater variety of <b>pre-closing</b> and closing devices in comparison with native English speakers as there are radical cross-cultural differences between Persian and English accepted norms of politeness. Using fewer and more limited <b>pre-closing</b> sequences by native English speakers is explained by relating it to their tendency to be direct and individualistic, while Persians made use of more such sequences due to their culture which tend to be highly publically oriented...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of pre-sequence expressions, utterances uttered by the speaker as {{a signal to the}} hearer before the speaker goes to the main idea. Pre-sequence is usually used before announcing, requesting, inviting, arranging, and closing something. The writer is {{interested}} in doing an analysis on pre-sequence in " 10 Things I Hate About You" film. The two characters in the film, Patrick and Kat, use many pre-sequences to each other to be indirect. Thus, the writer wants to know the different preferences in the use of pre-sequence expressions based on gender in the film. In conducting the analysis, she uses Levinson?s (1984) theory of Pre-sequence. As a result, the writer finds that Pre-announcement is used the most for both of them. It is because they are not confident enough to approach each other. The writer also finds that in this film, Patrick uses more pre-sequence rather than Kat does. For Patrick, pre-announcement is the mostly used, the second is pre-request, the third is pre-arrangement, the fourth is <b>pre-closing,</b> and the least is pre-invitation. While for Kat, pre-announcement is also the mostly used, the second is <b>pre-closing,</b> the third is pre-request, the fourth is pre-invitation, and none of them is pre-invitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fish {{that are}} {{incidentally}} caught by shrimp trawling represent a predictable and abundant resource for feeding several bird species, {{especially for the}} gull Larus dominicanus. This fishing activity is subject to disruptions throughout the year during closed fishing seasons, when other fishing modalities are exercised, which can alter the composition, abundance {{and size of the}} fish bycatch. This study evaluated the influence of the restriction of fishing period of shrimp (closed season) on the diet of L. dominicanus, on the Paraná State coast. From December 2013 to August 2014, 10 pellets were collected per month in two distinct areas that have shrimp trawl fishery as the main economic activity: one continental and another in an estuarine island. In total, 920 fish were identified, divided into four families and 15 species, especially the family Sciaenidae with 11 species. There were differences in abundance and biomass of species between areas and between seasons of pre-closure, closure and post-closure. Differences for the mean total length of the species were only detected between the <b>pre-closed</b> and closed seasons in one area. This study evidenced the strong relationship between L. dominicanus and the shrimp trawl fishery, the species composition identified in the pellets and their respective morphometric measurements follow the same pattern of the literature for fish discarded in trawling activities...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT Institutional {{interactions}} are often asymmetrical {{in that the}} professional has {{more control over the}} conversation. It is difficult to say who the professional is in simulated consultations between simulated patients (SPs) and medical students because these feature a real (educational) institutional context and a simulated (medical) institutional context. This study describes this asymmetry and makes educational recommendations based on the description. METHODS One hundred assessed conversations between SPs and Year 3 students were transcribed and analysed using discourse analysis (DA). We aimed to find linguistic patterns in predefined parts of the conversations (questions, topic initiations, openings, closings) that might suggest conversational dominance. RESULTS The SP is conversationally more dominant, despite performing the role of the patient, in that he or she asks more direct questions, is more likely to initiate topics, is more likely not to follow topic changes by students, and closes the consultation. The student is likely to follow topics initiated by the SP and to seek permission to <b>pre-close</b> the consultation. CONCLUSIONS The apparently greater dominance of the SP indicates that the simulated consultation differs from the doctor-patient consultation in certain key aspects. It is in that sense unrealistic. We argue, however, that `realism' ought not to be a goal of simulated consultation and that what matters is that such consultations are sufficiently realistic for their educational purpose. We discuss the educational implications that follow from this...|$|R

We retrospectively analyzed the PRC after pEVAR {{for the treatment of}} aortic aneurysm or dissection in our center from December 2012 to November 2013. Procedure success was defined as effective functioning of the two devices and local hemostasis. Access-related adverse events included vascular complications and device failures. Operative data and angiographic and computed tomography images were collected to assess the complications and treatment strategy. A total of 198 patients with 275 puncture sites underwent pEVAR with the 6 -Fr Perclose Proglide. The procedure was successful in 178 patients (89. 9 %), whereas PRC occurred in 20 cases (10. 1 %), including 10 device failures and 10 vascular complications. An extra manual ancillary compression was conducted in 7 patients, one more device was used in 8 patients, and surgical repair of the femoral artery was performed in 5 patients. PRC had a tendency to occur in patients with body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m 2 (p = 0. 021), thoracic stent grafts (p = 0. 038), common femoral artery (CFA) calcification (p = 0. 001), CFA depth> 4 cm (p = 0. 001), and sheath size> 20 Fr (p = 0. 005).

Detailed comparative study of the closing sequences in a corpus of mundane phone calls which do not include a disabled member finds very few such accounts. It is suggested that participants draw on accounts in a way that manages the potentially interactionally troubling matter of closing the call and, more specifically, to build the speakers' affiliative, ‘caring’, stance to one another.

40|$|Closing an {{encounter}} is a co-constructed activity through which participants conclude verbal and non-verbal {{action in a}} way that allows each to raise any matters they wish prior to the termination of the encounter (West, 2006). Although medical encounters are often time restricted, the scheduled length of the appointment "does not determine just when or how such a visit will be brought to a close" (West, 2006 : 379). There are, however, points within the consultation where closing becomes a relevant activity. In this article, I examine these points in surgeon-patient consultations. There are seven types of surgeon-initiated pre-closings found in the data presented here.

40|$|We analyze why {{managers}} of open-ended mutual funds choose {{to close their}} funds to new investment. Borrowing from Berk and Green (2004), we develop {{a model of the}} mutual fund closure decision where the main ingredient is a negative relationship between fund size and the fund’s realized return. We show that funds will find it optimal to restrict inflows following a period of superior performance. Because there is uncertainty regarding managerial skill, following closure, there is a net outflow of money that reduces the fund’s size and allows more skilled managers to realize higher returns. Therefore funds reopen after reductions in TNA, which allow them to maintain their <b>pre-closing</b> performance. Moreover, we show that the length of the fund closure period is positively related to post-reopening net inflows. We test the empirical predictions of the model on a sample of 141 equity mutual funds that closed to new investment between 1992 and 2002. Consistent with the model, closing funds outperform matching funds in the year prior to the closing, both in terms of inflows and returns. Closing also enables funds to retain their superior performance in the year following closure. Finally, we find that excess fund flows at reopening are significantly related to the length of the fund closure period.

Further, this study investigates these learners ‟ ability {{to improve their}} communication over time as they are {{moving away from the}} effort of learning their L 2 and toward the effort of applying that knowledge as they use the L 2. To explore the use and development of communication abilities, online conversations (chats) were used due to their reduced-pressure contexts (Sun, 2007). Participants were 32 intermediate-high Spanish learners from an advanced grammar course. Learners completed five open topic online chatting sessions. These chats were analyzed for the use of twelve communication tactics: openings, closings, <b>pre-closing</b> devices, direct requests, indirect requests, mitigated speech, circumlocution, follow-up questions, message abandonment, code switching, self-correction, and other-correction. Results found a significant increase in closings and follow-up questions along with a significant decrease in code switching from Chat 1 to Chat 3. Following Chat 3, these significant changes were maintained in Chats 4 and 5 (despite a slight increase in code switching during Chat 5). Additionally, from Chat 1 to Chat 4, significant increases were seen in circumlocution and self-correction and from Chat 1 to Chat 5, a significant decrease was seen for topic abandonment. These results show positive development over time to higher quality conversations with a desire to better maintain and explore topics. Further, learners attempted to remain in Spanish using less code switching and greater circumlocution to convey their meaning. A...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} approach {{was developed and}} implemented in eight governmental buildings to reduce their load during the peak demand hours in summer of 2007. The {{innovative approach}} implemented in these buildings included <b>pre-closing</b> treatment (PCT) between 13 : 00 and 14 : 00 h and time-of-day control (TDC) after 14 : 00 h for air conditioning (A/C) and lighting systems. PCT realized an overall reduction of 3. 43 MW, a saving of 11. 7 % of the buildings peak power demand; while TDC realized a total savings of 8. 67 MW at 15 : 00 h, a saving of 30. 7 % of the buildings peak power demand at that hour. The temperature build up inside the buildings due to PCT and TDC was within the acceptable range, which validated the technical viability of these measures. The implementation of the innovative approach in the eight governmental buildings with a total measured peak demand of 29. 3 MW achieved a reduction of 8. 89 MW. This power is now available to other users leading to financial savings of $ 13. 5 million for the nation towards the cost of constructing new power plants and distribution network equipment. More importantly, this reduction in peak power demand of well over 30 % involved zero or limited expenditure. A nationwide implementation of this innovative approach in all the governmental and institutional buildings is likely to reduce the national peak power demand by 154 MW which amounts to a capital savings of $ 232 million towards the cost of new power generation equipment and distribution network...|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} 2007 smart {{operation}} strategies for air-conditioning (A/C) and lighting systems were developed and {{tested in a}} number of governmental buildings in Kuwait as one of the solutions to reduce the national peak demand for electrical power that commonly occur around 15 : 00 h. The working hours for these building are generally between 07 : 00 and 14 : 00 h and their peak demand exceeds 600 MW. The smart operation strategies implemented in these buildings included <b>pre-closing</b> treatment (PCT) between 13 : 00 and 14 : 00 h and time-of-day control (TDC) after 14 : 00 h. Also de-lamping was carried out in some of the buildings to readjust the higher than recommended illumination levels. This paper presents the achievements of implementing these smart operations strategies in Justice Palace Complex (JPC) as a case study. The peak load of this building was 3700 kW. The achievements are summarized as an all time saving of 22 kW by de-lamping, an additional saving of 27 kW through TDC of lighting, direct savings between 13 : 00 and 22 : 00 h by closing supply and return air fans of 52 air-handling units with a connected load 400 kW, and an additional saving of 550 kW during the same period by optimizing the cooling production and distribution. In conclusion project achieved an overall reduction in power demand of around 20 % between 13 : 00 to 17 : 00 h and reduction ranging from 7 % to 15 % between 17 : 00 to 20 : 00 h...|$|E
