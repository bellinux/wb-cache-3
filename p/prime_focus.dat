5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by <b>Prime</b> <b>Focus</b> led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, <b>Prime</b> <b>Focus</b> was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{military}} standoff, Constantine confronted {{and defeated}} Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge outside Rome on October 28, 312; Maxentius {{retreated to the}} Tiber river and drowned. Constantine entered the city the next day, but declined {{to take part in}} the traditional ascent up the Capitoline Hill to the Temple of Jupiter. Constantine's army had advanced on Rome under a Christian sign. It had become, officially at least, a Christian army. Constantine's apparent conversion was visible elsewhere, too. Bishops dined at Constantine's table, and many Christian building projects began soon after his victory. On November 9, 312, the old headquarters of the Imperial Horse Guard were razed to make way for the Lateran Basilica.

5|$|Although many squadrons {{were raised}} at RAAF Station Laverton during World WarII, the base's <b>prime</b> <b>focus</b> {{continued}} to be its aircraft depot.

The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible {{for the maintenance of}} in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No.1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as B-17 Flying Fortresses.|$|E
5|$|Overseeing {{the visual}} effects {{department}} for New Moon was Susan MacLeod, {{who had previously}} worked with Weitz during the production of The Golden Compass. MacLeod enlisted Tippett Studio to create the computer generated wolves, while <b>Prime</b> <b>Focus</b> of Vancouver handled {{the effects of the}} vampires. To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves look real, Tippet artists studied wolf culture. They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves, such as their fat and tallness. In February 2009, a group of artists were able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, outside of Los Angeles, and see real wolves. The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating.|$|E

40|$|Smart Grids {{have been}} one of the <b>prime</b> <b>focuses</b> of studies for the past few years on power systems. The goal is to make the power {{infrastructure}} more reliable and effective to cater for the needs of the future. Another goal for improving the power infrastructure is to incorporate renewable energy sources in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The popularity of solar PV has increased in recent times which has lead to exponential growth in the installed solar PV. This paper compares four possible scenarios for incorporating household solar PV systems into the power grid. It discusses the properties of each scenario along with their advantages and disadvantages. An effective system layout can be obtained by choosing the suitable case for incorporation of solar home systems according to the requirements...|$|R
5|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{supervised}} by Tim Webber at the London-based VFX company Framestore, which {{was responsible for}} creating most of the film's visual effectsexcept for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the movie consisted of CGcompared to James Cameron's Avatar (2009), which was 60 percent CG. To simulate the authenticity and reflection of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CG at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at <b>Prime</b> <b>Focus,</b> London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.|$|E
5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by <b>Prime</b> <b>Focus</b> VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E

Then Condit produced a two-volume history of Chicago (Condit, 1973, 1974), books whose <b>prime</b> <b>foci</b> were architectural and technological, but which included {{a broad range of}} urban history as well. Many of the architectural masterpieces of the 1890s and 1920s were dilapidated or threatened by the 1950s, and Condit joined battles for their preservation where possible, often testifying at hearings on decisions about protecting landmark buildings. He also gave architectural tours of Chicago and frequently wrote newspaper and magazine pieces about the city's buildings.|$|R

We review studies investigating cognate and homograph processing in visual word perception and word production, auditory word perception using the visual world paradigm, and cross-language <b>priming,</b> <b>focusing</b> specifically on how differences in proficiency modulate co-activation during lexical access. We further discuss differences in L 2 proficiency in relation to immersion and age of L 2 acquisition, how differences in L 2 proficiency relate to neurocognitive aspects of cognitive control, and how changes in L 2 proficiency relative to L 1 proficiency may affect lexical processing...|$|R
