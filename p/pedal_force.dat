50|$|The older {{mechanically}} designed accelerator pedals {{not only}} provided a spring return, but the mechanism inherently provided some friction. This friction introduced mechanical hysteresis into the <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> versus pedal position transfer function. Put more simply, once the pedal {{was set at}} a specific position, the friction would help keep the pedal at this setting. This {{made it easier for}} the driver to maintain a pedal position. For example, if the driver's foot is slightly jostledby a bump in road, the accelerator pedal would tend to stay at its setting. While these old purely mechanical designs did have somefriction, the return spring force was always designed to overcome this friction with a considerable safety margin. The return spring force ensured that throttle returned to zero if the <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> applied by the driver was reduced or removed.|$|E

50|$|Brakes on a {{race car}} are {{imperative}} in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake <b>pedal</b> <b>force,</b> and vehicle deceleration. Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure. Brake performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes {{and they have not}} warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.|$|E
50|$|This {{force can}} be further {{increased}} by inserting a lever connected between the master piston, a pedal, and a pivot point. If {{the distance from the}} pedal to the pivot is three times the distance from the pivot to the connected piston, then it multiplies the <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> by a factor of 3, when pushing down on the pedal, so that 10 N becomes 30 N on the master piston and 120 N on the brake pad. Conversely, the pedal must move three times as far as the master piston. If we push the pedal 120 mm down, the master piston will move 40 mm and the slave piston will move the brake pad by 10 mm.|$|E
50|$|Cyclists {{typically}} have a cadence {{at which they}} feel most comfortable, and on bicycles with many gears {{it is possible to}} maintain a preferred cadence at a wide range of speeds. Recreational and utility cyclists typically cycle around 60-80 rpm. According to cadence measurement of 7 professional cyclists during 3 week races they cycle about 90 rpm during flat and long (~190 km) group stages and individual time trials of ∼50 km. During ∼15 km uphill cycling on high mountain passes they cycle about 70 rpm. Cyclists choose cadence to minimise muscular fatigue, and not metabolic demand, since oxygen consumption is lower at cadences 60-70 rpm. When cycling at 260 W, a <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> was the lowest at 90 rpm, lower than at 60, 75, 105 or 120 rpm. It is primarily due to increase of inertia of the crank with increasing cadence.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in muscle activity when subjects {{are asked to}} maintain a constant cadence during an unloaded condition. Eleven subjects pedaled for five loaded conditions (220 W, 190 W, 160 W, 130 W, 100 W) and one unloaded condition at 80 rpm. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of six lower limb muscles, <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> and oxygen consumption were calculated for every condition. Muscle activity was defined by timing (EMG onset and offset) and level (integrated values of EMGrms calculated between EMG onset and EMG offset) of activation, while horizontal and vertical impulses were computed to characterize <b>pedal</b> <b>forces.</b> Muscle activity, <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> and oxygen consumption variables measured during the unloaded condition were compared with those extrapolated to 0 W from the loaded conditions, assuming a linear relationship. The muscle activity was changed during unloaded condition: EMG onset and/or offset of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, vastus medialis, and gluteus maximus muscles were delayed (p < 0. 05); iEMGrms values of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior muscles were higher than those extrapolated to 0 W (p < 0. 05). Vertical impulse over the extension phase was lower (p < 0. 05) while backward horizontal impulse was higher (p < 0. 05) during unloaded condition than those extrapolated to 0 W. Oxygen consumptions were higher during unloaded condition than extrapolated to 0 W (750 ± 147 vs. 529 ± 297 mLO 2. min− 1; p < 0. 05). Timing of activation of rectus femoris and biceps femoris was dramatically modified to optimize <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> and maintain a constant cadence, while systematic changes in the activation level of the bi-articular muscles induced a relative increase in metabolic expenditure when pedaling during an unloaded condition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest on bicycle riding for recreation or fitness purpose. Bicycles are also accepted as urban transportation due to the consciousness of environmental protection. For a more comfortable riding experience, many bicycles are equipped with a suspension system including a front suspension fork and/or rear suspension. However, when a suspension system is added to a bicycle, it makes riding a little heavier since suspension dissipates some pedalling energy. This paper discusses front and rear suspensions corresponding to rider comfort and pedalling effort when riding on a rough road and smooth road. A human body computer model LifeMOD® is employed to model the cyclist. Dynamic analysis software ADAMS® is employed to analyze human body vibration and leg muscle forces of bicycle riding. Human body acceleration vs. vibration frequencies are used as the comfort criteria. The results show that a suspension system may effectively reduce high frequency vibration {{of the human body}} when riding on a rough road. <b>Pedalling</b> <b>forces</b> are mostly contributed by the biceps femoris and semitendinosus. The suspension system would increase the <b>pedaling</b> <b>forces</b> of femoris and semitendinosus. Other leg muscles have a minor effect on <b>pedaling</b> <b>forces.</b> Results obtained from this research are useful for the design of bicycle suspension systems with better comfort and less loss of pedalling efficiency...|$|R
50|$|However, unlike today's {{electrically}} powered fuel injection systems, the 300 SL's mechanical fuel pump {{would continue to}} inject gasoline into the engine during the interval between shutting off the ignition and the engine's coming to a stop; this unburned gasoline washed lubricating oil from the cylinder walls, which not only left them unprotected in affected areas during start-up but would dilute the engine's entire oil supply if the car was not driven hard or long enough to reach a sufficient temperature to evaporate the gas out of the oil. To reduce this dilution by gasoline when stopping the engine, the owner's manual advised Turn the ignition key to the left while idling. Do not on any account {{try to stop the}} engine at a higher speed. Exacerbating the problem was the engine's large racing-oriented oil cooler and enormous 10 L oil capacity, which virtually guaranteed the oil would not get hot enough. In practice, many owners would block off airflow through the oil cooler and stick rigidly to the appropriately low 1000 mi recommended oil change interval. An auxiliary fuel pump provided additional fuel for extended high speed operation or cold starts; overuse would also lead to dilution of the oil., Clutch operation was initially very heavy, remedied by an improved clutch arm helper spring which reduced <b>pedal</b> <b>force.</b> From March 1963 to the end of production later that year, a light alloy crankcase was used on a total of 209 vehicles.|$|E

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the staff at the Radlabor Freiburg (Radlabor GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) for the use of the {{laboratory}} facilities and for providing assistance with the measurement devices. In cycling, force applied to the pedal is conventionally measured using strain gauges or piezoelectric force transducers within the pedal body or at the crank. This thesis takes a different approach to determine <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> based on motion capturing. <b>Pedal</b> <b>force</b> is calculated as the sum of forces needed to overcome the resistance of the ergometer brake and the moment of inertia of the ergometer’s flywheel. The former is obtained from cadence and power measurements of the ergometer, the latter by means of flywheel inertia and angular acceleration of the crank. The crank angle was determined by tracking the pedal movement using motion capturing. Then the second derivative of the crank angle gave its angular acceleration. As noise inherent in measurement data causes serious problems when computing derivatives, the data was smoothed beforehand. Three smoothing techniques were applied: a Butterworth filter, a Kalman smoother, and singular spectrum analysis. The angular acceleration obtained by the three methods was similar. The analysis of the pedal motion data revealed that systematic errors and strong measurement noise prevent sufficiently accurate estimates of the angular acceleration of the crank. Therefore, the resulting <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> estimates differ considerably from the force obtained by a <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> measurement device (Powertec System). ii Kurzfassun...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For cycling, the {{analysis}} of the <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> is one of the important factors in the study of exercise ability assessment and overuse injuries. In past studies, a two-axis measurement sensor was used at the sagittal plane to measure the force only in the anterior, posterior, and vertical directions and to analyze the loss of force and the injury on the frontal plane due to the forces in the right and left directions. In this study, which is a basic study on diverse analyses of the <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> that consider the forces on the sagittal plane and the frontal plane, a three-axis <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> measurement sensor was developed to measure the anterior-posterior (Fx), medio-lateral (Fz), and vertical (Fy) forces. The sensor was fabricated with a size and shape {{similar to those of the}} general flat pedal, and had a 550 g weight that allowed smooth pedaling. Its measurement range was ± 1000 N for Fx and Fz and ± 2000 N for Fy, and its non-linearity, hysteresis, and repeatability were approximately 0. 5 %. The data were sampled at 1000 Hz using a signal collector. To use the developed sensor, the pedaling efficiency (index of efficiency, IE) and the range of left and right (medio-lateral, ML) forces were measured with two seat heights (low and high). The results of the measurement showed that the IE was higher and the force range in the ML direction was lower with the high position than with the low position. The developed measurement sensor and its application results will be useful in understanding and explaining the complicated pedaling technique, and will enable diverse kinematic analyses of the <b>pedal</b> <b>force</b> on the sagittal plane and the frontal plane...|$|E

40|$|AIM: It {{remains unclear}} if cyclists with better {{performance}} have less asymmetry. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing {{the relationship between}} cycling time trial performance and bilateral asymmetries in <b>pedal</b> <b>forces.</b> METHODS: Ten cyclists/triathletes performed an incremental cycling test to exhaustion to measure maximal oxygen uptake and power output. In a second session, bilateral <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> were acquired during a 4 -km cycling time trial on the stationary cycle ergometer. Resultant and effective forces were computed along with the index of effectiveness at 500 m sections of the time trial using instrumented pedals. Intra-limb variability and the asymmetry index were calculated for each force variable. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis assessed bilateral differences in <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> accounting for power output, pedalling cadence and oxygen uptake of each cyclist. Force variables did not change throughout the test (effective – P= 0. 98, resultant – P= 0. 90 and index of effectiveness – P= 0. 99) with larger force applied by the dominant limb (11 - 21 %). The relationship between asymmetries and performances was strong for the effective force (r=- 0. 72) but weak for the resultant force (r = 0. 01) and for the index of effectiveness (r=- 0. 29). Substantial asymmetries were observed for the effective force (36 - 54 %), resultant force (11 - 21 %) and for the index of effectiveness (21 - 32 %) at greater range than intra-limb variability (effective force = 8 - 22 %, resultant force = 5 - 10 % and index of effectiveness = 1 - 3 %). CONCLUSION: Larger asymmetries in effective force were related to better performances during the 4 -km time trial with low intra-limb variability for force measures suggesting consistence in asymmetries for individual cyclists...|$|R

Gross (GE) and net (NE) muscular efficiency, angular impulses and pedalling effectiveness during the whole pedal revolution (IF 360) and during the downstroke phase (IE 180) were investigated. Angular impulses were not related to either VO 2 or the muscular efficiency. IE 360 was not correlated with either VO 2 or muscular efficiencies, while IE 180 was significantly negatively correlated with VO 2 (r(2) = 0. 51) and positively related with NE (r(2) = 0. 49). The inter-individual differences in crank torque production, as investigated by angular impulse values, did not explain inter-individual differences in muscular efficiency. The lack of relationships between VO 2 or muscular efficiencies and IE 360 could be due to the fact that IE 360 is equally influenced by both low and high <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> produced during the upstroke and downstroke phases, respectively, while metabolic energy is mainly consumed during high <b>pedal</b> <b>forces</b> of the downstroke phase.
