40|$|Strong {{interest}} in applying wireless sensing technologies within structural monitoring systems {{has grown in}} recent years. Wireless sensors are capable of passively collecting response measurements of a dynamic structural system at low-costs. However, the role of wireless sensing within structural monitoring systems can be expanded if sensors are provided a direct interface to the physical system {{in which they are}} installed. Capable of exciting a structural system through actuators, a wireless “active ” sensor would be a valuable tool in structural control and damage detection applications. In this study, a wireless active sensing unit is proposed and fabricated. After fabrication of a prototype, a series of validation tests are conducted to assess the unit’s performance. A piezoelectric <b>pad</b> <b>mounted</b> to an aluminum plate is commanded by the wireless active sensing unit to impart lowenergy Lamb waves in the plate surface. Simultaneously, the same unit collects response measurements obtained from a second piezoelectric pad also surface mounted to the plate. To illustrate the potential of the wireless active sensing unit to locally perform system identification analyses, the computational core is provided the task of calculating autoregressive time-series models using input-output time-history data collected from the excited system...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{research}} has been conducted on inconsistencies relating to whole-body vibration (WBV) field assessments. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate a certain possible contributor to inconsistencies in vibration assessment work, namely averaging intervals. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the effect of multiple averaging approaches on WBV results. WBV parameters were measured for a driver operating a vehicle on a preselected test route utilising ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997. This was achieved utilizing a Quest HavPro vibration monitor with a fitted tri-axial Integrated Circuit Piezoelectric (ICP) accelerometer <b>pad</b> <b>mounted</b> on the driver’s seat. Furthermore, in an attempt to decrease differences between observed WBV results, an outlier detection method, part of the STATA software package was utilised to clean the data. Statistical analyses included hypothesis testing in the form of one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks to determine significant differences between integration intervals. Logged data time-series durations showed a W 0 = 0. 04, therefore indicating unequal variance. Omission of 60 s from statistical analyses showed a W 0 = 0. 28. The observed difference occurs when data is averaged over longer intervals, resulting in portions of data not being reflected in the final dataset. In addition, frequency-weighted root mean squared acceleration results reflected significant differences between 1 s, 10 s, 30 s, 60 s and SLOW averaging approaches, while non-significant differences were observed for crest factors and instantaneous peak accelerations. Vibration Dose Value results reflected non-significant differences after omission of 60 second averaging interval data. Cleaned data showed significant differences between various averaging approaches as well as significant differences when compared with raw vibration data. The study therefore outlined certain inconsistencies pertaining to the selection of multiple integration intervals during the assessment of WBV exposure. Data filtering could not provide a conclusion on a suitable averaging period and as such, further research is required to determine the correct averaging interval to be used for WBV assessment.

50|$|A Distribution Transformer Monitor (DTM) is a {{specialized}} hardware device that collects and measures information relative to electricity passing into {{and through a}} distribution transformer. The DTM is typically retrofit onto pole top and <b>pad</b> <b>mount</b> transformers. A pole top (above ground) or <b>pad</b> <b>mount</b> (below ground) transformer commonly powers anywhere from 5-8 homes in the US and is the last voltage transition in stepping down voltage before {{it gets to the}} home or business. Standard positioning of DTM devices occurs at the transformer bushings, but sometimes they are attached directly onto the secondary electricity lines. DTM devices commonly consist of highly accurate non-piercing or piercing sensors, onboard communications modules to transmit information, and a power supply provision. The DTM device reports to a collection engine, and/or existing SCADA/MDM system where relevant transformer data is stored and presented to the user; analytics platforms are oftentimes employed to interpret the information being captured and reported by the DTM.|$|R
