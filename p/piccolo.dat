5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian <b>Piccolo</b> {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with <b>Piccolo</b> and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with <b>Piccolo,</b> a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and <b>Piccolo</b> were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. <b>Piccolo</b> helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E

50|$|Edward Force {{wrote that}} Schuco's first {{consistent}} foray into diecast toys was in 1958 when the 1:90 scale 'Piccolo' series was introduced (Force 1990, pp. 216, 219). These solid metal (and heavy) cars were accurate, yet mildly cartoonish {{at the same}} time. <b>Piccolos</b> were solid cast metal without plastic windows nor did they have interiors. <b>Piccolos</b> are highly collectible today, whether the original models or the later Schuco reproductions.

5|$|Nearly all soprano and <b>piccolo</b> {{clarinets}} have keywork {{enabling them}} to play the E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation that sounds D3 on a soprano clarinet or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a <b>piccolo</b> clarinet), though some B clarinets go down to E3 {{to enable them to}} match the range of the A clarinet. On the B soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E

5|$|The Requiem employs an {{orchestra}} of two flutes, <b>piccolo,</b> two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three percussionists and strings. It requires a chorus to match. Reger himself wrote a version for piano.|$|E
5|$|The cantata in six {{movements}} is scored {{for three}} vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, trumpet, flauto <b>piccolo</b> (descant recorder in D), two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola and continuo.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata {{at least three}} times, first on 8 October 1724, a second time probably on 24 October 1734 when the sopranino {{was replaced by a}} violino <b>piccolo,</b> and a third time probably on 1 October 1740. The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff suggested performances in 1744/47, Klaus Hofmann in 1747, when the corno part was given to a trombone.|$|E

The Oregon Symphony last performed the overture in January 1990, under Norman Leyden. The work, which is approximately 15 minutes in length, employs two flutes, <b>piccolo,</b> two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two cornets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, five percussionists, strings.|$|E
5|$|Forte Tre Sassi (or Forte Tra i Sassi) is a {{fortress}} constructed in 1897 during the Austro-Hungarian period on the Passo Valparola. It lies between Sass de Stria and <b>Piccolo</b> Lagazuoi, dominating the passage between the Passo Falzarego and Val Badia in South Tyrol (Alto Adige). It {{was part of}} the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian border {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} {{of the work is}} about 35 minutes. The score calls for one <b>piccolo,</b> three flutes (third doubling second <b>piccolo),</b> one alto flute, four oboes (fourth doubling second English horn), English horn, three clarinets in B and A (third doubling second bass clarinet), clarinet in E and D, one bass clarinet, four bassoons (fourth doubling second contrabassoon), one contrabassoon; eight horns (seventh and eighth doubling tenor Wagner tubas), trumpet in D, four trumpets in C (fourth doubling bass trumpet in E), two trombones, one bass trombone, two bass tubas; a percussion section with 5 timpani (requiring two players), bass drum, tam-tam, triangle, tambourine, cymbals, antique cymbals in A and B, güiro; and strings. Despite the large orchestra, much of the score is written chamber-fashion, with individual instruments and small groups having distinct roles.|$|E

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and <b>piccolo</b> (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 12 August 1714. When he performed {{it again in}} Leipzig on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity in 1723 (8 August) {{it was the first}} solo cantata and the most operatic work which he had presented to the congregation up to that point. He made revisions for that performance, such as transposing it from C minor to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello <b>piccolo.</b> In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after the sermon.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{first and}} last are set for choir, while the inner movements are set for soloists, in a sequence of aria – chorale – recitative – aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: two oboes (Ob), oboe da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), violoncello <b>piccolo</b> (Vp) and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 26 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The Meiningen cantatas of Johann Ludwig Bach {{were scored}} {{for the four}} vocal parts and {{a small group of}} instrumentalists, {{consisting}} of two oboes, violins, violas and continuo: at Meiningen, as with many of the smaller courts in Germany, resources were limited; it appears that continuo instruments like bassoons were available only when these works were performed elsewhere. When Bach performed his cousin's cantatas in Leipzig in 1726, he used the same orchestral forces as Meiningen for all but two, adding trumpets with drums in one and <b>piccolo</b> trumpets in another.|$|E
5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling <b>piccolo),</b> 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E
5|$|His {{friendship}} with Bears teammate Brian <b>Piccolo,</b> {{who died of}} cancer in 1970, inspired Sayers to write his autobiography, I Am Third, which in turn was the basis for the 1971 made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 at age 34, and remains the youngest person to receive the honor. He was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary Team as a halfback and kick returner, the only player to occupy two positions on the team. For his achievements in college, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the same year. His jersey number is retired by both the Bears and the University of Kansas. Following his NFL career, Sayers began a career in sports administration and business, and served as the athletic director of Southern Illinois University from 1976 to 1981.|$|E
