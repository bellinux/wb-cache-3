5|$|On 5 June 1946, Boeing's Model 462, a straight-wing {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} six Wright T35 turboprops with a gross weight of 360,000pounds (160,000kg) and a combat radius of 3,110miles (2,700nmi, 5,010km), was declared the winner. On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale mock-up of the new XB-52 and do <b>preliminary</b> <b>engineering</b> and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to express concern about {{the sheer size of}} the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified design requirements. In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Planning of Monastery Road (Township Road209) {{improvements}} began in2003. At that time, $3.8million {{in state}} funding was {{set aside for}} the project, but the Ohio Department of Transportation(ODOT) did not receive the money until2005. By2007, most of the earmarked money was spent on <b>preliminary</b> <b>engineering</b> and planning. Without the money, Morgan Township officials could not afford to upgrade the road, andODOT was barred from spending money on local roads. In2011, deputy director Steve Williams devised a new plan that made the township road a state route, and Morgan Township officials transferred the road to ODOT.|$|E

The first phase was originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur from Third Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets.

5|$|In 1971, the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study {{completed}} by the Dade County metropolitan planning organization recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for Greater Miami. Having experienced a prolonged post-World War II population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States. Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) bond dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the Florida Legislature for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with <b>preliminary</b> <b>engineering</b> completed for the system, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA, then, the Urban Mass Transit Administration) committed 80% of the costs for {{the first stage of}} rapid transit system, with the county and state incurring the remaining cost. In the end the system cost over a billion dollars.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2001, the Federal Transit Administration {{approved}} {{the start of}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>engineering</b> on a full-length Second Avenue Subway. The MTA's final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was approved in April 2004; this latest proposal is for a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, down Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District. The final plan called for the full-length Second Avenue line to carry two services: the T, with a route emblem colored , {{as well as a}} rerouted Q train. Phase 1 rerouted the Q, the Broadway Express via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to the Upper East Side at 96th Street. Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. In Phase Three, the new T train will run from 125th Street to Houston Street.
