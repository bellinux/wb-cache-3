40|$|Spectralon is an {{extremely}} stable, near-perfect lambertian <b>reflecting</b> <b>diffuser</b> and calibration standard material {{that has been used}} by national labs, space, aerospace and commercial sectors for over two decades. New uncertainty targets of 2 % on-orbit absolute validation in the Earth Observing Systems community have challenged the industry to improve is characterization and knowledge of almost every aspect of radiometric performance (space and ground). Assuming “near perfect” reflectance and BRDF performance is no longer going to suffice for many program needs. To ensure lowest possible uncertainty, Spectralon has NVLAP accreditation for total hemispherical spectral reflectance measurements. The hemispherical reflectance provides a good mark of general performance, but without the angular characterization critical data is missing from many applications. Therefore, BRDF measurement capability is needed to characterize Spectralon’s “near perfect” angular response and provide a full uncertainty profile to many users. A preliminary data set will be presented on of materials, instrument capability and resulting measurements. Further data, a paper and complete analysis on products for traceable radiometric BRDF calibration standards will be presented later this year at SPIE Remote Sensing Asia (Oct 13 - 17, Beijing) ...|$|R

30|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. TiO 2 is unique because it efficiently scatters visible light, thereby imparting whiteness, brightness, and opacity when incorporated into a coating. Dry compacted TiO 2 samples are characterized by their brightness and whiteness and exhibit reflectance properties approaching that of the <b>perfect</b> <b>reflecting</b> <b>diffuser.</b> ‘Color’ is carefully controlled during the TiO 2 manufacturing process through the removal of the trace amounts of metal oxide contaminants. These light-absorbing contaminants will detract from the brightness and whiteness of the pigment and can affect the appearance of white and near-white paints containing that pigment. The opacity of white pigments mainly derives from the scattering, while the opacity of black pigments is a result of absorption ability[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was observed that if the TiO 2 is produced in a commercial production plant on particular days when there is oil leak in the larox filter, the color and brightness of the produced pigment failed when measured the same in acrylic lacquer paint (vehicle b). Also, this failure is not seen when the color and brightness are measured in dry mode (dry b). These observations were not a single case but were seen occasionally in the quality analysis. The failure in the vehicle color, once commenced, was seen continued consecutively with three to four final products. The sources of oil contamination during the manufacturing process can be as follows: In the chloride process of manufacturing TiO 2, rutile or high-grade ilmenite is converted to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) gas. The conversion takes place in a chlorinator (i.e., fluidized bed reactor) in the presence of chlorine gas at 850 °C to 950 °C, with petroleum coke added as a reductant. The chief reaction products are volatile metal chlorides, including TiCl 4, which are collected. The nonvolatile chlorides and the unreacted solids that remain in the chlorinator are wasted, forming the special waste stream ‘chloride process waste solids’. The gaseous raw product stream is purified to separate the titanium tetrachloride from other chlorides. Separation is by fractional condensation, double distillation, and chemical treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) is removed as a major acidic liquid waste stream through fractional condensation. Additional trace metal chlorides are removed through double distillation. Finally, vanadium oxychloride (VOCl 3), which has a boiling point close to that of TiCl 4 (136 °C), is removed as a low-volume non-special waste by complexing with mineral oil and reduced with hydrogen sulfide to VOCl 2 or by complexing with copper. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized to TiO 2 at 985 °C, driving off chlorine gas, which is recycled to the chlorinator. Aluminum chloride is added in the oxidation step to promote formation of the rutile crystal which is the TiO 2 product. The next stage of TiO 2 manufacturing is surface treatment, where the TiO 2 from oxidizer is converted to slurry in water, which is then subjected to sand milling to the required particle size. The clarified slurry from the sand mill is treated with alumina or zirconia for coating the surface of bare titanium dioxide with amorphous aluminum or zirconium oxide. The surface-treated product is then filtered through larox by pressing and followed by organic treatment and spin flash drying. Finally, the dried product is subjected to micronization process to get the surface-treated product. The brightness and color of this product is important for its marketing.|$|E

Next, we consider the presence of perfect mirrors and impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on such surfaces. In the presence of a single mirror the transition rate for the symmetric state undergoes a slight reduction, whereas for the antisymmetric state our results indicate a slightly enhancement.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, the {{measurement}} of sound absorption coefficient of novel sustainable fibrous materials is investigated. Nowadays {{the use of such}} materials is becoming wider for various applications, being ecological, biodegradable and renewable: they differ from traditional fibrous materials, as rock or glass wool, for their very low toxicity and polluting effects. These materials can be used in many ways: noise mitigation and building acoustic correction are surely among the most important. Sound absorbing layers made of natural fibres and of recycled raw materials have been tested in the reverberation room of the Acoustics Laboratory of the University of Perugia according to ISO 354 standard, in order to quantify their sound absorption properties and to make a comparison with traditional fibrous sound absorbers. An optimization of the reverberation room characteristics has been also carried out. Good sound field diffusivity inside the room is a fundamental requirement for {{the measurement}} accuracy. Among the parameters that mainly affect room diffusivity are the room shape and the sample disposition inside the room. In order to obtain accurate values of the sound absorption coefficient, specific actions were adopted. Test specimens were placed on the floor with edges nonparallel to the room walls. A partial closing of the lower room corners with absorbing and <b>reflecting</b> <b>diffusers</b> and suspended plane diffusers were also tested, obtaining a significant improvement of the results. The measured performance of the tested materials seems to be fully comparable with that of mineral wool fibres: because of their low impacts on the environment and the human health they {{can be seen as a}} valid alternative to conventional materials. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the dissolved and excess particulate Ba distribution (Ba xs, {{an estimate of}} biogenic Ba considered to consist mainly of barite [BaSO 4]) across the complex frontal system of the Crozet-Kerguelen Basin (Southern Ocean; 42 - 47 °S, 62 - 65 °E). Ba xs profiles show the characteristic mesopelagic maximum (depth range between 150 and 400 m) reaching up to 1000 pM in the Subantarctic Zone and Subtropical Front, the highest value observed for Southern Ocean mesopelagic waters. Dissolved Ba (concentrations between 38 and 104 nM) correlates with silicate and alkalinity, but the regression is not <b>perfect,</b> <b>reflecting</b> the involvement of different biogenic carriers in {{the control of the}} water column distribution of these compounds. Dissolved Ba in the upper 500 m appears strongly influenced by cross-frontal exchanges, involving both northward and southward transport of water masses. In the mesopelagic waters (150 - 400 m) of the Polar Front Zone, a dissolved Ba depletion faces the Ba xs maximum. This depletion appears mainly maintained by cross-frontal advection of waters containing less Ba and originating north of the Subantarctic Front. Overall, no clear evidence that precipitation of barite reflected by the occurrence of Ba xs maxima does measurably influence the distribution of dissolved Ba was found...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{emitted by}} a black hole (BH) during its evaporation has to have some degree of quantum coherence to accommodate a unitary time evolution. We parametrize the degree of coherence {{by the number of}} coherently emitted particles $N_{coh}$ and show that it is severely constrained by the equivalence principle. We discuss, in this context, the fate of a shell of matter that falls into a Schwarzschild BH. Two points of view are considered, that of a stationary external observer and that of the shell itself. From the perspective of the shell, the near-horizon region has an energy density proportional to $N_{coh}^ 2 $ in Schwarzschild units. So, if $N_{coh}$ is parameterically larger than the square root of the BH entropy $S_{BH}^ { 1 / 2 }$, a firewall or more generally a "wall of smoke" forms and the equivalence principle is violated while the BH is still semiclassical. To have a degree of coherence that is parametrically smaller than $S_{BH}^{ 1 / 2 }$, one has to introduce a new sub-Planckian gravitational length scale, which likely also violates the equivalence principle. And so our previously proposed model which has $N_{coh}=S_{BH}^{ 1 / 2 }$ is singled out. From the external-observer perspective, we find that the time it takes for the information {{about the state of the}} shell to get re-emitted from the BH is inversely proportional to $N_{coh}$.
