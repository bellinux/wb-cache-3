5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, drawer fronts, or face frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its veneer core, often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or high-pressure laminate {{but only if the}} edge profile is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with high-pressure laminate. Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore <b>pattern,</b> <b>variable</b> absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or wood fillers that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and sanding through the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} landscape patterns on spatial ecological processes by simulating these processes in computer-generated landscapes with varying composition and configuration. To generate such landscapes, various neutral landscape models have been developed. However, the limited set of landscape-level <b>pattern</b> <b>variables</b> included in these models is often inadequate to generate landscapes that reflect real landscapes. In order to achieve more flexibility and variability in the generated landscapes patterns, a more complete set of class- and patch-level <b>pattern</b> <b>variables</b> should be implemented in these models. These enhancements have been implemented in Landscape Generator (LG), which is a software that uses optimization algorithms to generate landscapes that match user-defined target values.

First, we used LG to recreate landscape patterns from a real landscape (i. e., a mountainous region in Switzerland). Second, we generated landscape series with incrementally changing <b>pattern</b> <b>variables,</b> which could be used in ecological simulation studies. We found that LG was able to recreate landscape patterns that approximate those of real landscapes. Furthermore, we successfully generated landscape series {{that would not have been}} possible with traditional neutral landscape models.

40|$|This study investigates {{socialization}} {{and ideal}} {{expectations for the}} health professional role {{in the provision of}} quality terminal care. Guiding the research are role theory, socialization theory, and Talcott Parsons 2 ̆ 7 (1951) <b>pattern</b> <b>variables.</b> The research was conducted in three phases. The first phase involved development of an analytical framework elaborating upon Parsons 2 ̆ 7 five <b>pattern</b> <b>variables,</b> which were first conceptualized as dimensions describing the ways in which roles could vary. Specific indicators for each of the <b>pattern</b> <b>variables</b> were developed. Typologies characterizing (1) the medical, or conventional, model and (2) the holistic model (specifically, the hospice model) for the provision of health care based on these indicators then were developed. Using the analytical framework, the second and third phases consisted of: (1) a content analysis of the physician and nurse socialization literature to determine the role prescriptions learned by these health professionals; and (2) a content analysis of open-ended interviews with a group (N = 94) of terminally ill elderly patients (n = 17), family members (n = 38), and health professionals (n = 39) from 10 urban health care programs (five conventional and five hospice) to identify ideal role expectations for the health professional. Major findings were that: (1) Parsons 2 ̆ 7 <b>pattern</b> <b>variables,</b> with elaboration, can provide a useful framework for role analysis; (2) physicians and nurses appear to be socialized to a number of role prescriptions consistent with the medical model, although there is evidence of conflicting socialization (to both models) for some role prescriptions; (3) respondents 2 ̆ 7 expectations generally were consistent with those prescribed by the hospice model with some notable exceptions; (4) the role expectations of the three groups of respondents were more congruent than was expected, although subgroups 2 ̆ 7 (conventional versus hospice) expectations tended to differ. Implications of the findings for: (1) role analysis; (2) socialization of health professionals to minimize role strain and conflict with patients and families; (3) continued implementation of conventional and hospice models for the provision of quality terminal care; (4) assessment of the quality of terminal care are explored; and (5) further research are explored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Granular {{computing}} {{and fuzzy}} sets concepts are proposed {{here as a}} novel method to process speckle images stacks in a fast and natural way. Speckle images are the result of scanning a phenomenon that occurs when a beam of coherent light illuminates a sample in which there is any type of activity, not visible, which produces a <b>pattern</b> <b>variable</b> in time. This process has been applied to the drying of paints without contact. The proposed methodology evaluates the intensity variations, considering the uncertainties proper of the phenomenon, being necessary only few images to characterize the activity. In many manufacturing processes it is of great importance the automation of the thickness evaluation in fresh film coatings. Examples about drying of paint process and activity images in paint layers are presented. The results obtained show that this methodology requires less information and computational efforts than the usual methods and also allows almost real time processing. This granular computing approach should be of interest in automatic processes, adding quality test spots of fresh films to improve the performance of the painting tasks...|$|E

40|$|Background: The immune system, {{a complex}} set of {{integrated}} responses, often cannot be explained, predicted, or monitored by examining its separate components as biomarkers. Combining different components may therefore be a suitable approach to develop relevant biomarkers reflecting immune system functioning in an appropriate way. Methods: Here we compute and test pattern variables that should reflect immune system functioning on the systems level. Computation was based on a dataset (from a randomized controlled trial comparing two routes of administration) of allergen-specifically induced expression levels of cytokines IL- 1 beta, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 17, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and symptom severity scores from 22 seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients measured before and after six weeks of treatment with medicinal products containing Citrus and Cydonia.

40|$|Patterns, {{sequences}} of variables, have traditionally only been studied when morphic images of them appear as factors in words. In this thesis, we initiate {{a study of}} patterns in words that appear as subwords of words. We say that a pattern appears in a word if each <b>pattern</b> <b>variable</b> can be morphically mapped to {{a factor in the}} word. To gain insight into the complexity of, and similarities between, words, we define pattern indices and distances between two words relative a given set of patterns. The distance is defined as the minimum number of pattern insertions and/or removals that transform one word into another. The pattern index is defined as the minimum number of pattern removals that transform a given word into the empty word. We initially consider pattern distances between arbitrary words. We conjecture that the word distance is computable relative the pattern αα and prove a lemma in this direction. Motivated by patterns detected in certain scrambled ciliate genomes, we focus on double occurrence words (words where every symbol appears twice) and consider recursive patterns, a generalization of the notion of a pattern which includes new types of words. We show that in double occurrence words the distance relative so-called complete sets of recursive patterns is computable. In particular, the pattern distance relative patterns αα (repeat words) and ααR (return words) is computable for double occurrence words. We conclude by applying pattern indices and word distances towards the analysis of highly scrambled genes in O. trifallax and discover a common pattern...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In {{asthmatic}} patients methacholine or histamine challenge {{may result}} in more rapid and shallow breathing. Bronchoconstriction can also be associated with changes {{in the pattern of}} breathing. However, few studies, particularly in patients with asthma, have investigated the possibility that changes in the pattern of breathing may precede the onset of bronchoconstriction. METHODS [...] Eight subjects were selected from 34 consecutive asthmatic patients who had previously exhibited a significant increase in respiratory frequency (Rf) and decrease in tidal volume (VT) accompanying a 20 % or greater fall in FEV 1 during a histamine bronchial provocation test. These patients also had bronchial hyperresponsiveness (histamine PC 20 FEV 1 0. 1 - 0. 25 mg/ml). VT, Rf, and the ratio of VT to Rf were evaluated breath by breath under control conditions and two minutes after inhalation of either saline or each of a series of progressively increasing concentrations of histamine. In each subject the coefficient of variation (CV) for each breathing <b>pattern</b> <b>variable</b> was calculated under control conditions and at each histamine concentration over at least 30 - 40 breaths. For FEV 1, VT and Rf step by step coefficients of variation were averaged and the mean (2 SD) CV was considered to represent a threshold value in each patient. RESULTS [...] Histamine challenge resulted in increased Rf and Rf/VT, and decreased VT and FEV 1. In all but one subject change in Rf and Rf/VT beyond the threshold value preceded change in FEV 1 beyond the threshold value. The threshold concentrations of histamine for Rf and Rf/VT did not correlate with the threshold value for FEV 1. CONCLUSIONS [...] In selected asthmatic patients a change in breathing pattern occurs prior to a change in FEV 1. These results suggest that narrowing of the airways, in terms of decrease in FEV 1, does not play a major part in the initial change in the pattern of breathing. This may be caused by direct stimulation of vagal airway receptors...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{cross-sectional}} {{study examined the}} mutual independent associations of sedentary behavior, lower intensity physical activity (LPA) and higher intensity physical activity HPA (an approximation of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF). METHODS: 2, 024 participants were included from The Maastricht Study (mean+/-SD age: 59. 7 +/- 8. 1 years, 49. 6 % men). With the activPAL 3 activity monitor we assessed sedentary time (ST), sedentary <b>pattern</b> <b>variables</b> (number of sedentary breaks, average sedentary bout duration, and number of prolonged sedentary bouts (>/= 30 min)), LPA, and HPA. CRF was calculated as maximum power output per kg body mass (Wmax kg) estimated from a sub-maximal cycle ergometer test. Linear regression analyses and isotemporal substitution analyses were used to examine associations of ST, sedentary <b>pattern</b> <b>variables,</b> and HPA with CRF. Analyses were stratified by sex. RESULTS: One hour of ST per day {{was associated with a}} lower Wmax kg: Bmen= - 0. 03 (95 % CI: - 0. 05;- 0. 01) and Bwomen= - 0. 02 (- 0. 04; 0. 00), independent of HPA. No statistically significant associations between sedentary <b>patterns</b> <b>variables</b> and CRF were observed. LPA was associated with a higher Wmax kg: Bmen = 0. 12 (0. 07; 0. 17) and Bwomen= 0. 12 (0. 07; 0. 18). HPA was associated with a higher Wmax kg: Bmen = 0. 48 (0. 38; 0. 58) and Bwomen= 0. 27 (0. 18; 0. 36). Replacing ST with LPA (Bmen = 0. 08 (0. 03; 0. 14), Bwomen= 0. 10 (0. 05; 0. 16)) or with HPA (Bmen = 0. 49 (0. 39; 0. 59), Bwomen= 0. 28 (0. 19; 0. 36)), but not with standing was associated with higher CRF.
