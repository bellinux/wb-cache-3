40|$|We {{report on}} the design, {{fabrication}} and measurement of ultra-thin film Silicon On Insulator (SOI) Schottky photo-detector cells with nanostructured plasmonic arrays, demonstrating broadband enhanced photocurrent generation using aperiodic golden angle spiral geometry. Both golden angle spiral and periodic arrays of various center-to-center particle spacing were investigated to optimize the photocurrent enhancement. The <b>primary</b> <b>photocurrent</b> enhancement region is designed for the spectral range 600 nm- 950 nm, where photon absorption in Si is inherently poor. We demonstrate that cells coupled to spiral arrays exhibit higher photocurrent enhancement compared to optimized periodic gratings structures. The findings are supported through coupled-dipole numerical simulations of radiation diagrams and finite difference time domain simulations of enhanced absorption in Si thin-films...|$|E

The <b>primary</b> <b>photocurrent</b> enhancement occurs in the spectral range from 550 nm to 800 nm. We use angle-resolved photocurrent spectroscopy {{to confirm that the}} enhanced absorption is due to coupling to guided modes supported by the cell. Full-field electromagnetic simulation of the absorption in the active a-Si:H layer agrees well with the experimental results. Furthermore, the nanopatterns were fabricated via an inexpensive, scalable, and precise nanopatterning method. These results should guide design of optimized, non-random nanostructured back reflectors for thin film solar cell...|$|E
40|$|A photoelectrochemical alcohol {{biosensor}} {{was designed}} through photonic wiring of alcohol oxidase (AOx) onto conducting polymer of 4 -(2, 5 -di(thiophen- 2 -yl) - 1 H-pyrrol- 1 -yl) benzenamine (SNS-NH 2) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified gold slides. The photoelectrochemical biosensors utilize a photonically wired electrode that oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes. Three different alcohols namely methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol {{were used as}} the substrates. In the presence of different concentrations of <b>primary</b> alcohol, the <b>photocurrents</b> were obtained by irradiating of the photoelectrochemical cell containing P(SNS-NH 2) /AOx/CNT/[Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + electrode as the anode under air. The bipyridine complex [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + was used to activate photoinduced electron-transfer reaction and it acted as a redox mediator to activate the bioelectrocatalytic functions of AOx. Therefore, it was shown the photonic electrontransfer wiring of AOx with the electrode. Sensitivity experiments, optimum pH value, operational stabilization and shelf life of the photoelectrochemical biosensor were investigated. Finally, the photoelectrochemical biosensors were used for alcohol detection in real samples...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{photovoltaics}} (OPV) {{have the}} potential to be a flexible and low-cost form of carbon-neutral energy production. However, many of the underlying physical mechanisms that dictate the behavior of OPVs remain frustratingly obscure in comparison to the well-understood physics of inorganic semiconductors. This dissertation centers around the development of new techniques to characterize the behavior of excitons in organic semiconductors, both in the bulk and at interfaces. We first examine the method of spectrally-resolved photoluminescence quenching (SR-PLQ), the most convenient and powerful current technique for measuring the exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic semiconductors, and extend it to work with optically thin films. This allows for its application to a much wider range of materials and physical systems. The second part of the dissertation presents a further extension of the method of PL quenching to characterize non-ideal interfaces, those which block or quench only a fraction of incident excitons. This is used to understand the operation of a novel fullerene:wide energy gap material buffer in OPVs. In combination with charge transport and morphological studies, it is shown that the mixed buffer shows disproportionate benefits from the two materials; blocking excitons superlinearly with wide energy gap material concentration and still conducting charges efficiently even at very small (10 %) fullerene concentration. Finally, we extend the principles of PL quenching to characterize arbitrary interfaces, including those between materials with identical energy levels but different LD and exciton lifetime, and those between materials with small (~ 20 meV) energy offsets. These techniques allow us to finally resolve the ambiguity in the spin state of the exciton which serves as the <b>primary</b> source of <b>photocurrent</b> in C 60, one of the most important materials in current efficient OPVs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two areas in silicon photodetectors, the first being {{enhancing}} the sub-bandgap light absorption of IR wavelenghts in silicon, {{and the second}} being intrinsic signal amplification in silicon photodetectors. Both of these are achieved using heavily doped p-n junction devices which create localized states that relax the k-selection rule of indirect bandgap material. The probability of transitions between impurity band and the conduction/valence band {{would be much more}} efficient than the one between band-to-band transition. The waveguide-coupled epitaxial p-n photodetector was demonstrated for 1310 nm wavelength detection. Incorporated with the Franz-Keldysh effect and the quasi-confined epitaxial layer design, an absorption coefficient around 10 cm- 1 has been measured and internal quantum efficiency nearly 100 % at - 2. 5 V. The absorption coefficient is calculated from the wave function of the electron and hole in p-n diode. The heavily doped impurity wave function can be formulated as a delta function, and the quasi-confined conduction band energy states, and the wave function on each level can be obtained from the Silvaco software. The calculated theoretical absorption coefficient increases with the increasing applied bias and the doping concentration, which matches the experimental results. To solve the issues of large excess noise and high operation bias for avalanche photodiodes based on impact ionization, I presented a detector using the Cycling Excitation Process (CEP) for signal amplification. This can be realized in a heavily doped and highly compensated Si p-n junction, showing ultra high gain about 3000 at very low bias (< 4 V), and possessing an intrinsic, phonon-mediated regulation process to keep the device stable without any quenching device required in todayâ€™s Geiger-mode avalanche detectors. The CEP can be formulated with the rate equations in conduction bands and impurity states. The gain expression, which {{is a function of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>photocurrent</b> and related to the phonon absorption time, predicts the same trend of the gain increasing with temperature and decreasing with increasing <b>primary</b> <b>photocurrent...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was {{to find out whether}} surface plasmon {{absorption}} in small metal clusters could be of benefit for the photovoltaic efficiency of molecular organic solar cells. Starting point was the hypothesis that plasmon absorption of metal clusters in the electric field of an photovoltaically active contact may lead to a directed charge carrier emission. Silver clusters were prepared by evaporation of silver island films in vacuum followed by tempering. Thereby well separated clusters of nearly spherical geometry were formed which were embedded into photovoltaically active organic dye films made from zinc phthalocyanine and/or a methyl substituted perylene pigment with indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass as a front and gold as a back contact. The samples were investigated by optical and photocurrent spectroscopy as well as by electrical measurements. It was proven in this thesis that silver clusters embedded into the photovoltaically active contact formed at the junction of ITO and zinc phthalocyanine lead to a <b>primary</b> <b>photocurrent</b> exactly following both, the surface plasmon resonance of the silver clusters (in a region with negligible absorption in the dye film) and the direct absorption of the zinc phthalocyanine layer. This experimental result is explained using an energy model in which the cluster plasmon decay leads to the excitation of electrons followed by the directed emission in an electric field.
