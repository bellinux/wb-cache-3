Improving constructability of construction projects is the responsibility of all <b>project</b> stakeholders: <b>owners,</b> designers and contractors. The owners have the most authority in enforcing implementation of constructability, therefore their role in constructability improvement of construction projects is the most important. <b>Project</b> <b>owners</b> must be aware that the decisions that are made in the initial stages of planning and design are difficult and costly to change once construction begins. This paper describes a study how construction <b>project</b> <b>owners</b> integrate construction knowledge and experience into planning and design in existing practice; and their role in improving constructability.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of green building projects {{is often more}} difficult than non-green building projects thereby resulting in low project performance. In order to overcome the difficulties and improve the delivery performance of green building projects, there is need to explore the perceived relationship between motivation and owner commitment (OC) based on the self-determination theory (SDT) of motivation. However no previous research has empirically tested this relationship {{in the context of}} green building delivery performance. Therefore this study evaluated this relationship using survey data from 150 <b>project</b> <b>owners</b> of green building projects in the Australian building sector. Data obtained was analyzed using both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis of eight hypotheses (H 1 -H 8). The SEM results reveal that OC has direct positive relationship with traditional delivery performance (TDP). Additionally, only the internal motivation (INT) of <b>project</b> <b>owners</b> has direct positive relationship with sustainability delivery performance (SDP), and this relationship is partially mediated by OC. The external motivation (EXT) has no direct positive relationship with OC, and neither TDP nor SDP. The study concludes that OC helps to improve the TDP of green building projects, while the INT of <b>project</b> <b>owners</b> is required to increase their commitment (OC) towards improving the SDP of green building projects. In addition, the EXT of <b>project</b> <b>owners</b> is not effective to increase their commitment (OC), as well as not contributing to improve TDP and SDP of green building projects. Theoretically, the application of SDT of motivation helps to contribute to the knowledge of how to improve the delivery performance of green building projects in the field of construction management and engineering. Practically, this study will help <b>project</b> <b>owners</b> to contribute to improve the delivery performance of green building projects. This study also provides the direction in which policies for encouraging the development of green building projects and associated practices should take in both Australia and the US henceforth...|$|R
