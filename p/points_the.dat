5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{in the top}} fifteen positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage.

5|$|The table below {{shows the}} overall record of Nea Salamina in the Cypriot First Division from 1955 to 2013.

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Penguins in 2015, Sprong rejoined the Islanders for the {{remainder}} of the 2015–16 season. He played 33 games for the Islanders and recorded 46 <b>points.</b> <b>The</b> team made the playoffs, where Sprong scored a further 15 points before the team was eliminated in the second round. An injury sustained during practice with the Penguins during the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs kept Sprong out until January, 2017 when he rejoined Charlottetown. He only played 31 games that season, but finished with 59 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> highest points-per-game average in the entire league. He finished his career with the Islanders with the third goals and second most points in team history, and during the playoffs he tied the record for most career goals and broke the records for most assists and points. Sprong led the Islanders in scoring with 20 points in 12 games as the team lost in the third round of the playoffs, ending his junior career. Following that he was recalled again by the Penguins to train with them during their time in the NHL playoffs.|$|E
