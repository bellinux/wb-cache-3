They are divided among 3 great groups {{on the basis of}} the kind of Podzolic B horizon. Humic Podzols have a dark B horizon with a low iron content.

50|$|Brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> are a {{subdivision}} of the <b>Podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> in the British soil classification. Although classed with podzols {{because they have}} an iron-rich, or spodic horizon, they are, in fact intermediate between podzols and Brown earths. They are common on hilly land in western Europe, in climates where precipitation of more than about 900mm exceeds evapotranspiration for {{a large part of}} the year, and summers are relatively cool. The result is that leaching of the soil profile occurs; in which mobile chemicals are washed out of the topsoil, or A horizon, and accumulate lower down, in the B horizon.|$|R
50|$|In some podzols, the E {{horizon is}} absent—either masked by {{biological}} activity or obliterated by disturbance. Podzols {{with little or}} no E horizon development are often classified as brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils,</b> also called umbrisols or umbrepts.|$|R
5000|$|Brown earths have a {{long history}} of being a major {{grouping}} in most soil classifications. In France they have been included with [...] "sol brun acide", although these soils may tend to have more iron and aluminium in the B horizon, and tend to what, in the British classification, is called a brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil.</b> Brown earths are also classified in the German and Austrian soil taxonomy as [...] "Braunerde." [...] Braunerden are widespread and frequently occur on unconsolidated parent sand or loess parent materials. [...] "Parabraunerde" [...] is the classification for a brown earth with an elluvial horison above a slightly argillic, clayey illuvial horizon. This gives rise to a universal division of these, generally brown and well drained soils into the weakly leached brown earths - called cambisols in the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB); and more leached brown podzolic soils in which there is an orange-brown B horizon, but no pale leached horizon between the A and the B horizons. These are called Umbrisols in the WRB, and are particularly common in western Europe, covering large areas in NW Spain.|$|E

40|$|Soil cover {{transformation}} and changes of morphological and chemical properties of Albeluvisols in clear-cuttings of middle taiga spruce forests were studied. The observed changes in structure and properties of <b>podzolic</b> texturally-differentiated <b>soils</b> at cuttings of spruce {{forests in the}} middle taiga subzone do not cause their transition to any other soil type. Soil cover of secondary deciduous-coniferous forests which replace cut forests are characterized with a varied soil contour and {{a combination of the}} main type of <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> under undisturbed spruce forests. The increased surface hydromorphism in cut areas causes formation of complicated sub-types of <b>podzolic</b> texturally differentiated <b>soils</b> (<b>podzolic</b> surface-gley <b>soils</b> with microprofile of podzol) and enlarges their ratio (up to 35 – 38 %) in soil cover structure. Temporary soil over-wetting at the initial (5 – 10 years) stage of after-cutting self-restoring vegetation succession provides for soil gleyzation, improves yield and segregation of iron compounds, increases the migratory activity of humic substances. Low content and resources of total nitrogen in forest litters mark anthropogenic transformation processes of <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> at this stage. Later (in 30 – 40 years after logging), soils in cut areas still retain signs of hydromorphism. Forest litters are denser, less acidic and thick with a low weight ratio of organic carbon as compared with Albeluvisols of undisturbed spruce forest. The upper mineral soil horizons under secondary deciduous-coniferous forests contain larger amounts of total iron, its mobile (oxalate-dissolvable) components, and Fe-Mn-concretions...|$|R

40|$|The {{stage of}} growth at which three plant species, a grass, a legume and a cereal, absorbed {{initially}} non-exchangeable potassium (K) from two soils, a red podzolic and a krasnozem, was examined by sequential harvesting in a glasshouse experiment. Large amounts of {{were removed from the}} red <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> which contained greater amounts of micaceous material, in the order setaria > maize > lucerne. Uptake of K„ appeared insignificant after exchangeable K, as measured on the bulk soil, had been depleted by about 607 o, and its contribution to total plant uptake thereafter was independent of species. For setaria and maize, plant K concentrations at this time were above the critical level, so that K represents a potassium resource that can be exploited during normal growth of an appropriate species. Uptake of K from the krasnozem was relatively small. The red <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> yielded much more K than a similar soil in earlier experiments.

40|$|The {{dehydrogenase}} activity (an {{index of}} the total soil biological activity), sulphur content, pH and Corg were determined in technogenic soils of the former (1954 - 1994) sulphur mines in Ukraine (open pit and underground sulphur melting, Yavoriv and Nemyriv, respectively). The soils were neither managed nor reclaimed, and underwent natural self-restoration processes. Soils of former open pit sulphur mine showed Corg of 0. 07 - 1. 29 %, pH of 7 - 7. 9 and a high SO 4 -S content (1. 7 - 14. 7 g kg- 1).

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{research}} are mixed forests of spruce and fir {{in the area of}} NP Kopaonik, which belong to the community of spruce and fir - Abieti-Piceetum abietis Mišić et Popović, 1978. The basis {{for the study of the}} structural development and production potential of these forests are data from 12 sample plots, with the average size of 0. 18 ha. In terms of coenoecological affiliation all the sample plots belong to the group of ecological units - forests of spruce and fir (Abieti-Piceetum abietis, Mišić et Popović, 1978) on acid brown and brown podzolic soils, which are differentiated into 5 ecological units: Abieti-Piceetum abietis oxalidetosum on brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> Abieti-Piceetum abietis oxalidetosum on acid brown soil, Abieti-Piceetum abietis vaccinietosum on brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> Abieti-Piceetum abietis typicum on brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> and Abieti-Piceetum abietis Dr. ymetosum on brown pozolic soil. In structural terms, these forests are characterized by very diverse structural forms, ranging from the structure of even-aged stands to typical multi-storey, unevenaged-aged stands. The form of cumulative curves of tree distribution is in most cases determined by spruce as the dominant species. At the same time, thin and medium-thick trees dominate, while the presence of stems with large dimensions is minimal. The average volume of these forestse is 777 m 3 •ha- 1, with a mixture ratio of 0. 7 : 0. 3 in favor of spruce. The average value of the current volume increment is 14 m 3 •ha- 1, with a 68 % share of spruce and 32 % of fir. The percentage of increment ranges from 1. 6 % to 2. 5 % in all sample plots and is somewhat higher for fir. The site potential, stand characteristics and relations among the tree species have resulted in structural complexity, high productivity and ecological stability of these forests. Therefore, future forest management should avoid radical measures and procedures that would violate the established relationships and dynamic processes.
