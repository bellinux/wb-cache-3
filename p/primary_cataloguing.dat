40|$|EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile CHAIRED BY: The Task Force {{ran from}} July 2012 to May 2013. Its {{motivation}} and scope are detailed in sections 1 - 6 below. Final Report on EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile Task Force "The EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile Task Force (EFAP-TF) {{was launched in}} response to the recommendations from the deliverable D 3. 4 from Europeana V 1. 0. This deliverable asked for an application profile that would allow a better representation of the FRBR group 1 entities: work, expression, manifestation and item. Additionally, it was to be conceived as an application profile of FRBRoo where each intellectual contribution (e. g., in the publication process) and the related activity are treated as entities in their own right, and does not depend too much on the notion of a bibliographic record. As a starting point they suggested the mapping of FRBRoo and EDM offered by the CIDOC CRM working group. The aim of the EFAP-TF is to extend, correct or restrict this suggested mapping and provide examples {{for the use of the}} combined EDM and FRBRoo namespaces. " "This report delivers combined models in terms of properties and classes of EDM and FRBRoo illustrated by sample data. Smaller groups have worked on three different examples. The report also provides principles for modeling and mapping rules based on the experiments of the working groups. " Find the report and its annexes below: Details of the annexes: Hamlet examples Musical work examples Don Quixote example Available at [URL] and archived here 1. MOTIVATION The deliverable Final Technical & Logical Architecture and future work recommendations (D 3. 4) from Europeana V 1. 0, WP 3 makes the following statement: "The distinction between the work, expression, manifestation and item will be relevant for the resources that are aggregated in Europeana. Functionality may be required to group results under the work level (e. g. all copies of all digital files in any format that contain all performances of a composition), under the expression level (e. g. all digital files in any format of a particular performance of a composition), or under the manifestation level (e. g. all digital files in a particular format of a particular performance of a composition). The framework of reference however should not so much be the original FRBR specification (which still is too much depending on the notion of a bibliographic record!) but rather the FRBRoo approach, in which each aggregate is treated as an entity in its own right. Note that a mapping of FRBRoo and EDM is offered by CIDOC. " The creation of this Task Force (EFAP-TF) reacts to this statement and is intended to start from the mapping provided by CIDOC eventually extending, correcting or restricting it and providing examples for the use of the combined EDM and FRBRoo namespace clusters. 2. SCOPE Activities include: Checking the mapping proposed by CIDOC available at [URL] Collecting data samples illustrating the possible use of the combined namespaces Identifying a relevant subset of classes and properties for the information integration scenario characteristic for Europeana, possibly a core set. Providing use cases for the combined namespaces The group will not work on <b>primary</b> <b>cataloguing</b> in whatever format which is regarded as a provider task. Therefore the group will only deal with how to map existing data formats into an extended EDM model, and at most with guidelines to use a core set of properties. 3. DELIVERABLE The Task Force on the EDM FRBRoo extension will be considered successful if a report is delivered in due time on: Combined model in terms of properties and classes including sample data Principles for modeling and mapping rules This deliverable benefits all those wishing to model derivative relations in EDM and may also help to clarify a future strategy regarding RDA compliant metadata and the way these are mapped to EDM. 4.

With this aim we identified the samples of single and isolated galaxies from SDSS DR 5 (Single and QIsol) with the 3 D Voronoi tessellation method (Elyiv et al. 2009). We found that in comparison with other samples of isolated galaxies, the QIsol sample contains an excess of late-type galaxies, especially with a low luminosity and BCG/Im/Irr morphology. We also showed that the fractions of early type galaxies in QIsol SDSS DR 5 sample and samples 2 MIG (Karachentseva et al. 2010) and CIG (Karachentseva et al. 1973; Hernandez-Toledo et al. 2008) are in a good agreement (16 - 19 %), but Allam's (Allam et al. 2005) and Prada's (Prada et al. 2003) SDSS DR 1 samples show a higher excess of the early type galaxies that {{can be explained by}} the selection criteria and morphology definition method.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that galaxy interactions {{play an important role}} in shaping the properties of galaxies. For this reason, cosmological studies focused on the evolution of halo/subhalo pairs are vital. In this paper I describe a large catalogue of halo pairs extracted from the publicly available Millennium Simulation (Springel et. al. 2005). (Throughout this work I use the term `halo' to refer both to individual haloes in the field and subhaloes embedded in larger structures.) Pairs are selected according to whether or not they come within a given critical (comoving) distance dcrit, without the prerequisite that they must merge. Also, a condition requiring haloes to surpass a critical mass Mcrit during their history is imposed. The <b>primary</b> <b>catalogue,</b> consisting of 502, 705 pairs, is selected by setting dcrit= 1 Mpc/h and Mcrit = 8. 6 10 ^ 10 Msun/h (equivalent to 100 simulation particles). One of the central goals of this paper is to evaluate the effects of modifying these criteria. For this purpose, additional subcatalogues with more stringent proximity and mass conditions are constructed (i. e., dcrit= 200 kpc/h or/and Mcrit= 8. 6 10 ^ 11 Msun/h = 1, 000 simulation particles). I use a simple five stage picture to perform statistical analyses of their separations, redshifts, masses, mass ratios, and relevant lifetimes. The fraction of pairs that never merge (because one of the members is absorbed by an external halo or both members survive until today) is accounted for. These results provide a broad picture that captures the essential characteristics behind the evolution of halo pairs. This is the first of a series of papers aimed to explore the huge wealth of information encoded in this catalogue. Such investigations will play a fundamental role in future cosmological studies of interacting galaxies and binary (and multiple) quasars. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, accepted by MNRAS.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of satellite galaxies {{is a critical}} small-scale test of the standard cosmological model. From comparing the predictions of structure formation in simulations with observations of Local Group dwarf galaxies {{there is a clear}} mismatch in the abundance, leading to the so-called “missing satellites” problem. The comparison between simulation and observation have, however, suffered from a limited sample of satellite galaxies, with the only reasonably complete sample being from the most local galaxy groups. It is unknown whether the observed {{abundance of}} dwarf satellite galaxies of the nearest groups is statistically representative of the abundance of dwarf satellites in the greater universe. We construct a volume-limited sample of galaxies down to a well-defined stellar mass limit (M★ ≥ 6 × 109 Msun) using the Atlas 3 D parent sample of spiral and ellipsoidal galaxies by Cappellari et al. 2011. In order to statistically identify bound satellites around galaxies in our <b>primary</b> <b>catalogue,</b> we apply cuts on the background based on the properties of known dwarf satellites of the Local Group using both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 (SDSS DR 8) ([URL] spectroscopic and photometric galaxy catalogues. We detect an over-density of faint objects at projected separations of < 500 kpc at S/N ∼ 8, corresponding to an average of 4. 8 ± 0. 65 satellite detections per primary after stacking these systems and subtracting the background. We further find that the over-density of faint objects strongly depends on primary morphology and magnitude. While the Milky Way seems to be unusual in its number of bright satellites, our faint end satellite abundances are in agreement from the ∆m luminosity function for primaries in our sample as bright as the Milky Way.

40|$|Context. The Frontier Fields {{survey is}} a {{pioneering}} observational {{program aimed at}} collecting photometric data, both from space (Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope) and from ground-based facilities (VLT Hawk-I), for six deep fields pointing at clusters of galaxies and six nearby deep parallel fields, {{in a wide range}} of passbands. The analysis of these data is a natural outcome of the Astrodeep project, an EU collaboration aimed at developing methods and tools for extragalactic photometry and creating valuable public photometric catalogues. Aims. We produce multiwavelength photometric catalogues (from B to 4. 5 μm) for the first two of the Frontier Fields, Abell- 2744 and MACS-J 0416 (plus their parallel fields). Methods. To detect faint sources even in the central regions of the clusters, we develop a robust and repeatable procedure that uses the public codes Galapagos and Galfit to model and remove most of the light contribution from both the brightest cluster members, and the intra-cluster light. We perform the detection on the processed HST H 160 image to obtain a pure H-selected sample, which is the <b>primary</b> <b>catalogue</b> that we publish. We also add a sample of sources which are undetected in the H 160 image but appear on a stacked infrared image. Photometry on the other HST bands is obtained using SExtractor, again on processed images after the procedure for foreground light removal. Photometry on the Hawk-I and IRAC bands is obtained using our PSF-matching deconfusion code t-phot. A similar procedure, but without the need for the foreground light removal, is adopted for the Parallel fields. Results. The procedure of foreground light subtraction allows for the detection and the photometric measurements of 2500 sources per field. We deliver and release complete photometric H-detected catalogues, with the addition of the complementary sample of infrared-detected sources. All objects have multiwavelength coverage including B to H HST bands, plus K-band from Hawk-I, and 3. 6 − 4. 5 μm from Spitzer. full and detailed treatment of photometric errors is included. We perform basic sanity checks on the reliability of our results. Conclusions. The multiwavelength photometric catalogues are available publicly and are ready to be used for scientific purposes. Our procedures allows for the detection of outshone objects near the bright galaxies, which, coupled with the magnification effect of the clusters, can reveal extremely faint high redshift sources.

The intentions of toy manufactures are to influence children while they are young to gain brand loyalty, devolving premature consumers. The consumers of the future. Marketing strategies towards child advertising are paid high attention to as the market is generating approximately 21 billion dollars into the United States economy each year.

The survey is based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and on extensive follow-up observations conducted in the frame of an ESO key program. In the paper we document the process by which the <b>primary</b> cluster candidate <b>catalogue</b> is constructed prior to the optical follow-up observations. We {{describe the}} reanalysis of the RASS source catalogue which enables us to impose a proper flux limit cut to the X-ray source list without introducing a severe bias against extended sources. We discuss the correlation of the X-ray and optical (COSMOS) data to find galaxy density enhancements at the RASS X-ray source positions and the further evaluation of the nature of these cluster candidates. Based also on the results of the follow-up observations we provide a statistical analysis of the completeness and contamination of the final cluster sample and show results on the cluster number counts. The final sample of identified X-ray clusters reaches a flux limit of 3 e- 12 erg s- 1 cm- 2 in the 0. 1 - 2. 4 keV band and comprises 452 clusters. The results imply a completeness of the REFLEX cluster sample well in excess of 90 % and a contamination by non-cluster X-ray sources of less than 9 %, an accuracy sufficient for the use of this cluster sample for cosmological tests.

40|$|The Telescope Array (TA) {{experiment}} {{is located in}} the western desert of Utah, USA, and observes ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the Northern hemisphere. At the highest energies, E> 10 EeV, the shape of cosmic ray energy spectrum may carry an imprint of the source density distribution along the line of sight different in different directions of the sky. In this study, we search for such directional variations {{in the shape of the}} energy spectrum using events observed with the Telescope Array's surface detector. We divide the TA field of view into two nearly equal-exposure regions: the "on-source" region which we define as ± 30 ^∘ of the supergalactic plane containing mostly nearby structures, and the complementary "off-source" region where the sources are further away on average. We compare the UHECR spectra in these regions by fitting them to the broken power law and comparing the resulting parameters. We find that the off-source spectrum has an earlier break at highest energies. The chance probability to obtain such or larger difference in statistically equivalent distributions is estimated as 6. 2 ± 1. 1 × 10 ^- 4 (3. 2 σ) by a Monte-Carlo simulation. The observed difference in spectra is in a reasonable quantitative agreement with a simplified model that assumes that the UHECR sources trace the galaxy distribution from the 2 MRS <b>catalogue,</b> <b>primary</b> particles are protons and the magnetic deflections can be neglected.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the nineteenth-century art collection of Donald Alexander Smith, Lord Strathcona (1820 [...] 1914), {{in relation to}} intersecting questions of imperialism, colonial relations, and cultural status. Both {{the formation of the}} collection and its dispersal are linked to a dialectic of cultural hegemony and national identity in nineteenth-century Canada. Smith came penniless to Montreal from Scotland in 1838, became the wealthiest man in Canada {{by the end of the}} century, and is known as Lord Strathcona after being raised to the peerage by Queen Victoria in 1897. My discussion of the rise and fall of Strathcona's collection is informed by postcolonial theory and its critical re-reading of imperialism. While British imperialism was the ideology that governed Strathcona's activities, Anthony Giddens's structuration theory is introduced to account for how personal agency remains operative within this dominant ideology. Strathcona formed a significant collection of European paintings and Asian art, which was, however, largely dispersed by the institution charged with its care, thus reducing its significance. Krzysztof Pomian's concept of collectors as select individuals who mediate symbolic cultural power through semiotic constructs provides an important methodological anchor for an analysis of the collector and his collection, as does Carol Duncan's work on the motivation to collect art and to structure cultural identity through control of museums. As well, the princely model of collecting reveals the humanist values operative throughout the centuries by comparison of Strathcona to the Medici in terms of the deployment of spectacle. This thesis makes use of primary source materials to compare Strathcona's collection to several of his peers in order to place him in his cultural milieu during a time in Canadian history when Montreal was a British enclave in a French province. Analysis of fragmented <b>primary</b> source inventories, <b>catalogues,</b> personal letters, and records held by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the National Archives of Canada, identification of paintings documented in the Notman photographs of 1914 [...] 1915, and my tracing of the public portraits of Strathcona by Robert Harris still on view in Montreal institutions allowed me to create useful inventories that previously did not exist...|$|R
