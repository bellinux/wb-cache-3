The effect of surfactant concentration on resulting film morphology and surface toughness Was Studied by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). Upon increasing the concentration of Span 40 in the mixture, films became rougher and more heterogeneous, indicating surface enrichment by Span 40 molecules. In the case of mixtures composed by CMCAB and Tween 40, the increase of Tween 40 in the mixture led to smoother and more homogeneous films, indicating compatibility between both components. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that Span 40 and Tween 40 act as plasticizers for CMCAB, leading to dramatic reduction of glass transition temperature of CMCAB, namely, Delta T(g) = - 158 degrees C and Delta T(g) =- 179 degrees C. respectively.

The polyoxyethylene esters of oleic acid (Atlas G- 2144), lauric acid (Arias G- 2124), sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Tween 40), and sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), have proven especially effective in this respect. In addition to their wetting effect on the cell, certain of the water-dispersible esters just mentioned are capable of enhancing the growth of many strains of tubercle bacilli, probably by supplying them with long chain fatty acids in a non-toxic form available for metabolic utilization (3). Unfortunately, the ester linkage in these wetting agents is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases, a fact which prohibits their use in media containing animal tissues or fluids rich in these enzymes.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate)</b> and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated the formation/preparation of stable, thermoreversible, thixtropic surfactant gels (amphiphilo-gels) with suitable physical properties for topical use.

In order to study the CH(_ 2) stretching vibrations, the solvent was fully deuterated. Careful calibration of the ATR experiment enabled the contribution to the ATR spectrum made by adsorbed species to be calculated. The surface excess concentration of the amines were calculated over a range of bulk solution conentrations, enabling adsorption isotherms to be constructed. The use of polarized radiation allowed the orientation of the molecules within the adsorbed layer to be studied. The adsorbed layer of hexadecylamine showed some ordering of the aliphatic chains. There is some spectral evidence that the chains in the adsorbed layer of 1, 12 - diaminododecane adopt a 'looped' configuration. The effect of adsorbed layers of the molecules listed above upon the rheological behaviour of Aerosil 200 dispersions in toluene was investigated. Differences in the rheological behaviour of these dispersions have been correlated to differences in adsorbed layer structure as determined by FTIR-ATR.

Ethylene vinyl acetate co-polymer (EVA) {{was used as}} the binder material. Preparation of HAP/EVA microspheres was followed by the thermal de-binding and sintering at 1150 °C for 3 h to obtain HAP microspheres. Each microsphere of 100 – 1000 mm was in turn composed of spherical hydroxyapatite granules of 2 – 15 mm size which were obtained by spray drying the precipitated HAP. The parameters such as percentage of initial HAP loading, type of stabilizer, concentration of stabilizer, stirring speed and temperature of microsphere preparation were varied to study their effect on the particle size and geometry of the microspheres obtained.

Therefore, the present work was adopted to investigate how proper manipulation of various formulations and processing factors on vesicular Z-average particle size. The selected variables were membrane additives, [including cholesterol (CHO), dicetylphosphate (DCP) and stearylamine (SA) ], sonication time as well as drug loading factor (using mannitol and estradiol). <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (span 40) niosomes were prepared by the conventional thin film hydration method. Particle size, measured by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy, and polydispersity indices were measured and compared.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop bigels from the oleogel of sunflower oil and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> for the delivery of metronidazole. The bigels were prepared by mixing oleogel with the polymer solution. Natural (proteins and polysaccharides) and synthetic polymers were used to alter {{properties of the}} bigels. Fluorescence microscope was used to study the microstructure of the bigels. The molecular interactions amongst the components of the bigels were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. The mechanical behavior of the bigels was determined using viscometer and static mechanical tester. Gel disintegration studies were carried out at pH 7. 4. The thermal and electrical properties of the bigels were analysed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and phase-sensitive multimeter, respectively. Goat blood and HaCaT cells were used to test the hemocompatibility and the cytocompatibility of the bigels, respectively. The antimicrobial efficacy of the drug (metronidazole) loaded bigels was studied against E. coli. The efficiency of the bigels as controlled delivery formulations was evaluated in vitro. Iontophoretic delivery of the drugs was carried out by injecting an AC current (peak current of 96. 44 μA). The micrographs suggested the formation of an oleogel-in-hydrogel type of bigels. The particle size of the bigels containing proteins was smaller (4 - 5 μm) than the bigels containing natural polysaccharides and synthetic polymers. Hydrogen bonding was the major driving force in the formation of the bigels. The mechanical properties of the polysaccharide based bigels were better as compared to the other bigels. The firmness of starch bigels and maltodextrin bigels was found to be highest 729. 4421 ± 3. 1471 g and 1000. 7623 ± 1. 8211 g, respectively. All the bigels exhibited pseudoplastic flow and were viscoelastic in nature. The disintegration time of the bigels was dependent on the property of the polymer used. The melting endotherm of the bigels was ~ 46 °C. The bigels were biocompatible in nature. The drug loaded bigels showed equivalent inhibitory zones against E. coli as compared to the marketed formulations. The application of AC current increased the in vitro drug release.

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Tecnologias do Medicamento, apresentada à Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade de CoimbraGels have {{consistently}} been studied for {{their role in}} topical and transdermal drug delivery systems as a non-invasive technique, for pharmaceutical and cosmetics application. These formulations are semi-solid three-dimensional structures, porous, with unique characteristics, such as rigidity and elasticity at the same time. Because of their high aqueous phase content, gels permit a greater dissolution of drugs through the skin and enhance skin hydration by retaining {{a significant amount of}} transepidermal water, in contrast to creams and ointments. Conventionally, gels are differentiated into two different types according to the nature of their liquid phase: hydrogels, which contain a polar solvent (water) and organogels, which contain an organic/non-polar solvent, as external phase. Hydrogels consist of polymeric materials that exhibit the ability to swell and retain a large amount of water or other biofluids in its structures. Despite its great affinity for water, they only possess a swelling behavior without dissolving in water. This proves its high flexibility, similar to natural tissue. Organogels consist of a network of self-assembled molecules which forms a thermally reversible gel upon cooling, immobilizing a non-aqueous liquid. They are mainly composed by lipids (organic phase), so they easily interact with the lipid skin surface and enhance the drug permeation through the skin. The most widely used lipids are based in edible oils due to their high biocompatibility, such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, sesame seed oil or olive oil. Organogels form viscoelastic structures through non-covalent associations with gelling agents in low concentrations. The commonly used organogelators include sorbitan monostearate or <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate.</b> These superstructures, often long fibers or needle-shaped structures, which entangle or form pseudocrystalline regions, immobilizing the liquid largely by surface tension and forming a gel of variable consistency. Lecithin organogels are a special type of organogels that do not require addition of any additional surfactant or penetration enhancer, as lecithin serves both the purposes. Recent studies have reported other types of gels for dermal drug application, such as proniosomal gels, emulgels, bigels and aerogels, combining features of conventional hydrogels and organogels. In conclusion, further studies in gel technologies are essentials to overcome the drawbacks of each gel system and for developing cost effective delivery systems for transdermal applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis deals with the symbiosis of Frankia spp. and Alnus glutinosa. Frankia spp. are actinomycetes giving rise {{to the formation of}} nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of a number of non-leguminous plants. In these nodules Frankia spp. live within the plant cells and obtain all sources of carbon and energy from the plant, giving fixed nitrogen in exchange. To answer the question what compounds Frankia spp. obtain from the plant, insight into the metabolism of this microorganism is required. To obtain this insight, researches have been made with the free-living Frankia AvcI 1, isolated from root nodules of Alnus viridis ssp crispa by Baker et al. (1979). This organism has been isolated and cultivated on complex media. In order to obtain insight into the C- and N-source requirements of Frankia AvcI 1, a simple and well-defined growth medium is needed. The composition of this medium and the C- and N-metabolism of Frankia AvcI 1 are the subjects of Chapter II of this thesis. In Chapter II. 1 it is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a medium containing Tween 80 (an oleate ester of <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> <b>sorbitan)</b> as sole C-source and either glutamic acid or NH 4 Cl as sole N-source. The growth yield of Frankia AvcI 1 on various media is reported. It is shown that the doubling time of Frankia AvcI 1 growing on QMOD/Tween medium is about 2 days, which is slow, even for an actinomycete. When growing with Casamino acids as nitrogen source, Frankia AvcI 1 selectively takes up glutamic acid and aspartic acid, leaving the concentrations of the other detectable amino acids unchanged. The mechanism of this selection is still unclear. Chapter II. 2 contains further data on the C-sources utilized by Frankia AvcI 1 It is shown that Frankia AvcI 1 can utilize as C-source also other Tweens, viz. Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 85, and in addition several fatty acids, viz. acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, caproic, caprylic, capric, palmitic and stearic acids. No growth of Frankia AvcI 1 was observed on media containing triglycerides as C-sources. The dependence of the growth yield {{on the nature of the}} carbon source and the concentration of NH 4 + in the media is shown. Utilization of NH 4 + as nitrogen source of Frankia AvcI 1 growing in the Tween/NH 4 + medium is confirmed by incorporation experiments with 15 N-NH 4 Cl. The results reported in Chapter II. 3 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up glucose from a medium containing both glucose and Tween 80. In agreement with this observation, it is demonstrated that the activities of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in cells grown on the QMOD/Tween medium (containing both glucose and Tween 80) are of the same order ofmagnitude as in cells grown on the Tween/NH 4 + medium (containing Tween 80 as sole C-source). Organisms growing on fatty acids, and degrading these compounds to acetyl-CoA, start gluconeogenesis with the action of the glyoxylate cycle (Kornberg and Krebs, 1957) leading to the conversion of 2 acetyl-CoA molecules to 1 molecule of succinate. The presence of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in Frankia AvcI 1 cells grown with Tween 80 as C-source is therefore not surprising. The succinate formed in the glyoxylate cycle can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by the subsequent action of the enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malic enzyme and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, which are found in cell-free extracts of Frankia AvcI 1 From phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis can continue with the action of phosphoglycerate kinase and 3 -phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase. For energy generation, Frankia AvcI 1 can oxidize the acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid breakdown in the citric acid cycle, although the low activity of the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase leaves room for the presumption that the citric acid cycle is not very operative in Frankia AvcI 1 This is not impossible since the oxidation of fatty acids yields many reducing equivalents. The data contained in Chapter II. 4 show that Frankia AvcI 1 does not take up succinate from a medium containing acetate plus succinate or succinate alone. In accordance, no repressing effect of succinate on the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes was observed, whereas in cells grown on propionate these enzymes were not found, indicating that they are hot constitutive in Frankia AvcI 1 Frankia AvcI 1 is able to utilize several amino acids as sole nitrogen source, viz. alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and valine. No differences in C- and N-source requirements were observed for the three Frankia strains AvcI 1, CPI 1 (isolated by Callaham et al., 1978, from Comptonia peregrina root nodules) and AgSp+ 1 (isolated by Quispel and Burggraaf, 1981, from Alnus glutinosa spore-(+) type root nodules). These three strains were shown to utilize either Tween 80 or acetate, but no ethanol, lactate, glucose or succinate as sole C-source, and either NH 4 Cl, Casamino acids, aspartic acid or alanine as N-source. From the data given in Chapter II it will be clear that Frankia AvcI 1 is able to grow on a well-defined medium, which is a prerequisite for obtaining a clear insight into the physiology of the organism. The alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979), added to the medium as growth factors, can be replaced by Tween 80 or fatty acids which are utilized as carbon source, while NH 4 Cl or amino acids can be utilized as nitrogen source. It is unknown whether Frankia spp. grow with the same growth rate on media with different constituents. The growth yields presented in Chapter II are usually small as compared to the amount of carbon present in the media. This suggests that either an additional component of the medium is present in limiting concentrations or that Frankia spp. can only grow for a limited time after inoculation. The only group of compounds known so far to be utilized as C-source by free-living Frankia AvcI 1 are fatty acids, either free or esterified. The question what carbon source Frankia spp. living symbiotically in the nodule obtain from the plant, still remains to be answered. Based on the data obtained for free-living Frankia spp. it is not unlikely that some fatty acid functions as C-source under such conditions. Other possible candidates for this function are plant lipids like the alcoholic root extract (Quispel and Tak, 1978) or the soybean lecithin (Lalonde and Calvert, 1979). It is unlikely that sugars like glucose or dicarboxylic acids like succinate are playing this role, unless the ability of Frankia spp. to take up one or more of these compounds should alter during the transition from the free-living to the symbiotic stage. The cultivation of free-living Frankia spp. is a powerful tool in discovering symbiotic interactions of the endophyte and the host. In Chapter II. 4 of this thesis it is shown that by replacing acetate as C-source of the medium by propionate, the activities of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes are repressed. Other authors (Tjepkema, Ormerod and Torrey, 1980 and 1981, Gauthier, Diem and Dommergues, 1981) reported a medium in which free-living Frankia spp. show vesicle formation and N 2 -ase activity. The present knowledge thus enables one to influence regulation in freeliving Frankia spp., which is important in studying the symbiotic interactions mentioned above. In Chapter III attention is paid to the assimilation of the ammonia produced by the endophyte living symbiotically in the root nodules of Alnus glutinosa grown in the greenhouse from seeds collected in Wageningen. In Chapter III. 1 the composition of the pool of free amino acids in root nodules and the xylem tissue of stems is reported. It is shown that citrulline is the predominant free amino acid in nodules, while serine also occurs in relatively large amounts. In xylem tissue citrulline and glutamic acid are prominent. The activities of N 2 -ase, GS, GDH and OCT in root nodule homogenates are reported. From the K m values of GDH for NH 4 + (16 mM) and glutamate (0. 9 mM) and the concentrations in the nodule of NH 4 + (1. 5 mM) and glutamate (0. 5 mM) it is concluded that GDH in alder nodules probably is responsible for the deamination of glutamate and not for the synthesis of this key amino acid. The important function of GDH in the nitrogen metabolism of alder nodules is confirmed by the much higher activity of this enzyme in homogenates of nodules as compared to that in homogenates of root-tips and leaves. The vesicle clusters, which contain the N 2 -ase activity, did not show activity of GS, GDH and OCT. The cytoplasm of the host cells was shown to possess the GS activity, while GDH and OCT are localized in the organelles of the host cells. No activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT was observed. In Chapter 111. 2 it is shown that the activity of NADH-dependent GOGAT from root nodules of lupins is inhibited by some compound in the homogenate of alder nodules. Simultaneously with and independently of the present research, Schubert et al. (1981) analyzed the composition of the pool of free amino acids in nodules and the xylem tissue of Alnus glutinosa grown in the field in East Lansing, Michigan. The only difference with respect to these amino acid pools between the American alders and the European alders studied in the present research, is the relatively high amount of serine in nodules of the latter, whereas in nodules of the former this amino acid is not found. The results of both Schubert et al. (1981) and the present research confirm the hypothesis that in alder,citrulline is the main transport vehicle of fixed nitrogen (Miettienen and Virtanen, 1952; Leaf, Gardner and Bond, 1958; Wheeler and Bond, 1970). From the results shown in Chapter 111. 2 it can be concluded that our failure to find any GOGAT activity may be ascribed to the presence of an inhibiting compound in the homogenate of alder nodules, so that it is not excluded that GOGAT is active in alder nodules in vivo. The data reported in Chapter III are in accordance with the following model: The nitrogen fixed as ammonia in the vesicle clusters of the endophyte, is assimilated in the cytoplasm of the host cell into glutamate by the action of GS and presumably GOGAT. Glutamate is in part deaminated in the plant organelles by the action of GDH to supply the NH 4 + required for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate. Another part of the glutamate is converted to ornithine, which in the organelles of the host cellreacts with carbamyl phosphate to form citrulline according to the OCT reaction. Citrulline is excreted from the nodule and serves as nitrogen source for the plant. ...|$|R
