40|$|From {{different}} plant tissues such as tobacco (Nicotiana rustica), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and mung bun (Phaseolus radiatus), ring- or cylinder-shaped particles called <b>prosomes</b> wrere isolated {{by either}} sucrose gradient centrifugation or fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). These particles have {{a diameter of}} 12 to 14 nm and a length of 16 to 18 nm. They migrate under conditions of nondenaturing gel electrophoresis as one distinct band. Sedimentation coefficient and buoyant density in Cs 2 SO 4. of the plant <b>prosomes</b> were determined by analytical ultracentrifugation to be approximately 23 S and 1. 23 g/cm 3, respectively. The total molecular mass was estimated by gel filtration to be 650 kDa. Plant <b>prosomes</b> are composed of 12 to 15 proteins with molecular masses {{in the range of}} 24 to 35 kDa with isoelectric points of pH 5 to 7 as revealed by twodimensional gel electrophoresis. The protein patterns or <b>prosomes</b> from the three different plant species are very similar. Polyclonal antisera against potato <b>prosomes</b> reacted in Western blots with prosomal proteins of all three plant species. They also bind to some prosomal proteins of animal species. Antisera against animal <b>prosomes</b> react with some proteins of plant <b>prosomes.</b> As shown by lectin blotting, plant <b>prosomes.</b> are glycosylated carrying glucosyl- or mannosyl, and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues. Prosomal preparations contain non-stoichiometric amounts of small RNA of about 80 kDa. These results suggest that plant <b>prosomes</b> are structurally and functionally homologous to <b>prosomes</b> of other eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that in murine myoblasts <b>prosomes</b> are {{constituents}} of the nuclear matrix; {{a major part of}} the latter was found to be RNase sensitive. Here, we further define the RNA-dependent matrix in avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) transformed erythroid cells in relation to its structure, presence of specific RNA, <b>prosomes</b> and/or proteasomes. These cells transcribe but do not express globin genes prior to induction. Electron micrographs show little difference in matrices treated with DNase alone or with both, DNase and RNase. In situ hybridization with alpha globin riboprobes shows that this matrix includes globin transcripts. Of particular interest is that, apparently, a nearly 35 kb long globin full domain transcript (FDT), including genes, intergenic regions and a large upstream domain is a part of the RNA-dependent nuclear matrix. The 23 K-type of <b>prosomes,</b> previously shown to be co-localized with globin transcripts in the nuclear RNA processing centers, were found all over the nuclear matrix. Other types of <b>prosomes</b> show different distributions in the intact cell but similar distribution patterns on the matrix. Globin transcripts and at least 80 % of <b>prosomes</b> disappear from matrices upon RNase treatment. Interestingly, the 19 S proteasome modulator complex is insensitive to RNase treatment. Only 20 S <b>prosomes</b> but not 26 S proteasomes are thus part of the RNA-dependent nuclear matrix. We suggest that giant pre-mRNA and FDTs in processing, aligning <b>prosomes</b> and other RNA-binding proteins are involved in the organization of the dynamic nuclear matrix. It is proposed that the putative function of RNA within the nuclear matrix and, thus, the nuclear dynamic architecture, might explain the giant size and complex organization of primary transcripts and their introns...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} brief history of polyribosomes, ergosomes, <b>prosomes,</b> informosomes, {{maternal}} mRNA, stored mRNA, and RNP particles. Even though most published research focuses on total mRNA rather than polysomal mRNA and often assumes they are synonymous – i. e., if a functional mRNA is present, it must be translated – results from our laboratories comparing polysomal RNA and total mRNA in a range of “normal” issues show that some transcripts are almost totally absent from polysomes while others are almost entirely associated with polysomes. We describe a recent model from yeast showing various destinies for polysomal mRNA once it has been released from polysomes. The main points we want to emphasize are; a) when mRNA leaves polysomes to go to <b>prosomes,</b> P-bodies, stress granules, etc., it is not necessarily destined for degradation – it can be re-utilized; b) “normal” tissue, not just seeds and stressed tissue, contains functional non-polysomal mRNA; c) association of mRNA with different classes of polysomes affects their sub-cellular location and translatability; and d) drawbacks, misinterpretations, and false hopes arise from analysis of total mRNA rather than polysomal mRNA and from presuming that all polysomes are “created equal”...|$|R
40|$|<b>Prosomes</b> {{and heat}} shock protein (HSP) {{complexes}} isolated from the cytoplasm of Drosophila cells in culture were biochemically and immunologically characterized. The two complexes were found to separate on sucrose gradients, allowing the analysis of their protein constituents by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by reaction with anti-HSP sera and prosome-specific monoclonal antibodies. All of the prosomal proteins {{were found to be}} clearly distinct from the HSP; none of the prosomal proteins was synthesized de novo in heat shock. However, an antiprosome (anti-p 27 K) monoclonal antibody (mouse anti-duck) recognizing the Drosophila p 29 K prosomal protein allowed immunoprecipitation from a heat-shocked postmitochondrial supernatant of the crude HSP complex, including the low- and the high-molecular-weight components, in particular the 70 x 10 (3) -molecular weight HSP. The highly purified small 16 S HSP complex still contained this preexistent p 29 K prosomal protein, which thus also seems to be a metabolically stable constituent of the HSP complex. The significance of this structural and possibly functional relationship between <b>prosomes</b> and HSP, involving the highly ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved prosomal protein p 27 / 29 K, remains to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|A cytoplasmic {{particle}} displaying {{properties in}} common with a structure present in duck erythroblasts, termed the <b>prosome,</b> has been isolated from eggs and embryos of two species of sea urchin. This particle was partially purified by sedimentation in sucrose gradients containing 0. 5 M KCl, {{and some of its}} physical properties and its behavior during early development were determined. The <b>prosome</b> sediments between 16 and 19 S and has a buoyant density of 1. 30 g/cm 3 in Cs 2 SO 4 gradients. Biochemically, the particle is characterized as 20 - 25 polypeptides of molecular size 24 - 35 kDa with about 10 small RNAs. A monoclonal antibody directed against the 27 -kDa protein of duck erythroblast <b>prosome</b> recognizes a 27 -kDa protein of the sea urchin <b>prosome.</b> We have used this protein, as representative of the <b>prosome,</b> to immunologically determine the level and the subcellular localization of the particle during development. Immunoblotting and cellular fractionation studies show that the 27 -kDa <b>prosome</b> polypeptide is present almost entirely in the postribosomal supernatant of unfertilized egg lysates. After fertilization and during early development, the total amount of 27 -kDa protein per embryo remains constant, but the amount in the postribosomal supernatant decreases; there is a concomitant increase in the level of the 27 -kDa protein in a rapidly sedimenting, particulate fraction containing nuclei. Immunofluorescence studies further show that the 27 -kDa protein is located mainly in the cytoplasm of eggs and two-cell embryos. The subcellular location of the <b>prosome,</b> therefore, appears to change during development. In vivo labeling experiments have failed to detect the synthesis of either the <b>prosome</b> proteins or RNAs in eggs and embryos up to 48 hr of development, suggesting that this cytoplasmic particle is not synthesized de novo in early embryogenesis and thus is metabolically stable.
