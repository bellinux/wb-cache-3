Some members become non-affiliated after resigning or being expelled from a party, either through a political disagreement or after a scandal such as the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal.

40|$|Recent theory-building on the {{substantive}} representation of women (SRW) in parliamentary settings contends {{that in addition}} to traditional concerns about achieving a ‘critical mass’ of women, scholars need to question who the ‘critical actors’ are. Analysis of a range of deliberative functions of the Scottish Parliament supports the critical actor thesis—yet, while female critical actors have disproportionate policy-making influence, the present study adds to contemporary understanding by highlighting that it is how critical actors interact with critical mass that {{plays a key role in}} the SRW. Thus future work needs to be cognisant of a range of factors shaping critical mass/critical actor interaction, including: institutional mechanisms, type of parliamentary proceeding, <b>party</b> <b>allegiance</b> <b>and</b> whether women representatives belong to the party forming the executive...|$|R
40|$|Wells's The New Machiavelli (1911) {{offers an}} {{excellent}} {{case study of}} the use of anti-Machiavellian Machiavellism as both a philosophical and a rhetorical strategy. In Remington, Wells creates a protagonist who follows Machiavellian rules of behaviour and denounces those who do likewise. The novel is structured to show Remington's progress from an idealist refutation of Machiavellism, through a recognition of its necessity, to the formulation of a private and political method for the necessary pursuit of Machiavellian principles under the disguise of anti-Machiavellism, including trenchant criticisms of Fabians as anti-Machiavellian Machiavellians. These stages, culminating in complete personal and public failure, are reflected in Remington's <b>party</b> <b>allegiances,</b> <b>and</b> broadened by Wells into an account of British party ideologies {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century. Wells's rhetorical design for mapping and assessing anti-Machiavellian Machiavellism is paralleled by an exploration of that technique in himself, attested by the predominance of autobiographical elements in The New Machiavelli, and by similarities between Remington's and Wells's own deception of others and themselves. Far from incidental, anti-Machiavellian Machiavellism is the motif that unites the shifting <b>party</b> <b>allegiances,</b> political conceits <b>and</b> moral hypocrisies, and private and public failures of Wells, Remington, and of the period of British politics that they intend to encapsulate...|$|R

40|$|With the {{apparent}} {{increase in the}} number of alternative political media, political pluralists are again faced with the question: does the proliferation of subaltern counter-publics lead to a multiplication of forces? Fragmentation in political culture is fuelled by the rise of identity politics that focuses on consumption not production. <b>Party</b> <b>allegiances</b> <b>and</b> class alliances give way to more fluid and informal networks of action. Postmodern theorists celebrate fragmentation because it allows the recognition of diversity in political desires, acknowledges difference between individuals and debunks the myth of homogenous political units leading ultimately to liberation. But for political efficacy there must be more than {{the apparent}} freedom that comes with embracing difference and diversity. This article argues that if we accept the description of society as fragmented, in order to create a viable political community then solidarity is crucial. In a global economy, solidarity can be mediated through new communication technologies but the challenge is to articulate the politics online with actual movements and struggles on the ground...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} core {{political}} values {{has long been}} of central importance in understanding how citizens evaluate policies, parties and candidates. However, the characterisation of these higher order values as, if not immutable then highly stable, has meant {{little attention has been}} paid to the causes and consequences of shorter term fluctuations. This paper demonstrates that switching <b>allegiance</b> between main <b>parties</b> led to significant shifts in the left-right political value dimension amongst the British public during the early 1990 s. I use a True Intra-individual Change (TIC) structural equation model (Steyer, Eid and Schwenkmezger 1997; Steyer, Partchev and Shanahan 2000; Steyer and Krambeer 2003) on data from the British Election Panel Survey to examine the influence of <b>party</b> <b>allegiance</b> <b>and</b> changes in <b>party</b> <b>allegiance,</b> on change in the left-right political values of individual voters between 1992 and 1997. Results indicate that switching allegiance from the Conservative to the Labour party between 1992 and 1994 resulted in significant and enduring shifts in left-right values in the direction of the party of defection. Some change was observed between 1992 and 1996 for those defecting from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats, though this group had returned to their 1992 positions by the time they were re-surveyed in 1997. Those who stuck with the Conservative Party between 1992 and 1994 had moved significantly to the right by 1996, a position they retained up to the General Election in 1997. No change was observed amongst stable Labour and Liberal Democrat voters. While the absolute magnitudes of these value shifts were not large, the fact that left-right position has itself such an over-riding influence on party popularity, means that even small shifts in this value dimension can have sizeable impacts on the popularity ratings and vote share of the main parties. </p...|$|R
50|$|The Caretaker is a play {{in three}} acts by Harold Pinter. Although {{it was the}} sixth of his major works for stage and television, this {{psychological}} study of the confluence of power, <b>allegiance,</b> innocence, <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> among two brothers and a tramp, became Pinter's first significant commercial success. It premiered at the Arts Theatre Club in London's West End on 27 April 1960 and transferred to the Duchess Theatre the following month, where it ran for 444 performances before departing London for Broadway. In 1964, a film version of the play based on Pinter's unpublished screenplay was directed by Clive Donner. The movie starred Alan Bates as Mick and Donald Pleasence as Davies in their original stage roles, while Robert Shaw replaced Peter Woodthorpe as Aston. First published by both Encore Publishing and Eyre Methuen in 1960, The Caretaker remains one of Pinter's most celebrated and oft-performed plays.|$|R
40|$|British culture {{today is}} the product of a {{shifting}} combination of tradition and experimentation, national identity and regional and ethnic diversity. These distinctive tensions are expressed in a range of cultural arenas, such as art, sport, journalism, fashion, education, and race. This Companion addresses these and other major aspects of British culture, and offers a sophisticated understanding of what it means to study and think about the diverse cultural landscapes of contemporary Britain. Each contributor looks at the language through which culture is formed and expressed, the political and institutional trends that shape culture, and at the role of culture in daily life. This interesting and informative account of modern British culture embraces controversy and debate, and never loses sight of the fact that Britain and Britishness must always be understood in relation to the increasingly international context of globalisation. Michael Higgins begins his chapter on British newspapers by acknowledging the importance of newspapers to Britain's sense of its political and cultural identity. He argues that the notion of the press as a 'fourth estate of the realm' situates the industry as representative of the British population against the institutions of power and ­privilege. Although the press have never lived up to the rhetoric of this demanding tradition and are currently suffering from declining print sales, Higgins argues that newspapers remain important as socio-political identifiers and as a means of reproducing established political and class-based social groupings. Higgins's argument resonates with that of John Street, such that it appears that the politics of newspapers are motivated as much by target markets as an attachment to political ideologies. Higgins suggests that these divisions in the newspaper market extend beyond the conventional one between popular and quality newspapers and include various factors of political <b>party</b> <b>allegiance</b> <b>and</b> identification with particular, shifting social groupings and politically significant categories...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a 2008 survey {{conducted}} in the Msunduzi municipality in the KwaZulu-Natal province, the paper begins an exploration of the character of popular politics and citizenship in South Africa. Embracing a ‘citizen-centred’ methodology informed by participation literatures, and sensibilities to the ‘work in progress’ character of African cities from urban studies debates, the paper interrogates the mainstream liberal-participatory model of citizenship in South Africa, and the critiques of current South African politics informed by these notions, specifically the ‘racial census’ and ‘dominant party syndrome’ analyses. Taken together these views can be read as characterising South African politics as a game for individual citizens governed by liberal rules, but played by racial and/or partisan groups in exclusionary ways, thus distorting liberal democratic mechanisms of representation and accountability. The paper also examines evidence for an alternative class-based analysis of one aspect of citizenship, namely, protest against poor local governance. The paper looks to unpack this ‘liberal model versus racialised communitarian practice’ imaginary by, on the one hand, demonstrating the ways in which citizenship is not racialised, or is asymmetrically racialised. Indeed, other than <b>party</b> <b>allegiances</b> <b>and</b> trust in key offices, very little by way of what citizens do, believe or think of themselves follows discrete racial lines. Similar points hold for partisanship too. On the other hand, the paper does not redeem the liberal-democratic model as there is also evidence of trust in government when it is not deserved based on performance, but more importantly, evidence that citizens embrace ‘informal’ means to secure their rights. A good example of this is protestors who {{are also more likely to}} vote than non-protestors. Taken together, these findings affirm both the way in which the racial and partisan legacy of the past is being undone by new institutions and practices, and suggest the complex intersection of these with networks of personal relations which characterise the local politics of most African cities.

40|$|Elected multi-party {{assemblies}} {{have existed}} in Africa on average {{for no more}} than two decades. Consolidating democracy and improving the lives of ordinary citizens demands guardian parliaments. Parliaments are comprised predominantly of politicians and, interconnected with citizens and executives, are perceived as core institutions of representative democracies. This dissertation seeks to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} African multiparty parliaments and their role in consolidating democracy. The study seeks to comprehend the links between citizens and their elected parliaments in 18 African countries, in the process attempting to predict the prospects of these new democracies. It also focuses on the Assembly of Mozambique to attempt an understanding of the evolution, capacity and functioning of an emerging parliament. The study investigates the perceptions of Mozambican civil leaders toward their parliament, and it looks at the perceptions of Mozambican parliamentarians concerning their roles and their relations with the electorate, and concerning the Assembly’s capacity and powers. This is critical to understanding how democracy has been and will be exercised, since parliamentarians are at the forefront of the process. Each parliament has distinctive characteristics. However, there are common features based on their age and origin. The development of the Mozambican Assembly since the monoparty regime illustrates the challenges and achievements that African parliaments have undergone in the transition to democracy. The findings reveal that African citizens distinguish between presidents and parliaments, which is important given the legacy in Africa of strong executives led by dominant presidents. They also reveal that citizens value the gains made by the multiparty regimes and that parliaments as lawmakers are preferred to presidents. In most countries surveyed, citizens, on average, gave positive evaluations of their parliaments, especially concerning their trustworthiness. Political characteristics outweigh socio-economic status in influencing how citizens perceived parliaments. <b>Party</b> <b>allegiance</b> <b>and</b> perception of electoral fairness are the factors that most influenced how citizens perceived their parliaments. Interviews with Mozambican MPs revealed their frustration over the influence of the Assembly over the national budget. In the MPs’ opinions, direct foreign aid to the budget reduced parliament’s role to that of a rubber stamp, weakening the role of MPs. Mozambican civic leaders saw parliament as an indispensable and critical institution, and they expressed frustration with the extreme party-centricity of MPs, which is perceived as normal by MPs. Distrust between these groups reinforces the sentiment among ruling party members that the party deserves protection. In democracies, MPs from different parties are political opponents and not enemies. In Mozambique, the transition from enemy to adversary is not yet complete. While fragile, parliament has been the only space in Mozambican society where political parties can interact...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The New Europe Barometer (NEB) series, originally known as the New Democracies Barometer (NDB), has been conducted annually across Central and Eastern Europe since autumn 1991. The same questions are asked in each country and repeated from year to year, so trends can be analysed across {{a wide variety of}} post-Communist societies. Approximately 1, 000 respondents in each country are interviewed face-to-face each year about their economic, political and social attitudes and behaviour. Data are available for separate years and also as a trend dataset (SN 5241). Further information on the NEB is available on the CSPP Barometer Surveys web site, along with details of other survey series. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, post-communist regimes have followed radically different paths: ten are now new member states of the European Union, while others remain partners in the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States. This project draws on a unique database of more than 100 New Europe Barometer (NEB) surveys undertaken in post-communist countries since 1991. Funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) supported a fresh multinational survey in autumn/winter 2004 - 5 in Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The seventh NEB survey (2004 - 2005) focuses on topics such as whether respondents evaluate their new regime and compare it to the past, and how committed are they to the rejection of undemocratic alternatives; what accounts for differences in evaluations of post-communist regimes; and how important the costs of economic transformation and/or the opportunities of movement to the market have been. The NEB surveys are comparative; the same questions are asked in all countries covered. For 2004, the results were merged into a single multinational data file, with each country's responses weighted equally at 1, 000. The multinational data file encourages research that considers the extent to which causes of division within society, for example education, age or economic status, operate transnationally. It is possible to assess to what extent and under what circumstances national context is an important influence on behaviour and attitudes (net of individual attributes), and to test the importance of absolute standards of living, which are measured cross-nationally by a household's material possessions, as against relative income advantage or disadvantage. In addition to this, separate data files for all 13 countries are included in the dataset. The majority of questions asked in the 2004 - 2005 survey had been asked in previous surveys. The responses from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are comparable with the New Baltic Barometer survey series (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33416). Main Topics : The NEB questionnaire is designed to create political, social and economic indicators for varied social science concepts, some familiar in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Topics covered include family circumstances and social support, employment, economic conditions and hardship, income, attitudes to taxation, unemployment and public expenditure, attitudes to political and social issues, attitudes to communism, socialism and other political systems, trust in authorities and government, perceived threats from neighbouring and other countries, political <b>party</b> <b>allegiance,</b> <b>and</b> personal and household demographic characteristics. Standard Measures: Many 'transformation' measures were devised especially {{to take into account the}} consequences of the communist legacy and transformation, e. g. regime changes. They are complemented by indicators appropriate for stable democracies with market economies. <br...|$|R
