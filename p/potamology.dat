50|$|Pavle Vujević (Serbian Cyrillic: Павле Вујевић, 10 August 1881 - 17 November 1966) was a Serbian {{geographer}} and meteorologist, {{professor of}} climatology, meteorology, and mathematical geography at the University of Belgrade. He was {{a founder of}} the science of micro-climatology, {{and one of the first}} in the science of <b>potamology,</b> the study of rivers.|$|E
50|$|Rivers {{are part}} of the {{hydrological}} cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from glaciers). <b>Potamology</b> is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general.|$|E

By the {{diversity}} of the territorial system components that need to be analyzed, a regional geography study requires a continuous approach of the specific character of these components, which is also valid for the hydrological component. First, it is necessary to highlight the role of <b>potamology,</b> limnology and hydrogeology features {{in the evolution of the}} region, as related to three temporal levels (past, present and perspective). The change of population’s notion of the extreme hydrological events by specific and/or general analyses of the changes occurred in the territory (hydrotehnical facilities, impoundment and drainage works). The graphical representation of the analyzed elements and phenomena, which varies in terms of scale and necessity, comes as a supplement and enforcement of the above statements...|$|E
40|$|Water runs downhill—we {{all know}} that. As a rule, it follows {{the path of}} steepest descent, seeking out the {{shortest}} and fastest route from top to bottom. So {{how can we make}} sense of meandering rivers, which wiggle-waggle down the valley, prolonging their journey to the sea and greatly lengthening their course? Why doesn’t the flowing water—acting under the tug of gravity—just carve out a shortcut across all those loops? I first encountered the mysteries of meanders in an article by Luna B. Leopold and Walter Langbein, published 40 years ago in Scientific American. They gave a lucid account of how meanders form and why they assume their characteristic sinuous shapes. I was a student at the time, and the article made a lasting impression. Not that I was inspired to go off and pursue a career in <b>potamology,</b> but the Leopold-Langbein theory of meanders was an eye-opener all the same. It brought home to me the curious fact that the world is a comprehensible place: You can look at a landform, say, and expect to understand what you see. The patterns of nature make sense, {{if you know how to}} read them. Luna Leopold died last February at age 90. Reading accounts of his life and work led me back to that fondly remembered Scientific American article from 1966, as well as another article published a few years earlier in American Scientist. I found them still lucid and engaging—and yet, on reflection, not quite fully satisfying. It’s not so much that the answers now seemed less compelling, but they led to many Brian Hayes is Senior Writer for American Scientist.
