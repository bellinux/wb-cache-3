40|$|Certain <b>propeller</b> <b>driven</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> are {{equipped}} with piston engines whose fundamental "firing"-frequency coincides with the rotational frequency of the propeller. Taking the two sources as a system consisting of a primary source (propeller) and a secondary source (engine exhaust), an active noise control (ANC) technique can be applied. The far field noise of both the propeller and the engine exhaust is characterised by periodic sound pressure fluctuations; by generating a suitable phase shift between these two periodic sound-fields, a destructive interference may be attained, resulting in a reduced overall noise level immission on the ground. Technically, this is achieved by (1) adjusting the spatial distance between the exhaust orifice and the propeller and (2) an appropriate azimuthal positioning of the propeller on the crankshaft of the engine...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{work has been}} under way to {{investigate}} the possibility to reduce the noise of piston-engine driven propeller/aeroplanes by appropriately superposing the very propeller/noise with exhaust noise from the piston engine to pro- duce a destructive interference. In this context, it should be understood that certain <b>propeller</b> <b>driven</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> are equipped with piston engines whose fundamental firing frequency coincides with the rotational (blade passing) frequency of the propeller. Taking the two sources as a system consisting of a primary source (propeller) and a secondary anti-noise source (engine exhaust), an active noise control technique can be applied. Indeed, the signature of both the propeller and the engine exhaust noise is characterized by periodic sound pressure fluctations. In establishing a suitable phase shift between these two periodic sound signals a destructive interference can be attained, in principle resulting in a lesser noise level on the ground...|$|R
40|$|Stringent {{noise limits}} have been imposed on {{ultralight}} aeroplanes in the Federal Republic of Germany. The "Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection" (CAEP) of the "International Civil Aviation Organization" (ICAO) intends to formulate internationally binding noise regulations for ultralight aeroplanes. In view {{of these developments}} an experimental and theoretical research program was initiated to investigate specifically the noise sources and noise characteristics of ultralight aeroplanes. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the technical feasibility of meeting existing or proposed noise limits - especially in comparison with the noise limits for "light propeller-driven aeroplanes" (ANNEX 16 /Chapter 6) and to further establish the minimum noise radiation from various types of ultralight aeroplanes within operational limitations. Flyover and ground static noise measurements on tractor- and pusher-propeller <b>driven</b> ultralight <b>aeroplanes</b> and wind tunnel noise measurements on isolated full-scale ultralight-aeroplane propellers were conducted. Engine noise was studied seperately providing information on the relationship of engine rotational speed and exhaust noise. In an overall sense the study showed that only tractor <b>propeller</b> <b>driven</b> ultralight <b>aeroplanes</b> have a chance to comply with the current stringent (German) noise limits; they must be of clean aerodynamic design, be equipped with thoroughly muffled engines and their operational propeller blade tip Mach number must be limited to values well below 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{noise from}} <b>propeller</b> <b>driven</b> General Aviation <b>aeroplanes</b> {{is due in}} part to piston-engine noise. Therefore engine noise cannot be {{neglected}} when developing corresponding noise reduction measures for such aeroplanes in trying to meet future - possibly rather stringent - noise limits. An engine noise test facility was developed and initial tests were performed on a Lycoming IO- 360 engine. The engine exhaust, rather than direct engine-housing vibration caused radiation, was identified as the prime source of engine noise. Spectral characteristics and radiation directivities were determined for different operational conditions as well as the dependence of the overall noise on full and part throttle engine power. The transmission loss of a typical commercially available exhaust muffler was determined to be sufficiently high (in terms of overall A-weighted levels) essentially because the test engine's noise...|$|R
