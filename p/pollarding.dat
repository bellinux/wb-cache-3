25|$|<b>Pollarding</b> is a pruning {{system in}} which the upper {{branches}} of a tree are removed, promoting a dense head of foliage and branches. <b>Pollarding</b> in ancient Rome was mentioned by Propertius during the 1st Century BC. It has been common in Europe since medieval times and is practised today in urban areas worldwide, primarily to maintain trees at a predetermined height.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pollarding</b> {{began with}} walled cities in Europe {{which did not}} have room for large trees. The smaller limbs that {{resulted}} {{could be used for}} heat and cooking.|$|E
25|$|An {{incidental}} {{effect of}} <b>pollarding</b> in woodland is {{the encouragement of}} underbrush growth due to increased levels of light reaching the woodland floor. This can increase species diversity. However, in woodland where <b>pollarding</b> was once common but has now ceased, the opposite effect occurs, as the side and top shoots develop into trunk-sized branches. An example {{of this can be}} seen in Epping Forest in London/Essex, UK, the majority of which was pollarded until the late 19th century. Here, the light that reaches the woodland floor is extremely limited owing to the thick growth of the pollarded trees.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was second}} son of Walter <b>Pollard</b> of Plymouth, by Avice, {{daughter}} of Richard <b>Pollard</b> of Way, {{in the parish}} of St Giles in the Wood, near Great Torrington, Devon. John <b>Pollard</b> {{may have been the}} <b>Pollard</b> who, without Christian name, is mentioned as entering the Middle Temple on 3 June 1515; but it may also be that this entry is that of his relative Lewis <b>Pollard,</b> son of Sir Hugh <b>Pollard</b> and grandson of Sir Lewis <b>Pollard</b> (c.1465-1526), Justice of the Common Pleas. John was appointed Autumn Reader of the Middle Temple in 1535, and became serjeant-at-law in 1547.|$|R
25|$|Although {{people who}} came to the United States from Europe {{continued}} the practice, in the 21st century, experts believe <b>pollarding</b> older trees harms the tree. The smaller limbs grow from wood that is not as strong, and the weaker trees will not live as long and can be more easily damaged by storms.|$|E
25|$|M. oleifera can be {{cultivated}} for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for {{oil extraction}} and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation. Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached. <b>Pollarding,</b> coppicing and lopping or pruning are recommended to promote branching, increase production and facilitate harvesting.|$|E
25|$|As in coppicing, the {{tradition}} of <b>pollarding</b> is to encourage the tree to produce new growth {{on a regular basis}} to maintain a supply of new wood for various purposes, particularly for fuel. In some areas, dried leafy branches are stored as winter fodder for stock. Depending upon the use of the cut material, the length of time between cutting will vary from one year for tree hay or withies, to five years or more for larger timber. Sometimes, only some of the regrown stems may be cut in a season – this is thought to reduce the chances of death of the tree when recutting long-neglected pollards.|$|E

25|$|The {{vast amounts}} of wood needed to produce glass in this way {{dictated}} that glasshouses be located in forest areas and that the woodland be managed carefully by coppicing and <b>pollarding</b> to maximise the wood resource and to optimise the size of wood pieces used. Even so, periodically the glasshouse would have to relocate, as the woodland was depleted. The glass industry had to compete for wood supplies with other industries such as mining, and domestic demand. In sixteenth-century England, an embargo {{was placed on the}} use of wood for fuel for glassmaking. Glasshouses often were located in forests owned by the church. One of the main uses of forest glass was for ecclesiastical stained glass windows.|$|E
500|$|Willow {{has been}} cut and used on the Levels since mankind moved into the area.

The willow was harvested using traditional methods of <b>pollarding,</b> where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. New shoots of willow, called [...] "withies", would grow out of the trunk and these would be cut periodically for use.|$|E

5000|$|In a March 2007 {{interview}} with Susan Rosenbluth of The Jewish Voice and Opinion, Luchins, {{a student of}} Rabbi Ahron Soleveichik and a senior advisor to Daniel Patrick Moynahan, described the men's role in trying to free <b>Pollard.</b> According to Luchins, shortly after then-President Bill Clinton 1993 inauguration, he was approached by Moynihan and Senator Joseph Lieberman about <b>Pollard's</b> release; the president was reportedly willing to commute <b>Pollard's</b> sentence and order his release if {{he wrote a letter}} expressing clear remorse. Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik brought a letter of apology vetted by the White House to <b>Pollard</b> in prison, for his signature. Reportedly, <b>Pollard</b> signed the letter and Lieberman hand-delivered it to Clinton. However, while the letter was still on Clinton's desk, <b>Pollard</b> is reported to have had a change of heart, renouncing the letter and criticizing a portion that apologized for violating Jewish law. According to Luchins, <b>Pollard</b> was pressured by [...] "the <b>Pollard</b> people, the more intense members of the cult", with the result that what seemed like a firm deal to accomplish <b>Pollard's</b> release from prison fell apart. Esther <b>Pollard</b> (Eileen Zeitz) denies that <b>Pollard</b> was ever asked to sign any such letter.|$|R
2500|$|The {{technique}} {{is also used}} in Africa for moringa trees, to bring the nutritious leaves into easier reach for harvesting. <b>Pollarding</b> is also used in urban forestry in certain areas for reasons such as tree size management, safety, and health concerns. It removes rotting or diseased branches to support the overall health of the tree, living and dead branches that could harm property and people, as well as expanded foliage in spring for aesthetic, shade and pollution concerns. Trees may be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] by <b>pollarding</b> – for example Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana [...] "Bradford"), a beautiful flowering species when young, but brittle and top-heavy when older.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pollarding</b> was {{preferred}} over coppicing in wood-pastures {{and other}} grazed areas, because animals would browse the regrowth from coppice stools. Historically, {{the right to}} pollard or [...] "lop" [...] was often granted to local people for fuel on common land or in royal forests; {{this was part of}} the right of Estover.|$|E
2500|$|Coppicing is a {{traditional}} method of woodland management which exploits the capacity of many species of trees to put out new shoots from their stump or roots if cut down. In a [...] wood, which is called a copse, young tree stems are repeatedly cut down to near ground level, known as a stool. In subsequent years new growth reemerges, and, {{after a number of}} years, the coppiced tree is harvested again, and the cycle begins anew. <b>Pollarding</b> is a similar process carried out at a higher level on the tree.|$|E

2500|$|... "Poll" [...] was {{originally}} {{a name for}} the top of the head, and [...] "to poll" [...] was a verb meaning [...] "to crop the hair". This use was extended to similar treatment of the branches of trees and the horns of animals. A pollard simply meant someone or something that had been polled (similar to the formation of [...] "drunkard" [...] and [...] "sluggard"); for example, a hornless ox or polled livestock. Later, the noun pollard came {{to be used as a}} verb: [...] "pollarding". <b>Pollarding</b> has now largely replaced polling as the verb in the forestry sense. Pollard can also be used as an adjective: [...] "pollard tree".|$|E

"Wild arbor" [...] trees (yěfàng, [...] ): Most {{producers}} {{claim that}} their pu'er is from wild trees, but most use leaves from older plantations that were cultivated in previous generations {{that have gone}} feral {{due to the lack}} of care. These trees produce teas of better flavor due to the higher levels of secondary metabolite produced in the tea tree. As well, the trees are typically cared for using organic practices, which includes the scheduled pruning of the trees in a manner similar to <b>pollarding.</b> Despite the good quality of their produced teas, [...] "wild arbor" [...] trees are not as prized as the truly wild trees.|$|E
2500|$|Garrick's Ait {{is named}} after David Garrick, the actor whose Temple to Shakespeare and Villa (house) are on the Hampton bank and as such is the only island in the country named after an actor.

Wood from <b>pollarding</b> could be used for cricket bats, paddles, ladders, gun stocks, crates and poles for fences. Harvested branches, called osiers, are strong, flexible and resistant to rot – they were used for fish traps, basket making and for reinforcing riverbanks.|$|E

2500|$|The Epping Forest Act 1878 was passed, {{saving the}} forest from enclosure, and halting the {{shrinkage}} {{of the forest}} that this had caused. Epping Forest {{ceased to be a}} royal forest and was placed in the care of the City of London Corporation who act as Conservators. In addition, the Crown's right to venison was terminated, and <b>pollarding</b> was no longer allowed, although grazing rights continued. This act laid down a stipulation that the Conservators [...] "shall at all times keep Epping Forest unenclosed and unbuilt on as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the people". In compensation for the loss of lopping rights, Lopping Hall in Loughton was built as a community building.|$|E

Part of the march dyke is still clearly indicated by a large coppiced beech and we know that this coppicing or <b>pollarding</b> was done because such 'marker' trees will live considerably longer than trees which have been left untouched.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Epping Forest Act almost {{certainly}} saved the forest from total destruction, {{it has to}} some extent had a deleterious effect on the area's biodiversity.

[...] In addition, the area surrounding the forest is now to a great extent urbanised; the corresponding reduction in grazing has led to former areas of grassland and heathland being overcome by secondary woodland – this has been exacerbated by the majority of the forest's deer being enclosed to prevent impacts with vehicles on the major roads that run through the forest. In recent years, the Conservators have experimented with <b>pollarding</b> in selected areas of the forest, and a herd of English Longhorn cattle has been reintroduced to graze the heathland and grassland.|$|E
