In addition, the reactive nature of aluminum {{in the presence of}} oxygen has inspired investigation into functionally coating bare nanoaluminum prior to exposure to the atmosphere. Faceted aluminum crystals are fabricated in the aerosol phase via thermal pyrolysis of triisobutylaluminum, a low temperature gas-phase synthesis route, and combustion tests of oxygen passivated product in thermite combination show an increase in energy release compared to commercial nanoaluminum. Three different coatings on this bare nanoaluminum are developed: a decoration of Ni/Ni 2 O 3 particles by thermal decomposition of Ni(CO) 4, a homogeneous layer of Fe 3 O 4 by thermal decomposition of Fe(CO) 5, and a monolayer of perfluoropentanoic acid via bridge bonding between aluminum and carboxylate groups. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that the metal oxide coatings have facilitated formation of an expanded aluminum oxide layer during an air bleed, but perfluoropentanoic acid has successfully passivated aluminum.

Therefore, a combination of NPs and Al 2 O 3 coating is of special interest in PEC system. For comparison, the modified Fe 2 O 3 electrodes with both single step coating (i.e., Fe 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 -Au) and sequential coating (Fe 2 O 3 -Au-Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -Au) processes are characterized. Figure  4 c shows that the photocurrent of the pristine Fe 2 O 3 -Au electrodes is obviously higher than others at 0.0  V vs Ag/AgCl, which could be attributed to the increased open circuit potential by the Au modification. The hematite films are n-type photoanodes and a positive applied bias potential will increase the photocurrent generation as the Fermi level moves to assist charge separation and facilitate water splitting [32]. The conduction band of α-Fe 2 O 3 is located slightly below the level needed for hydrogen production, and its valence band is well-suited for oxygen production. Therefore, an external bias is typically required for water splitting when using α-Fe 2 O 3 materials as photoanodes [26, 33].

40|$|This work {{presents}} the first practical selective emitter for high performance thermophotovoltaics (TPV) that offers high optical performance, high temperature stability, {{and the ability}} to be fabricated in large area samples. In a TPV system, a heat source brings the photonic crystal emitter to incandescence, and the resulting thermal radiation drives a low-bandgap photovoltaic cell. The photonic crystal enables high eciency by enhancing the radiation from the heat source in the wavelength range that can be converted by the photovoltaic cell and suppressing the radiation outside of that range. Our photonic crystal, composed of a square array of cylindrical cavities etched into a metallic substrate, enables unprecedented efficiencies in solar, radioisotope, and hydrocarbon TPV systems. We overcome multiple technical challenges previously limiting selective emitters by developing new fabrication processes to improve optical performance; by adopting commercial poly-crystalline tantalum to fabricate large-area samples; by developing a HfO₂ <b>passivation</b> <b>coating</b> for improved thermo-chemical stability; and by developing a HfO₂ cavity filing process for improved omnidirectional performance. More specically, we developed a process for fabrication of uniformly patterned 50 mm diameter photonic crystals, integratable with virtually any heat source by brazing. Furthermore, we fabricated a photonic crystal in a sputtered tantalum coating, which can be directly sputtered onto a heat source. Our photonic crystal design reaches 67 % of the performance of an ideal emitter. To further improve the omnidirectional performance, we fabricated a filled-cavity emitter, which experimentally demonstrated the theoretical prediction that HfO 2 -filled photonic crystals would have superior hemispherical in-band emissivity. Both fabricated photonic crystal designs were tested for 300 hours at 100 °C with no detectable degradation due to the passivation by HfO₂. With our original design, we demonstrated the highest heat-to-electricity eciency in a hydrocarbon TPV experiment to-date, exceeding 4 % and greater than previous 2 - 3 % effissences thought to be the practical limit. Furthermore, we expect from simulations that our filled photonic crystal design will enable over 12 % eciency with only engineering optimization. For reference, a 1. 5 % eciency corresponds to the energy density of lithium ion batteries. by Veronika Stelmakh. Thesis: Ph.

30|$|After signal recording, the coupled {{vertical}} nanowire probe-cell {{was investigated}} to clarify whether the nanowire probe penetrates the GH 3 cell, which {{is essential for}} intracellular signaling. Figure  3 c shows the cross-section of the coupled interface prepared by a high-resolution Cross Beam FIB-FESEM. Two <b>passivation</b> layers that <b>coated</b> the nanowires and a Pt layer for signal collection {{at the tip of}} the nanowires can be clearly seen in the cross-section. It is noted that the nanowire probe pierced through the cellular membrane in a bent shape, possibly due to compression by the weight of the cells. A robust passivation layer also acts as a buttress, which supports a nanowire against the cell. Figure  3 c also shows that the membranes of the cells perforated by the vertical nanowire probe adhere closely to the top passivation layer without any voids. This tight coupling of the membrane and the SiO 2 layer prevent the cytoplasm of the GH 3 cell from mixing with the culture medium and the standard bath solution. By thus isolating the cells physically, it is possible to record the electrical activity inside of the cell in an intercellular mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, Al 2 O 3 film {{deposited}} by thermal {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) with diluted NH 4 OH {{instead of}} H 2 O was suggested for passivation layer and anti-reflection (AR) coating of the p-type crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cell application. It was confirmed that the deposition rate and refractive index of Al 2 O 3 film was proportional to the NH 4 OH concentration. Al 2 O 3 film deposited with 5 % NH 4 OH has the greatest negative fixed oxide charge density (Qf), which {{can be explained by}} aluminum vacancies (VAl) or oxygen interstitials (Oi) under O-rich condition. Al 2 O 3 film deposited with NH 4 OH 5 % condition also shows lower interface trap density (Dit) distribution than those of other conditions. At NH 4 OH 5 % condition, moreover, Al 2 O 3 film shows the highest excess carrier lifetime (τPCD) and the lowest surface recombination velocity (Seff), which are linked with its passivation properties. The proposed Al 2 O 3 film deposited with diluted NH 4 OH is very promising for passivation layer and AR coating of the p-type c-Si solar cell.
