50|$|As part of {{a strong}} state, de Gaulle {{emphasized}} the need to base state institutions on a strong executive. This was {{a departure from the}} French republican tradition, which emphasized the role of the elected assembly. De Gaulle, during his time in office, sought to establish authority by holding direct universal votes and popular referenda and by directly engaging with the nation (via speeches broadcast over radio, <b>press</b> conferences, and <b>trips</b> to the provinces). While de Gaulle frequently spoke on his respect for democracy, his political opponents perceived in his rule a tendency toward dictatorial power; many feared a Bonapartist revival or a republican monarchy. France remained a democracy, however, and de Gaulle's decision to step down as president following voters' rejection of the April 1969 constitutional referendum showed that his commitment to democracy was not merely a rhetorical ploy.|$|R

Despite the hasty circumstances, the work evidences his early virtuosity, and sets an example for the quality of his future works.|$|R

Joe Scott in a <b>press</b> conference, Young <b>tripped</b> while carrying a salad and soft drink up a set of stairs and hit his head on an iron railing. The fall onto the railing opened a large gash across the top of Young's head, causing him to drop to the floor bleeding profusely. After lying on the floor for some time, Young got up and walked bleeding through several rooms of his spacious, two-story house before ending up in his second-floor bedroom. According to Scott, Young walked past several telephones but didn't place an emergency call.|$|R

The American journalist knew that the Sudanese government did not want to risk more bad publicity on his death and so eventually all three were released. Upon their successful release - after an international outcry from US diplomats, the US military, Bono and even the Pope - Hari moved to the US where he began work on his memoirs to help bring further world attention to the plight of his people and country.

But Chris, with his idiosyncratic logic, came up with an elegant solution to this dilemma: He simply got rid of the map.
