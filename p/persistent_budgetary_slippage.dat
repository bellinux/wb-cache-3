40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} budgetary subsidy {{policy issues}} that arise when centrally planned economies {{move toward a}} market economy. The analysis suggests that subsidy reduction, to be successful, has to be embedded into an overall economic reform program and that during the program’s execution, former implicit subsidies {{are likely to become}} budgetized. Furthermore, additional pressure on the budget, caused by enterprise restructuring or the introduction of social safety net provisions, necessitates careful policy design. Comprehensive budgetary reform is required to prevent <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> during the transition process. ...|$|R

At end-December 2001, eight of the eleven quantitative and structural benchmarks were met.

25|$|The <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippage</b> {{with the}} Public–private {{partnerships}} (PPPs): between 2008 and 2010 the accounts slipped 560.2 million euros, mainly {{due to the}} rents paid to road concessions, to which were paid more 425.5 million euros than it was budgeted. In 2011 the slippage in the rents with the road concessions rose 28% to 197.4 million euros above what was budgeted and rose 42.3% to 266.3 million euros above what had been forecasted for 2010. The State spent a total of 896.6 million euros in rents to the road concessions. The rents paid to the PPPs in the health and rail sectors also slipped considerably.|$|R

40|$|The {{budgeting}} {{process has}} been recently reformed in Italy (L. 196 / 2009) {{in order to improve}} control of budget and transparency in the provision of clear information on government fiscal policy. Indeed, the general government final expenditures often deviate significantly from the initial forecasted amounts. Therefore, although the initial budget is often formulated in contractionary stance compared with the previous year’s final account, the final outcome turns out to be expansionary. As a consequence, confidence in the reliability of expenditure estimates in the initial budget and {{in the value of the}} initial budget as an indicator of the stance of fiscal policy have been undermined. Using real-time data for Italy, reported in the Relazione Previsionale e Programmatica (RPP) and in the Relazione Unificata sull’Economia e la Finanza Pubblica (RUEF), we explore fiscal plans and their implementation for GDP and general government aggregated and disaggregated items of revenue, expenditure and budget balance over the period 1998 - 2009. Both reports are employed with the aim of measuring the budgetary policy implementation error, following the methodology of Beetsma et al. (2009). We focus on the first year of the fiscal plans because <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> mainly occur in this year (Balassone et al. 2010). The main findings suggest that implemented budgetary adjustment falls systematically short of planned adjustment for GDP, for primary balance and overall balance. Actually, the main determinants of the implementation error of both primary and overall balance are the expenditures, in particular, the capital expenditures. Moreover, it seems that errors in macroeconomic forecasts cannot be considered the driving force of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages.</b> Our results are in line with the strand of literature (von Hagen 1992; von Hagen and Harden 1994; Alesina and Perotti 1999; Tanaka 2003) according to which credible plans are the conditio sine qua non for healthy budget outcomes and resorting fiscal transparency and accountability. To improve public budgeting in Italy, we deem necessary a renewed commitment by policy makers in term of planning and control of public expenditures. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of expenditure {{rules in the}} next future in Italy has been made viable by recent domestic and European budget reforms. Expenditure rules could improve the difficult conditions of the Italian public finance and could remedy to some of its main flaws, in particular, ‘unexpected’ <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> and poor expenditure control. The analysis {{is focused on the}} comparison of some relevant characteristics of three kinds of expenditure rules (a ceiling set in terms of a rate of expenditure growth, a fixed term/rolling basis spending limit and an expenditure ceiling within a debt brake mechanism) and on the impact that their adoption could have on the soundness of the country’s fiscal position. The expenditure counterfactual paths we trace use a real-time data set covering all stages of the budget process. Political acceptability, coherence with the EU and the domestic fiscal frameworks, predictability of resources and transparency differ according to the rule adopted and prevent a clear ranking of the expenditure rules to single out the best solution. However, the expenditure ceilings within the debt brake unquestionably grant better results in terms of fiscal performance...|$|R

Amid <b>persistent</b> <b>budgetary</b> shortage {{and a series}} of attempted mutinies in the army, Tevzadze attempted to implement some reforms in the Georgian military with the declared aim to help transition “from old Soviet model to the modern forces, applicable to the international standards.” He was pursuant to a pro-NATO line declared by Georgia in 1998 and rejected the post of deputy head of the Coordinating Staff of the CIS Armed Forces in 2001, saying he saw no point in multilateral military cooperation between CIS states. It was during his tenure, that, in 2002, the United States launched a program of training for the selected Georgian military units (GTEP).|$|R
40|$|When it {{was adopted}} in 1997 the {{stability}} and growth pact was considered {{as one of the}} cornerstones of the European monetary union. However, against the background of the economic downturn starting {{at the turn of the}} century, this perception changed and some observers criticised the pact for unduly constraining governments’ fiscal room for manoeuvre. This sparked a long debate on the appropriateness of the fiscal rules in the monetary union that has finally ended in March 2005 when a political agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union that announces substantial changes to the pact. This article first recalls the reasons for fiscal rules, especially in a monetary union with a fragmented budgetary policy, and the main provisions of the original pact. It then shows that despite the strengthening of the fiscal rules nearly all EU- 15 Member States have significantly relaxed budgetary discipline after 1997, i. e. the year in which compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria was tested, which led to significant <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> in a number of countries. It is argued that this is due to specific institutional, political and statistical factors. Finally, the reform of the pact is assessed. Without prejudging the application of the new framework, the fiscal rules are found to be significantly weakened and there is a clear shift towards a more judgement-based institutional framework.

40|$|Abstract: The unusual {{rise and}} fall of {{non-monetary}} trade (NMT) in the Russian transition has been a subject of heated debates. Yet, this phenomenon is often viewed as a peculiarity that one cannot explain by economic considerations alone. In this paper we show that the resort to NMT was a rational, albeit spontaneous, reaction of industrial enterprises to the outflow of liquidity, which in turn was precipitated by the combination of <b>persistent</b> <b>budgetary</b> deficit and strict monetary policy. The IMF pledge to stand by if the government became insolvent made this policy credible. Several mechanisms contributed to the development of credit rationing of enterprises. First, the abandonment of implicit guarantees on loans extended to enterprises by the Central Bank of Russia prompted commercial banks to shift credit to other groups of borrowers. Second, when the Federal Government moved to finance its budgetary deficit through open-market operations, it crowded out commercial credit. Third, public money was transferred predominantly to households who partially lent it back to the government. Fourth, the policy of low exchange rate kept the balance of payment close to zero, which prevented the monetary base from growing. The default of August 1998 constituted a clear structural break. It prompted modifications in monetary and fiscal policies. The collapse of the market for state securities led to widespread bank failures. The CBR abandoned its policy of non-intervention in fiscal affairs and cleared debts that the governments and enterprises accumulated. In addition, money supply expanded because increased inflows of foreign currency were incompletely sterilized. The combination of a lesser government presence at credit markets, clearance of debts, and increase in money supply injected liquidity in domestic producers and they abandoned NMT. Statistical evidence supports the claim that NMT was caused by credit rationing experienced by enterprises. A GLS model with four explanatory variables (and dummies accounting for a structural break of August 1998) explains more than 90 % of monthly changes in NMT for the period of February 1992 – December 2001. The collapse of the market for government loans appears to be the most significant event accountable for the structural break...|$|R

40|$|Current {{financial}} turbulence and uncertainty in Europe reinforce arguments {{in favour of}} encouraging economic and monetary cooperation but, at the same time, make such cooperation more difficult. Since the rejection by Denmark of the Maastricht Treaty, five Community currencies (those of Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom) have devalued, two of them have left the system (United Kingdom and Italy) and others have come under serious pressure (Denmark and France). The difficulties cannot be ignored. An {{important component of the}} problem is the management and control of public expenditure. Adjustments to monetary parameters are necessary to solve urgent problems, but they are not sufficient to build a solid EMU. Excessive use of monetary instruments, with <b>persistent</b> <b>budgetary</b> deficits, {{is one of the main}} reasons for the current crisis. Long-lasting financial-market stability requires budgetary discipline. Serious movement towards EMU cannot take place successfully until the budgetary performance of Member States has converged. The European Monetary Union will function properly when Member States accept and work under nominal convergence requirements, among other things, conditions on inflation, interest rates, etc., which means having similar levels of budget deficits. Externalities and interdependence form the basis of the following important arguments identified in support of fiscal cohesion in the European Community: the need for a global European fiscal policy beyond the aggregation of 12 individually decided budgetary positions; the need to avoid the disproportionate use of Community savings by one Member State; a possible bias towards lack of fiscal restraint'; and the need for convergence in budgetary positions during the transition period (A. Lamfalussy, 1989, p. 91). Although the need for fiscal coordination and for controlling national spending in particular have been widely justified, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying and analyzing concrete measures to make this feasible. Most studies on these aspects of the Economic Monetary Union have been concerned with questions as to why the need exist for fiscal convergence and to what degree is it desirable. Attention has only recently been focused on examining what budgetary measures (rules, procedures, structures) can be taken by the Commission or finance ministries for European convergence. This last question was EIPA's main global concern when organizing the workshop Can Norms and Rules enable EC Member States to Secure Budgetary Convergence?' in December 1992. In this workshop, a mixed group of academics and experienced practitioners from the 12 Member States and the Commission met to analyze and discuss the above question and also the general consequences on national budgeting as a result of the conditions put forward by a future European Monetary Union. Presentations and discussions were multidisciplinary. Most of the relevant scientific approaches were represented: public economics, political science, public management and law. A special participant in this workshop was Professor Wildavsky, a visiting professor at EIPA at that time. The objective of the workshop was to analyze, discuss and suggest alternative policy-option initiatives at EC and national levels encouraging convergent financial management behaviour. Discussions were based on the following important questions: What is the current capacity of EC and national governments to manage public spending?'; What budgetary strategies are available to reduce deficits?'; How do social values and political culture affect spending patterns?'; What should the role of the Commission be under these circumstances?'; What is the Member States' responsibility for managing national budgets?'; What budgetary norms and rules should be proposed and negotiated to guarantee convergence of integration?'; What other orders of control should be applied and by whom?' and What strategic and structural arrangements could facilitate integration?'...|$|R
40|$|Philippine {{economic}} growth is below the typical performance of East Asian neighbors. GNP is outstripping GDP {{as a result of}} national labor income arising from work in other economies and relatively slow domestic output growth. Instead of high domestic investments fueling the absorption of labor at home at good wages, labor seeks migration to other countries with labor shortage and high employment rates. Domestic output is growing with a rising services component at the expense of industry and agriculture. High domestic labor standards make labor unit costs high and the inadequate growth of capital investment opportunities keep productivity relatively low. Capital investment policies - despite economic liberalization that made possible a growing industrial export sector - continue to restrict foreign investments in critical sectors that are prohibited in the Constitution that can be traced to 1935 provisions. National saving rates are low relative to investment needs, especially in highly needed infrastructure and public utilities - areas in which restrictions to foreign direct investment are binding. These saving rates are also low compared to those experienced in East Asian neighbors. The fiscal sector has been a major cause of poor national saving because of <b>persistent</b> current <b>budgetary</b> deficits. External trade and payments positions have improved as a result of economic liberalization. But the full potentials of the economy can be extended with reforms affecting resource use, including labor and capital markets. The potentials for development in the Philippines are not fully exploited at home so that the conquest of poverty is slow. A relative indication of this underperformance can be derived from the immense improvement of economic fundamentals from poor to improving in 2006 just as soon as the government was able to reform the fiscal front...|$|R
