5000|$|High Resolution Melting {{analysis}} is the simplest PCR-based method to understand. Basically, the same thermodynamic properties that {{allowed for the}} gel techniques to work apply here, and in real-time. A fluorimeter monitors the post-PCR denaturation of the entire dsDNA amplicon. You make primers specific to the site you want to amplify. You [...] "paint" [...] the amplicon with a double-strand specific dye, included in the <b>PCR</b> <b>mix.</b> The ds-specific dye integrates itself into the PCR product. In essence, the entire amplicon becomes a probe. This opens up new possibilities for discovery. Either you position the primers very close {{to either side of}} the SNP in question (small amplicon genotyping, Liew, 2004) or amplify a larger region (100-400bp in length) for scanning purposes. For simple genotyping of an SNP, it is easier to just make the amplicon small to minimize the chances you mistake one SNP for another. The melting temperature (Tm) of the entire amplicon is determined and most homozygotes are sufficiently different (in the better instruments) in Tm to genotype. Heterozygotes are even easier to differentiate because they have heteroduplexes generated (refer to the gel-based explanations) which broadens the melt transition and usually gives two discernible peaks. Amplicon melting using a fluorescently-labeled primer has been described (Gundry et al., 2003) but is less practical than using ds-specific dyes due to the cost of the fluorogenic primer.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nosocomial {{infections are}} often caused by multidrug-resistant {{bacteria}} and the incidence is increasing. Acinetobacter, a Gram-negative bacillus, is {{commonly associated with}} the use of intravascular catheterization and airway intubation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification of Acinetobacter baumannii from samples has been standardized that use conventional wet-reagent mix. We have designed and optimized a dry-reagent mix for identification of Acinetobacter species by PCR. The dry-reagent mix can be stored at room temperature, has less chances of contamination, and thus can be used at point-of-care diagnosis. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The present work was focused on comparing the sensitivity and specificity of dry-reagent <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> over conventional wet-reagent <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> for identification of Acinetobacter species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional wet-reagent mix based and dry-reagent mix based PCR were carried out for the DNA isolated from Acinetobacter species. The latter was also applied directly on bacterial growth without prior DNA extraction process. Equal numbers of bacterial isolates other than Acinetobacter species were also subjected to identification by the same protocols for determining the sensitivity and specificity of the test. RESULTS: The Acinetobacter species showed amplification of the target rpoB gene and the band was observed at 397 bp. The dry-reagent <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> results matched completely with the conventional wet-reagent <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> assay. All the non-Acinetobacter isolates were negative for the PCR. This indicates that the test is highly specific. The dry-reagent mix also contained an enzyme resistant to PCR inhibitors and capable of amplifying DNA directly from cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative {{real-time}} PCR (qPCR) {{is becoming}} increasingly important for DNA genotyping and gene expression analysis. For continuous monitoring of the production of PCR amplicons DNA-intercalating dyes are widely used. Recently, we have introduced a new qPCR mix which showed improved amplification of medium-size genomic DNA fragments {{in the presence of}} DNA dye SYBR green I (SGI). In this study we tested whether the new <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> is also suitable for other DNA dyes used for qPCR and whether it can be applied for amplification of DNA fragments which are difficult to amplify. Results We found that several DNA dyes (SGI, SYTO- 9, SYTO- 13, SYTO- 82, EvaGreen, LCGreen or ResoLight) exhibited optimum qPCR performance in buffers of different salt composition. Fidelity assays demonstrated that the observed differences were not caused by changes in Taq DNA polymerase induced mutation frequencies in PCR mixes of different salt composition or containing different DNA dyes. In search for a <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> compatible with all the DNA dyes, and suitable for efficient amplification of difficult-to-amplify DNA templates, such as those in whole blood, of medium size and/or GC-rich, we found excellent performance of a <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> supplemented with 1 M 1, 2 -propanediol and 0. 2 M trehalose (PT enhancer). These two additives together decreased DNA melting temperature and efficiently neutralized PCR inhibitors present in blood samples. They also made possible more efficient amplification of GC-rich templates than betaine and other previously described additives. Furthermore, amplification in the presence of PT enhancer increased the robustness and performance of routinely used qPCRs with short amplicons. Conclusions The combined data indicate that PCR mixes supplemented with PT enhancer are suitable for DNA amplification in the presence of various DNA dyes and for a variety of templates which otherwise can be amplified with difficulty. </p...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a model for}} electrolyte-gated graphene field-effect transistors (EGFETs) that incorporates {{the effects of the}} double layer capacitance and the quantum capacitance of graphene. The model is validated through experimental graphene EGFETs, which were fabricated and measured to provide experimental data and extract graphene EGFET parameters such as mobility, minimum carrier concentration, interface capacitance, contact resistance, and effective charged impurity concentration. The proposed graphene EGFET model accurately determines a number of properties necessary for circuit design such as current-voltage characteristics, transconductance, output resistance, and intrinsic gain. The model {{can also be used to}} optimize the design of EGFETs. For example, simulated and experimental results show that avoiding the practice of partial channel passivation enhances the transconductance of graphene EGFETs. Graphene EGFETs are fabricated for pH sensing. The location of the Dirac point is measured for pH concentrations varying from 4 to 10. In this range, graphene EGFETs are shown to produce - 50. 8 mV/pH sensitivity. Graphene EGFETs are also fabricated for use in a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) system. RTPCR is run successfully to identify DNA segments thought responsible for the metabolism of clopidogrel, a widely prescribed antiplatelet medication. The graphene EGFETs, however, failed to sense an increase in DNA concentration. Further optimization of the <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> is required to ensure that increased DNA concentration lowers the <b>PCR</b> <b>mix</b> pH without rendering the DNA polymerase ineffective.

By assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of DNA fragments present in each chamber, the DNA concentration is determined without the need for a standard curve.

We compared the TaqMan Universal <b>PCR</b> Master <b>Mix</b> with two alternative DNA polymerases: ExTaq HS and Immolase.
