40|$|Oleanolic acid (OA) is a {{well-known}} pentacyclic triterpenoid compound, which {{has been used as}} a dietary supplement and is supplied as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of human liver diseases. These are reasons for the low bioavailability of OA which have restricted its wider application. In this study, two OA prodrugs (1, 3 -cyclic propanyl phosphate esters of OA) were designed and synthesized. The hepatoprotective effects of these prodrugs were evaluated against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) induced liver injury in mice; the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly increased, and the level of the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased. The metabolism, in vitro, of the prodrugs was studied by incubation in rat liver microsome; the plasma pharmacokinetics and the biodistribution in vivo after intravenous (iv) injection to six rats were investigated, respectively. The prodrugs diminished gradually with time; most of the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs</b> were released within 30 min in vitro, and the presumed mechanism of the in vitro metabolism was confirmed. The plasmaconcentration data in vivo was analyzed by a compartmental method: both the prodrugs and the corresponding released <b>parent</b> <b>drugs</b> existed at up to 48 h in rats. The t 1 / 2 improved after intravenous administration in rats compared with direct injection of the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs.</b> All analyte concentrations were highest in the liver, and most of the prodrugs were excreted in feces (> 47. 11 %).

25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{pharmacological properties}} of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind {{to the same}} sites on GABAA-containing receptors, causing an enhancement {{of the actions of}} GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to α1, α2, α3, and α5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the <b>parent</b> <b>drug</b> zopiclone, which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover.|$|E
40|$|This was a {{relational}} study {{investigating the}} implications of a <b>parents</b> <b>drug</b> use on a young child’s life. A {{review of the literature}} revealed that a child is severely impacted by their <b>parent’s</b> <b>drug</b> and alcohol abuse. Prenatal or postnatal use of drugs or alcohol can mean health, mental, social and emotional issues for a child. The relational study compared children whose parents have a history of drug or alcohol abuse to the children whose parents did not. The sample was observed in the Head Start setting and consisted of 77 children. The children whose family life did not include substance abuse were compared to the children whose home life had included substance abuse at some time. The findings were that drug and alcohol use by a parent does affect a child in many ways. The study also implied that poverty and other social issues can affect the way a child grows up as well. The statistics showed that the combination of social issues a child at Head Start may experience has more of an impact than just the substance abuse of a parent. As an overall example; 45 children in the program with parents who were not substance abusers had health problems and 38 had developmental issues. 14 children whose <b>parents</b> abused <b>drugs</b> or alcohol had health problems and only 13 had developmental issues...|$|R

The structure of the synthesized ester prodrug was conﬁrmed by IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy and their purity was established by elemental analysis, HPLC and TLC. The release of ASP as well as CZX, from the ester prodrug was studied. A validated analytical HPLC method for the estimation of the ASP, and the prodrug was developed. The kinetics of ester hydrolysis was studied in four different non-enzymatic buffer solutions, at pH 3, 4, 5 and 7. 4 as well as in experimental plasma. Study of skeletal muscle relaxant and anti-inﬂammatory properties in comparison with the reference compounds has shown that both skeletal muscle relaxant and anti-inﬂammatory activities were present at the same doses of the investigated compounds.

25|$|Thalidomide and its immune-modulating analogs {{alter the}} {{production}} of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The analogs are believed to inhibit {{the production of}} TNF-α, where the analogs are up to 50.000 times more potent in vitro than the <b>parent</b> <b>drug</b> thalidomide. The mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in diminished amounts of this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted. This explains the effect of thalidomide when given to ENL patients, as they commonly have high levels of TNF-α in their blood and in dermatological lesions. In contrast, in vitro assay demonstrated that TNF-α is actually enhanced in T-cell activation, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were stimulated by anti-CD3 which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory dermatologic diseases.|$|E

Several approaches have been proposed to modify the <b>parent</b> nonsteroidal antiinflammatory <b>drugs</b> molecule in order to reduce their gastric toxicity. Oral prodrug approach is one of such approaches. In the present work three nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs viz. ibuprofen, diclofenac, and flurbiprofen were conjugated with sulfonamides like sulphamethoxazole and sulphanilamide via amide bond using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide coupling reaction. The synthesized prodrugs were screened for their analgesic and antiinflammatory activity using Eddy′s hot plate, acetic acid-induced writhing and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema method, respectively.

40|$|A {{series of}} new {{compounds}} containing a 9, 10 -anthracenedione moiety {{and one or}} two peptide chains at position 1 and/or 4 have been synthesized. The amino acid residues introduced are glycine (Gly), lysine (Lys), and tryptophan (Trp), the latter two in both the L- and Dconfigurations. The peptidyl anthraquinones maintain the ability of intercalating efficiently into DNA, even though the orientation within the base-pair pocket may change somewhat with reference to the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs</b> mitoxantrone (MX) and ametantrone (AM). The interaction constants of the mono-, di-, and triglycyl derivatives are well comparable to those found for AM but 5 - 10 times lower than the value reported for MX. On the other hand, the glycyl-lysyl compounds bind DNA to the same extent as (L-isomer) or even better than (D-isomer) MX. As for the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs</b> without peptidyl chains, the new compounds prefer alternating CG binding sites, although to different extents. The bis-Gly-Lys derivatives are the least sensitive to base composition, which may be due to extensive aspecific charged interactions with the polynucleotide backbone. As far as redox properties are concerned, all peptidyl anthraquinones show a reduction potential very close to that of AM and 60 - 80 mV less negative than that of MX; hence, they can produce free-radical-damaging species to an extent similar to the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs.</b> The biological activity has been tested in human tumor and murine leukemia cell lines. Most of the test anthraquinones exhibit cytotoxic properties close to those of AM and considerably lower than those of MX. Stimulation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage is moderately present in representatives of the glycylanthraquinone family, whereas inhibition of the background cleavage occurs when Lys is present in the peptide chain. For most of the test anthraquinones, the toxicity data are in line with the DNA affinity scale and the topoisomerase II stimulation activity. However, in the lysyl derivatives, for which lack of cytotoxicity cannot be related to poor binding to DNA, the steric and electronic properties of the side-chain substituent must impair an effective recognition of the cleavable complex...|$|R

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} {{adverse effects}} of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been recognized since shortly after the introduction of aspirin to the marketplace over a century ago. However, the underlying pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastropathy remains incompletely understood. Advances in understanding some {{of the factors that}} contribute to the mucosal injury have provided clues for the development of safer NSAIDs. The inhibitory effects of nitric oxide (NO) on NSAID-induced leukocyte adherence were exploited in the development of NO-releasing NSAIDs. As well as eliciting less gastrointestinal damage than conventional NSAIDs, these drugs do not elevate blood pressure and show anti-inflammatory effects, additional to those of the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs.</b> Modification of other drugs in a similar manner (i. e., NO-releasing derivatives) has similarly resulted in more effective drugs. More recently, hydrogen sulphide-releasing derivatives of NSAIDs and of other drugs, have been developed, based on the observed ability of H 2 S to reduce inflammation and pain in experimental models. H 2 S-releasing NSAIDs produce negligible gastric damage and exhibit enhanced anti-inflammatory potency as compared to the <b>parent</b> <b>drugs.</b> The NO-NSAIDs and H 2 S-releasing NSAIDs represent examples of new anti-inflammatory drugs with greatly reduced toxicity and improved therapeutic activity, both created through the concept of exploiting the beneficial effects of endogenous gaseous mediators...|$|R
