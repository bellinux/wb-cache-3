After unsuccessful legal action, Pulling founded the one-person advocacy group Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons (BADD), and began <b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> circulating her belief that D encouraged devil worship and suicide.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, a {{cybercrime}} decree was issued, imposing severe {{restrictions on}} freedom of speech in social networking, blogs, text messages and emails. The law outlawed criticism of senior officials and demands for political reform. The law stipulates an imprisonment and a fine of up to 1,000,000 dirhams for <b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> which is deemed to be critical towards the state.|$|E
25|$|As well as <b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> (including its Church Association Tracts) {{and holding}} public meetings, controversially, this also {{involved}} instigating {{legal action against}} Anglo-Catholics. According to the Association this was intended to clarify the law. However, the ritualists refusal {{to comply with the}} courts' verdicts, coupled with the bishops' unwillingness to act, eventually led to such legal action not being pursued.|$|E

25|$|The {{case against}} TSR {{was thrown out}} in 1984, and most of her claims were disproved by reporters, {{especially}} Michael A. Stackpole, who demonstrated that gamers had lower suicide rates than non-gamers. When her lawsuits were dismissed, she founded BADD and began <b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> to promote her belief that D encouraged Satanism, rape, and suicide, and incorporated an entire litany of immoral and illegal practices. BADD effectively ceased to exist after Pulling {{died of cancer in}} 1997.|$|E
25|$|A {{second trial}} {{took place in}} April 2009, when Connelly and Barker, under aliases, faced charges related to the rape of a two-year-old girl. The girl was also on Haringey's child {{protection}} register. Barker {{was found guilty of}} rape, while Connelly was found not guilty of child cruelty charges. Their defence lawyers argued that this second trial was nearly undermined by bloggers <b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> linking them to the death of Peter, which could have prejudiced the jury.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though on}} this {{occasion}} Rajab was personally congratulated by the Minister, his use of Twitter to publicise human rights abuses has brought him into repeated conflict with the authorities. In April 2011 he was threatened with prosecution for the publication on his Twitter account of an allegedly fabricated image {{of the body of}} Ali Issa Saqer showing signs of torture in custody; the threats were withdrawn after prison guards were charged with Saqer's death. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) described the threat against Rajab of the first ever charge in the Arab world involving [...] "tweeting" [...] (<b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> on Twitter) as an illustration of the Bahraini government's implacable hostility towards freedom of expression and Internet freedom.|$|E

Its newspapers published detailed reports about the contacts between Codreanu and King Carol, noting that the Guard enjoyed free publicity [...] "in the official and semiofficial press", and even that government money was being spent on manufacturing Guardist insignia. More disturbingly for Codreanu, Stelescu was <b>publishing</b> <b>information</b> regarding secret contacts between the Guard and the royal mistress, Elena Lupescu, as well as statements implicating Codreanu in the Duca assassination and questioning his Romanian ethnicity.
