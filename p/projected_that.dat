5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers <b>projected</b> <b>that</b> several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E
5|$|Other {{people from}} much further afield {{in the former}} British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% {{of people living in}} England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent, mostly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 2.90% of the {{population}} are black, from Africa and the Caribbean, especially former British colonies. There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families, and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration. Debate over immigration is politically prominent; according to a 2009 Home Office poll, 80% of people want to cap it.

The United Press, however, had New York winning the pennant; they had 81 votes compared to 55 for Brooklyn and 18 for Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their photosynthetic activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is <b>projected</b> <b>that</b> global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} of an attack from the land was not a theoretical concern, as Adolf Hitler sought Spanish support to carry out Operation Felix, an invasion of Gibraltar that would have enabled the Germans to close {{the entrance to the}} Mediterranean to the great disadvantage of the Allies. It was <b>projected</b> <b>that</b> Gibraltar would fall within only three days. In the event, Hitler failed to reach an agreement with the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. Gibraltar's defences were tested several times by air raids carried out by Italy and Vichy France, which only caused limited damage and light casualties, and by Italian submarine and sabotage attacks which damaged or sank a number of ships in the bay.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with lines}} , R3, and R4, the R1 (then simply {{numbered}} line 1) started services in 1989 {{as one of}} the first lines of the Cercanías commuter rail system for Barcelona, known as Rodalies Barcelona.

In 2005, all trains terminating at the airport moved their southern terminus to Molins de Rei. In the long-term future, it is <b>projected</b> <b>that</b> the R1 will take over the southern section of line R2, creating a major north–south axis that will extend along the coast of the Barcelona metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has <b>projected</b> <b>that</b> complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Regional {{cooperation}} projects {{between countries}} in the Middle East are expected to provide benefits to all parties involved but their feasibility is subject to social, economic and political constraints. This article uses a database of planned projects {{in the last decade}} and tries to detect types of <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are less sensitive to the constraints. A typology of projects shows the prevalence of two main groups. A first group of projects avoids constraints by focusing on relatively high micro-economic viability but with low intensity of cooperation: these are economic-business projects and some infrastructure <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are based on mere coordination between countries and mostly implemented separately in a single country. A second group of projects are infrastructure and public services <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> involve a number of countries, and implementation through joint planning and management. We conclude that the response to the constraints for regional cooperation is found in the concentration in <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> do not require any intensive continuous contact between the populations, by choosing business <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are implemented separately in each country, or public <b>projects</b> <b>that</b> are jointly implemented, but on the basis of cooperation between public officers, not necessarily the population. ...|$|R
