A standard tool of labelling cannot be used because the voices of the cartoon's characters are atypical: shouted voice, child voice, foreign accent, whispered speech, voice of animal characters, laugh [...] . We describe the LIPS tool (LIPS Logiciel Interactif de <b>PostSynchronisation</b> : lipsync Interactive Software) and the generation of the acoustic models required by the tool...|$|E
