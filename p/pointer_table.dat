40|$|Abstract. Modern {{object-oriented}} programming languages such as C++ provide convenient abstractions and data encapsulation mechanisms for software developers. However, these features also complicate testing and static analysis {{of programs that}} utilize {{object-oriented programming}} concepts. In particular, the C++ language exhibits features such as multiple inheritance, static and dynamic typecasting that make static analyzers for C++ quite hard to implement. In this paper, we present an approach where static analysis is performed by lowering the original C++ program into a semantically equivalent C program. However, unlike existing translation mechanisms that utilize complex pointer arithmetic operations, virtual-base offsets, virtual-function <b>pointer</b> <b>tables,</b> and calls to run-time libraries to model C++ features, our translation is targeted towards making static program analyzers for C++ easier to write and provide more precise results. We have implemented our ideas in a framework for C++ called CILpp that {{is analogous to the}} popular C Intermediate Language (CIL) framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of our translation in a bug finding tool that uses abstract interpretation and model checking. The bug finding tool uncovered several previously unknown bugs in C++ open source projects. ...|$|R

50|$|The 64-bit {{addressing}} mode ("long mode") is a superset of Physical Address Extensions (PAE); because of this, page sizes may be 4 KB (212 bytes) or 2 MB (221 bytes).

Rather than the three-level page table system used by systems in PAE mode, systems running in long mode use four levels of page table: PAE's Page-Directory <b>Pointer</b> <b>Table</b> is extended from 4 entries to 512, {{and an additional}} Page-Map Level 4 (PML4) Table is added, containing 512 entries in 48-bit implementations. In implementations providing larger virtual addresses, this latter table would either grow to accommodate sufficient entries to describe the entire address range, up to a theoretical maximum of 33,554,432 entries for a 64-bit implementation, or be over ranked by a new mapping level, such as a PML5.

30|$|The {{handover}} between domains is {{not defined}} in PMIPv 6, but the movement between domains is frequent, {{according to the}} development of transportation, and diversification into mobile devices. The mobility of Inter-domain causes high handover delay, packet loss and signaling overhead, according to the fast-moving of the MN. For this reason, two methods of a pointer forwarding scheme are proposed. First, when MN moves inter domain, make a pointer forwarding chain between the domains (LMA). The PMIPv 6 handover between domains is not clearly defined. This is because of the not defined part of the information sharing of the home network prefix (HNP), when the MN moves from pLMA to nLMA. However, when MN enters from pLMA to nLMA area, nLMA, to run the connection (LMA of the CN another), based on the information of HNP received from pLMA, by running the binding update to request HNP information to pLMA, must perform a binding update. This is the point of the packet loss and handover delay, according to heavy signaling overhead occurring. So pointer forwarding between pLMA and nLMA is supposed to set, and LMA (the distance between pLMA and nLMA) is much shorter than sending a binding update to CN (LMA connected to MN). This can reduce the high signaling overhead of the binding update that occurs during the movement of the LMA in the PMIPv 6 network environment. The pointer forwarding scheme maintains a <b>pointer</b> <b>table</b> (PT) per each LMA. Each PT consists of four fields: ID 1, ID 2, CURRENT. The ID 1 field is composed of MN-HoA that is connected to the first, ID 2 field is composed of MN-ID and CURRENT field uses LMAA (LMA address) of pLMA. But, the NEXT field is composed of LMAA (LMA address) of nLMA, to move next. For example, if the value of the NEXT field is NULL, then the value of CURRENT field is LMAA of LMA, so this means that MN stays in the CURRENT LMA.|$|E

These attacks can hijack program control flow whenever a virtual method of a corrupted object is called, potentially allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the underlying system. In this paper we present SAFEDISPATCH, a novel defense to prevent such vtable hijacking by statically analyzing C++ programs and inserting sufficient runtime checks to ensure that control flow at virtual method call sites cannot be arbitrarily influenced by an attacker.

Up to now {{the definition of the}} domain and of its elements is derived from context and knowledge. The internet provides an additional important possibility: A link to a conjoint uniform definition of the domain at unique location on the internet. The associated basic information structure is called "Domain Vector" (DV) and has the structure "UL (of the domain definition) plus sequence of numbers". The "UL" is not only "Uniform Locator" of the domain definition. It also identifies a certain kind of information for later comparison and search. It can be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or an abbreviated equivalent, e. g. a hierarchic numeric pointer or a short local <b>pointer</b> to a <b>table</b> with global internet pointers. The DV structure can be used as general carrier of information which is language independent and more precise than language. A domain which contains DVs is called "Domain Space" (DS) and is defined as metric space. This allows similarity search according to user defined criteria, so that any kind of definable information can be made comparable and searchable according to user selected (relevant) and objectifiable (globally uniform) criteria. DS definitions can be reused in new DS definitions. Their elements, the DVs, are automatically globally uniformly identified and defined. Obviously such conjoint definition of comparable information has great potential. It also can avoid interoperability problems and redundant programming and so save high costs.

To easy to mean sign which implied in caricature, researcher use analysis of semiotic property of Charles Sanders Pierce pursuant to icon, index, and symbol of Roland Barthes about konotasi, myth, and to strengthen analysis, researcher use what is in caricature in is serial of book prohibited impecunious there are culture code namely, hermeunitika, semantic, symbolic, naration, and cultural. By using analysis above, researcher can catch meaning at the opposite of between the line meaning of caricature. Namely sign which emerge is caricature in impecunious prohibited serial is always depicted with oposition of element "rich", this matter of researcher assess to confirm pauper to be remain to and impecunious always is. Furthermore of pauper being construct through some element supporting namely in all day long its of pauper always used shirts, short pants, have singlet, slipper footgear to nip frequent even do not use footgear. its Face expression is always embosomed by sorrow, hopeless, and any accept everthing that happened. Work of pauper framed to embosom shoe polish, flank labour, TKI, farmer, seller of tempe fry, beggar, PKL.

From researcher data analysis give practical suggestion namely depiction in pauper book without subsidy of peniliti assess have precisely, but at book hereinafter if with comic illustration, hence got by situation is reader in meaning repsentasi of this problem of which is lifted (pass/through) caricature less precise. Do not only fulfilling requirement of market, but in representated of is problem of which is lifted as real as passing real correct caricature of caricature is precise matter. Concerning place setting must strenghtened again with other supporter instrument, do not just sit side by side (among/between) the rich and the just impecunious, for example.
