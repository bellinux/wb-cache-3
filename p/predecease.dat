Adomnán also names Artúr, called a son of Conaing in the Senchus, and Domangart, who {{is not included in}} the Senchus. Domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of Áedán, most likely another son of Conaing. The main line of Cenél nGabráin kings were the descendants of Eochaid Buide through his son Domnall Brecc, but the descendants of Conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th.|$|E
5|$|Edward Pulsford {{was born}} at Burslem in Staffordshire on 29 September 1844. His mother was Mary Ann, née Cutler, and his father, James Eustace Pulsford, was a Baptist {{minister}} and businessman. He received a private education and worked with his father as a commission agent; together they worked in Hull, Yorkshire, from 1870 to 1884. On 23 February 1870, he married Mary Charlotte Stainforth at Hull; she would <b>predecease</b> him. In 1883 Edward embarked for New South Wales, while his father travelled to New York to become resident secretary of the Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Company. After his arrival in Sydney, Pulsford immediately {{became involved in the}} free trade cause, and in 1885 he co-founded the Free Trade and Liberal Association of New South Wales (FTLA, a forerunner of the Free Trade Party) with Bernhard Wise. His campaigning on behalf of free trade led to his becoming an honorary member of the Cobden Club.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} House of Metternich in 1773, {{the son of}} a diplomat, he was named after his godfather, Clement-Wenceslas, Archbishop of Trier. Metternich {{received}} a good education at the universities of Strasbourg and Mainz. He was of help during the coronation of Francis II in 1792 and that of his predecessor, Leopold II, in 1790. After a brief trip to England, Metternich was named as the Austrian ambassador to the Netherlands, a short-lived post, since the country was brought under French control the next year. He married his first wife, Eleonore von Kaunitz (a descendant of Karolina of Legnica-Brieg), in 1795, which aided his entry into Viennese society. Despite having numerous affairs, he was devastated by her death in 1825. He would later remarry, wedding Baroness Antoinette Leykam in 1827 and, after her death in 1829, Countess Melanie Zichy-Ferraris in 1831. She would <b>predecease</b> him by five years. Before taking office as Foreign Minister, Metternich held numerous smaller posts, including ambassadorial roles in the Kingdom of Saxony, the Kingdom of Prussia and Napoleonic France. One of Metternich's sons, Richard von Metternich, was also a successful diplomat; many of Metternich's twelve other acknowledged children predeceased him. A traditional conservative, Metternich was keen to maintain the balance of power, in particular by resisting Russian territorial ambitions in Central Europe and lands belonging to the Ottoman Empire. He disliked liberalism and worked to prevent the breakup of the Austrian empire, for example, by crushing nationalist revolts in Austrian north Italy and the German states. At home, he pursued a similar policy, using censorship and a wide ranging spy network to suppress unrest.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of his heir apparent, Ferdinando, in 1713, Cosimo {{deposited}} a bill in the Senate, Tuscany's titular legislature, [...] promulgating that if Cosimo and his new heir apparent, Gian Gastone, were to <b>predecease</b> the Electress, she would ascend the throne. Charles VI was furious; he replied that the Grand Duchy was an imperial fief and therefore he alone possessed the prerogative to alter the laws of succession. To complicate things further, Elisabeth Farnese, heiress of the Duchy of Parma, the second wife of Philip V of Spain, as a great-granddaughter of Margherita de' Medici, exercised a claim to Tuscany. In May 1716, Charles VI, who constantly changed his stance on the issue, told Florence that the Electress's succession was unquestioned, but added that Austria and Tuscany must soon reach an agreement regarding which royal house was to follow the Medici.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, King George VI died, {{the third}} of Queen Mary's {{children}} to <b>predecease</b> her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II.

Mary remarked to Princess Marie Louise: [...] "I have lost three sons through death, but I have never been privileged {{to be there to}} say a last farewell to them." [...] Mary died the next year on 24 March 1953 at the age of 85, only ten weeks before her granddaughter's coronation. Mary let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed. Her remains lay in state at Westminster Hall, where large numbers of mourners filed past her coffin.

2500|$|It was {{probably}} during this interlude at Sutanuti that Charnock suffered a personal {{loss in the}} death of his wife Maria. They had been together for some twenty-five years. They had one son (who would <b>predecease</b> his father), and three surviving daughters who were later baptised in Madras. Although Maria was buried like a Christian, and not cremated as a Hindu, Charnock was said to sacrifice a cock over her grave each year on the anniversary of her death, [...] "after the Pagan Manner". The ritual resembles the Sufi custom of the panch peer or [...] "five saints", which Charnock might have learnt from his years in Bihar.

2500|$|The {{one who did}} {{the most}} to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, {{dedicating}} his Will to Believe (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce {{to be paid to}} give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette <b>predecease</b> him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used [...] "Santiago" [...] ("St. James" [...] in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, a {{free-standing}} earlier structure (marked [...] "E" [...] on plan) {{was very much}} enhanced; it flanks the mansion almost {{as though it were}} a wing of the house itself. Its origins and uses have always been debated. Possibly this was the chantry said to have been built by the D'Evercy family. Though it is known traditionally as the [...] "priest's house", its entrance faces away from the church, into the former forecourt of the 15th-century house. [...] "It may originally have been a range of lodgings for retainers or guests". Whatever its original use, it seems certain that it was remade as a dower house by Joan Stourton, who had married John Sydenham in 1434, not realising that her own son was to <b>predecease</b> her, thus allowing her to remain in the main house for the duration of her life.|$|E
2500|$|She {{married a}} second time in 1503 on her Feast Day of 22 November, Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire; however, this {{marriage}} did not produce any children. As the marriage had required a papal dispensation and the King's licence, Stafford paid Henry VII the sum of £2,000 for the necessary permission to marry Cecily, who at 43 years old was 19 years older than her spouse. Her son Thomas, the 2nd Marquess of Dorset vehemently disapproved of the match, as it is alleged he feared she would use her inheritance to [...] "endow her new husband at his own expense". His fears did have some foundation as Cecily gave Stafford a life estate in holdings valued at [...] £1,000 per year and even vowed to leave him the remainder of her capital should Thomas happen to <b>predecease</b> her. This provoked Thomas to challenge Cecily's right to continue as his father's sole executor, [...] resulting in an acrimonious dispute that necessitated the intervention of King Henry VII and his council to stop it from escalating even further. The settlement the King decreed allowed Cecily to manage her late husband's estate until she had paid off his debts, but prevented her from claiming her dowry until she had transferred the remainder of her son's inheritance to him. King Henry's arbitrary decision also severely limited her control over her own inheritance: she was required to bequeath all of it to Thomas upon her death; until then, Cecily was permitted to grant lands worth up to 1,000 marks per annum for {{a certain number of}} years. Historian Barbara Jean Harris stated that the Crown's oppressive decree greatly restricted Cecily's personal rights as an heiress in favour of those of her eldest son and the tradition of primogeniture. Nearly two decades later, she and her son quarrelled again; on this occasion it was about their mutual duties towards Thomas's seven surviving siblings. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey arbitrated on behalf of King Henry VIII and ordered both Cecily and Thomas to contribute to the dowries of her four living daughters: the ladies Dorothy, Mary, Elizabeth, and Cecily. She was also forced to create individual annuities drawn from her own funds for her three younger sons. In 1527 she gave her daughter Elizabeth an additional dowry of £1000 although her marriage to the Earl of Kildare had gone against the wishes of both Cecily and her first husband. She added the following explanation for the gift of money despite having had earlier misgivings: [...] "Forasmuch as the said marriage is honourable and I and all her friends have cause to be content with the same".|$|E

6000|$|A week {{afterwards}} Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and {{in something}} less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at {{which he had been}} sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. [...] "PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in case of his <b>predecease</b> to be destroyed unread," [...] so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. [...] "I have buried one friend to-day," [...] he thought: [...] "what if this should cost me another?" [...] And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as [...] "not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll." [...] Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe.|$|E
