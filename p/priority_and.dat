5|$|Also synonymised {{with this}} species is Adenanthos crenata, {{published}} by Carl Ludwig Willdenow's in Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel's 1825 16th edition of Systema Vegetabilium. Willdenow published both A.cuneata and A.crenata, giving them different descriptions but designating {{the same type}} specimen for both. Thus A.crenata was rejected under the principle of <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of A.cuneatus.|$|E
5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} the critical competitive <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities that enables competitive manufacturing in the high cost environment of Sweden and how these can be improved to increase manufacturing performance. Method – The {{purpose of this}} thesis was achieved through two main research methods. First a systematic literature review was conducted in order to condensate the existing literature on competitive <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities. Secondly a case {{study was conducted in}} order to examine the identified competitive <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities {{in the context of a}} high cost environment. Findings – Initially, a set of articles were identified and included in the literature review. Through an analysis of the included articles, a framework was created including competitive <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> competitive capabilities. A comparison between the framework and the empirical data collected at the case company identified a number of <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities considered critical for competitive manufacturing in a high cost environment. The literature review revealed a set of improvement actions and methods that could be used to improve the identified critical competitive <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities in order to increase manufacturing performance. Implications – The thesis makes a theoretical contribution by condensing the existing literature on competitive <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities in a high cost environment, and creates a starting point for future research. Further it makes a practical contribution by providing awareness for practitioners regarding <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities, what may be important in the future, and how these could be improved. Limitations – This study identifies how critical <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> capabilities can be improved, however, it does not specify how they can or should be applied and used. Additionally, the inclusion criteria in the systematic literature review did not include improvement actions and thus other suggestions for improvements may not be included. The case study was limited to one company, making the result difficult to generalize...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the linkage between {{innovative}} capabilities <b>and</b> operations <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> corporate performance and try to answer the question of how innovative capabilities support a manufacturing firm’s operations <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> corporate performance. By using survey data from 184 manufacturing firms, firms are clustered according to their innovative capabilities. These clusters are explored in terms of operations <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> corporate performance. The findings substantiate that manufacturing firms can be clustered according to their innovative capabilities. Each innovation cluster adopts and develops different operations <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> they attain diverse financial performance levels implying that there are alternative ways to compete in the market even within the same industry. However, each alternative strategy provides diverse levels of benefits. The findings demonstrate further that high performing firms compete effectively on multiple operations priorities simultaneously. Hence, firms need to excel in multiple <b>priorities</b> <b>and</b> innovation types in their market...|$|R

5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I {{was good enough for}} operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest <b>priority</b> <b>and</b> provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E

When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E

5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, {{his response}} to what he perceived {{as a lack of}} method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus Atylus on the grounds of <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> correctly made the combination Atylus anemonifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E

The discussions on the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute were temporarily given a lower <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> the focus shifted to discussions of fishing rights. He also settled all remaining border issues with Chile. The Lago del Desierto dispute had an international arbitration, favourable to Argentina. The only exception was the dispute over the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, which is still open.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{publication}} Revisio generum plantarum was German botanist Otto Kuntze's {{response to}} what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and that species had already been placed by Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus {{on the grounds of}} <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> made the new combination Atylus anethifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E

Children of single parents and students are given <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these may be grouped together.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} of Cossa's tomb monument {{was negotiated}} {{for about a}} decade following Cossa's death. Cossa's last will and testament—written on his death bed on December 22, 1419—made several of the customary Florentine civic bequests, acts of charity, and traditional ecclesiastical courtesies, {{but the bulk of}} his estate was left to his nephews Michele and Giovanni. The bequests to his nephews took <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884, both of which extended suffrage for men in the United Kingdom, led to large-scale political organisation. These combined with {{the outcome of the}} Corrupt Practices Act of 1883, which prevented the payment of canvassers, led to both Conservative and Liberal Parties approaching female supporters to aid them in political campaigning. The Conservatives were first to offer a political role for women in Wales with the opening of branches of the Primrose League, but campaigning for women's rights was not its <b>priority</b> <b>and</b> merely aimed to 'interest women in politics'.|$|E

5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third <b>priority</b> <b>and</b> fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E

5|$|As {{the battle}} progressed, {{more and more}} forces would become {{available}} to the Germans. Adolf Hitler, stunned by the attack, agreed that the defence of the Netherlands should receive absolute <b>priority</b> <b>and</b> {{over the course of}} the battle reinforcements would stream in; from Wehrkreis VI, the Wesel area and General Friedrich Christiansen's Armed Forces Command Netherlands. Model arranged for units to be sent straight to the units in action in order to avoid long-winded logistics, and rushed in specialist urban warfare and machine gun battalions. Each day of the battle, the German military strength increased whilst the British supplies diminished. By 21 September, the fifth day of the battle, German forces outnumbered the British by 3:1 and continued to increase.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} McKinley was nominated, {{it was not}} clear who his Democratic rival would be.

The platform was deemed of highest <b>priority,</b> <b>and</b> only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. Others either seeking or spoken of for the nomination included South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
