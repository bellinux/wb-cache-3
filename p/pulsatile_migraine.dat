40|$|A. M., is a 14 {{year old}} girl, who {{presented}} with {{an episode of}} fever and sore throat associated to supraorbital <b>pulsatile</b> <b>migraine</b> with phonophobia, nausea and vomiting. The headache, exacerbated by eye movements, got worse in the following days, requiring access to the Emergency Department: ophthalmological examination showed bilateral optic nerve edema with peripapillary hemorrhages (LE>RE). CTscan results were unremarkable so a lumbar puncture was performed, which was normal, but immediate improvement of headache was noted. VEP, ERG and MRI were all normal, confirming the hypothesis of benign intracranial hypertension. No evidence of endocrine dysfunction was identified. The blood virological test ruled out the main etiologic agents (1 - 2 HSV, CMV, parvovirus B 19, Adenovirus) {{and the search for}} other, uncommon, viruses are still in progress. An empirical therapy with i. v. corticosteroids and acetazolamide 15 mg/kg/die was started and iv potassium for 4 days was given for drug-induced hypokalemia. The next ophtalmological check up after 6 days therapy showed complete recovery from the peripapillary hemorrhages and a partial reduction in edema of the papillae. After excluding a secondary etiology for intracranial hyper-tension a diagnosis of idiophatic pseudo-tumor cerebri was established. The girl was discharged in good condition with instructions to continue low dose oral steroids tapering down the dose before stopping it completely together with diuretics until the next clinical follow-up...|$|E
50|$|The carotid and {{vertebral}} arteries {{are most}} commonly affected. Middle and distal {{regions of the}} internal carotid arteries are frequently involved. Patients with FMD in the carotid arteries typically present around 50 years of age. Symptoms of craniocervical involvement include headaches (mostly <b>migraine),</b> <b>pulsatile</b> tinnitus, dizziness, and neck pain, although patients are often asymptomatic. On physical examination, one may detect neurological symptoms secondary to a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), a bruit over an affected artery, and diminished distal pulses. Complications of cerebrovascular FMD include TIA, ischemic stroke, Horner syndrome, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|R
