5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{engines to}} retain high {{specific}} impulse at all altitudes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminology}} in {{the literature}} surrounding this subject is somewhat confused—the term aerospike was originally used for a truncated <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> with a very rough conical taper and some gas injection, forming an [...] "air spike" [...] to help {{make up for the}} absence of the plug tail. However, frequently, a full-length <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> is now called an aerospike.|$|E
50|$|Advanced altitude-compensating designs, {{such as the}} {{aerospike}} or <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle,</b> {{attempt to}} minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{are used}} in {{aircraft}} typically with jet engines — the Junkers Jumo 004's Zwiebel (onion) movable restrictive body being a pioneering example, providing a form of variable geometry with its exhaust — both because of the annular shape of the turbine exhaust and for their altitude compensating characteristics. For high speed aircraft, translating the plug or external cowl provides a means of area control with relatively simple actuation. <b>Plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{have been shown to}} provide noise reduction compared to traditional convergent-divergent nozzles. [...] Weight and cooling are typical concerns with aircraft <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{belong to}} a class of {{altitude}} compensating nozzles much like the aerospike which, unlike traditional designs, maintains its efficiency at {{a wide range of}} altitudes.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{aerospike}} and <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles,</b> if modular {{combustion chambers}} {{were used in}} place of a single combustion chamber, then thrust vectoring would be achievable by throttling the flow to various chambers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{is a type}} of nozzle which {{includes}} a centerbody or plug around which the working fluid flows. Plug nozzles have applications in aircraft, rockets, and numerous other fluid flows.|$|E
50|$|The Kolesov RD-36-51 had {{an unusual}} {{variable}} con-di nozzle for the nozzle pressure ratios at supersonic speeds. Without an afterburner {{there was no}} variable nozzle already available. A translating <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> was used.|$|E
5000|$|At liftoff {{the engine}} {{typically}} burns both fuels, gradually changing the mixture over altitude {{in order to}} keep the exhaust plume [...] "tuned" [...] (a strategy similar in concept to the <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> but using a normal bell), eventually switching entirely to LH2 once the kerosene is burned off. At that point the engine is largely a straight LH2/LOX engine, with an extra fuel pump hanging onto it.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} and analytical acoustic {{results of a}} scale-model investigation or unsuppressed and mechanically suppressed high-radius ratio coannular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> with inverted velocity and temperature profiles are summarized. Nine coannular nozzle configurations along with a reference conical nozzle were evaluated in the Anechoic Free-Jet Facility {{for a total of}} 212 acoustic test points. Most of the tests were conducted at variable cycle engine conditions applicable to advanced high speed aircraft. The tested <b>nozzles</b> included coannular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> with both convergent and convergent-divergent (C-D) terminations in order to evaluate C-D effectiveness in the reduction of shock-cell noise and 20 and 40 shallow-chute mechanical suppressors in the outer stream in order to evaluate their effectiveness in the reduction of jet noise. In addition to the acoustic tests, mean and turbulent velocity measurements were made on selected plumes of the 20 shallow-chute configuration using a laser velocimeter. At a mixed jet velocity of 700 m/sec, the 20 shallow-chute suppressor configuration yielded peak aft quadrant suppression of 11. 5 and 9 PNdB and forward quadrant suppression of 7 and 6 PNdB relative to a baseline conical nozzles during static and simulated flight, respectively. The C-D terminations were observed to reduce shock-cell noise. An engineering spectral prediction method was formulated for mechanically suppressed coannular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Laser {{velocimeter}} data, collected {{as part of}} {{an acoustic}} investigation of coannular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles,</b> is provided. The type of traverse, position, and histogram number is given along with the mean and turbulent velocity data. The velocites are normalized with respect to the outer flow velocity and the 'mixed' velocity...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Space Shuttle Main Engine high-pressure oxygen turbopump <b>nozzle</b> <b>plug</b> trajectories has been performed, using a Lagrangian method to track <b>nozzle</b> <b>plug</b> particles expelled from a turbine through a high Reynolds number flow in a turnaround duct with turning vanes. Axisymmetric and parametric analyses reveal that if <b>nozzle</b> <b>plugs</b> exited the turbine {{they would probably}} impact the LOX heat exchanger with impact velocities which are significantly less than the penetration velocity. The finding that only slight to moderate damage will result from <b>nozzle</b> <b>plug</b> failure in flight {{is supported by the}} results of a hot-fire engine test with induced <b>nozzle</b> <b>plug</b> failures...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the mid-1950s, Rao {{began to}} use {{mainframe}} computers at Rocketdyne to make computations {{for the design of}} rocket nozzles. Kramer and Wheelock state, [...] "Rao developed a method for determining the nozzle contour that would produce the maximum thrust for any given nozzle area ratio and length... The optimum turned out to be not only more efficient but also considerably shorter by about 60% than a 15-degree conical nozzle of the same area." [...] George P. Sutton, who worked with Rao at Rocketdyne, said that [...] "bell shape or curved exit contour is used almost universally today for nozzles designed since about 1960 for large as well as small thrust chamber nozzles" [...] and for both solid and liquid propellants. In 1963, the Advanced Propulsion Section of NASA published Computation of <b>Plug</b> <b>Nozzle</b> Contours by the Rao Optimum Thrust Method about a study that was performed to design a <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> using Rao’s maximum thrust theory using a FORTRAN computer program. In 1983, Rao's design was modified, with a slightly different contour, to maximize performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{expanding}} nozzle {{is a type}} of {{rocket nozzle}} that, unlike traditional designs, maintains its efficiency at a wide range of altitudes. It {{is a member of the}} class of altitude compensating nozzles, a class that also includes the <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> and aerospike. While the expanding nozzle is the least technically advanced and simplest to understand from a modeling point of view, it also appears to be the most difficult design to build.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s various TPS systems were {{proposed}} to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels {{in the heat}} shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs which would be cheaper to develop, be more rugged, and {{eliminate the need for}} classified technology. The disadvantages are increased weight and complexity, and lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar technology (the <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle)</b> did undergo extensive ground testing.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the theory {{used to calculate}} supersonic flow in <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> and the computer program based on this theory. Flow properties are calculated by the method of characteristics. Sauer's transonic theory is {{used to determine the}} starting line and Korst's technique is used to calculate the base pressure...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{of these}} allows the {{supersonic}} flow {{to adapt to}} the ambient pressure by expanding or contracting, thereby changing the exit ratio so that it is at (or near) optimal exit pressure for the corresponding altitude. The <b>plug</b> and aerospike <b>nozzles</b> are very similar in that they are radial in-flow designs but <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> feature a solid centerbody (sometimes truncated) and aerospike nozzles have a [...] "base-bleed" [...] of gases to simulate a solid center-body. ED nozzles are radial out-flow nozzles with the flow deflected by a center pintle.|$|R
40|$|Jet noise {{suppression}} data presented earlier by Maestrello for porous <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> have been supplemented by {{the testing of}} a family of nozzles having an equivalent throat diameter of 11. 77 cm. Two circular reference <b>nozzles</b> and eight <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> having radius ratios of either 0. 53 or 0. 80 were tested at total pressure ratios of 1. 60 to 4. 00. Data were taken both with and without a forward motion of coannular flow jet, and some tests were made with a heated jet. Jet thrust was measured. The data were analyzed to show the effects of suppressor geometry on nozzle propulsive efficiency and jet noise. Jet noise reductions in overall sound pressure level of up to 15 dB were obtained with a 3. 5 percent reduction in thrust, but reductions of 10 dB were obtained at thrust reductions on the order of 0. 3 percent. The noise reductions for subsonic pressure ratios were much less than those for supersonic pressure ratios...|$|R
50|$|Bono pursued {{single-stage}} space launch as {{simpler and}} cheaper. He realized {{to do this}} {{he would need to}} use high specific impulse liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket engines. Afterwards he proposed to make these vehicles reusable. From his ROOST design onwards Bono advocated space launch vehicles without wings, usually using rocket assisted vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL). According to his estimates, wings consisted mostly of dead weight that decreased launch payload mass. He patented a reusable <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> rocket engine which had dual use as a heat shield for atmospheric reentry. His early 1960s concepts influenced later designs like the 1990s Delta Clipper, also from Douglas.|$|E
5000|$|Douglas Aircraft's SASSTO, {{short for}} [...] "Saturn Application Single Stage to Orbit", was a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) {{reusable}} launch system designed by Philip Bono's team in 1967. SASSTO {{was a study}} in minimalist designs, a launcher with the specific intent of repeatedly placing a Gemini capsule in orbit for the lowest possible cost. The SASSTO booster {{was based on the}} layout of the S-IVB upper stage from the Saturn family, modified with a <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Although the SASSTO design was never followed up at Douglas, it is widely referred to in newer studies for SSTO launchers, notably the MBB [...] "Beta" [...] design, which was largely an updated version of SASSTO.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{garden hose}} trigger nozzles are a simple {{example of the}} <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> and its method of operation. In this example the nozzle {{consists}} of a conical or bell shaped opening with a plug on a movable rod positioned {{in front of the}} nozzle. The plug looks similar to a poppet valve. The stem of the valve runs back through the body of the nozzle body to a [...] "trigger", normally a long lever running down the back of the nozzle assembly. A spring keeps the valve pressed against the opening under normal use, thereby providing a failsafe cut-off that stops the flow of water when the nozzle is dropped.|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{investigation of the}} flow field and base pressure of internal-external-expansion truncated <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> are discussed. Experimental results for two axisymmetric, conical plug-cylindrical shroud, truncated <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> are presented for both open and closed wake operations. These results include extensive optical and pressure data covering nozzle flow field and base pressure characteristics, diffuser effects, lip shock strength, Mach disc behaviour, and the recompression and reverse flow regions. Transonic experiments for a special planar transonic section are presented. An extension of the analytical method of Hall and Mueller to include the internal shock wave from the shroud exit is presented for closed wake operation. Results of this analysis include effects on the flow field and base pressure of ambient pressure ratio, nozzle geometry, and the ratio of specific heats. Static thrust {{is presented as a}} function of ambient pressure ratio and nozzle geometry. A new transonic solution method is also presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept for}} <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> cooled by inlet ram air is presented. Experimental data {{obtained}} {{with a small}} scale model, 21. 59 -cm (8. 5 -in.) diameter, in a static altitude facility demonstrated high thrust performance and excellent pumping characteristics. Tests were made at nozzle pressure ratios simulating supersonic cruise and takeoff conditions. Effect of plug size, outer shroud length, and varying amounts of secondary flow were investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} derivations of the non-axial thrust divergence {{losses for}} convergent-divergent nozzles {{are described as}} well as how these calculations are embodied in the Navy/NASA engine computer program. The convergent-divergent geometries considered are simple classic axisymmetric nozzles, two dimensional rectangular nozzles, and axisymmetric and two dimensional <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles.</b> A simple, traditional, inviscid mathematical approach is used to deduce the influence of the ineffectual non-axial thrust {{as a function of the}} nozzle exit divergence angle...|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit {{pressure and the}} ambient pressure, {{the diameter of the}} nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature). This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines. In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled. To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle,</b> stepped nozzles, the expanding nozzle and the aerospike have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept was}} first {{explored}} in the US by Robert Salkeld, who published {{the first study}} on the concept in Mixed-Mode Propulsion for the Space Shuttle, Astronautics & Aeronautics August 1971. He studied a number of designs using such engines, both ground based and a number that were air-launched from large jet aircraft. He concluded that tripropellant engines would produce gains of over 100% in payload fraction, reductions of over 65% in propellant volume and better than 20% in dry weight. A second design series studied {{the replacement of the}} Shuttles SRBs with tripropellant based boosters, in which case the engine almost halved the overall weight of the designs. His last full study was on the Orbital Rocket Airplane which used both tripropellant and (in some versions) a <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle,</b> resulting in a spaceship only slightly larger than a Lockheed SR-71, able to operate from traditional runways.|$|E

40|$|Jet noise {{suppression}} data presented earlier by Maestrello for porous <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> were supplemented by {{the testing of}} a family of nozzles having an equivalent throat diameter of 11. 77 cm. Two circular reference <b>nozzles</b> and eight <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> having radius ratios of either 0. 53 or 0. 80 were tested at total pressure ratios of 1. 60 to 4. 00.

The data were analyzed to show the effects of suppressor geometry on nozzle propulsive efficiency and jet noise. Aerodynamic testing of the nozzles was carried out in order to study the physical features that lead to the {{noise suppression}}. The aerodynamic flow phenomena were examined by the use of high speed shadowgraph cinematography, still shadowgraphs, extensive static pressure probe measurements, and two component laser Doppler velocimeter studies. The different measurement techniques correlated well with each other and demonstrated that the porous plug changes the shock cell structure of a standard nozzle into a series of smaller, periodic cell structures without strong shock waves. These structures become smaller in dimension and have reduced pressure variations as either the plug diameter or the porosity is increased, changes that also reduce the jet noise and decrease thrust efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{has been}} studied as a {{promising}} nozzle from a viewpoint of improving thrust efficiency for rocket or space plane. In the field of mechanical engineering, supersonic jets from a Laval or a conical nozzle are frequentlry used as a cleaning tool, cooling tool, mixing tool, etc. The <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> also has possibility applicable {{to the field of}} mechanical engineering as well, however, the jet structure of the <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> is now well known. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify the structure of jets from a <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> by solving Euler equations numerically. The jet flowfield is computed for an axisymmetric plug with a design Mach number 2. 0, and the velocity distributions on jet center line are obtained for the over, correct and underexpanded supersonic jets. The structures of the jets issuing from a <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> are highly complicated and are found to be quite different from the jets from a Laval nozzle...|$|E
40|$|Seven single stream model nozzles {{were tested}} in the Anechoic Free-Jet Acoustic Test Facility to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of convergent divergent (C-D) flowpaths in the reduction of shock-cell noise under both static and mulated flight conditions. The test nozzles included a baseline convergent circular nozzle, a C-D circular nozzle, a convergent annular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle,</b> a C-D annular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle,</b> a convergent multi-element suppressor <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and a C-D multi-element suppressor <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Diagnostic flow visualization with a shadowgraph and aerodynamic plume measurements with a laser velocimeter were performed with the test nozzles. A theory of shock-cell noise for annular plug nozzles with shock-cells in the vicinity of the plug was developed. The benefit of these C-D nozzles was observed over a broad range of pressure ratiosin the vicinity of their design conditions. At the C-D design condition, the C-D annual nozzle was found to be free of shock-cells on the plug...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation {{has been carried}} out to study the effect of curvature of the cowling lip on the expansion in a <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> at the Mach number 1. 50. In the theoretical phase of this investigation, the design of the profile of <b>plug</b> <b>nozzle</b> is based on expansion waves emanating from a cowling lip surface of variable radius of curvature, applying graphical and finite difference methods. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the viscous interaction between the primary and secondary streams of ejector nozzles was developed. The analysis accounts for real sonic line effects and the streamwise variation in stream mixing and boundary layer within the ejector. The aspects of the analysis are explained and illustrated by applying the theory {{to a variety of}} ejector configurations including cylindrical shroud, contoured flap and <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Extensive comparisons are made between theory and data to show the importance of various analytical assumptions and such design variables as diameter ratio, spacing ratio, total temperature ratio, and primary nozzle geometry...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} {{a method for}} predicting jet mixing and shock noise spectra from coannular <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> operated in the inverted velocity profile mode. It is shown that the jet mixing noise prediction method {{is based on the}} physics of the flow and its noise radiating characteristics, modeling the source spectrum, eddy convection, and fluid shrouding in a simplistic fashion. Further, the shock noise prediction procedure is described, noting that it is an extension of the Fisher-Harper-Bourne method for conical nozzles. Finally, it is concluded that the method has the potential of being extended to suppressors of complex geometries...|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{the garden}} hose example, <b>plug</b> <b>nozzles</b> use a shaped rocket nozzle with a poppet-shaped plug to allow {{the pattern of the}} rocket exhaust to be changed. This is used to adjust for changes in altitude; at lower altitudes the plug is pulled back to cause the exhaust to spread out, while at higher altitudes the lower air {{pressure}} will cause this to happen naturally. An alternative construction for the same basic concept is to use two nozzles, one inside the other, and adjust the distance between them. This pattern has the advantage of better control over the exhaust and simpler cooling arrangements.|$|R
