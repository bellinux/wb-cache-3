40|$|OBJECTIVES: p 120 ctn is a {{component}} of the catenin family. To date, there have only been two studies examining expression levels of p 120 ctn in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Paraffined</b> specimens of 113 OSCCs and 12 of normal mucosa were examined by immunohistochemistry. Frozen samples of 20 OSCCs and 5 of normal mucosa were examined by Western blot (WB). Results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Five cell lines were examined by immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, and WB to show immunoreactivity and cellular localization of p 120 ctn. RESULTS: Altered p 120 ctn expression was observed in 109 / 113 cases of OSCC. Heterogenous cytoplasmic/nuclear expression was associated with loss of membranous distribution (88 / 113 cases). Complete loss of expression was noted in 21 / 113 cases. Increased cytoplasmic expression was evident in all positive cases, without significant correlation among p 120 ctn staining/pattern and grading/stage. Reduction/absence of p 120 ctn expression was related to poor prognosis (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: p 120 ctn delocalization/loss of expression could be an independent prognostic marker in OSCC...|$|E

N-myc oncogene amplification is considered {{to be one of the}} most important prognostic factors used to evaluate survival in these patients. Objectives: The aim of our study was to determine amplification of the N-myc oncogene using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to show the influence of N-myc amplified tumors on the overall survival rate. Patients and Methods: This study is an analytical historical cohort study of forty children with neuroblastoma admitted to the Shafa Hospital, Iran from 1999 to 2010. <b>Paraffined</b> blocks of tumoral tissue were analyzed for N-myc amplification by a PCR.

40|$|The {{infection}} of normal or hyperplastic rabbit skin with the papilloma virus can be greatly enhanced by protecting the scarified and inoculated {{area with a}} layer of <b>paraffined</b> gauze until healing occurs. In this way the necrosis which follows upon scarification and also the scabbing are almost entirely prevented and in consequence epithelial regeneration is usually complete within 24 hours. Not only are many susceptible cells provided to the virus far earlier than would otherwise be the case,—and collateral tests have shown that it becomes associated with them within a few hours instead of after many,—but the inoculum is itself conserved, instead of becoming largely lost amidst necrotic tissue and scab, as under ordinary circumstances. The effective titer of the virus is increased by the procedure from 10 to 100 times over that attained when hyperplastic skin is allowed to dry after inoculation. Since the results under the latter circumstances are 10 to 100 times better than those when normal skin is treated in the same way it follows that a 100 - to 10, 000 -fold increase in the effectiveness of the virus has now been obtained...|$|E
40|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} metaplasia is a pre-cancerous condition {{caused by}} chronic esophagitis. Chromosomal instability (CIN) {{is common in}} Barrett's cells: therefore, we investigated the possible presence of centrosomal aberrations (a main cause of CIN) by centrosomal protein immunostaining in <b>paraffined</b> esophageal samples of patients who developed a Barrett's adenocarcinoma. In most (55 %) patients, alterations of the pericentriolar material (PCM) signals were evident and consistently marked the transition between normal epithelium to metaplasia. The alterations could even be found in adjacent native squamous epithelium, Barrett's mucosa and submucosal gland cells, {{as well as in}} the basal/epibasal layers of the mucosa and submucosal gland duct, which are the regions hosting esophageal stem and progenitor cells. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the three esophageal histotypes (one being pathological) can have a common progenitor. Surprisingly, PCM defective signal eventually decreased with neoplastic progression, possibly to enhance the genome stability of advanced cancer cells. Importantly, PCM altered signals in Barrett's mucosa and their apparent evolution in successive histopathological steps were correlated to adenocarcinoma aggressiveness, suggesting PCM as a possible prognostic marker for tumor relapse. Extending our observations in a prospective study might help in the development of new prevention protocols for adenocarcinoma patients...|$|E

The infected animals were further divided into two groups: an asymptomatic group of 10 dogs without clinical signs of the disease; and a symptomatic group of 10 dogs with classical clinical signs. All thirty animals were mongrel dogs of undefined age, obtained from the municipality of Belo Horizonte, MG, metropolitan area.

The {{aim of this}} study was histopathological evaluation of the effect of sodium sulfonate application as neutral soap on the cat's dental pulp after an ideal composite restorative treatment.   Methods: Ten adult cats with 40 caries-free canine teeth were selected for the study. Class V cavities were prepared in the buccal surfaces of all the teeth. The teeth of the right quadrants were treated with composite, whereas the teeth of the left quadrants were primarily etched, after using of sodium sulfonate solution, they treated with composite. The first five cats were killed after one week and the other five cats after one month. The teeth were fixed, decalcified and after being sliced, <b>paraffined</b> blocks were made and microscopic slides were prepared and histologically evaluated. Results: The results of the histological evaluation showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the intensity of inflammation in the pulp of the teeth in the right and left quadrants after one week (P= 1. 000) and one month (P= 0. 773). However, there was significant difference after one week regarding predentin formation (P= 0. 017) and in the teeth of the left quadrants, the formation of predentin was more that the right quadrants, but no meaningful difference was observed after one month (P= 0. 203).    Conclusion: It seems that the sodium sulfonate in composite restorative treatments without fear of damage to the pulp can be used...|$|E
40|$|With {{the method}} of {{studying}} experimental extracorporeal thrombosis already described, the influences of certain chemical substances, such as distilled water, bile salts, d-glucose, urea and calcium chloride, have been examined. The Effect of Distilled Water. It {{is well known that}} shed or hemolyzed blood, when injected into the circulation, may cause the liberation of fibrin and subsequently intravascular clotting. On the other hand, it has been stated by Reed that heparinized blood, despite its incoagulability, can clot very soon after the addition of distilled water. In this connection, I have carried out a series of experiments and have verified this fact, as will be seen from the results. Experiment 1. [...] A rabbit weighing 2100 gm. was given 50 mg. of heparin (Hynson, Westcott and Dunning) intravenously. Blood was drawn immediately from the carotid artery into a <b>paraffined</b> vessel; 1 cc. of the blood was put into each of a series of small test-tubes and various amounts of distilled water were added to each and clotting time was recorded (Table I). Accordingly I attempted to see what the effect would be of distilled water placed outside of the collodion membrane. Experiment 2. [...] When the collodion tube of the circulatory loop was surrounded by distilled water, the latter passed through the membrane into the circulation, causing, from 5 to 10 minutes later, hemolysis of the heparinized blood flowing along the wall of the collodion tube. 30 minutes or more later, fibrin formed, and 963 964 EXTRACORPOREAL THROMBOSIS. V coagulation of hemolyzed blood followed. In the serial sections this clot looked almost entirely homogeneous, and neither structure nor formed elements could be differentiated because of hemolysis. * Two reasons are advanced to explain this phenomenon: one that tissue extract or fibrinogen and hemoglobin set free by hemolysis neutralize the heparin action, and the other, dilution of the anticoagulant. According to Howell, the latter explanation is less probable...|$|E
