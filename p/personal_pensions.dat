A group personal pension plan (GPPP) can be established by an employer {{as a way of}} providing all of its employees with access to a pension plan run by a single provider. By grouping all the employees together in this way, it is normally possible for the employer to negotiate favourable terms with the provider, thus reducing the cost of pension provision to the employees. The employer will also normally contribute to the GPPP.|$|E
25|$|Stakeholder {{pensions}} (insured <b>personal</b> <b>pensions,</b> with charges capped {{at a low}} level) are a form of pension arrangement {{designed to}} be easily understandable and available. Stakeholder pensions are in effect personal pension schemes set up on terms which meet standards set by the government (for example there are restrictions on the charges the provider may make). Although a stakeholder pension is a personal pension, they can (and in some circumstances must) be offered by an employer as a cost-effective way of providing pension cover for their workforce.|$|E

5000|$|SIPPs are {{a type of}} <b>Personal</b> <b>Pension</b> Plan. Another {{subset of}} this type of pension is the Stakeholder Pension Plan. SIPPs, in common with <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> schemes, are tax [...] "wrappers", {{allowing}} tax rebates on contributions in exchange for limits on accessibility. The HMRC rules allow for a greater range of investments to be held than <b>Personal</b> <b>Pension</b> Plans, notably equities and property.

2500|$|In Paris Merezhkovsky {{founded the}} Religious Union (later Soyuz Neprimirimykh, the Union of the Unpacified), was holding lectures, contributed to Pavel Milyukov's Poslednye Novosty and Pyotr Struve's Osvobozhdenye newspapers, exposing {{what he saw}} as the Bolshevist lies and denouncing the [...] "Kingdom of Antichrist." [...] It was {{becoming}} more and more obvious, though, that Merezhkovsky, backed only by the circle of friends, was in isolation, misunderstood by some, abhorred by others. His calling for the international intervention into Russia angered the left; rejecting the restoration of the Russian monarchy antagonized the right. His single ally at the time was Ivan Bunin; never sharing much personal affinity, the two men formed an alliance in their relentless anti-Soviet campaign. Besides, having maintained strong contacts with influential French politics lobbying the interests of the Russian immigrants, both ensured that the Russian writers should get some financial support from the French government. A couple of years later another sponsor was found in Tomas Masaryk who granted <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> to some prominent figures in the immigrant Russian writers' community.|$|E

The results obtained indicate that the fundamental factors in the pricing of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Pension</b> Plans are associated with the fixed-income market (maturity, default risk, relevance of short term operations) ...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{conventional}} <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> {{where the}} provider as trustee has ownership {{and control of}} the assets, in a SIPP the member may have ownership of the assets (via an individual trust) as long as the scheme administrator is a co-trustee to exercise control.
