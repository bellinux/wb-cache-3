30|$|Due to the {{increasing}} social pressure on civil unions, civil unions have accepted <b>pension</b> <b>reforms.</b> Social innovation is achieved through the pressure on stakeholders to draw concessions and sacrifices. The appropriate level of civic responsibility and pressure for stakeholders surrounding <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> is an effective factor in eliminating the obstacles to complex <b>pension</b> <b>reforms.</b> In addition, stakeholders involved in <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> learn from civic responsibilities to reduce social conflicts, providing fundamental assets of sustainable social innovation. In summary, policy knowledge about specific concrete policy alternatives to <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> has put {{a great deal of}} social pressures on the government to restrain the resistance of civil unions and to encourage social consensus on reform proposals. In addition, the government and the ruling party had a strong push for President Park’s will - public sector reform. In the Public Sector Reform Program under the Park Administration of South Korea, reform of the public pension system was set as the most important priority. These government-led strong reform initiatives played a fundamental role in the <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> proposal. In addition, policy entrepreneurs attempted to build a strong link between positive government intervention and policy knowledge. These factors contributed to inducing a political consensus to the <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> proposal. Further, this policy experience and learning to achieve political consensus to <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> with competing interests in South Korea will provide social asset to facilitate future institutional reforms as social innovation.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{suggests that}} demographic {{changes and the}} creation of a single currency in Europe have compelled greater EU influence in Spanish <b>pension</b> <b>reform.</b> Although <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> has remained the domain of the domestic realm, increased European integration has necessitated lifting the issue of <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> to the EU level. The economic dependence among members of EMU and the unique institutional structure o£ the EU has facilitated increased attention at the EU level regarding <b>pension</b> <b>reform.</b> Particularly, the creation of the "open method of coordination" introduced at the Lisbon Summit has created an institutionalized way for the EU to play an oversight function in <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> as well as provide a formalized avenue for countries to share policy ideas. As a result, greater EU activity in pension policy has directly influenced <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> agenda setting with Spain. Politically, the EU presents a unique condition. For instance, accountability is quite distinct from democratic configurations within member states whereby constituencies can place greater political pressure to inhibit change. In addition, national governments are able to use the EU as a scapegoat to implement needed yet unpopular or highly contested policies such as <b>pension</b> <b>reform.</b> Economically, the almost complete economic integration after the introduction of the Euro, means that countries are ever more dependent on policy choices in other member states.

As <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> are intrinsically {{difficult to define}} and pinpoint, we introduce an alternative measure of <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> by comparing long-term forecasts of pension expenditures for seventeen European countries. The larger the decrease in expected spending on public pensions in 2050 between two base years, the more successful a <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> the country achieved (after controlling for other factors, such as demography). Our analysis shows that the reform effort varies widely across countries and over time.

In {{the second part of}} the paper, we analyze factors that may facilitate or hamper <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> – quality of fiscal institutions, public debt, trade unions’ influence, and also demographic factors. Only the measure of trade union power proves to be significant in explaining <b>pension</b> <b>reforms.</b> Other factors, such as quality of fiscal institutions, size of the existing funded pillar, public debt or recent demographic developments, do not seem to play a significant role. However, specific pension system factors – most significantly the lagged change in pension expenditures – are significant and suggest that European governments do <b>reform</b> their <b>pension</b> systems when faced with the threat of escalating pension expenditures. In conclusion, we propose a hypothesis of “bounded” economic rationale of European governments, as they seem to react to expectations of an increase in pension spending, but they seem to be content with the current spending levels.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} national {{processes of}} <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> in various European welfare states. The countries under study (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden) not only face similar fiscal, demographic and competitive pressures {{since the early}} 1990 s, but are also characterized by broadly similar pension arrangements. Being from the defined benefit/pay-as-you-go type, mainly financed through wage-based social contributions, pension systems in these countries reveal a high vulnerability to changes in demographic and employment structures. Generally, I argue, that European integration has exerted only marginal influence on national pension policies. Moreover, the impact of European integration does not explain cross-country variance in <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> outcomes: While we observe substantial similarities {{in the direction of}} reform, the degree of policy change varies considerable even among countries with similar pension policy profiles. By the same token, the failure of several <b>pension</b> <b>reforms</b> in European welfare states suggests, that the presence of the EMU convergence criteria and increased economic internationalization was by no means a sufficient condition for the successful implementation of <b>pension</b> <b>reforms.</b> Thus, only a closer inspection of national decision making processes does allow for an explanation of different <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> outcomes. The political feasibility of a substantial <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> critically depends on the government's ability to orchestrate a reform consensus either among the major political parties {{on both sides of the}} political center or between the government and the trade unions.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. <b>Pension</b> <b>reform</b> is {{certainly}} the most complex of all structural reforms because it upsets existing political-economy equilibria, affects public finances, intervenes in the functioning of labor and capital markets, distributes income both across and within generations, and changes an economy's saving, investment, and growth paths from the short to the very long term (Schmidt-Hebbel 1999). Therefore, {{the impact of a}} <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> on capital accumulation, saving, output, labor participation, income distribution, and individual welfare have long been of critical concerns to both academic economists and policy-makers. Since the early 1990 s, China's national pension system, one of the largest pension systems in the world 1, has undergone quite a few major fundamental reforms and been shifting from a traditional Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) system to a Partially Funded (PF) multi-pillar system under an era featuring rapid economic growth and drastic demographic change. Given its complexity, scale, and importance, the practice of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> provides a good research case to study the macroeconomic and welfare effects of the type of <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> from PAYG to partial funding. This dissertation presented in three essays aims to investigate the macroeconomic and welfare effects of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform,</b> to review the progress and challenges facing China's pension systems, and to study some options for further parametric <b>pension</b> <b>reform.</b> It is worthy to note though our model targets China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform,</b> it is also suited to studying the type of <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> from PAYG to partial funding in other countries. Essay one is the first of kind to use Auerbach [...] Kotlikoff framework to assess the macroeconomic and welfare effects of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> when population aging and transition costs are considered. We first build a two-period Overlapping Generation (OLG) Simulation Model in a general equilibrium framework with homogeneous agent under the context of population aging and endogenous labor force participation of the elderly to simulate quantitatively the two economies under PAYG system and PF system respectively. Then we analyze and compare the two economies at steady state to observe the effects of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> on capital accumulation, saving, output, wage, interest rate, lifetime utility, and income distribution. Our analysis shows China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> from PAYG to partial funding has notable and positive effects on China's macro economy and intergenerational equality. Simulation results show impact of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> can be substantial. For example, under the cases of endogenous labor force participation of the elderly, the capital stock rises by 14 %, output by 5. 5 %, national saving rate by 17 %, real wage by 5. 5 %, lifetime income by 9. 9 %, and pension replacement ratio by 70 %. Moreover, the reform significantly improves intergenerational fairness by reducing upward intergenerational transfers by 24 %. Additionally, although the Reform brings up certain transition costs, the government can make appropriate policy measures such as imposing special consumption tax on consumer to deal with the challenge of financing the transition costs. Finally, the economy reaches its new steady state five periods after the Reform, yet the future generations gain at the cost of the transition generation's welfare loss, which may cause a challenge to the implementation of the <b>pension</b> <b>reform.</b> In order to make our model more suited to China's reality, the second essay extends the two-period OLG General Equilibrium Model with heterogeneous agents to study the effects of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> on macro economy and intergenerational and intragenerational income distribution. We assume two types of agents differ in their human capital endowments and in their access to the financial system. We first build the two-period OLG general equilibrium model and quantitatively simulate the economic effects of China's <b>pension</b> <b>reform</b> on macro economy, individual welfare, income distribution, and transition costs, then we discuss the sensitivity level of the simulated results to some important parameters, finally we analyze the specific transitional path of the Reform...|$|R
