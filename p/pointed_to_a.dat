5|$|In 1998, two {{separate}} teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the Amber Room. The German team <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure {{was buried in}} a lagoon; neither of the two suggestions turned out to hold the Amber Room.|$|E
5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate {{the effects of the}} blast. From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E

5|$|In April 2015, fans mistook {{random numbers}} that were placed by Cawthon into the source {{code of the}} game's {{official}} website to be coordinates that <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> location significant to the games. Fans entered these numbers into Google Maps and consequently discovered a pizzeria in Virginia. Mass phone calls {{were made to the}} pizzeria by fans, attempting to discover if the company had a connection to the upcoming installment, Five Nights at Freddy's 4. It was later confirmed by Cawthon that this pizzeria had no connection with the Five Nights at Freddy's series.|$|E
5|$|The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called {{attention}} to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state-run television, claiming {{that the man who}} self-immolated on the square was not the same person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV. It <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance the theory that the self-immolators were actors.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  4 a, it {{is found}} that the maximum {{eigenvector}} of the gravity gradient tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-density causative body if the body is embedded in the low-density medium. In this case, the minimum eigenvector of the tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the low-density medium around the high-density body. On the other hand, the minimum eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-density causative body if the body is embedded in the high-density medium. In this case, the maximum eigenvector of the tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the high-density medium around the low-density body. From these results, in the two-dimensional analyses, it was shown that the maximum eigenvector <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-density causative body and the minimum eigenvectors <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-density causative body.|$|R

5|$|The reactor was {{powered up}} successfully, {{but after a}} few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E
25|$|Furnivall {{could see}} {{little in the}} play that <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} dialect, other than a few instances that inclined him more to a Midlands dialect than anything else.

The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.|$|E
