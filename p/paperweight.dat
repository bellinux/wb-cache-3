50|$|In the US, Charles Kaziun {{started in}} 1940 to produce buttons, <b>paperweights,</b> inkwells and other bottles, using lamp-work of elegant simplicity. In Scotland, the {{pioneering}} work of Paul Ysart from the 1930s onward preceded {{a new generation}} of artists such as William Manson, Peter McDougall, Peter Holmes and John Deacons. A further impetus to reviving interest in <b>paperweights</b> was the publication of Evangiline Bergstrom's book, Old Glass <b>Paperweights,</b> the first of a new genre.|$|R

25|$|At last, Prospero and Roger are reunited at {{the actual}} site called Five Dials, a lone inn {{on the edge}} of the country. Here they discuss why Melichus is after Prospero: they once created a magical item together, a kind of crystal ball {{resembling}} a green glass <b>paperweight.</b> Since neither one can fully possess it without the other’s cooperation, Prospero will have some share in Melichus’ power until he is dead. They also determine that Melichus is using the mysterious book mentioned early in the story to create a permanent winter over the world. While staying the night at Five Dials they meet a small armed force that intends to attack a village across the border. Roger and Prospero thwart the army by destroying a necessary bridge and begin traveling to the village where the <b>paperweight</b> is kept, and where, they presume, Melichus is now. As they travel, unseasonably cold weather gradually sets in. Though the way to their destination is blocked, they find a monk herbalist who lets them in through a back entrance. Once in the village they do find Melichus studying the book. Prospero attempts to steal the <b>paperweight,</b> only to be transported to a different world. Melichus follows him there, but Prospero meets another wizard who takes the magical item and defeats Melichus. In the end, Prospero returns home to find that the early winter has subsided.|$|E

25|$|Paperweights {{are used}} to hold down paper. A <b>paperweight</b> is often placed {{at the top of}} all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed {{at the bottom of the}} page for support. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or {{pictorial}} designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{is forced}} to accept that he could never repay his father. In fact, Da adored him, and selflessly gave him his entire legacy: {{the money and the}} <b>paperweight.</b> Charlie berates his father's ghost, {{pledging}} to leave Ireland forever, outraged that Da never accepted any help, and saddened that Da refused to move to England. The ghost decides {{to make up for lost}} time, and come back to England with Charlie. As the play ends, Charlie leaves his house with the ghost following him. His Da will always remain a powerful presence in his life.|$|E

25|$|A {{newspaper}} reported that Kelly's body was dissected by medical students who removed {{his head and}} organs for study. Dissection outside of a coronial enquiry was illegal. Public outrage at the rumour raised real fears of public disorder, leading the commissioner of police to write to the gaol's governor, who denied that a dissection had taken place. (Saw cuts {{on a piece of}} his occipital bone recovered in 2011 confirm that a dissection had been done.) His head was allegedly given to phrenologists for study, then returned to the police, who used it for a time as a <b>paperweight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dodd showed {{through his}} {{evidence}} that Ukrainian Overlord Erich Koch and defendant Polish Overlord Hans Frank {{were responsible for}} the plan to deport one million Poles for slave labor. Dodd also showed evidence that defendant Walther Funk turned the Reichsbank into a depository for gold teeth and other valuables seized from the concentration camp victims. Dodd showed a motion picture of the vaults in Frankfurt where Allied troops found cases of these valuables, containing dentures, earrings, silverware and candelabra. Dodd showed many gruesome items of evidence, such as a shrunken, stuffed and preserved human head of one of the concentration camp victims that had been used as a <b>paperweight</b> by the commandant of Buchenwald Concentration Camp.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a <b>paperweight.</b>|$|E

25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a <b>paperweight</b> at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the strike there were some {{incidents}} of vandalism and store window smashing, and the police arrested about 300 people, most of them blacks. In a nastier episode, three white motorists drove a car through a black neighborhood and, without stopping or warning, shot at a 13-year-old black boy, who received non-critical injuries. The most visible episode of unrest came when a black war factory worker, whose brother was in the Army, threw a <b>paperweight</b> at the Liberty Bell shouting [...] "Liberty Bell, oh Liberty Bellliberty, that's a lot of bunk!" [...] He was arrested and sent by the magistrate for a psychiatric evaluation. However, by and large, calm prevailed and there were no major outbreaks of violence and no deaths or critical injuries among the public.|$|E
500|$|On April 7, 1972 McCoy staged {{the best-known}} of the {{so-called}} [...] "copycat" [...] hijackings (see above). He boarded United Airlines' Flight855 (a Boeing727 with aft stairs) in Denver, and brandishing what later {{proved to be a}} <b>paperweight</b> resembling a hand grenade and an unloaded handgun, he demanded four parachutes and $500,000. After delivery of the money and parachutes at San Francisco International Airport, McCoy ordered the aircraft back into the sky and bailed out over Provo, Utah, leaving behind his handwritten hijacking instructions and his fingerprints on a magazine he had been reading. He was arrested on April 9 with the ransom cash in his possession, and after trial and conviction, received a 45-year sentence. Two years later he escaped from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary with several accomplices by crashing a garbage truck through the main gate. Tracked down three months later in Virginia Beach, McCoy was killed in a shootout with FBI agents.|$|E

500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a <b>paperweight</b> in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E
