Since 2000, the university has awarded over 100,000 degrees. UCF is currently the largest university in the nation by terms of undergraduate enrollment, the largest university in Florida, and in 2003 held {{the distinction of being}} the fastest-growing university in the United States. During its Spring 2010 graduation ceremonies, The University of Central Florida awarded its 200,000th degree, less than five years after awarding its 150,000th diploma.|$|E
5|$|Several {{video games}} have either been adapted into or have had {{spin-offs}} {{in the form}} of manga and novels. The first was the novelization of Final FantasyII in 1989, and was followed by a manga adaptation of Final FantasyIII in 1992. The <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen {{an increase in the number}} of non-video game adaptations and spin-offs. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within has been adapted into a novel, the spin-off game Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles has been adapted into a manga, and Final FantasyXI has had a novel and manga set in its continuity. Seven novellas based on the Final FantasyVII universe have also been released. The Final Fantasy: Unlimited story was partially continued in novels and a manga after the anime series ended. The Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XIII series have also had novellas and audio dramas released.|$|E
5|$|The MIT {{library system}} {{consists}} of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print {{resources in the}} libraries. Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library {{with an emphasis on}} 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music, the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art, and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions. MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.|$|E

25|$|The {{flat-headed cat}} is {{primarily}} threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been rapid in tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments {{and is likely}} to be a significant threat.

25|$|Only the {{insecticides}} spinosyn and abamectin {{are known}} to be effective against this pest. Neem based products are considered effective synergists. Product rotation is integral to resistance prevention programs. Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils are both effective, but only in very frequent, sometimes impractical spray schedules (at least once a week). Systemic neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid were once considered to be sparing of beneficial insects and natural predators, and recommended for integrated pest management of chilli thrips, especially when used as a soil soak or drip irrigation product. The <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> revealed that neonicotinoids can seriously impact beneficial insects, especially bees, through effects that are not immediately apparent - even at trace concentrations.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, the National Commission on IIT {{considered}} {{leaving the}} Mies Main Campus {{and moving to}} the Chicago suburbs. Construction of a veritable wall of Chicago Housing Authority high-rises replaced virtually all of IIT's neighbors in the 1950s and 1960s, a well-meaning but flawed attempt to improve conditions in an economically declining portion of the city. The closest high-rise, Stateway Gardens, was located {{just south of the}} IIT campus boundary, the last building of which was demolished in 2006. But the Dearborn Homes to the immediate north of campus still remain. The <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen a redevelopment of Stateway Gardens into a new, mixed-income neighborhood dubbed Park Boulevard; the completion of the new central station of the Chicago Police Department a block east of the campus; and major commercial development at Roosevelt Road, just north of the campus, and residential development as close as Michigan Avenue on the east boundary of the school.|$|E

2500|$|Soap opera analyst C. Lee Harrington stated, [...] "While the <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> {{witnessed}} {{a growing number}} of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender characters in primetime dramas and situation comedies, daytime soap operas offer unique challenges (and possibilities) regarding the inclusion and 'normalization' of varied sexualities in entertainment television." [...] Daytime television has been ahead of primetime for some time in exploring diverse or controversial storylines and characters, with the one glaring exception being homosexuality. Gay and lesbian issues or characters were invisible in 1950s and early 1960s TV. When it came to the mainstream shows, audiences were built up as [...] "replications of the idealized, middleclass nuclear family, defined as monogamous heterosexual couples with children" [...] (Buxton, 1997, p.1477). Because of this perception of what was ideal, networks geared programming toward it, feeling that viewers were exactly like these images on their television screens.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Yom Kippur War Israeli defense {{spending}} rose dramatically, exposing {{the weaknesses of}} the state-run economy. The result was rampant inflation that led Israel to recall the lira in 1980 and issue the sheqel. This move did not sufficiently curb inflation and consequently the sheqel was recalled in 1985 in favor for the Israeli new sheqel, a move implemented together with a comprehensive economic stabilization program which stemmed inflation {{and set the stage}} for high growth in the 1990s. Israel had also undertaken a privatization effort beginning in the late 1970s. The economy received a boost in the early 1990s with the arrival of several hundred thousand immigrants form the former Soviet Union. As a significant number of the immigrants were highly educated, Israel accelerated its privatization in order to encourage the high-skilled workers to stay. The new high-skill labor also attracted a lot of foreign direct investment. Israel's growth over the <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been commensurate with western developed nations as is its GDP (PPP) per-capita which is about $35,000/year – the highest of all the non natural resources dependent countries in the Middle East. It also has the highest economic complexity index of all the countries in the Middle East. Israel is described as [...] "Very Highly Developed" [...] on the UN's Human Development Index, ranking 16th among 187 world nations and highest in the Middle East in 2012.|$|E
