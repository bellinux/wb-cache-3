These operational procedures are performed carefully {{in order to prevent}} air pocket formation, as such pockets may trigger damaging surges, as well impose blockages that reduce pipe conveyance. While previous research addressed the modeling of the <b>pipeline</b> <b>filling</b> events, the air phase within the conduits is in most cases either not included in the simulation, or its formulation is very simplified, not including air pressure gradients. This paper presents two modeling frameworks which couple a Two-Component Pressure Approach model to simulate water flow with models for the air phase flow within the conduits. The first is a discretized model for air phase based on the isothermal Euler equations and the second is based on the ideal gas law (as presented in [Zhou et al., 2002 a]).

30|$|Dynamics in the SC {{can arise}} from order oscillations, {{seasonality}} or minimum order quantities and {{may result in}} a bullwhip effect [50, 85]. Ensuring product availability at product launch can also create internal dynamics within an SC, especially if a significant proportion of demand is expected at or shortly after product launch and thus needs to be pre-produced and distributed thereby maintaining a short time to market [41]. This phenomenon is known as <b>pipeline</b> <b>filling,</b> which is defined as the production and distribution of a product prior to product launch in order to ensure sufficient product availability across all stocking points at the launch date, i. e., at a time when product demand is fostered by strong marketing campaigns [72]. During <b>pipeline</b> <b>filling</b> activities, all stocking points are filled with a major portion of the expected annual demand before the product is actually launched in the marketplace. In this early phase of the PLC, production capacity demand strongly differs from market demands of finished products. As a result, the capacity requirements or inventory levels during the more static maturity phase of the PLC can be up to 60  % lower than during the highly dynamic product launch phase (see Fig.  1).|$|R
30|$|Accurate branch {{prediction}} {{is of utmost}} importance to keep long <b>pipelines</b> <b>filled.</b> The penalty of a wrongly predicted conditional branch is typically {{almost as long as}} the pipeline length. Modern branch predictors guess the outcome primarily from results of earlier branches. They heavily rely on the execution history, an effect we want to avoid for a tight worst-case prediction. Global branch predictors and caches have a similar issue: as soon as a single index into the branch history is unknown, the whole information of {{branch prediction}} is lost for the analysis at that point.|$|R

30|$|Uncertainties in {{the demand}} signal are modeled by {{distinguishing}} between {{the level of}} expectation value, representing over- and under-estimation of market demand (contingency planning), and the variance, describing the random fluctuation in demand.

In the latter case, the demand forecasts are also allowed to be adjusted automatically by the system after an assumed “learning period” of three months.

50|$|One unusual {{feature of}} the i860 was that the {{pipelines}} into the functional units were program-accessible (VLIW), requiring the compilers to order instructions carefully in the object code to keep the <b>pipelines</b> <b>filled.</b> In traditional architectures these duties were handled at runtime by a scheduler on the CPU itself, but the complexity of these systems limited their application in early RISC designs. The i860 {{was an attempt to}} avoid this entirely by moving this duty off-chip into the compiler. This allowed the i860 to devote more room to functional units, improving performance. As a result of its architecture, the i860 could run certain graphics and floating point algorithms with exceptionally high speed, but its performance in general-purpose applications suffered and it was difficult to program efficiently (see below).|$|R

40|$|Branch Prediction is an {{important}} factor in achieving high performance in modern microprocessors. Branch predictors are used to keep <b>pipeline</b> <b>filled</b> with instructions before the outcome of the branch condition is known. On the other hand, branch misprediction halts fetching of useful instructions. The situation becomes worse when we take into account the cache pollution a branch misprediction causes. Branches that depend on a long-latency loads take much longer time to resolve. As a result, mispredicting such branch fills up the pipe with a lot of useless instructions. Finally, when the branch resolves the entire start-up latency comes in the critical path. Several recent studies have speculated that such branches are critical for performance. In this paper, we put this debate to rest by showing that these branches are very small in number and do not affect performance. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to other quantitative approaches that apply optimization techniques to SC configuration problems in NPI [17, 29], DES is employed {{in this case}} example. While optimization approaches are able to consider demand uncertainties [13, 86], their {{ability to cope with}} dynamics is limited. Similar to Higuchi and Troutt [40], the simulation model presented in the paper at hand considers dynamics and uncertainties simultaneously and addresses the problem arising from introducing products with short PLCs and high product availability requirements. In {{contrast to}} the paper at hand, Higuchi and Troutt [40] limit the assessment to a selective and isolated evaluation of SC performance criteria. In the case example assessed by Higuchi and Troutt [40], dynamics are caused externally by shadow demands which occur due to a significant under-estimation of a product’s market reception. <b>Pipeline</b> <b>filling</b> activities are intended to mitigate this effect, {{but on the other hand}} create internal dynamics in the SC as shown in this paper.|$|R

Furthermore, SC-related impacts of marketing decisions during NPI, e.g., regional launch postponements to react to global supply bottlenecks, can be evaluated. Beyond this, the application of normative models is encouraged, e.g., to assess trade-offs between cost reduction, service level optimization and NPV maximization in greater detail.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} aperture focusing technique {{is a method}} for focusing ultrasonic scans used in nondestructive testing. Traditionally, the technique has mainly been used for contact testing, where {{the speed of sound}} is constant throughout the whole medium, but a number of recently proposed algorithms have extended the technique to multilayered media. One important application for such multilayer methods is immersion testing, where an object is immersed in water and the transducer is scanned within the water layer. Similarly, a multilayer technique is useful for inline ultrasound inspection of <b>pipelines</b> <b>filled</b> with liquid, for example water or oil. The multilayer methods have so far only been applied to the 2 -dimensional line scan case, but in this paper we extend the the focusing procedure to the 3 -dimensional surface scan case. The proposed method is based on the frequency-domain Phase Shift Migration algorithm, which is both conceptually simpler and more computationally efficient than similar time-domain methods. The performance of the focusing algorithm is tested on a three-layer structure, consisting of acrylic glass and aluminum blocks immersed in water. Several small flat-bottom holes in each block are used to simulate point scatterers, and the scatterer responses are studied using both B- and C-scan presentation.

40|$|Abstract Background High quality {{annotation}} of {{the genes}} and transposable elements in complex genomes requires a human-curated integration of multiple sources of computational evidence. These evidences include results from a diversity of ab initio prediction {{programs as well as}} homology-based searches. Most of these programs operate on a single contiguous sequence at a time, and the results are generated in a diverse array of readable formats that must be translated to a standardized file format. These translated results must then be concatenated into a single source, and then presented in an integrated form for human curation. Results We have designed, implemented, and assessed a Perl-based workflow named DAWGPAWS for the generation of computational results for human curation {{of the genes}} and transposable elements in plant genomes. The use of DAWGPAWS was found to accelerate annotation of 80 – 200 kb wheat DNA inserts in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors by approximately twenty-fold and to also significantly improve the quality of the annotation in terms of completeness and accuracy. Conclusion The DAWGPAWS genome annotation <b>pipeline</b> <b>fills</b> an important need in the annotation of plant genomes by generating computational evidences in a high throughput manner, translating these results to a common file format, and facilitating the human curation of these computational results. We have verified the value of DAWGPAWS by using this pipeline to annotate the genes and transposable elements in 220 BAC insertions from the hexaploid wheat genome (Triticum aestivum L.). DAWGPAWS can be applied to annotation efforts in other plant genomes with minor modifications of program-specific configuration files, and the modular design of the workflow facilitates integration into existing pipelines. </p...|$|R
