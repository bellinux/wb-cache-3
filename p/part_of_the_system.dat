5|$|Ranch Road 1 is {{classified}} by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as a Ranch Road, {{and is the}} only highway in the state to be currently categorized as so. The route is not officially part of the state's Farm and Ranch to Market Road System, although it is considered similar to the Farm to Market Road system. RR 1 is signed with a shield similar to a Ranch to Market Road. The highway fits almost perfectly with the Recreational Road classification, but is not considered <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking at the {{possibility}} of converting all or <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted {{in the formation of the}} Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E
5|$|The FreeBSD Project {{is run by}} around 500 committers, or {{developers}} who have commit access to the master source code repositories and can develop, debug or enhance any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> Most of the developers are volunteers and few developers are paid by some companies. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team {{who are responsible for}} overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new commiters, or the granting of SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, for example, responsibility for managing the ports collection is delegated to the Ports Management Team.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to one <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> can accumulate and magnify to cause large {{effects on the}} system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{system uses}} eight {{lettered}} zones which are divided by major state highways. Each county {{road in the}} system is designated with the zone letter followed by a number. Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions is optional, and not all counties use the system. One additional highway, H-16, has appeared on state maps since the 1980s {{although it is not}} a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> Of the highways designated, two were removed from the system and later partially restored.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} added {{this road}} to the state highway system in 1933, and it became part of Legislative Route 11, which had stretched east from Sacramento along US 50. This part of Route 11 was not assigned a sign route number in 1934, but, by 1937, when the new Broadway Low Level Tunnel opened, {{it was part of}} Sign Route 24. That route had initially begun at Woodland and traveled northeast and east through the Feather River Canyon, and was extended southeast from Woodland along Sign Route 16 to Sacramento and then south and west via Antioch to the San Francisco– Oakland Bay Bridge approach in Berkeley. The California Freeway and Expressway System was formed in 1959, and included in the planned upgrades was the road between Antioch and Rio Vista. (North of Rio Vista the present SR 84 was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.)</b> The entire length was included in the State Scenic Highway System in 1963. In the 1964 renumbering, the Antioch-Sacramento roadway was split between two routes: Route 84 from Antioch to SR 12 near Rio Vista, and Route 160 from SR 12 to Sacramento. However, the entire route was marked as SR 160, and in 1981 the legislative definition was changed to reflect this.|$|E
