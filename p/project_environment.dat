This is one of the lessons learned from field research of 120 culturally diverse and globally dispersed project teams. The study explores the specific barriers, drivers, critical success factors, and the organizational conditions most conducive to high team performance in complex, multinational and technology-intensive <b>project</b> <b>environments.</b> The results provide insight into the dynamics and the specific project management skill sets needed to foster a culture of collaboration and commitment across intricate organizational boundaries connecting support functions, suppliers, customers and partners...|$|R

However, most {{available}} environments {{do not provide}} risk management process support to the project manager’s activities. This support could be provided through {{the analysis of the}} interactions between projects. One of the main weakness of the approaches up to now is to neglect the risk management process improvement based on the risks between on going projects and those ones that were ended. In this light, we propose the creation of a Risk Management Model for Multiple <b>Project</b> <b>Environments</b> to treat the risk interactions between projects. 1...|$|R

50|$|Reigeluth led a {{research}} team at Indiana University {{to investigate the}} technology requirements for the learner-centered paradigm of education. It identified four major functions for technology: 1) recordkeeping for student learning, {{to keep track of}} the individual competencies met by each student, 2) planning for student learning, to help each student set their career and short-term learning goals, select appropriate projects through which to meet those goals, select teammates for collaborating on those projects, and create a learning contract, 3) instruction for student learning, to provide an immersive <b>project</b> <b>environment</b> (simulation or virtual world) with just-in-time instructional support (similar to the tutorials and practice provided by the Khan Academy), and 4) assessment for and of student learning, fully integrated with the instructional support (similar to the Khan Academy), to ensure every student has mastered the competencies associated with each project. These functions should all be seamlessly integrated in a technology system, allowing the teacher to focus more on social, emotional, and character development. The research team also proposed that the system be much like a smartphone operating system that allows third parties to develop “apps” for any or all of the four functions as long as they meet requirements for interoperability. And the interface should be customizable by students, teachers, and parents.|$|E

Research on learning has shown that people learn better and retain knowledge longer when their brains are actively engaged, therefore the managers must focus their attention on those methods that engage the team members and make them realize their importance within the team. knowledge, knowledge transfer, participation, transfer methods. ...|$|R
