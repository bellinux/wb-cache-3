40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to create adaptive and smooth sequences of actions and how to decide among skill options in a continuous manner without the necessity of recurrent planning. Motion generation is based on serial and <b>parallel</b> <b>blending</b> of movement primitives (MP). MPs are modeled as dynamical systems on task coordinates with attractor behavior and augmented with additional signals to ease their coordination. Sequences and transitions between skills are realized in a unified way as bifurcating dynamical systems based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The neural output is used as activation signal for MPs. Besides continuous feedback from the controlled MPs, the neural dynamics is influenced by a cost term from a future prediction to allow the inhibition of an action flow that is expected to fail. First results are shown in a physical simulation environment on a high-DoF robotic hand-arm system. The system is capable of creating smooth transients of MPs. Robustness to disturbances can be observed as local adaptations of individual lowlevel MPs, flexible sequencing of MPs, and global error recovery by changing the whole strategy of how to perform a movement skill.

Skirting round the extreme S.E. termination, I ascended only a few points, which were composed of a fine-grained gneiss, almost composed of feldspar with a little mica, and passing in the upper parts of the hills into a rather compact purplish clay-slate. The cleavage was nearly vertical, striking in a N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. line, nearly, though not quite, coincident with the direction of the parallel ridges.|$|R

Recently, the definition has become more fluid, embracing videoconferencing, podcasting, YouTube videos, wikis, blogs, and other media (Picciano, 2009).|$|R

40|$|Online churches” are Internet-based Christian communities, {{pursuing}} worship, education, support, proselytisation {{and other}} religious goals through computer-mediated communication. This paper draws on three years of participant observation and 50 interviews to investigate reliance on the familiar in the aesthetics and sensory experience of online religion, a trend that previous researchers have noticed but not fully explained. I use two ethnographic studies to explore the range of motivations that can guide this common strategy and consider visual design, use of sound, avatar gestures, awareness of co-presence and the physical activity of the computer user. Key factors include the desire to “frame” participant expectations, “ground” online experience, demonstrate theological “authenticity” and encourage participatory leadership, and these achievements are used to validate experimentation in other areas. This strategy is not uncontested, however: “outsiders” are frequently deterred by styles that “insiders” consider “normal”, and both churches have begun to explore new forms of architecture, ritual and communication with no clear offline <b>parallels.</b> New <b>blends</b> of familiarity and innovation are emerging, indicating some of the future directions of online churchmanship. My two case studies, the Anglican Cathedral of Second Life and LifeChurch. tv Church Online, reflect two key trends among online churches: the proliferation of small-scale independent congregations and the increasing involvement of wealthy institutions. The empirical and theoretical dimensions of this paper are innovative and timely, drawing attention to the professionalization and domestication of online religion {{and the rise of}} the “online campus”, key developments that deserve considerable scholarly attention...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 138 - 148). This study investigated whether familiarity and proficiency factors {{play a role}} in EFL learners’ use of interactional resources (i. e., turn-taking, topic management, repair and task management) and the emergence of interactional patterns (i. e., collaborative, <b>parallel,</b> asymmetric and <b>blend)</b> in paired speaking tests. The study was carried out with 100 EFL learners paired as low-low, high-high and low-high and with 36 EFL learners matched as unfamiliar and familiar in the oral proficiency exam at a state university in Turkey. In order to place the participants for low-low, high-high and low-high groups, their scores in the proficiency exam which measured their reading, writing and listening skills as well as their vocabulary and grammar knowledge, and their scores in the oral proficiency exam were examined by the researcher. While 15 pairs were selected for the low-low and high-high groups separately, 20 pairs were selected for the low-high group. Then all 100 students (50 pairs) in the first cohort were asked whether their partners were their classmates or their friends in the exam and nine pairs out of 50 were detected as familiar. After that, nine unfamiliar pairs were selected in order to compare them with the familiar ones. In total, 50 videos were listened to and transcribed by using the conventions suggested by Jefferson (2004). Forthwith, all transcriptions were analyzed in order to identify the interactional resources such as turn-taking, repair, topic management and task management employed by the test-takers during the test discourse. Following this process, the researcher drew upon the interactional resources in order to assign the interactional patterns such as collaborative, asymmetric, <b>parallel</b> and <b>blend</b> which took place during test-takers’ interaction with each other. The results indicated that pairing two different proficiency level students is disadvantageous for the high level test-takers in terms of topic management, task management and repair. In contrast, while the low levels are advantageous in terms of topic and task management in particular, they are disadvantageous in terms of turn-taking. What is more, while high-high pairs create a collaborative pattern which is the most favorable one, low-low pairs usually create a parallel pattern. On the other hand, low-high pairs usually generate an asymmetric pattern due to the dominance of the high levels. Furthermore, the findings suggested that pairing two unfamiliar peer interlocutors seem more advantageous for the test-takers because unfamiliar pairs usually generate a collaborative pattern whereas familiar pairs usually create an asymmetric pattern during the test discourse. In light of these findings, this study provided insights into how test-takers should be matched in paired speaking tests for the test administrators. by Esma Lot. M. S...|$|R
40|$|English Department Honors Thesis. Scholars have {{understood}} Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, a quintessential female Bildungsroman or coming-of-age novel, as ultimately a conservative work, since the marriage {{at the end}} of the novel appears to subsume and domesticate the rebellious, feminist actions of the eponymous protagonist. As both a Bildungsroman and a fictional autobiography, the novel, published in 1847, tracks the psychological development and maturation of Jane that allows her to become a productive citizen and the author of her own story. From the beginning of the novel, Jane is aware that she must actively cultivate herself as a subject to establish her place in society. This awareness complicates the conservative understandings of the novel, because it compels Jane to develop her narrative abilities so that she can determine her own fate and suggests that Victorian women can do the same. Both as the narrator and the protagonist, Jane uses language to differentiate herself from the “other” and to redefine what constitutes success and failure in her life. More specifically, she uses the language of suicide and marriage to describe failed and successful processes of development for herself and other characters throughout the novel, demonstrating her awareness of these developmental processes. Jane’s self-conscious development as both a subject and a narrator <b>parallels</b> Brontë’s <b>blending</b> of the Bildungsroman and autobiography. By tracking Jane’s development as both a subject and a narrator and demonstrating Jane’s awareness of this process through the narration of her own story, Brontë provides a model for Victorian women to assert themselves by becoming the authors of their own lives.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to exploit the {{information}} provided by low-cost inertial sensors in order to bridge GNSS gaps and deliver a good estimate of {{the attitude of the}} vehicle in the INS/GNSS trajectory solution with little money investment. To achieve the main objective, the work is focused on two objectives: modelling the sensor errors both at laboratory level and on-board, and exploring inertial sensor redundancy. At laboratory level, a static test was carried to characterize both sensor long term drift behaviour and accuracy of an EPSON low-cost inertial unit (MEMS based). At on-board level, a Kalman Filter was implemented and tested with both real and simulated data. A new adaptive estimation technique is presented to deal with on-board noise model changes. This proposed adaptive method based on spectral analysis provides a more realistic uncertainty figure to the Kalman Filter yielding better results. The performance of the method is assessed comparing real and simulated trajectories against non-adaptive Kalman Filter. Also data gaps due to buffer overflow are addressed and an initial alignment and calibration setup procedure is proposed. The second part of the work focuses on exploring the effects of adding sensor redundancy on the solution hybridising multiple IMUs with a GNSS. First, the previous work done in this field is reviewed, presenting the trade-off between design topologies. A common problem in redundant systems is that when a sensor is biased, the feedback loop is unable to distinguish where it comes from. A new system architecture that tackles this problem is proposed in this work. This system takes advantage of the relative forces that arise when turning to de-couple sensor biases. To test the performance of the proposed architecture, sensor simulated data has been used to obtain a trajectory solution in a controlled environment. Yet another redundant architecture has been implemented which is based on several INS/GNSS Kalman filter pairs running in <b>parallel</b> and <b>blending</b> trajectory data. Both system performances are compared in reference to single IMU...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} products in an oil refinery and can account for as much as 60 - 70 % of total profit. Optimal integrated scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations can significantly increase profit by avoiding ship demurrage, improving customer satisfaction, minimizing quality give-aways, reducing costly transitions and slop generation, exploiting low-quality cuts, and reducing inventory costs. In this article, we first introduce a new unit-specific event-based continuous-time formulation for the integrated treatment of recipes, blending, and scheduling of gasoline blending and order delivery operations. Many operational features are included such as nonidentical <b>parallel</b> blenders, constant <b>blending</b> rate, minimum blend length and amount, blender transition times, multipurpose product tanks, changeovers, and piecewise constant profiles for blend component qualities and feed rates. To address the non-convexities arising from forcing constant blending rates during a run, we propose a hybrid global optimization approach incorporating a schedule adjustment procedure, iteratively via a mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming scheme, and a rigorous deterministic global optimization approach. The computational results demonstrate that our proposed formulation does improve the mixed-integer linear programming relaxation of Li and Karimi, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2011, 50, 9156 - 9174. All examples are solved to be 1 %-global optimality with modest computational effort. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineer...|$|R
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on March 9, 2015 Thesis advisor: James MobberleyVitaDissertation (D. M. A) [...] Conservatory of Music and Dance. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Quaerere Sententias (“search for meaning”) is a {{collection}} of pieces composed for soloists, digital audio, and video. The first set, Quaerere Sententias I, is comprised of three pieces: Introit, for trumpet; Hiram, for clarinet; and Musashi, for flute. Each piece in Quaerere Sententias is concerned with an historic example of an individual or culture’s pursuit of purpose and related ontological ideas. Through presenting these concepts literally and abstractly in the medium of electroacoustic music and video, the meaning of associated cultural symbols is also explored. Introit serves as a prologue to Quaerere Sententias I. Musical material is drawn from the melody of L’homme armé, just as composers of Renaissance masses employed the same to derive their material. The music evokes a sacred soundscape, as the video presents a sketched space based on Saint Gatien’s Cathedral in Tours. Tours served as the home to Burgundian composer Antoine Busnois, whose Missa L’homme armé was highly inspirational in the creation of Introit. Hiram takes its title from Hiram Bingham III, whose writings and photographs are featured in the video. Bingham’s search for Machu Picchu is the narrative focus behind the piece, as is the sense of purpose derived from the uncovering of an ancient civilization. Simultaneously, Hiram is concerned with the mysteries of Incan ontology, lost to time even as Quechua people populate the Andes today. The musical material of Hiram is influenced by Andean traditions such as the huanyo. Samples of Peruvian instruments, including zampoña, qena, and cajón, are featured in the fixed part. Musashi is inspired by Go Rin No Sho, a treatise on strategy by the legendary ronin swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. The musical material is inspired by Honshirabe, a staple of shakuhachi repertoire. Throughout the piece, the fixed part is derived from samples of taiko and shakuhachi, the metallic clash and scrape of swords, and a reading of the Fudō-myōō sutra, creating a soundscape to <b>parallel</b> Musashi’s <b>blend</b> of Zen spirituality with merciless violence. Elements of taiko performance are also influential— particularly oroshi, a gesture in which the interval between events is reduced over time.

40|$|Abstract — Robotics {{applications}} {{often requires}} vision systems capable of capturing {{a large amount}} of information related to a scene. With many camera sensors, the perception of information is limited in areas with strong contrasts. The High Dynamic Range (HDR) vision system can deal with these limitations. This paper describes the HDR-ARtiSt hardware platform (High Dynamic Range Advanced Real-time imaging System), a FPGAbased architecture that can produce a real- time high dynamic range video from successive image acquisition. The proposed approach uses three captures with different exposure times, in a pure-hardware computationally efficient manner suitable for real-time processing. This method has the advantage to make outputs more visible than a simple single exposure. A real-time hardware implementation of High Dynamic Range video that shows more details in dark areas and bright areas of a scene is an important line of research. Our approach consists of three steps. First we capture three images from the sensor with alternating the three exposure times, and we store them into memory. Then we manage reading and writing operations in memory to have three video streams in parallel, corresponding to the three exposure times. Finally, under a highly <b>parallel</b> context, we <b>blend</b> the three video streams together with {{a modified version of the}} High Dynamic range technique. Our system can achieve an output at 60 fps with a full sensor resolution of 1, 280 × 1, 024 pixels. We demonstrate the efficiency of our technique through a series of experiments and comparisons.

40|$|Thesis (MTh (Old and New Testament)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. This study {{examines}} the exodus event {{and its impact}} on identity formation {{in the light of the}} origin and migration narratives of the Yoruba people. On the one hand, it is observed that migration is not only an ancient but a universal phenomenon. Its rootedness in Africa and its profound influence on identity formation are therefore brought to the fore by comparing the origin and migration narratives of the Yoruba with those of the Tiv and the amaZulu. The findings show that certain elements of the origin and migration narratives such as a common ancestor, a common ancestral home, a common belief in Supreme Deity etc., provide a basis for identity formation and recognition among these Africans, in particular, the Yoruba. On the other hand, the study focuses on the Sea event in Exodus 14 - 15 : 18 which is composed of both a narrative and a poetic rendition of the sea-crossing by the children of Israel. In the Sea event, Israel acknowledged in story and song that it was Yahweh who as a warrior, delivered its people from the hand of Pharaoh and took them safely to the other side of the Sea. This research shows that a literary consideration of the text and especially of the interplay between prose and poetry points to Yahweh as the main character in the Sea event. Consequently, Israel’s identity is defined in Yahweh whose own identity as warrior and deliverer brought Israel victory over the Egyptians and paved the way for a new nation in a new land. In this sense, Israel’s identity is assumed to be a theological one. It is argued that the Yoruba origin and migration narratives help to bring to light the memories of exodus and Israel’s recollection of Yahweh as the root of its identity. The narratives help to appreciate more clearly Yahweh’s role in the midst of his people and the his centrality to Israel’s self-understanding even as they show that these can provide valuable resources in today’s world where migration and the struggle for identity are features that are not likely to fade away. Besides, the juxtaposition of cosmogonic myths and migration theories in attesting to the elements of Yoruba identity formation, have a <b>parallel</b> in the <b>blending</b> of both cosmic and migration elements in Exodus 14 - 15 : 18. This blending also foregrounds the role of Yahweh in the Sea event. In addition, the study suggests that the interaction between prose and poetry in the Sea event is an instance of a separate genre which further research may confirm in Yoruba, especially in folk-tales and in oríkì-oríle (praise names/epithet) ...|$|R
