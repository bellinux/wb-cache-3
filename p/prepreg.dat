40|$|The use of polyamic acid (PAA) {{precursor}} as interphase in polymer composites {{is one of}} {{the many}} applications of polyimides (PIs). In this work, composites based on poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) and carbon fibers were prepared using two manufacturing techniques for thermoplastic composites: hot compression molding, and aqueous polymeric suspension <b>prepregging</b> using PIs as interphase. Two PAAs were synthesized and used as interphases: 3, 3 '- 4, 4 '-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride/oxydianiline (BTDA/ODA) and pyromellitic dianhydride/oxydianiline (PMDA/ODA). The PAA/PI systems were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Results from these analyses confirmed the synthesis of these compounds. Aqueous polymeric suspension <b>prepregging</b> was more efficient than hot compression molding when the PMDA/ODA PAA/PI interphase was used; also, the interlaminar shear strength of composites produced using this technique was 14. 5 % higher than the one produced using hot compression molding...|$|R
50|$|SQRTM is an RTM process {{adapted to}} <b>prepreg</b> technology. The <b>prepreg</b> {{is placed in}} a closed mold and during the cure cycle, {{a small amount of}} resin is {{injected}} into the cavity through ports positioned around the part. This resin does not go into the laminate, but only presses up against the edge of the laminate in order to establish hydrostatic pressure on the <b>prepreg,</b> similar to the goal of autoclave curing. This pressure is similar to the autoclave, on the order of 6-7 bars (90-100 psi). Hydrostatic pressure minimizes voids by keeping dissolved air, water and resin monomers in solution in the resin.The tool can either be self-clamped and self-heated or heated and clamped by a press. The equipment is composed of a tool, a press, an injector, and a vacuum pump.|$|E

All of the polymers retained small amounts of solvent as indicated {{by an increase in}} T(sub g) as the polymers were dried. The flow properties showed that all three polymers had very high apparent viscosities and would require high pressures and/or high temperatures and/or long times to obtain adequate flow in <b>prepregging</b> and molding. Although none was intended for such application, two of the polymers were combined with carbon fibers by solution <b>prepregging.</b> The prepregs were molded into laminates at temperatures and times, the selection of which was guided by the results from the flow measurements. These laminates had room temperature short beam shear strength similar to that of carbon fiber laminates with a thermosetting polyimide matrix.

50|$|Stitching {{is arguably}} the {{simplest}} of the four main textile manufacturing techniques and {{one that can be}} performed with the smallest investment in specialized machinery. Basically stitching consists of inserting a needle, carrying the stitch thread, through a stack of fabric layers to form a 3D structure. The advantages of stitching are {{that it is possible to}} stitch both dry and <b>prepreg</b> fabric, although the tackiness of the <b>prepreg</b> makes the process difficult and generally creates more damage within the <b>prepreg</b> material than in the dry fabric. Stitching also utilizes the standard two-dimensional fabrics that are commonly in use within the composite industry therefore there is a sense of familiarity concerning the material systems. The use of standard fabric also allows a greater degree of flexibility in the fabric lay-up of the component than is possible with the other textile processes, which have restrictions on the fibre orientations that can be produced.|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} powder <b>prepregging</b> {{method for}} use with LaRC-TPI (a thermoplastic polyimide) /graphite composites is investigated. The alternative method incorporates the idea of moistening the fiber prior to powder coating. Details of the processing parameters are given and discussed. The material was subsequently laminated into small coupons which were evaluated for processing defects using electron microscopy. After the initial evaluation of the material, no major processing defects were encountered but {{there appeared to be}} an interfacial adhesion problem. As a result, <b>prepregging</b> efforts were extended to include an additional fiber system, XAS, and a semicrystalline form of the matrix. The semicrystalline form of the matrix {{was the result of a}} complex heat treating cycle. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the fiber/matrix adhesion was evaluated in these systems relative to the amorphous/XAS coupons. Based on these results, amorphous and semicrystalline/AS- 4 and XAS materials were prepregged and laminated for transverse tensile testing. The results of these tests are presented, and in an effort to obtain more information on the effect of the matrix, remaining semicrystalline transverse tensile coupons were transformed back to the amorphous state and tested. The mechanical properties of the transformed coupons returned to the values observed for the original amorphous coupons, and the interfacial adhesion, as observed by SEM, was better than in any previous sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{process for}} dry powder {{impregnation}} of carbon fiber tows being developed at LaRC overcomes {{many of the}} difficulties associated with melt, solution, and slurry <b>prepregging.</b> In the process, fluidized powder is deposited on spread tow bundles and fused to the fibers by radiant heating. Impregnated tows have been produced for preform, weaving, and composite materials applications. Design and operating data correlations were developed for scale up of the process to commercial operation.

40|$|High quality films, {{preimpregnated}} tape (prepegs), and composites {{have been}} fabricated from polyimide precursor 'saltlike' solutions.

50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber filament yarns {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for <b>prepregging,</b> filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per yarn count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon filament yarn, but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are twill, satin and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.|$|R
40|$|A high {{molecular}} weight, carboxyl functionalised solid rubber {{was added to}} an epoxy resin-aromatic amino system developed for autoclave curing of honeycomb core composite structures. The achievement of an optimal balance of viscous flow and viscoelasticity of the resin, by controlling {{the nature and extent}} of cross-linking of the functionalised rubber, was proposed as a route to void-free honeycomb skins.

The concentration of carboxyl groups was changed by reacting them with a monofunctional epoxy resin. Dynamic shear viscosity profiles varying frequency, temperature and as function of time during isothermal cure have been determined for blends with differently functionalised rubbers.

40|$|An {{alternative}} powder <b>prepregging</b> {{technique is}} discussed {{that is based}} on the deposition of powder onto carbon fibers that have been moistened using an ultrasonic humidifier. The dry fiber tow is initially spread to allow a greater amount of the fiber surface to be exposed to the powder, thus ensuring a significant amount of intimate contact between the fiber and the matrix. Moisture in the form of ultrafine water droplets is then deposited onto the spread fiber tow. The moisture promotes adhesion to the fiber until the powder can be tacked to the fibers by melting. Powdered resin is then sieved onto the fibers and then tacked onto the fibers by quick heating in a convective oven. This study focuses on the production of prepregs and laminates made with LaRC-TPI (thermoplastic polyimide) using this process. Although the process appears to be successful, early evaluation was hampered by poor interfacial adhesion. The adhesion problem, however, seems {{to be the result of}} a material system incompatibility, rather than being influenced by the process...|$|R

The molecular weight of the polyimides was shown to be dependant upon {{the selection of the}} base used for making the polyamic acid salt. The development of an Ultem-type polyimide with controlled molecular weight and properties similar to commercial Ultem 1000 was accomplished with the Ultem-type TPA+ polyamic acid salt. Both the Ultem-type polyimides and the BisP-BTDA polyimides derived from the NH salt and the TMA salt were shown to crosslink at elevated temperatures. 4 + + Blends of Ultem-type polyimide with PEEK and BisP-BTDA polyimide with PEEK were prepared to study the structure-property relationships of model composite matrices. Since both polyimides are miscible with PEEK, interdiffusion of the polyimides with PEEK is expected, however, the interdiffusion behavior is complicated by the crosslinking mechanism of the polyimides.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{in their}} various forms have {{great potential for}} use in the development of multifunctional multiscale laminated composites due to their unique geometry and properties. Recent advancements in the development of CNT hierarchical composites have mostly focused on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). In this work, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were used to develop nano-modified carbonfiber/epoxylaminates. A functionalization technique based on reduced SWCNT was employed to improve dispersion and epoxy resin-nanotube interaction. A commercial <b>prepregging</b> unit was then used to impregnate unidirectional carbonfiber tape with a modified epoxy system containing 0. 1 wt% functionalized SWCNT. Impact and compression-after-impact (CAI) tests, Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness tests were performed on laminates with and without SWCNT. It was found that incorporation of 0. 1 wt% of SWCNT resulted in a 5 % reduction of the area of impact damage, a 3. 5 % increase in CAI strength, a 13 % increase in Mode I fracture toughness, and 28 % increase in Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness. A comparison between the results of this work and literature results on MWCNT-modified laminated composites suggests that SWCNT, at similar loadings, are more effective in enhancing the mechanicalperformance of traditional laminated composites.

40|$|The bearing {{behavior}} of bolted composite joints is significantly poorer {{than that of}} their metallic counterparts. The objective {{of the present study}} was to examine ways of improving the bearing performance of bolted joints in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy laminates. Two strategies were examined, namely stiffening of the matrix using nanofillers and through- thickness reinforcement of the laminates using z- pins. The development of a nanoparticle reinforced matrix resin, and its performance in a composite loaded in bearing, was the focus of the first part of the study. A commercial nanoclay, I 30 E from Nanocor, was chosen as the reinforcement since the nanoclay particles are modified with long alkyl chain amines which improves dispersion in the epoxy resin. The c onditions for preparing nanocomposites based on the nanoclay were examined for two epoxy resin systems, DGEBA and TGDDM. Significant improvements in the elastic modulus were obtained, with a 20 % increase being recorded w ith 8. 4 phr nanoclay content in the DGEBA resin and a 50 % increase with 20 phr nanoclay content in the TGDDM system. Carbon fibre reinforced laminates w ere prepared from nanoclay reinforced TGGDM matrix resin, using a vacuum assisted <b>prepregging</b> process. The bearing strength and stiffness of the laminated composites was improved by 7 % and 15 % respectively but the strain to failure was reduced.
