5|$|With {{his budget}} {{concerns}} alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, {{he and the}} Experience met sound engineer Eddie Kramer. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method {{that they had been}} using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then <b>pre-mixed</b> and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's perfectionism and Chandler's desire {{to reduce the number of}} takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} risk of {{vascular}} disease, HbA 1 c and weight change, between first prescribed insulins in people with type 2 diabetes. Methods: People included in THIN United Kingdom primary care record database who began insulin (2000 – 2007) after poor control on oral glucose-lowering agents (OGLD) were grouped {{by the number of}} OGLDs in their treatment regimen immediately before starting insulin (n = 3, 485).

Results: Mean follow-up was 3. 6 years. Rates of incident macrovascular events were similar when basal insulin was compared to <b>pre-mix</b> or NPH, adjusted hazard ratio versus basal: <b>pre-mix</b> 1. 08 (95 % CI 0. 73, 1. 59); NPH 1. 00 (0. 63, 1. 58) after two OGLDs, and <b>pre-mix</b> 0. 97 (0. 46, 2. 02); NPH 0. 77 (0. 32, 1. 86) after three OGLDs.

25|$|A 2004 MIT {{study and}} an earlier paper {{published}} by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress ‘knock’ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into <b>pre-mixed</b> gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.|$|E
