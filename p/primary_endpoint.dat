25|$|Participants in {{the trial}} were {{recruited}} when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects {{in order to maximize}} the generalizability of the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled {{in the trial}}. Generally accepted cutoffs are 7–17 points for mild depression, 18–24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression. The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22. The pre-specified <b>primary</b> <b>endpoint</b> of this trial was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders. In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.|$|E

25|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the <b>primary</b> <b>endpoint</b> for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|E

40|$|In a {{clinical}} trial with an active treatment and a placebo the situation may occur that two (or even more) <b>primary</b> <b>endpoints</b> {{may be necessary to}} describe the active treatment’s benefit. We were interested in a more specific situation in so far as superiority in one of the <b>primary</b> <b>endpoints</b> would suffice given that non-inferiority is observed in the remaining. Several proposals exist in the literature for dealing with this or similar problems, but prove insufficient or inadequate at a closer look (e. g. [1], [2], [8], [9]). We propose a hierarchical three step procedure, where non-inferiority in both variables is the aim in the first step, overall tests for superiority ([4], [6], [3],[5]) or a bootstrap procedure based on ideas presented [5] build the second step, and (for the case of two <b>primary</b> <b>endpoints)</b> two separate superiority tests are performed in the third step. All statistical tests are conducted at the same one-sided significance level alpha. From the above mentioned overall superiority tests we preferred the SS test from [5] or adjustments according to [4] for the reason that these have been proven to strictly control the type I error. A simulation study reveals that the performance regarding power of the overall test depends to a considerable degree on the correlation and on the magnitude of the expected effects of the two <b>primary</b> <b>endpoints.</b> Therefore, the recommendation which test to choose depends on knowledge of the possible correlation between the two <b>primary</b> <b>endpoints.</b> In general, procedures based on [5] in step 2 shows the best overall properties, whereas the procedure based on [4] shows an advantage if both, a positive correlation between the two variables and a considerable difference between their standardized effect sizes can be expected...|$|R
