40|$|Title: The {{comparison}} of stereognosis and <b>pallesthesia</b> of the preferred and non-preferred upper extremity in students of physiotherapy Objectives: To {{the objectives of}} the work belong the processing and compilation of information concerning laterality and sensation in the region of the upper extremities, then to evaluate the preference of the upper extremity by means of elected tests in 30 students of physiotherapy and to evaluate, whether the sensitivity of stereognosis and <b>pallesthesia</b> is higher in the region of the non- preferred upper extremity than in the region of the preferred upper extremity or whether the sensitivity of stereognosis and <b>pallesthesia</b> both of the upper extremities do not differ. Methods: The tasks of the work were dealt with four tests directed to the examination of preference, stereognosis and <b>pallesthesia</b> in the region of upper extremities. The statistic analysis {{of the results of the}} examination was carried out by means of paired t-test. Results: In the examination of <b>pallesthesia</b> in the region of processus styloideus radii and in the examination of stereognosis the null-hypothesis, that the sensitivity of <b>pallesthesia</b> / stereognosis examined by selected test in the region of preferred and non-preferred upper extremity in students of physiotherapy does not differ, was at [...] ...|$|E

Six months after posterior fossa decompression there was the disappearance of nuchal rigidity, vertigo, spastic paraparesis and improvement of balance.

40|$|Spondylotic {{cervical}} myelopathy (SCM) is a radiologic {{entity that}} can match a clinical syndrome of varying degree of severity, and results from spinal canal narrowing due to physiological degeneration of the cervical spine. Clinically, cervical spinal canal narrowing can produce minimal {{symptoms such as}} non-specific neck pain, foraminal entrapment of nerve roots, or more severe, chronic myelopathy. SCM initially manifests by signs of posterior medullary tract dysfunction with subsequent <b>pallesthesia,</b> resulting in gait and balance disturbance. Spasticity due to lower motoneurone impairment and incontinence may appear in later stages. Once the symptoms of myelopathy occur, functional deterioration will take place sooner or later. Surgery can then be recommended and scheduled according to the severity of functional impairment and imaging...|$|E
40|$|The author {{studies the}} {{significance}} of the accurate test of vibration sense for the diagnosis of some diseases of the nervous system. This work is divided into three main parts. First part - After reviewing the medical literature on the nature, pathways and physiopathology of the vibration sense, the author states the following conclusions : 1. <b>Pallesthesia</b> is an inespecific type of sensation. 2. The receptors for vibratory stimuli include both the superficial structures designed to record the cutaneous deformation, and the end-organs located in the muscles, ligaments, joints and periosteum. 3. On the light of more recent experimental work, carried on by neuro-physiologists and clinical neurologists, it becomes evident that the muscle spindles are the end-organs mostly concerned in the reception of vibratory stimuli. 4. These facts lead to the conclusion that vibration sense impulses run in the spinal cord by tactile and proprioceptive pathways. There are reasons to believe that lesions of the dorsal funiculi are more apt to interfere with the conduction of vibratory stimuli. 5. The dissociation between <b>pallesthesia</b> (lost or impaired) and joint sense (impaired or normal), frequently met with in several nervous diseases, must be ascribed to the fact that injury of nerve fibers lengthens the refractory period; the vibratory stimuli, which normally are transmitted almost in the limit of nerve fiber ability, are thus summed up and does not evoke the vibratory sensation any more. 6. The prevalence of kinesthesic over pallesthesic disturbances, which is said to occur in lesions of parietal lobes, {{can be explained by the}} discriminative character of the former type of sensation, as well as by a wider bilateral cortical representation of the vibration sense pathways. Second part - The analysis of variance of the vibratory perception thresholds measured with the "Bio-thesiometer" in 55 normal subjects lead the author to the following conclusions: 1. The vibration perception thresholds show wide variations according to the bodily area which is tested. 2. The variations of the vibration perception thresholds among subjects, although great, are lesser than the changes among bodily areas. 3. Among the bodily areas studied, the fingers and toes were the most sensitive to vibratory stimuli. 4. The vibration perception thresholds in the head are very high and are prone to great individual variations. 5. The least individual variations were shown by the bodily areas more sensitive to vibratory stimuli. 6. All these facts point to the selection of the fingers and toes as the bodily areas more suitable for the quantitative test of <b>pallesthesia,</b> with diagnostic purposes or to estimate the course of nervous diseases. 7. The variations of the vibration perception thresholds during regular time intervals (3 days) have not been significant in relation to the variations among bodily areas and subjects. 8. The average vibration perception thresholds of the left side of the body were lesser than those of the right side, although only in the great toes the difference was statistically significant. 9. It has been statistically proved that the method used in this work is a trustful procedure for the quantitative study of vibration sense. Third part - The study of 126 cases of nervous diseases due to lesions of various topographies, using the same quantitative method, allowed the following conclusions: 1. Vibration sense can be the only form of sensation impaired in several kinds of nervous diseases. 2. The quantitative test of <b>pallesthesia</b> has great semiotic significance since the increase of the vibration perception thresholds can be the only sign of damage of the sensory pathways. 3. Dissociation between <b>pallesthesia</b> and kinesthesia can be observed in several nervous diseases and as well in peripheral as in central lesions. 4. In cases of diabetic neuropathy the impairment of vibration sense is frequent and sometimes very conspicuous; it bears a close relation to the severeness of the whole neurologic picture. 5. In cases of herniated nucleus pulposus the test of vibration sense can cooperate in the diagnosis of the side of the protrusion. However, it must be emphasized that the changes in <b>pallesthesia</b> have not, in such cases, the semiotic significance which some authors have assigned to them. 6. In the subacute combined degenerations of the spinal cord, with constitutional or acquired achlorhydria, the test of vibration sense is imperative, owing to the early and marked impairment of this form of sensation. The quantitative method can disclose, in several cases, the existence of pallesthesic changes not shown by routine procedures, particularly those involving the upper limbs. 7. In poliradiculoneuritis the vibration sense is deeply impaired, even in the upper limbs, where other forms of sensation can be normal by routine examination. 8. In trigeminal nerve lesions the quantitative test of vibration sense is of little semiotic significance, owing to the great variability of the thresholds in the head and to the frequent confusion between vibration and auditory senses. In the four cases tested the increase of the thresholds was slight, even in two cases with associated facial palsy. 9. In cases of parietal lobe injuries, including two cases of hemisphe-rectomy, the impairment of vibration sense is remarkable and coincident or not with changes in the joint sense. 10. In other diseases of the nervous system, the quantitative test of vibration sense has proved worthful for the diagnosis, either as a positive or sometimes as a negative finding...|$|E
