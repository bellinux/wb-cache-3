50|$|They {{can assume}} three {{different}} system configurations - shuttle, loop, and <b>pinched</b> <b>loop.</b> The shuttle {{system is the}} least complex. One train operates on each lane of a dual lane guideway. After the train dwells {{in one of the}} end stations for passengers for entry and exit, it reverses direction and returns to the opposite end station. Because Innovia APM vehicles are fully automated, they do not require a driver’s cab, which allows them to be bidirectional. A loop is an enclosed system that connects multiple stations along a track or guideway that is a continuous circle or closed curve. Loop systems can be designed as either a single lane or a dual lane configuration. A pinched-loop system shares common characteristics with both the shuttle and the loop systems. Pinched loops look like a dual-land shuttle (with two parallel guideways), but trains can go from one track to the other changing direction via switches at each end. As a result, traffic on a <b>pinched</b> <b>loop</b> flows in opposite directions on two parallel tracks, but can accommodate many stations.|$|E
50|$|Trains can {{run in a}} <b>pinched</b> <b>loop</b> configuration, with trains {{reversing}} direction at {{each end}} onto the opposite track. Alternately a shuttle service can be operated, with a single train shuttling backwards and forwards on one track, or a double-shuttle service with one train on each track. In order to allow this flexibility, the traction cables are arranged into five loops: one {{in each of the}} main tunnels driven by 465 kW motors, one in each of the reversing lines driven by 266 kW motors, and one in the maintenance siding driven by a 55 kW motor. The trains can engage with, and switch between cables using hydraulic horizontally movable clamps.|$|E
50|$|This system {{creates a}} {{circular}} train flow {{where more than}} one train moves in the same direction. The principle of this system is based on several rope loops which adjoin and overlap {{each other in the}} stations. Every haul rope loop is supplied with its own drive and return machinery. In every station each vehicle of the train has to be disconnected from the current haul rope to the next haul rope in order to continue the circular and synchronized train flow. The haul rope loop change may occur only when all the trains are positioned at the standard stop position in the stations and are standstill and will be carried out during boarding/de-boarding of the passengers. Switches installed at the end stations will guide the train from one lane of the double lane track over to a single guideway in the end stations. During the station stop the switch will be repositioned that the train can leave the station at the other lane of the double lane track. For the functionality of the <b>Pinched</b> <b>Loop</b> concept the stations spans have to be approximately equidistant from each other.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{addition}} to the single polarization-versus-electric field hysteresis loop that is characteristic of ferroelectrics and the double hysteresis loop that is known to occur in antiferroelectrics, a third kind of polarization-versus-electric field function {{has been reported in}} several systems. This third kind is commonly termed the " <b>pinched</b> " <b>loop</b> due to its unusual shape, and is typically believed to originate from the pinning of domain walls interacting with defects. Here, using an atomistic effective Hamiltonian scheme, we demonstrate that such a belief has to be broadened since our simulations also yield <b>pinched</b> <b>loops</b> in defect-free ferroelectric materials, {{as a result of the}} occurrence of intermediate modulated phases exhibiting an inhomogeneous dipolar pattern leading to the coexistence of both ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders...|$|R
40|$|A {{material}} which {{possesses a}} temperature dependent polarisation {{is known as}} pyroelectric. The effect is observed only in materials whose polar molecules are arranged in a non-centrosymmetric fashion. Whenever a pyroelectric material is subjected to a changing temperature, it will generate a pyroelectric current. This thesis reports the manifestation of the pyroelectric effect in Langmuir-Blodgett films containing calixarene molecules. The synthetic chemist {{has the ability to}} add functional -carboxyl or -amino groups around the lower rim of the calixarene molecule, so rendering it polar. Use of the alternate layer deposition technique to build up multilayer assemblies of alternating -carboxyl substituted calixarene with amino substituted calixarene has produced pyroelectric LB films of calixarenes with some of the highest pyroelectric coefficients ever recorded for LB devices: 15 #mu#Cm"-" 2 K"-" 1. This study has identified an optimum thickness effect within pyroelectric calixarene LB films. The thermal stability of the pyroelectric device has been dramatically improved by the addition of heavy metal ions to the LB matrix. The temporal stability of the device was also found to be constant over more than 72 hours continuous testing. X-ray reflectometry measurements on both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric cadmium substituted LB films of calixarenes have provided direct evidence of their multilayer structure. The reflectivity profiles exhibited both interference fringes and one or more Bragg peaks. Simulations of the experimental results have been made for a series of structural models based on the recognised conformations of calixarenes, and it was shown that the <b>pinched</b> <b>loop</b> conformation allows an LB film to be built up which has the correct total thickness and bilayer spacing. The simulated reflectivity profile is in excellent agreement with that obtained in the experiments. The model proposed works well for both the centrosymmetric structures and the pyroelectric LB films. X-ray reflectometry experiments have also been used to investigate the effect on film structure of the formation of cadmium sulphide nanoparticles within the LB film. The results showed that the calixarene LB matrix hinders the lateral diffusion of cadmium and sulphur atoms and therefore results in some of the smallest nanoparticles ever formed with diameters of 15 #+-# 0. 3 A. The formation of the particles had no observable effect on the calixarene film structure in contrast to the almost complete destruction of the multilayer structure observed in films of stearic acid.

40|$|Oxygen octahedra tilting is {{a common}} {{structural}} phenomenon in perovskites and has been subject of intensive studies, particularly in rhombohedral Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 (PZT). Early reports suggest that the tilted octahedra may strongly affect the domain switching behavior, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of PZT ceramics. In a way similar to that proposed for tilts, however, charged defects, associated with oxygen vacancies, may also inhibit {{the motion of the}} domain walls, resulting macroscopically in <b>pinched</b> hysteresis <b>loops</b> and reduced piezoelectric response. Here, we revisit the early studies on rhombohedral PZT ceramics with tilted octahedra by considering a possible role of both tilts and charged defects on domain-wall motion. We show that the observed <b>pinched</b> hysteresis <b>loops</b> are likely associated with the presence of defect complexes containing charged oxygen vacancies, and not tilts as suggested in some cases. Regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} long-range ordered tilts in rhombohedral PZT, the effect of charged defects is also prominent in weak-field permittivity and piezoelectric properties, particularly at sub-Hz driving conditions where the conductivity, related to the motion of oxygen vacancies, gives rise to strong frequency dispersion.

40|$|A design {{methodology}} for earthquake resistant plywood sheathed shear walls is presented. The sheathing nailing is {{selected as the}} ductile load limiting element, whereby the large displacement demands imposed during an earthquake can be sustained without failure of the timber members in bending, shear or tension. Analytical models for predicting the elastic behaviour and ultimate strength of shear walls are formulated {{in order to develop}} the design procedure. An experimental study of nailed sheathed joints was undertaken, and showed that such joints were able to sustain large reverse cycles well into the inelastic range. Complementary to the experimental study, an analytical strength model for nailed joints is described, and identifies nail diameter, nail length and nail coating as being the variables most influential on joint strength. Eleven full scale plywood sheathed shear walls were subjected to reverse cyclic quasi-static loading and shaketable excitation. The performance of the sheathing nailing, framing connections and anchorage connections is reported in detail. The test walls exhibited progressive stiffness degradation resulting in <b>pinched</b> hysteresis <b>loops,</b> prior to failure through the nail heads pulling through the plywood, or the nail point withdrawing from the framing. A theoretical time-history single degree of freedom idealisation is described to predict the dynamic response of shear walls.

40|$|We {{extend our}} study of {{hysteresis}} to the O(N) symmetric (Phi 2) 3 model {{in three dimensions}} with {{the dynamics of the}} nonconserved order parameter given by a Langevin equation. We analyze both thermal and magnetic hysteresis within this model. We study the systematics of the shapes and areas of hysteresis loops as functions of the amplitude and frequency of the applied field and other parameters in the theory. In the case of magnetic hysteresis we obtain <b>pinched</b> <b>loops</b> for a range of values in parameter space and demonstrate a scaling behavior of the area of the hysteresis loop with the amplitude H 0 of the magnetic field for low amplitudes: A [approx equals] H alpha 0, where the exponent alpha = 2 / 3. This puts the magnetic hysteresis behavior of the (Phi 2) 3 model in the same universality class as that of the (Phi 2) 2 model. Thermal hysteresis, obtained by cycling the temperature {{in the presence of a}} small magnetic field, is characterized by asymmetric loops. We find that the area of the thermal hysteresis loops scales as a function of the amplitude of the periodic temperature (for low amplitudes) : A [approx equals] r alpha 0, where alpha = 1. we show that our study is relevant to the physics of ferroelectric materials and charge-density-wave systems.
