5000|$|Surface Resonant Vibrators {{rely on the}} {{principle}} of counter rotating eccentric weights to impart a sinusoidal harmonic motion from the surface into the work string at the surface. Reference Three (above) provides a full explanation of this technology. The frequency of rotation, and hence vibration of the <b>pipe</b> <b>string,</b> is tuned to the resonant frequency of the system. The system is defined as the surface resonant vibrator, <b>pipe</b> <b>string,</b> fish and retaining media. The resultant forces imparted to the fish is based on the following logic: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{geological}} formation downhole occasionally has a significantly lower pressure than the drilling fluid being used. When the <b>pipe</b> <b>string</b> comes {{into contact with}} the exposed formation the difference in pressure will cause the pipe to be sucked against the formation. If the rig is able to circulate drilling fluid back to the surface that is often a good indication of differentially stuck pipe. One technique for freeing the stuck pipe, or avoiding the issue to begin with, is to rotate the <b>pipe</b> <b>string</b> while pulling out of the hole.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the free}} {{point of a}} stuck <b>pipe</b> <b>string</b> is determined, the stringshot {{back-off}} service {{can be used to}} remove the free portion from the well. The string-shot is a metal rod wrapped in explosive primer cord. The back-off procedure applies left-hand torque to the stuck <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b> The CCL is used to help position the string shot at the predetermined pipe joint, and then the string shot is detonated. [...] The explosion produces a similar effect as an intense hammer blow and allows the joint to be unscrewed at the proper connection. Several factors such as pipe size, weight and condition, back-off depth, mud or borehole fluid weight and well temperature are carefully considered when making up the proper string-shot assembly.|$|E

50|$|Although {{problems}} {{such as the one}} described above can happen they are extremely rare and always avoidable. In the case above, adequate supervision could have prevented this dramatic consequence of operator error by limiting the hydraulic force allowable to be an applied to a level below what was required to part the <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jet cutters use a circular-shaped {{charge to}} produce the cutting action. Jet cutters are capable of {{severing}} pipe despite significant downhole pressure. This makes them an ideal choice for extremely deep wells, greater than 20,000 feet deep. They typically leave a flare on the severed <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b> This flare must be removed, typically by using a mill, before further fishing operations can take place.|$|E

50|$|The tool {{consists}} {{of at least}} two concentric pipes which are forming two hydraulic channels - one for pumping down a high-pressure working agent (water) and second for delivering pregnant slurry back to the surface. A BHM tool usually has (down-up): an eductor (waterjet pump) section, a hydromonitor section, an extension section and a hub, connecting it all to a drill <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b> This string extends the tool up to the surface. Above the surface, the tool has a swivel allowing its suspension and rotation in a hole, and also connections to the working agent supply (pump station) and a slurry collector. A drill rig is normally required to operate a BHM tool.|$|E
50|$|The {{more complex}} method of {{pressure}} control, {{as compared to}} coiled tubing and wireline, naturally invites more opportunity for things to go wrong. One such peril was seen in June 2007 on the Shearwater platform. Snubbing was being used to clean out large pebble, which had entered the well through a collapsed liner. While pulling out of hole, one stripping ram was not opened sufficiently and a collar on the <b>pipe</b> <b>string</b> caught on the ram. The excessive force applied to the pipe caused it to break apart, dropping the string below the failure into the well. In {{the time it took}} to prepare to fish out the pipe, the pebbles {{in the process of being}} circulated out, settled on the pipe, preventing successful fishing.|$|E
50|$|Snubbing {{is a type}} {{of heavy}} well {{intervention}} performed on oil and gas wells. It involves running the BHA on a <b>pipe</b> <b>string</b> using a hydraulic workover rig. Unlike wireline or coiled tubing, the pipe is not spooled off a drum but made up and broken up while running in and pulling out, much like conventional drill pipe. Due to the large rigup, it is only used for the most demanding of operations when lighter intervention techniques do not offer the strength and durability. Unlike conventional drilling and completions operations, snubbing can be performed with the well still under pressure (not killed). When done so, it is called hydraulic workover. It can also be performed without having to remove the Christmas tree from the wellhead.|$|E

5000|$|The capture {{vehicle was}} lowered and {{raised on a}} <b>pipe</b> <b>string</b> {{similar to those used}} on oil {{drilling}} rigs. Section by section, 60 ft steel pipes were strung together to lower the claw {{through a hole in the}} middle of the ship.

The salvaged [...] "Target Object" [...] was thus to be drawn into a moon pool, the doors of which could then be closed to form a floor for the salvaged section. This allowed for the entire salvage process to take place underwater, away from the view of other ships, aircraft, or spy satellites.|$|E
50|$|The Halliburton Freepoint Tool {{is based}} around the magnetorestrictive {{property}} of steel. This principle states that when torque or stretch {{is applied to}} free pipe, the magnetization will change. Stuck pipe will have no change in magnetization. There is a magnet {{on the bottom of}} the tool that creates a small magnetic field. There are four co-planar orthogonal multi-axis high sensitivity magnetometers located above the magnet. The magnetometers measure the change in the magnetization of the pipe. The pipe is set at neutral weight, then the tool is run downhole logging the entire <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b> Once it is at the bottom of the string, torque or stretch is applied to the pipe. The tool is then pulled uphole logging the entire string. The tool will detect differences in the magnetization of the pipe, thereby indicating free and stuck sections of pipe.|$|E
50|$|The term {{free point}} {{is used to}} {{describe}} the delineating point between the stuck pipe and the free pipe in a <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b> Every joint of pipe above the free point is free, meaning it can rotate freely and be moved {{in and out of the}} hole, provided it was not attached to the remaining joints of stuck pipe below the free point. A good way to visualize this is to hold a piece of string with your left hand. With your right hand grab the bottom third of that string. The 2/3rds of the string above your right hand would be considered free, since you can move the string however you may like. The section of string inside and below your right hand is stuck, since no matter what you do to the free string it will not affect the string in or below your right hand.|$|E
50|$|The Magic Pipe, {{also known}} by his close friends as 'The Broken Bowflex', is a homemade, {{electronically}} rigged pair of machined aluminum pipes (previously steel {{in its first}} incarnation), connected by adjustable phosphorus bronze joints, with each pipe hosting an orchestral bass string. The harp-shaped instrument is roughly seven feet tall and features 13 trigger points, which can be mapped to various musical sound effects or samples. The front pipe uses a low C string, while the rear <b>pipe's</b> <b>string</b> is used to achieve more tenor ranged notes. The pipes themselves are employed to produce various percussive sounds while That 1 Guy slaps, plucks, or bows the strings, as well as occasionally utilizing a drum stick to sound the <b>strings</b> and the <b>pipes</b> at the same time.

50|$|Differential {{sticking}} is {{a problem}} that occurs when drilling a well with a greater well bore pressure than formation pressure, as is usually the case. The drill pipe is pressed against the wellbore wall so that part of its circumference will see only reservoir pressure, while the rest will continue to be pushed by wellbore pressure. As a result, the pipe becomes stuck to the wall, and can require millions of pounds of force to remove, which may prove impossible. In many cases the drilling fluid (mud) weight is reduced, thus relieving the pressure difference and releasing the stuck <b>pipe</b> <b>string.</b> Should this option be unavailable, as in sour gas wells, a specialty fishing company is called to retrieve the stuck pipe or 'fish'. Many options exist once a fishing company is on site: oil or nitrogen may be pumped down the well, or the fish may be 'washed over' using a carbide shoe on a string of washpipe. Jarring is not usually attempted with differential sticking due to the massive amount of pressure that holds the pipe in place.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} helpful to {{visualize}} the well as a U-tube as in Figure beside. Column Y of the tube represents the annulus and column X represents the <b>pipe</b> (<b>string)</b> in the well. The bottom of the U-tube represents {{the bottom of the}} well. In most cases, there are fluids creating hydrostatic pressures in both the pipe and annulus. Atmospheric pressure can be omitted, since it works the same on both columns. If the fluid in both the pipe and annulus are of the same density, hydrostatic pressures would be equal and the fluid would be static {{on both sides of the}} tube. If the fluid in the annulus is heavier, it will exert more pressure downward and will flow into the string, displacing some of the lighter fluid out of the string causing a flow at surface. The fluid level will fall in the annulus, equalizing pressures. When there is a difference in the hydrostatic pressures, the fluid will try to reach balance point. This is called U-tubing, and it explains why there is often flow from the pipe when making connections. This is often evident when drilling fast because the effective density in the annulus is increased by cuttings.|$|E
50|$|The D/V Chikyu, {{operated}} by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) sailed on IODP Expedition 343 from the port of Shimizu, Shizuoka on April 1, 2012, within 13 months after the earthquake. Chikyu is the only research vessel with the capabilities for the necessary drilling in very deep water of over 6900 meters. Two months of operations from April 1 to 24 May 24, 2012 were scheduled for drilling several boreholes to carry out Logging while drilling (LWD), install temperature sensors and retrieve core samples. The extreme water depths caused many technical challenges {{that had to be}} considered, such as the strength of the long <b>pipe</b> <b>string,</b> onboard handling of the pipe sections, and instrument operations at very high water pressure. These aspects needed careful planning and new tools on the ship. Various equipment had not been previously used in such deep water and caused many problems and delays during the first month at sea. Eventually difficult engineering problems were overcome enabling retrieval of borehole core and installation of a temperature observatory across the fault zone at a depth of about 820 meters below the sea floor. New records were set for scientific drilling including, longest drilling string (7740 m) from the ocean surface and deepest core from the ocean surface (7752 m).|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{may serve}} as an example. At {{the end of the}} 19 th century Herman Hollerith combined punch cards having holes in specific places – a device known from mechanic musical instruments – with the cognitive concept of coding numbers by the arrangement of holes on the cards. In mechanic musical instruments, this technique was used for coding musical notes. Air pressure passing through the holes of the punch cards triggered an acoustic tone in <b>pipes,</b> <b>strings</b> or bells associated with the holes. Hollerith not only replaced musical notes by numbers. He also combined his punch cards with an electric reading device replacing air pressure: spring-mounted needles made an electrical connection when passing through the holes. Taken in isolation, all of the elements which Hollerith combined were no new concepts, yet their combination was. In fact, it was the first electro-mechanically machine able to tabulate and sort numerical information automatically. This {{turned out to be a}} major innovation when introduced to the market by the Tabulating Machine Company, later Computer Tabulating Recording Company renamed IBM in 1924 (see (Kistermann 1991)).|$|R

Sampling technology was involved in the composing process, which provided the tracks with a varied and contemporary touch and enabled a more liberated use of sounds. Studio technology was not ruled out; the pure and unprocessed experience inherent in Koledoyuran was substituted by an effort to create an integrated album in atmosphere and sound. The album enjoyed contributions from a variety of guests and includes traditional instruments like ney (reed flute), zurna (shrill <b>pipe),</b> <b>strings,</b> and the Ramadan drum, as well as vocalists and a text-reading chorus. The lyrics were not written to make up a concept album but are in natural harmony and mirror the human inner world through personal impressions.
