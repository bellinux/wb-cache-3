40|$|The {{justification}} {{for doing the}} work {{presented in this paper}} lies in the recent and disturbing rumours regarding the reflectivity of the current SCIAMACHY Level 1 b product. The reflectivity was claimed to show an overall 20 -percent loss in magnitude compared to GOME. We will show that the reported discrepancy in the reflectivity is indeed not a fictional one, but that it is certainly not caused by the failing <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction.</b> We also concentrate on the <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> itself. Unfortunately, the current version of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm is not reliable, and shows severe errors in the applied correction. 1 <b>POLARISATION</b> <b>CORRECTION</b> OF RADIANCES Light can be described by means of Stokes vectors, in which the component refers to the intensity of the radiation, and and characterize the degree of linear polarisation [1]. Circular polarisation, described by the Stokes parameter, is negligible for atmospheric polarisation [2]. The spectral channels of SCIAMACHY are sensitive to the polarisation of the light it detects. This is an unwanted property. Because of the sensitivity of the spectral channels to polarisation, the response to detected atmospheric light is unfortunately not just a linear function of the intensity, but also depends on the Stokes parameters and describing the (linear) polarisation of the radiation. More specifically, it is given by [3] which defines &('*),+. -:;. " 859...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the POLAMI {{program for the}} monitoring of all four Stokes parameters of a sample of bright radio-loud active galactic nuclei with the IRAM 30 m telescope at 3. 5 and 1. 3 mm. The program started in October 2006 and accumulated, until August 2014, 2300 observations at 3. 5 mm, achieving a median time sampling interval of 22 days for the sample of 37 sources. This first paper explains the source selection, mostly blazars, the observing strategy and data calibration, and gives {{the details of the}} instrumental <b>polarisation</b> <b>corrections.</b> The sensitivity (1 sigma) reached at 3. 5 mm is 0. 5 % (linear polarisation degree), 4. 7 deg. (polarisation angle), and 0. 23 % (circular polarisation), while the corresponding values at 1. 3 mm are 1. 7 %, 9. 9 deg., and 0. 72 %, respectively. The data quality is demonstrated by the time sequences of our calibrators Mars and Uranus. For the quasar 3 C 286, widely used as a linear polarisation calibrator, we give improved estimates of its linear polarisation, and show for the first time occasional detections of its weak circular polarisation, which suggests a small level of variability of the source at millimeter wavelengths.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the errors in GOME radiances {{resulting}} solely from the operational <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> of GOME signals. The assessment was made by simulating on a computer both the observation of various Earth scenes and the subsequent calibration of signals, as relevant to GOME. For 290 - 350 nm, errors are typically larger than 1 %, sometimes even as large as 10 %. Especially for 305 - 315 nm, errors will usually be 2 - 5 %. For longer wavelengths (350 - 790 nm), errors are normally smaller than 1 %, allthough they may reach 2 % for certain wavelengths and Earth scenes. The large uv errors are {{due to lack of}} uv polarisation data, either from theory or observation. We supply additional theoretical data in the form of parametrisations of the polarisation in the uv and show that a <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm capable of using this additional information significantly reduces uv radiance errors. The correct retrieval of e. g. ozone profiles relies strongly on well-calibrated absolute uv radiances. Our results are also relevant to future instruments like SCIAMACHY and GOME- 2...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{deals with}} the well-known radiometric calibration error of SCIAMACHY. Two new key data products have recently become available and we investigate their performance in the UV. The use of the new key data results in a smaller calibration error in the reflectance, but some additional spectral features are introduced. These changes are mainly due {{to changes in the}} solar irradiance. The radiance has not changed significantly. 1. REFLECTANCE VALIDATION METHOD For the work presented in this report we rely on a radiative transfer model to provide us with a reference spectrum in order to validate the reflectance measured by SCIAMACHY. The reference spectrum is calculated by the radiative transfer model Doubling-Adding KNMI (DAK). The approach we followed is described in [1]. There it is explained that a comparison with model calculations is most reliable in the UV. The SCIAMACHY data were calibrated using SciaL 1 C 2. 2. 7. <b>Polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> was not applied; instead, we corrected the spectrum using our own <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction.</b> The latter procedure is described in [2]. 2.

40|$|Abstract. The Extracted GOME Instrument header (EGOI) data, {{which are}} {{available}} near-real time and contain parts of the UV-Vis spectra, {{are used in the}} retrieval of ozone columns and profiles. This work is done in the framework of the ESA-DUP project GOFAP. The level 0 - 1 algorithms used are based on the GOME Data Processor (GDP) algorithms of DLR, but there are several differences. The corrections for straylight and polarisation sensitivity differ from the GDP algorithms in order to account for the limited spectral information in the EGOI data (only nine small spectral windows are available). Detailed validation studies have resulted in several improvements in the level 0 to 1 algorithms. These comprise the wavelength calibration, correction of Peltier cooler interference, <b>correction</b> for <b>polarisation</b> sensitivity and <b>correction</b> of the effective reflectivity degradation.

Errors are estimated by applying different correction algorithms to a sample of simulated observations. The currently implemented algorithm is shown to permit larger inaccuracies than necessary and small modifications are suggested that lead to substantial reduction in the errors, especially in the UV. Also, a new algorithm that deals more consistently with the variation of polarisation with wavelength is presented.

40|$|We {{compute the}} vacuum <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> to the binding energy of nuclear {{matter in the}} Walecka model using a nonperturbative approach. We first study such a {{contribution}} as arising from a ground state structure with baryon-antibaryon condensates. This yields the same results as obtained through the relativistic Hartree approximation of summing tadpole diagrams for the baryon propagator. Such a vacuum is then generalized to include quantum effects from meson fields through scalar-meson condensates. The method is applied to study properties of nuclear matter and leads to a softer equation of state giving a lower value of the incompressibility than would be reached without quantum effects. The density dependent effective sigma mass is also calculated including such vacuum polarisation effects.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method that {{identifies}} a mode of Rayleigh waves and separates it from body waves and from other modes, using quaternions to represent multi-component data. Being well known the abilities of quaternions to handle rotations in space, we use previous results derived from Le Bihan and Mars (2004) to prove that a Rayleigh-wave mode recorded by an array of vector-sensors can be approximated by a sum of trace-by-trace rotating time signals. Our method decomposes the signal into narrow-frequency bands, which undergo both a velocity correction and a <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction.</b> The aim of these corrections {{is to reduce the}} mode of interest to a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with infinite apparent velocity and quasi-circular polarisation. Once written in quaternion notation, we refer to this wave packet as quaternion brick. Based on theoretical considerations, we prove that this quaternion brick maps into the first quaternion eigenimage of the quaternion singular value decomposition. We apply this method to synthetic datasets derived from two vertically heterogeneous models to extract the fundamental mode and we prove that it is correctly separated from either a higher mode of propagation or body waves with negligible residual.

Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf of the}} Royal Astronomical Society. Astronomical widefield imaging of interferometric radio data is computationally expensive, especially for the large data volumes created by modern non-coplanar many-element arrays. We present a new widefield interferometric imager that uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use of the w-snapshot algorithm. The performance dependencies of CASA's w-projection and our new imager are analysed and analytical functions are derived that describe the required computing cost for both imagers. On data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we find our new method to be an order of magnitude faster than w-projection, as well as being capable of full-sky imaging at full resolution and with correct <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction.</b> We predict the computing costs for several other arrays and estimate that our imager is a factor of 2 - 12 faster, depending on the array configuration. We estimate the computing cost for imaging the low-frequency Square-Kilometre Array observations to be 60 PetaFLOPS with current techniques. We find that combining w-stacking with the w-snapshot algorithm does not significantly improve computing requirements over pure w-stacking. The source code of our new imager is publicly released...|$|E

Correction of the {{influence}} of baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation on dielectric spectra. Bioelectrochemistry, 51 (1), 53 - 65 The deconvolution of biological dielectric spectra can be difficult enough with artefact-free spectra but is more problematic when machine baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation are present as well. In addition, these two sources of anomalies can be responsible for significant interference with dielectric biomass measurements made using one- or two-spot frequencies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop mathematical models of baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation which can be used to remove these anomalies from dielectric spectra in a way that can be easily implemented on-line and in real-time on the Biomass Monitor (BM). We show that both artefacts can be successfully removed in solutions of organic and inorganic ions; in animal cell and microbial culture media; and in yeast suspensions of varying biomass. The high quality of the compensations achieved were independent of whether gold and platinum electrodes were used; the electrode geometry; electrode fouling; current density; the type of BM; and of whether electrolytic cleaning pulses had been applied. In addition, the calibration experiments required could be done off-line using a simple aqueous KCl dilution series with the calibration constants being automatically calculated by a computer without the need for user intervention. The calibration values remained valid for a minimum of 3 months for the baseline model and indefinitely for the electrode polarisation one. Importantly, application of baseline correction prior to <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> allowed the latter's application to the whole conductance range of the BM. These techniques are therefore exceptionally convenient to use under practical conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{calibration}} of SCIAMACHY {{was thoroughly}} checked since {{the instrument was}} launched on-board ENVISAT in February 2002. While SCIAMACHY's functional performance is excellent since launch, a number of technical difficulties have appeared, that required adjustments to the calibration. The problems can be separated into three types: (1) Those caused by the instrument and/or platform environment. Among these are the high water content in the satellite structure and/or MLI layer. This results in the deposition of ice on the detectors in channels 7 and 8 which seriously affects the retrievals in the IR, mostly because of the continuous change of the slit function caused by scattering of the light through the ice layer. Additionally a light leak in channel 7 severely hampers any retrieval from this channel. (2) Problems due to errors in the on-ground calibration and/or data processing affecting for example the radiometric calibration. A new approach based on a mixture of on-ground and in-flight data is shortly described here. (3) Problems caused by principal limitations of the calibration concept, e. g. the possible appearance of spectral structures after the <b>polarisation</b> <b>correction</b> due to unavoidable errors in the determination of atmospheric polarisation. In this paper we give a complete overview of the calibration and problems that {{still have to be}} solved. We will also give an indication of the effect of calibration problems on retrievals where possible. Since the operational processing chain is currently being updated and no newly processed data are available at this point in time, for some calibration issues only a rough estimate of the effect on Level 2 products can be given. However, it is the intention of this paper to serve as a future reference for detailed studies into specific calibration issues...|$|E
