5000|$|Heterogeneous {{photocatalysis}} is {{the process}} that underpins the activity of most architectural materials, such as glass, tiles, concrete, paint and fabric, which are promoted as being 'self-cleaning'. These photocatalytic materials facilitate the oxidative mineralisation of organic and inorganic species by ambient oxygen on their surfaces, rendering the surfaces clean and, usually, hydrophilic. In most commercial photocatalytic products the active layer is a thin, clear, colourless coating of the semiconductor anatase titania, which requires UV light to photogenerate the necessary electrons (e−) and holes (h+), in its conductance and valence bands, respectively, to promote the <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>process.</b> A schematic of the key processes behind the photocatalytic mineralisation of an organic pollutant {{on the surface of}} a titania photocatalyst film is illustrated in figure 1 and the overall reaction is summarised by: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{marketing}} of photocatalytic products {{and prevention of}} counterfeiting is made difficult because the photocatalytic coatings are usually and necessarily invisible to the eye. [...] One way to achieve a visual demonstration of photocatalysis {{is to use a}} dyestuff, like methylene blue, dissolved in water, as the organic species to be mineralised, since, as the <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>process</b> proceeds, the colour of the dye disappears as it is oxidised. [...] This approach forms the basis of a well-established ISO test for photocatalytic activity of films ISO. [...] However, most photocatalyst commercial products use only a thin layer of titania (e.g. ca. 15 nm thick in self-cleaning glass) and ambient UV levels are often low (e.g. for a sunny day in the UK the UVA irradiance is only ca. 4 mW/cm2). As a consequence, the photocatalytic oxidative bleaching of methylene blue is usually very slow, taking many hours, and so inappropriate for marketing at least.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{photocatalytic}} {{decomposition of}} trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in water was studied. TCE and PCE {{were present in}} water at very low concentrations of about 15 µg/dm 3. This concentration level corresponds to the one occasionally occurring in groundwater. Results of this research confirmed usefulness of the <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>process</b> for successful removal of low-concentrated TCE and PCE from water. Removal of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene from water {{can be achieved by}} application of the <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>process</b> over titanium dioxide.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has been}} addressed {{to study the}} reclamation of heavy metal contaminated soils by soil washing, and to investigate the feasibility of <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>processes</b> {{for the treatment of}} the spent soil washing solution (SSWS). Indeed, the collected SSWS, containing the extracted metals and chelating agents, represents one of the main drawbacks of the washing technique, as it has to be submitted to further treatments for a complete detoxification before being discharged into the environment. The soil washing using EDDS as chelating agent has been demonstrated to be an efficient soil remediation technique to remove Cu and Zn from real polluted soils. Only Cu and Zn present as exchangeable and reducible fractions have been extracted by EDDS. The intra-particle diffusion was the main rate controlling step in the extraction of heavy metals from the solid matrix. Different contributions have been found by applying the Weber and Morris intra-particle diffusion model due to the different roles of superficial and intra-particle diffusive processes. The diffusion coefficients of the Cu/EDDS and Zn/EDDS complexes in real contaminated soils have been estimated using simplified diffusive models. The simultaneous removal of EDDS and metals (Cu, Fe and Zn) from both synthetic solutions and real contaminated soil washing mixtures at neutral pH has been investigated to assess the possibility of applying TiO 2 based <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>processes</b> for the treatment of SSWS and identify the sequence of <b>photocatalytic</b> <b>processes</b> required to optimally decontaminate the liquid wastes. The photocatalytic tests have demonstrated that the sequence of treatment constituted by two steps, TiO 2 -photocatalysis with oxygen followed by TiO 2 -sacrificial photocatalysis, is required to completely detoxify the SSWS.
