5|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth is {{planning}} a party. Knowing this, Liz recounts past parties of Kenneth's to Tracy, telling {{him that she was}} the only other person who attended those parties. Feeling <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> Kenneth, Tracy tells the biggest gossips on TGS with Tracy Jordan, Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown), that T.I. will be attending. They persuade other people to attend by telling various other lies. The resulting party is so outrageous that Kenneth decides never to throw a party again.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} press instructed {{people to}} sacrifice their family ties {{for the sake}} of atheism, and that they should not make compromises with family religious tradition {{for the sake of}} family unity or loving <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> their relatives.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{he showed}} some decline as a bowler in 1914, Thompson batted better than ever, {{and it was}} a great <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> Northamptonshire that serious {{injuries}} prevented him playing at all until 1921, when he had lost his bowling completely but retained some of his batting skill. After a few games in 1922, Thompson's career ended tamely.|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt an earth tremor last night," [...] said Bickley, [...] "though it is {{odd that}} it should only have {{affected}} this particular statue. A thousand <b>pities,</b> <b>for</b> {{it was a wonderful}} work of art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she assented, [...] "sympathy is the {{one thing}} a man lacks. It isn't your fault, Philip. You are to be <b>pitied</b> <b>for</b> it. And, after all, it is a woman's gift, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} an honest-minded Mingo,--one {{that you could}} put faith in, {{if he had a}} temptation to deceive you. Cheating seems to be their gift, and I {{sometimes}} think they ought to be <b>pitied</b> <b>for</b> it, rather than persecuted." ...|$|R
25|$|After seeing conscripted civilians of the Volkssturm needlessly {{gunned down}} in battle, General Mohnke confronts Joseph Goebbels, their commander, about the slaughter. Goebbels tells Mohnke {{that he has no}} <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the civilians, as they chose their fate. Hitler loses his sense of reality and orders Field Marshal Keitel to find Admiral Karl Dönitz, whom Hitler {{believes}} is gathering troops in the north, and help him plan an offensive to recover the Romanian oil fields.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} a kind of {{military}} racism, or species-ism. The Mushrooms are clearly described as different, although they would seem to be human, to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins feel no <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.|$|E
25|$|In Jogajog (Relationships), {{the heroine}} Kumudini—bound by {{the ideals of}} Śiva-Sati, {{exemplified}} by Dākshāyani—is torn between her <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; pathos depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry. The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families—the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.|$|E

60|$|The {{conversation}} waxed general. Christminster {{society was}} criticized, the dons, magistrates, {{and other people}} in authority being sincerely <b>pitied</b> <b>for</b> their shortcomings, while opinions on how they ought to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly respected, were exchanged in a large-minded and disinterested manner.|$|R
60|$|Never {{was such}} a {{language}} of sympathy as the Italian. Poverino! Poverino! They are never happy unless they are sympathising pityingly with somebody.

25|$|Arindal is hallucinating {{that he is}} hunting a doe. As it is killed, he realises it is his wife. He {{continues}} to experience visions (Ich seh' den Himmel) before falling asleep. The voice of the petrified but weeping Ada is heard calling for him. Then the voice of Groma calls to him too. A sword, shield and lyre appear which Groma says can win Arindal victory and a greater reward. Zemina and Farzana, enter. The former expresses her <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> Arindal while the latter says he deserves punishment for seeking to take Ada from them. They wake him and announce they will lead him to Ada to rescue her. He expresses his willingness to die for her. The two fairies hope this will actually happen.|$|E
25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E
500|$|KMFDM is an initialism for the {{nonsensical}} and grammatically incorrect German phrase Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid, which, {{keeping the}} same word order, [...] literally translates as [...] "no majority for the pity", but is typically given the loose translation of [...] "no <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the majority". In the original phrase, the articles preceding the nouns Mehrheit and Mitleid are inflected for the wrong gender, as the proper declension would be Keine Mehrheit für das Mitleid. Swapping the two nouns yields the grammatically correct Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit, which translates directly as [...] "no <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the majority".

500|$|KMFDM (originally Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid, loosely {{translated}} by the band as [...] "no <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the majority") is an industrial band led by German multi-instrumentalist Sascha Konietzko, {{who founded the}} group in 1984 as a performance art project.|$|E
500|$|Basically the death-lay is {{a simple}} story of a short-tempered man who falls victim of his [...] "bad-mouthed wife's" [...] sharp tongue. The poem has no <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> Lalli, {{and he is not}} {{depicted}} as a hero in a story whose true antagonist is Kerttu. The depiction of Henry's death built on an independent tradition that was once in direct competition with that of the legend, which is largely forgotten today. It remains unknown whether the two traditions were built around the same person.|$|E

Meanwhile, Karen (Megan Mullally) tries to pass off Will (Eric McCormack) as her lover and not her lawyer when she discovers that she is the object of <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> being single at her own Valentine's Day party.|$|E

500|$|Some {{space is}} devoted to the {{psychological}} scrutiny of the principal characters, but with consideration, also, of their function in the dramatic construct. [...] "The character of Lear" [...] is perfectly conceived for its place in the play, [...] "the only ground on which such a story could be built with the greatest truth and effect. It is his rash haste, his violent impetuosity, his blindness to every thing but the dictates of his passions or affection, that produces all his misfortunes, that aggravates his impatience of them, that enforces our <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|One night {{alone in}} the office while the men are out together, Carter answers the case line to hear of the {{location}} of the Zodiac. Though three to five agents are recommended, Carter decides to go to the location herself. Fighting off multiple guards, Carter is able to retrieve the Zodiac, a mysterious serum, herself. The next day, Flynn reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission, and dismisses the indignant Carter as just an [...] "old flame" [...] of Captain America's who was given her current job out of <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> her bereavement. However, before he can officially punish her, the case line rings again, this time with Howard Stark on the other end, who informs Flynn that Carter will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|The season {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Mulder—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett comes upon an old case about a professed [...] "soul-eater" [...] that he hopes will ultimately prove the truth behind Mulder’s abduction. In a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that, after his exposure to an alien artifact, Mulder was slowly dying of a brain disease. In an attempt to heal himself, he tracked down the soul eater {{a year before the}} events of the episode, but felt <b>pity</b> <b>for</b> the creature. In the present, Doggett is shot and killed by the local sheriff, but the soul eater consumes his death and is finally allowed to die, resurrecting Doggett in the process.|$|E
