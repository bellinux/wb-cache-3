40|$|What was {{important}} about the Treaty on European Union {{from the point}} of view of the European Parliament (EP) ? What were the most significant new powers that the Parliament acquired? Most observers have concentrated their attention on the new <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> under Article 189 b or the expanded role in the appointment of the President and members of the European Commission; more esoteric commentaries may also mention the autonomous right of the EP to appoint a European Ombudsman, but very few have so far given much attention to Article 138 c and the right to set up a temporary Committee of Inquiry to investigate "alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. " It is not the intention of this paper to compare the new power of inquiry directly with the reinforced legislative role of the EP or its more salient position in the appointment of the Commission. Rather it will be argued that the first two committees of inquiry set up by the Parliament in 1996 showed how the EP can operate within a relatively constraining institutional framework to make an original contribution to the scrutiny of Community policies and to bring the work of the EP to the attention of larger public than its traditional activity in relation to legislation or the appointment of the Commission normally does...|$|E
40|$|This study uses rationalist and constructivist {{explanations}} <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> in the European Parliament (EP). It {{seeks to}} understand {{the change in the}} policy preferences of the EP during negotiations on the ‘Returns’ directive – dealing with the voluntary or compulsory return of irregular immigrants. This article shows that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> contributed considerably to the EP’s change of stance on immigration policies. A long-standing advocate of civil liberties in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ), the EP was expected to raise the standards of protection for third-country nationals. In view of the inability of the EP to construct a more liberal policy, the study uses two institutionalist approaches to understand why the EP was unsuccessful in raising the standards. Therefore, the approaches aim at identifying the logics and layers of change. The empirical application of the models highlights the necessity to integrate rationalist and constructivist understandings <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> in order to understand motivations for policy change. Synergies in the direction of change also point to the importance of institutional motivations, in order to understand major changes in the policy preferences of the EP...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{implications}} of the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>co-decision</b> procedure for the European Unionâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy and its reform. We use a game-theoretical model of the legislative procedures in the European Union and show that the move from consultation to co-decision implies a shift <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from the Commission to the European Parliament. The implications for the Common Agricultural Policy depend on the configuration of preferences, the location of the status quo, and the bargaining powers in the Conciliation Committee. If the member states and the European Parliament are more opposed to reform than is the Commission, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> reduces the prospects for reform of the European Unionâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper first explores {{existing}} debates, {{identifying the}} particular approaches {{that have been}} used to deconstruct co¬decision. It agues that whilst the methods may be substantially and intellectually different, they are institutionalist in flavour, and actually reach similar conclusions. It distinguishes between those approaches which focus on the divisibles of co-decision-voting patterns and outputs, and those which examine the visible (or perhaps as some might argue the less visible or invisible) effects, namely structural and cultural change within and between EU institutions. This paper is part of a lager project on the legacy <b>of</b> <b>co-decision,</b> and its consequent effects upon the inter-institutional dynamics of the EU. It is significantly orientated towards the cultural and procedural changes within the Council of Ministers (Council). However, at a preliminary stage, one glaring omission from existing research became obvious. There has been a natural and predictable emphasis on the European Parliament-Council dichotomy <b>of</b> <b>co-decision.</b> Consequently, the European Commission (Commission) has been analytically sidelined. The second part of this paper identifies why it is timely to bring the Commission back into our thinking on co¬decision. The final section of this paper identifies the implications <b>of</b> <b>co-decision,</b> addressing the underlying and political factors that have enabled co-decision to evolve into an EU decisional norm, but focusing upon the implications for our appreciation of the Council and its legitimate role with the EU system of governance...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to {{establish}} {{the effect of the}} procedure <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> to the behaviour of and relationship between the political groups of the Parliament and furthermore discuss the effect to the inter-institutional operating of the Parliament within the process of decision-making with the Council and Commission. The effect is established by the application of the theory of rational choice institutionalism where after the main theoretical interpretations are discussed to the empirical research of the intra-institutional process of decision-making in the Parliament. A main theoretical interpretation is that the formal structures of the procedure <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> favour the larger political parties due to the ability of the parties to influence the institutional structure of the procedure. It is however found that the procedure in reality does not favour the larger political parties as much as expected. The tradition of balancing the distribution <b>of</b> rights and <b>powers</b> according {{to the size of the}} parties and the further construction of the Conciliation committee system to ensure that the delegation of chairs of committees can not be made used of to ensure more inter-institutional influence reflect this. Yet, the procedure is interpreted to affect the behaviour of the political groups as to enhance cooperating instead of competition. The Parliament has fought hard for its current legislative status and it is interpreted that it is not viable that the political parties will act as to jeopardize the legislative status. However, when focusing on the formal rules of voting, the procedure <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> does not affect the political parties differently. The empirical research supports the later interpretation of the effect of the procedure to the behaviour of and relationship between the political parties. However, the overall pattern is that to understand the political behaviour one needs to include several parameters and not only the formal and informal inter- and intra-institutional practises within the procedure <b>of</b> <b>co-decision.</b> Such parameters are for instance the public opinion, ideological similarity and technical reasons...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we show that, for {{the area}} of {{environmental}} policy, the Commission and the Council have been more willing to rely on extensive delegation after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>co-decision.</b> We also show that the tendency of these two actors to delegate has followed the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty - which indicates that the Council and Commission had anticipated their relative loss <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to the EP and rushed to delegate {{as much as possible}} before the effective introduction <b>of</b> <b>co-decision.</b> However, the Council was only willing to delegate more to the Commission on condition that it could exert as much control as possible over the procedure by using regulatory committees. These empirical findings confirm a distributive institutionalist argument according to which the Council and the Commission, seeking to maximizing their institutional power, would try to circumvent the EP through delegation when the latter’s competences in legislation increase. The expectation, also based on this argument, that the EP would react to this behaviour by opposing delegation altogether was not confirmed: the EP, rather than opposing delegation as such, has systematically tried to restrict its scope...|$|R

The macro-institutional changes in the Treaty of Lisbon indicate that the EP will have opportunities to de-securitise, although the emphasis on EU citizens’ rights introduced in the Stockholm programme offers it a chance to appeal to domestic audiences at the expense of more diffuse issues such as immigration and asylum...|$|R

40|$|Since the European Parliament's first {{vote on a}} Council common {{position}} submitted under the co-decision procedure in January 1994 the practice <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> has been scrutinized carefully within Parliament and the other European Union (EU) institutions. However, such scrutiny has produced differing interpretations. This article seeks to assess these respective claims by analysing the first thirty-two legislative proposals processed under co-decision, and so to make an initial assessment of the legislative impact of the European Parliament under the new procedure. Under co-decision Parliament is a more equal partner in the EU's legislative process, and now has a rightful place alongside Council in several important policy areas - despite the weighting of the procedure towards Council. Certainly, informal inter-institutional linkages have expanded as a result <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> and, whatever their qualitative effect, {{there has been an}} undeniable quantitative increase in the interactions between Parliament and Council. The net result of the dialogue between Parliament and Council is the confirmation of an increasingly bipartite bargaining process and this, in turn, has placed the Commission in a considerably more ambiguous, and weaker, position than in the co-operation or consultation procedures...|$|R
40|$|During {{the months}} leading {{to the end of}} the {{transitional}} period (January 2005), most academics and actors involved in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (ASFJ) expected the introduction <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> as the normal decision-making procedure in this area to change the balance between security and liberty. The involvement of the European Parliament as a co-legislator was thought to be a positive aspect, since this institution had persistently adopted a pro-civil liberties stance. Since then, this question has not been systematically tackled in the literature and consequently the impact <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> on the AFSJ remains unclear. However, in 2007, Maurer and Parkes looked at the securitised policy-image governing European asylum policy in order to understand why the European Parliament had been unable to redress the balance and establish civil liberties as a priority. Following their line of reasoning, this paper develops the functional and substantive dimensions introduced by these scholars, in order to explain why the European Parliament, and especially the LIBE committee, has been equally unable to change priorities in the fields of irregular immigration and data protection. I argue that the persistent weakness of the European Parliament in the functional dimension, i. e. the need to legitimise its presence in negotiations dealt with under co-decision, has made changes in the substantive dimension difficult to attain. In those areas were the substantive dimension is weak, as was the case in the Returns directive, the need to legitimise the presence of the EP creates more polarisation among the members of the LIBE committee. In those cases where there is a strong substantive alternative in the LIBE committee, as was the case in the Data retention directive, change is hindered by the Plenary, which establishes the strengthening of the functional dimension as a priority for the institution. In both cases the introduction <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> led to the persistence of a securitised policy-image and the impossibility of engaging in conflict expansion...|$|R
40|$|Legislative co-decision for the European Parliament {{in certain}} areas of EU {{competence}} {{was one of the}} key changes introduced by the Maastricht Treaty. Further extension <b>of</b> the <b>co-decision</b> procedures to all EU legislature is probably the single most important European Parliament demand for itself at the current Intergovernmental Conference. And yet certain academic commentators have suggested that the co-decision procedure is less satisfactory than it first seems for the European Parliament, and that the latter's power to influence policy making may, in fact, be great under the cooperation procedure than under the co-decision procedure. The paper begins by placing the co-decision procedure in context by means of a survey of the evolution of the European Parliament's legislative <b>powers</b> and <b>of</b> the main features of the consultation, cooperation and co-decision procedures. There then follows an assessment <b>of</b> the <b>co-decision</b> procedure compared to the parallel cooperation and consultation procedures, especially with regard to its impacts on EU legislative efficiency, on the overall functioning of the European Parliament and on the balance between the EU institutions.

The paper concludes that it is still hard to measure the longer-term impacts of the procedure but that its unprecedented combination <b>of</b> a veto <b>power</b> and a negotiating mechanism have already had dynamic effects, such as greater professionalization of the European Parliament's work and a reinforcement of its position vis-à-vis the Commission and the Council, that have been underestimated by its critics...|$|R

In order to understand how this process of adaptation occurs and what the consequences are, the present study examines the change in decision-making rules that occurred in the committee for civil liberties and justice and home affairs (LIBE) after 2005 as a precedent for future changes. Interviews and analyses of legislative texts indicate that adaptation to co-decision may occur very quickly but that its extent can be limited by forms of dual behaviour, when the coexistence of two decision-making rules oppose two different worldviews, introducing uncertainty inside committees and among external actors...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} that the 1999 Treaty of Amsterdam significantly increased the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> the European Parliament (EP). The critical question, however, is why the European Union (EU) governments did this. I argue, contrary to existing explanations, that these changes came about because the EP was a ‘constitutional agenda-setter’. The rules in the EU Treaty, as established at Maastricht, were incomplete contracts, and the EU governments had imperfect information about the precise operation of the Treaty. As a result, the EP was able to re-interpret these rules to its advantage and threaten not to co-operate with the governments unless they accepted the EP's interpretations. The article shows how this process of discretion, interpretation and acceptance worked in the two main areas of EP power: in the legislative process (in the reform <b>of</b> the <b>co-decision</b> procedure), and in executive appointment (in the reform of the Commission investiture procedure). The article concludes that ‘agenda-setting through discretion in rule interpretation’ is a common story in the development <b>of</b> the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> parliaments, both at the domestic and EU levels...|$|R

We investigate the effect of early agreements (trilogues) on the time it takes for legislation to be negotiated during the first reading <b>of</b> <b>co-decision.</b> We find that the first reading negotiations of trilogues on salient legislation take longer than first readings of similar files reconciled at second and third reading. First readings of early agreements also appear to last longer when considering all co-decision files submitted to the 5 th and 6 th European Parliaments, but the effect is masked by a general increase in first reading duration after 2004. We conclude that even if early agreements restrict access of certain actors to decision making, they allow for more time for substantive debate at the first reading stage than similar files reconciled later in the legislative process...|$|R

40|$|Introduction]. Many {{observers}} {{claim that}} the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>Co-decision</b> mechanism with the ESA (1987) and its manifestation in the Maastricht/Amsterdam Treaties (1992 / 97) {{could be interpreted as}} a significant step towards more democratic legitimacy in European policymaking. This conclusion could come close to reality under two conditions: The first, if the EP as the only directly elected decision-making body is comprehensively involved as an equal-footing Co-legislator beside the Council. The second, and even more important, is if the Co-decision procedure is sufficiently transparent for the European Citizens. Therefore, this paper aims to explore, whether these two requirements are fulfilled. The following is that a too optimistic assessment of the Codecision procedure, as a tool for more legitimacy cannot be justified. In order to demonstrate my thesis, I will firstly discuss the general problem for European Citizens with legislation at the national and European level, specifically regarding the critical question, of how the EU can bring the people closer to the Union. Secondly, it seems useful to deliver a more comprehensive description of the history <b>of</b> the <b>Co-decision</b> procedure, because this gives an insight into the development of legislation in the Community...|$|R
40|$|The European Parliament is {{frequently}} {{seen as the}} ‘big winner’ of the Lisbon Treaty, {{given the fact that}} several changes have significantly extended its powers, such as the extension <b>of</b> <b>co-decision</b> as the ordinary legislative procedure, and the introduction of the assent procedure to international agreements. The reform of comitology (Article 291) and the introduction of the new instrument of delegated acts (Article 290) are generally seen in the same light, marking the culmination of a long-standing quest of the EP to gain equal rights to the Council in this area. This article questions the view that the Parliament has had unconditional ‘success’ by examining in detail the way the new provisions have been implemented. It argues that Member States in the Council managed to claw back influence on delegated powers through the manner that the new treaty articles have been put into practice. We identify the EP’s timing and selective attention with regard to this domain as the main explanations for this outcome. Our analysis demonstrates the need to study the actual implementation of treaty provisions before coming to a conclusion about the identity of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ of treaty reform...|$|R

Inevitably, there are conflicts between these elements, although many of these conflicts can be resolved through effective communication at an early stage, through information and, above all, active participation of all parties, particularly the public. Large differences exist between the capacity and mechanisms for communication in resort beaches near big urban areas and in rural beaches used only by a limited number of people. Nevertheless, beach managers should consult with, and inform, beach users at all appropriate stages. The success of beach management depends very much on the active participation and involvement of the local population and of beach visitors (Camhis and Coccossis, 1982; Gubbay, 1994).

Using spatial theory and drawing on historical institutionalism it introduces an analytical model that operates on two levels, the level of day-to-day politics and the level of treaty reforms. Two main points are made. First, adapting strategically to the de jure legislative procedures the EP has been able to convert these into de facto procedures that grant it a substantial legislative role. Second, this empowering has enabled the EP and the Commission to pursue a pro-integrationist agenda in a two-level game of legislation and implementation...|$|R
