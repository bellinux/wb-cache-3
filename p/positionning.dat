40|$|This paper {{presents}} a geometrical method {{to calculate the}} position of points in 3 D space from two different views. Our method is divided in two steps. The first step is two-dimensional and defines the epipolar geometry. It calculates a double projection of the homologous image on the reference image through a Virtual Intermediate Plane. We use eight corresponding points to calculate {{the transformation of the}} homologous image. The disparity between the corresponding points in a same referential allows us to get some information about the position of the 3 D points. The second step calculates the coordinates of points in a projective space. The calculation of 3 D coordinates consists in a simple transformation of projective to cartesian coordinates with 5 points {{in the case of a}} pinhole camera, and 4 points for the parallel projection. The interest of our method is to calculate the relative <b>positionning</b> without any knowledge on 3 D coordinates of points, to offer controls along the calculation and to postpone use of the reference points at the end of the calculation.

METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial with 33 pregnant women divided into 2 groups: pregnant group sequence 1 and pregnant group sequence 2. The order of <b>positions</b> used in sequence 1 was Fowler’s <b>position,</b> prone <b>position,</b> supine <b>position,</b> left lateral, Fowler’s <b>position</b> 2, supine <b>position</b> 2, prone <b>position</b> 2 and left lateral 2.

30|$|The {{detection}} and tracking of moving objects (DATMO) in an outdoor environment from a mobile robot are difficult tasks {{because of the}} wide variety of dynamic objects. A reliable discrimination of mobile and static detections without any prior knowledge is often conditioned by a good position estimation obtained using Global <b>Positionning</b> System/Differential Global Positioning System (GPS/DGPS), proprioceptive sensors, inertial sensors or even the use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. In this article a solution of the DATMO problem is presented to perform this task using only a microwave radar sensor. Indeed, this sensor provides images of the environment from which Doppler information can be extracted and interpreted in order to obtain not only velocities of detected objects but also the robot's own velocity.|$|E

40|$|Location-based {{services}} in general require {{information about the}} <b>position</b> of certain objects. For instance, for a navigation service the <b>position</b> of the user needs to be known. This <b>position</b> is usually provided by a <b>positioning</b> system. However, it is typical for all <b>positioning</b> systems {{that they are not}} perfect. This means that the <b>positions</b> they produce inherit <b>position</b> errors. Nowadays, usually only the <b>position</b> estimate is shown to the user even though a quality measure for the <b>position</b> error is provided by most <b>positioning</b> systems. To increase the user’s trust in location-based services and the usefulness of these services, the user should be informed about the uncertainty of <b>position</b> estimates as well. Thus, in this paper we investigate different visualization methods for the <b>position</b> and the <b>position</b> error.

For this, we developed a questionnaire that contains nine different <b>position</b> and <b>position</b> error visualization methods.

40|$|High {{precision}} <b>positionning</b> {{and assembly}} {{as well as}} micro-machining require dedicated devices. These devices have to provide high repeatability and precision on several degrees of freedom (dof). High dynamic characteristics are also sought to reach short task execution time and a good robustness. This work shows how to design parallel robots with flexure joints that allow nanometric <b>positionning</b> repeatability and high dynamics. After {{a description of the}} state of the art, a design methodology is proposed. The state of the art is focused on several topics (analyses and design of flexure joints, parallel micro-robots, dynamic and control of high precision dynamic devices). The methodology guides the engineer through the different design-steps. The design of elementary flexures is studied and the concept of functionaly equivalent flexures is given. This concept consists in a comparison criterion for elementary flexures. The idea is to compare elements that allow a given displacement (for instance a bending angle) at maximal stress. The caracteristics of flexure joints are described. Stiffness and compliance matrix, accurary, eigen-frequencies and eigen-modes determine the behaviour of a joint. The flexure profile, mass-geometry and material choices are analysed. The links between a structure, its dynamic model and the controller are investigated. Several examples are proposed to assess the effect of the mechanical properties of the chosen structures. Two devices have been built to emphasize important issues encountered in the design and control of high precision flexure robots. The first one is a linear stage that highlights the importance of identification, sensitivities, algorithms, quantifications (control and mesure) and sampling on a single dof structure. The second one is a 3 dof parallel robot used as a micro electro-discharge machine. The properties and caracteristics of this robot are illustrated.
