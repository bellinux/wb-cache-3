40|$|Abstract Transport {{systems are}} {{essential}} {{for the life of}} modern societies and economies. A sustainable transport system can shape a sustainable development pattern and socio-economic attributes of urban centres and regions. The use of private cars and trucks is increasing in most countries, creating more congestion, accidents, pollution and energy consumption. Many governments desire to achieve growth in public transport to overcome these adverse trends. A massive shift toward an environmentally sound type of transport is crucial and railways are deemed {{to be one of the}} most sustainable modes. All over the world the railway industry is involved in a renewal to reform and up-date rail, prompted largely by environmental concerns. The trend is to develop speed-competitive systems to expand transportation capacity. The focus of the current research, which is at its commencing stages, is to investigate the opportunities to apply an alternative approach to railway operations to overcome the difficulty of high speed transport in servicing larger amounts of demand, while achieving minimum <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>travel</b> time, in a viable and integrated environment for both passenger and freight services. The expected outcome of the research project is to present a framework that may be used to identify and evaluate the most cost-effective transport solution to service not only major cities, but also regional centres along an interregional rail corridor, thus providing greater benefits on local economies and to build a spine for future development...|$|E
40|$|In December 2001, just a {{few months}} after the {{terrorist}} attacks on New York and Washington left the international airline industry reeling, a new Malaysian company called ‘Tune Air’ purchased a small underperforming domestic Malaysian airline known as ‘AirAsia’ for 1 Malaysian ringgit and the assumption of 40 million ringgit in debt. Within 11 months of acquiring the company, Tune Air had fully repaid this debt and by January 2003 the company was operating six aircraft domestically. In 2006, AirAsia boasted a fleet of 35 Boeing 737 - 300 aircraft and eight Airbus 320 aircraft with orders for 100 more A 320 s and was forecast to carry nine million passengers to 52 domestic and international destinations. AirAsia's meteoric rise is the result of the confluence of opportunity and skillful application of the low-cost Carrier (LCC) aviation business model. This model, which has its origins in the success of Southwest Airlines and Michael O'Leary's ‘Ryanair’, has been implemented around the world and consists of a number of common elements such as reduced inflight service, <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>travel,</b> high aircraft utilization, single fleet type, ticketless passenger reservation systems and considerable functional flexibility in staffing. In this article we trace the rise of AirAsia's success and the nuances of the low-cost aviation model it has pursued. We draw upon established theory from the fields of strategy and strategic human resource management to explain AirAsia's minimalist approach to human resource management. In particular, we apply Porter's well known theory of generic business strategies and Schuler and Jackson's model linking HR practices to competitive strategy, to argue that the airline's successful quest for market cost leadership has been supported by a strict focus on Legge's ‘hard’ variety of HRM. It is further argued that while a number of the components of the Southwest Airlines model are evident, there are also significant differences in AirAsia's management of human resources. In particular, it is argued that the airline has adopted a far stronger cost minimization and ‘hard’ HRM path that is closer to Ryanair's model, which has proved highly successful for the airline in South East Asia...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the passenger experience of travel time, and its translation into a transport model of travel time, which is of great significance in the potential funding and construction of infrastructural projects. In the economic appraisals of such projects, which are often of massive scale and impact, it is presumed that travel time is wasted, dead, or empty, and therefore should be minimised. However, {{in this paper we}} show how travel time is filled with activities and fantasies. We show that there are multiple travel times and places, and not just a single measured clock time that has to be minimised in getting from <b>point</b> A <b>to</b> <b>point</b> B. <b>Travel</b> time is situated in the sociomaterial practices of travel, which include engaging with other passengers, interacting with wireless networks, views out of the window, things packed in one’s bag, and so on. We describe and evaluate various ‘moving methods’ for researching places on-the-move, from survey to ethnography. Finally, {{we consider}} how to disrupt the assumption in transport appraisal that such time is empty and should be minimised, and suggest new approaches for presencing the richness of passenger travel time in transport modelling...|$|R
