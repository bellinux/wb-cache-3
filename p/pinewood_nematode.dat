No jack pines died. A single Scotch pine control died, apparently the result of natural nematode infection. No other controls died. Mean oleoresin flow did not differ among nematode-inoculated jack and shortleaf pines and their respective controls. Oleoresin flow in nematode-inoculated eastern white and Scotch pines was significantly lower than in their controls. Oleoresin flow was temporarily reduced in mortality-resistant eastern white and Scotch pines following nematode infection.

50|$|Pine wilt {{is caused}} by the North American native <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematode</b> (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). Where it is {{indigenous}} it is not major pathogen of native pine species, but in North America it causes wilt in a few non-native North American pine species. It has been introduced into Japan and China, where it has become a troubling disease of Japanese red pines (Pinus densiflora) and black pines (Pinus thunbergii). Over 46 million cubic meters of trees have been lost alone in Japan over a 50-year period. It is spread among conifers by pine sawyer beetles (Monochamus spp). The nematodes can reproduce quickly in the sapwood under favorable conditions within susceptible pine species, causing wilting and death, sometimes in only a few weeks. North America lumber products are under export restrictions because of the nematode. In the Midwest United States it has killed many Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris), and this attractive tree is no longer recommended for landscaping uses there.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluated}} {{radio frequency}} (RF) dielectric heating for eradication of <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematodes</b> (PWN) in infested wood. Thirteen temperatures were tested (from ambient to 70  °C) on small wood samples (2.5  ×  3.8  ×  0.64  cm) {{to determine the}} minimum lethal temperature (100  % mortality), which was 56  °C [based on infra-red (IR) thermal images data 55.5 – 57.4  °C] with a 1  min hold time. We also used thermal probes inside the wood to confirm that temperatures were ≥ 56  °C. Thirty additional samples were tested bracketing the minimum lethal temperature using 54, 56 and 58  °C with additional replications to produce the minimum sample size equivalent of 100  % mortality of at least 93, 616 nematodes to satisfy the Probit 9 efficacy requirement. This minimum lethal temperature was further verified by treating infested large wood blocks (10.2  ×  10.2  ×  25.4  cm). All samples that met or exceeded the 56  °C lethal temperature for the required 1  min hold time (as measured by probes inserted in the wood and on the wood surface by IR) produced 100  % mortality. The sample size required to show Probit 9 efficacy was also satisfied. This study supports the consideration of RF in addition to microwave (MW) dielectric heating as alternative treatments of wood packaging material for inclusion in ISPM No. 15, provided the treatment delivers the target lethal temperature throughout {{the profile of the}} material in industrial scale operations.|$|R

This comprised a series of new techniques: sampling, mass estimations of nematodes using staining techniques, and lowest limit Bx nematode mass determination for PCR detection. The procedure was undertaken on three adjoining 5 -mg wood cross-sections, of 0. 5 · 0. 5 · 0. 015 cm dimension, that were cut from a wood sample of 0. 5 · 0. 5 · 0. 5 cm initially, then the larger wood sample was stained by acid fuchsin, from which two 5 -mg wood cross-sections (that adjoined the three 5 -mg wood cross-sections, mentioned above) were cut. Nematode-staining-spots (NSSs) in each of the two stained sections were counted under a microscope at 100 · magnification. If there were eight or more NSSs present, the adjoining three sections were used for PCR assays. The B. xylophilus – specific amplicon of 403 bp (DQ 855275) was generated by PCR assay from 100. 00 % of 5 -mg wood cross-sections that contained more than eight Bx NSSs by the PCR assay.

Distinction among several species of the <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematodes</b> species complex (PWNSC) is often difficult. Besides standard morphology, morphometrics and molecular biology, new tools are welcome to better understand this group. The computerized (or e-) key of this genus, presented in this communication, includes 74 species (complete list of valid species of the world fauna) and 35 characters, that were used by the taxonomic experts of this group, in the original descriptions. Morphology of sex organs (male spicules and female vulval region) was digitized and classified to distinguish alternative types. Several qualitative characters with overlapping character states (expressions) were transformed into the morphometric indices with the discontinuous ranges (characters of ratios of the spicule dimensions). Characters and their states (expressions) were illustrated in detail and supplied by brief user-friendly comments. E-key {{was created in the}} BIKEY identification system (Dianov & Lobanov, 1996 - 2004).

It may be useful in the detailed analysis of taxonomy and evolution of the genus and in its splitting to the species groups based on morphology. The verification of the dendrogram using the information on the species links with insect vectors and their associated plants, provided an opportunity to recognize the five clusters (xylophilus, hunti, eremus sensu stricto, tusciae and piniperdae sensu stricto), which seem to be the natural species groups.

The nematode- inoculated saplings showed ceased oleoresin exudation, discoloration of needles, and wilting 2, 4 - 6, and 8 - 10 weeks after inoculation, respectively. The mortality ratios of 1, 000 nematodes-inoculated saplings were 8 - 12 % irrespective to inoculation years and sites. The mortality ratio of 10, 000 nematodes-inoculated saplings on the lava terrace was 14 and 18 % in 1997 and 1998, respectively. But that at the nursery was estimated as 75 % in 1998. These {{results suggest that the}} saplings growing on the lava terrace in Sakurajima may not have the resistance to pine wilt disease inherently, but acquired it during the stages from germination to establishment as seedlings. The air temperature was 2 - 3 °C higher and the relative humidity was 10 - 30 % lower on the lava terrace than at the nursery at midday in August and September. However, the xylem pressure potential of the saplings on the lava terrace did not differ significantly from that at the nursery at midday in summer. The saplings on the lava terrace might acquire some mechanism that can reduce a stress from desiccation and increase vigor, resulting into a low mortality due to pine wilt disease. 鹿児島県桜島の溶岩台地上に生育するクロマツのマツ材 線虫病に対する抵抗性を明らかにするために, 1997 年と 1998 年に,鹿児島大学農学部付属演習林桜島溶岩実験場に生育するクロマツ幼樹と桜島溶岩実験場で採取した種子由来の本部実験苗畑に生育するクロマツ幼樹に強病原性マツノザイセンチュウ(島原系統) を 1 万頭と 1 千頭接種し,半年間にわたり針葉や樹脂滲出の異常と生存を追跡した。接種後 2 週間目には樹脂滲出異常が, 4 ～ 6 週間目には針葉の萎凋が,そして 8 ～ 10 週間目から枯死が認められた。 1 千頭接種個体の死亡率は,接種年やクロマツの生育場所にかかわらず, 8 ～ 12 %と低かった。 1 万頭接種個体の死亡率は,溶岩実験場に生育する個体では, 1997 年は 14 %, 1998 年は 18 %と低かったが,苗畑に生育する個体は 75 %と 高かった。 8 月から 9 月にかけては,苗畑に比べ溶岩台地 の方が,日中の気温は 2 ～ 3 ℃高く,湿度は 10 ～ 30 %低かっ た。しかし,クロマツの木部圧ポテンシャルには溶岩実験 場と苗畑で有意差は見られなかった。夏の日中に水分ストレスを強く受けると考えられる桜島の溶岩台地上に生育するクロマツは,遺伝的抵抗性を持ってはいないが,何らかの要因が働いて樹勢が増し,見かけ上抵抗性を有しているように見られると考えられた...|$|R

It has since then spread to other Asian countries such as China, Taiwan and Korea, causing serious losses and economic damage. In 1999, the PWN was first detected in the European Union (EU), in Portugal, and immmediately prompted several government (national and EU) actions to assess the extent of the nematode’s presence, and to contain B. xylophilus and its insect vector (Monochamus galloprovincialis) to an area with a 30 km radius in the Setúbal Peninsula, 20 km south of Lisbon. International wood trade, with its political as well as economic ramifications, has been seriously jeopardized. The origin of the population of PWN found in Portugal remains elusive.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the diversity of the bacterial community carried by B. xylophilus, isolated from different Pinus spp. with PWD in Nebraska, United States. The bacteria carried by PWN belonged to Gammaproteobacteria (79. 9 %), Betaproteobacteria (11. 7 %), Bacilli (5. 0 %), Alphaproteobacteria (1. 7 %) and Flavobacteriia (1. 7 %). Strains from the genera Chryseobacterium and Pigmentiphaga were found associated with the nematode for the first time. These results were compared to results from similar studies conducted from other countries of three continents in order to assess the diversity of bacteria with associated with PWN. The isolates from the United States, Portugal and China belonged to 25 different genera and only strains from the genus Pseudomonas were found in nematodes from all countries. The strains from China were closely related to P. fluorescens and the strains isolated from Portugal and USA were phylogenetically related to P. mohnii and P. lutea. Nematodes from the different countries are associated with bacteria of different species, not supporting a relationship between PWN with a particular bacterial species. Moreover, the diversity of the bacteria carried by the <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematode</b> seems to be relate...|$|E
40|$|Pine {{wilt disease}} (PWD) {{is one of}} the most serious {{problems}} in pine forests, and also one of the most serious biological invasion issues worldwide. The causal agent, the <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematode</b> (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is considered to have its center of origin in North America, where it has co-evolved for millions of years, and is in balance with the autochthonous pine species. The PWN was firstly described as the casual organism of PWD in 1971. Later, in 1980, a possible involvement of toxin producing-bacteria in association with B. xylophilus in PWD was hypothesized. Ever since, efforts have been made to unravel the role(s) of bacteria in PWD. Preliminary results show that bacteria associated with B. xylophilus can induce PWD, although the symptoms shown by the plant host are slightly different from those observed when the nematode is inoculated alone. These observations suggest that bacteria can act in a different pathway than the <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematode.</b> It has been hypothesized that toxin producing-bacteria can lower plant defense systems, thus helping nematode infection and proliferation in the plant host. If so, how, where and when do bacteria act? Which mechanisms are utilized? These questions remain unanswered. Still the role of bacteria in PWD seems to be evident. Interestingly, a solution for this disease can also involve the bacteria. The use of plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) is already known to be a useful tool in helping plant host overcome several biotic stresses, including pathogen attack. In this sense, bacteria may present a dual role in the complex system of the PWD...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematode</b> (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is {{a serious}} threat to forest {{ecosystems}} at a global scale. The nematode has become a major quarantine problem due to its capability to completely destroy Pinus spp. trees, with great damage to the wood industry. Controlling the nematode inside a living tree is quite difficult, the techniques used being often ineffective and quite expensive. In the coming years, most chemicals used to control nematodes will be banned and replaced by safer and environmentally friendly products. As so, chemicals naturally produced by plants will {{play an important role in}} controlling diseases such as pine wilt. Plants, particularly aromatic ones, are commonly used due to the chemical properties of their secondary metabolites. Among these, essential oils and/or extracts are highly employed and are being tested as possible control of some organisms, like nematodes. Recent publications have evaluated essential oils derived from different plant species as natural nematicides [1; 2], antibacterial [3], anti-fungal [4] as well as insecticidal [5]. Concerning control of the PWN, a significant amount of information on plants tested, results obtained and employed techniques, is available. Our revision has extensively gathered this information, making it easier to search, read and use. It may become useful information for future studies on the subject, since it will be possible to check the plants already tested. Although numbers aren´t definitive, so far, tested plants are distributed amongst 148 families. The extracts or essential oils of plants belonging to the Asteraceae, Lamiaceae and Euphorbiaceae families show promising results on controlling the <b>pinewood</b> <b>nematode...</b>|$|E
