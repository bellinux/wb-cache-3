40|$|Different {{analytical}} methods for computing the flux distribution on the focal plane of a paraboloidal solar concentrator are reviewed. An analytical solution in algebraic form is also derived for an idealized model. The effects resulting from using different assumptions {{in the definition}} of optical parameters used in these methodologies are compared and discussed in detail. These parameters include solar irradiance distribution (limb darkening and circumsolar), reflector surface specular spreading, surface slope error, and concentrator <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracy.</b> The type of computational method selected for use depends on the maturity of the design and the data available at the time the analysis is made...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a digital optical data transmission system is specified by {{the probability that the}} system erroneously decides a signal has or has not been transmitted. Two factors which induce signal fading and thereby decrease system performance are atmospheric scintillation and transmitter <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracy.</b> A channel simulator was developed that is capable of producing the effects of both atmospheric scintillation and the transmitter pointing problem for a neodymium-yag optical data transmission systems. Comparison of data taken from the modulated intensity of a beam having been transmitted through the channel simulator with experimental data from GEOS-B argon laser transmission through the atmosphere to a low earth-orbiting satellite indicates that the modulated signal intensity is log-normal to the degree of measured atmospheric scintillation...|$|E
40|$|Optical jitter {{can result}} in the beam <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracy</b> and poor optical system perfor-mance. With a {{correlated}} measurement of the disturbance, improved control performance can be achieved. In this research, an adaptive optimal sensing strategy for optical systems is proposed. When an array of reference sensors is available, an optimal set of reference sensors that are coupled to modes of interests can be selected. The weighted reference signal from the optimal sensor set is then used in an adaptive control design algorithm. An adaptive generalized predictive control design algorithm combined with the proposed adaptive optimal sensing strategy achieves better performance than the control system using {{only one of the}} reference sensors. The overall algorithm is also advantageous in the presence of time-varying or uncertain disturbances. The proposed technique is applied to an experimental test bed in which multiple accelerometer sensors measure the structural vibration of optical elements. Reduction of the structural vibration of optical components is attained using a fast steering mirror which results in a reduction of the corresponding jitter. Nomenclatur...|$|E
40|$|Spitzer {{observations}} of exoplanets routinely yield accuracies of {{better than one}} part in 10, 000. However, there remain {{a number of issues}} that limit the attainable precision, particularly for long duration observations. These include initial <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracies,</b> <b>pointing</b> wobble, initial target drift, long-term pointing drifts, and low and high frequency jitter. Coupled with small scale, intrapixel sensitivity variations, all of these pointing issues have the potential to produce significant, correlated photometric noise. We examine each of these issues in turn, discussing their suspected causes and consequences, and describing possible and planned mitigation techniques...|$|R

40|$|Using eye-gaze {{to create}} a usable “eye mouse ” {{has long been a}} goal of humancomputer {{interaction}} research. The appeal and advantages of eye-gaze can be summarised by the four main aspects of the modality: Firstly eye-gaze {{has the potential to be}} a very natural form of interaction, as people tend to look at the object they wish to interact with. Secondly the speed of eye-gaze to locate an object can be fast when compared to other devices such as head mice. Thirdly natural eye movements exhibit little detectable fatigue and could give near fatiguefree interaction. Finally, as eye-gaze control is retained in all but the most severe disabilities, it can be used as a computer control modality for people who may have no other usable method of computer interaction. 2 The Problems of Eye-Gaze There is, however, a problem with eye-gaze interaction: Most people who have used an eye mouse have failed to interact successfully with a computer. Users have found that they cannot point accurately at targets, they cannot accurately select the correct targets and they have found it difficult to manipulate the interface without getting into difficulties. These problems have, to date, inhibited the use of such a promising and potentially highly enabling technology. The <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracy</b> of eye mice is partially due to users moving their head during use and so degrading calibration, and partly due to the inherent tolerance of gaze due to the visual angle of the fovea in the eye. In this second case the width of the fovea, which gives clear vision, is approximately 1 ° visual arc, hence the ey...|$|E

40|$|Our study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the accuracy of a low-cost, paper-based 3 D printer by comparing a dry human mandible to its corresponding three-dimensional (3 D) model using a 3 D measuring arm. One dry human mandible and its corresponding printed model were evaluated. The model was produced using DICOM data from cone beam computed tomography. The data were imported into Maxilim software, wherein automatic segmentation was performed, and the STL file was saved. These data were subsequently analysed, repaired, cut and prepared for printing with netfabb software. These prepared data were {{used to create a}} paper-based model of a mandible with an MCor Matrix 300 printer. Seventy-six anatomical landmarks were chosen and measured 20 times on the mandible and the model using a MicroScribe G 2 X 3 D measuring arm. The distances between all the selected landmarks were measured and compared. Only landmarks with a <b>point</b> <b>inaccuracy</b> less than 30 % were used in further analyses. The mean absolute difference for the selected 2016 measurements was 0. 36  ±  0. 29  mm. The mean relative difference was 1. 87  ±  3. 14 %; however, the measurement length significantly influenced the relative difference. The accuracy of the 3 D model printed using the paper-based, low-cost 3 D Matrix 300 printer was acceptable. The average error was no greater than that measured with other types of 3 D printers. The mean relative difference should not be considered the best way to compare studies. The <b>point</b> <b>inaccuracy</b> methodology proposed in this study may be helpful in future studies concerned with evaluating the accuracy of 3 D rapid prototyping models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In formal verification, {{reliable}} {{results are}} of utmost importance. In model checking of digital systems, mainly incorrect implementations {{of the model}} checking algorithms due to logical errors {{are the source of}} wrong results. In probabilistic model checking, however, numerical instabilities are an additional source for inconsistent results. We motivate our investigations with an example, for which several state-of-the-art probabilistic model checking tools give completely wrong results due to inexact computations. We then analyze, at which <b>points</b> <b>inaccuracies</b> are introduced during the model checking process. We discuss first ideas how, in spite of these inaccuracies, reliable results can be obtained or at least the user be warned about potential correctness problems: (1) usage of exact (rational) arithmetic, (2) usage of interval arithmetic to obtain safe approximations of the actual probabilities, (3) provision of certificates which testify that the result is correct, and (4) integration of a “degree of belief ” for each sub-formula into existing model checking tools.

40|$|The solar {{concentrator}} design concept provides a theoretical concentration efficiency of 96 percent with power-to-weight ratios {{as high as}} 50 W/kg. Further, it {{eliminates the need for}} fragile reflective coatings and is very tolerant to <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracies.</b> The concept differs from conventional reflective mirrors and lens design in that is uses the principle of total internal reflection in order to funnel incident sunlight into a concentrator photovoltaic cell. The feasibility of the light funnel concentrator concept was determined through a balanced approach of analysis, development, and fabrication of prototypes, and testing of components. A three-dimensional optical model of the light funnel concentrator and photovoltaic cell was developed in order to assess the ultimate performance of such systems. In addition, a thermal and structural analysis of a typical unit was made. Techniques of fabricating the light funnel cones, optically coupling them to GaAs concentrator cells, bonding the funnels to GaAs cells, making electrical interconnects, and bonding substrates was explored and a prototype light funnel concentrator unit was fabricated and tested. Testing of the system included measurements of optical concentrating efficiency, optical concentrator to cell coupling efficiency, and electrical efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{distinction}} of attributive and predicative adjectives in contemporary Czech. Although this distinction {{is very important for}} defining adjectives as a word class in many languages, there was only little attention paid to it in Czech so far. This thesis is {{based on the work of}} František Čermák Lexikon a sémantika (2010). It is strongly inspired by english tradition of linguistics, which is also a reason, why he introduces a new term predicative adjectives in Czech. The thesis is divided into two parts.

It is based on information contained in czech and foreign grammarbooks, handbooks or research papers. The goal is to summarize these separate information. The theoretical part {{deals with the}} basic characteristic of both types of adjectives, it focuses also on description of their semantics, word form and valency, which depends on it.

40|$|Bearings {{generate}} disturbances that, {{when combined}} with structural gains of a momentum wheel, contribute to induced vibration in the wheel. The frequencies generated by a ball bearing are defined by the bearing's geometry and defects. The amplitudes at these frequencies are dependent upon the actual geometry variations from perfection; therefore, a geometrically perfect bearing will produce no amplitudes at the kinematic frequencies that the design generates. Because perfect geometry can only be approached, emitted vibrations do occur. The most significant vibration is at the spin frequency and can be balanced out in the build process. Other frequencies' amplitudes, however, cannot be balanced out. Momentum wheels are usually the single largest source of vibrations in a spacecraft and can contribute to <b>pointing</b> <b>inaccuracies</b> if emitted vibrations ring the structure or are in the high-gain bandwidth of a sensitive pointing control loop. It is therefore important {{to be able to}} provide an a priori knowledge of possible amplitudes that are singular in source or are a result of interacting defects that do not reveal themselves in normal frequency prediction equations. This paper will describe the computer model that provides for the incorporation of bearing geometry errors and then develops an estimation of actual amplitudes and frequencies. Test results were correlated with the model. A momentum wheel was producing an unacceptable 74 Hz amplitude. The model was used to simulate geometry errors and proved successful in identifying a cause that was verified when the parts were inspected...|$|R
