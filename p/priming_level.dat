40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{individual differences in}} Absorption and fantasy, {{as well as in}} Achiievement and achievement striving as possible moderators of the perceptual closure effect found by Snodgrass and Feenan (1990). The study also examined whether different instructions (experiential versus instrumental) interact with the personality variables to moderate the relationship between priming and subsequent performance on a picture completion task. 1 28 participants completed two sessions, one to fill out the MPQ and NEO personality inventories and the other to complete the experimental task. The experimental task consisted of a priming phase and a test phase, with pictures presented on a computer screen for both phases. Participants were shown 30 pictures in the priming phase, and then shovm the 30 primed pictures along with 30 new pictures for the test phase. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the two different instruction sets for the task. Two measures of performance were calculated, most fragmented measure and threshold. Results of the present study confirm that a five-second exposure time is long enough to produce the perceptual closure effect. The analysis of the two-way interaction effects indicated a significant quadratic interaction of Absorption with <b>priming</b> <b>level</b> on threshold performance. The results were in the opposite direction of predictions. Possible explanations for the Absorption results include lack of optimal conditions, lack of intrinsic motivation and measurement problems. Primary analyses also revealed two significant between-subject effects of fantasy and achievement striving on performance collapsed across priming levels. These results suggest that fantasy has a beneficial effect on performance at test for pictures primed at all levels, whereas achievement striving seems to have an adverse effect on performance at test for pictures primed at all levels. Results of the secondary analyses with a revised threshold performance measure indicated a significant quadratic interaction of Absorption, condition and <b>priming</b> <b>level.</b> In the experiential condition, test performance, based on Absorption scores for pictures primed at level 4, showed a positive slope and performance for pictures primed at levels 1 and 7 based on Absorption showed a negative slope. The reverse effect was found in the instrumental condition. The results suggest that Absorption, in combination with experiential involvement, may affect implicit memory. A second significant result of the secondary analyses was a linear three-way interaction of Achievement, condition and <b>priming</b> <b>level</b> on performance. Results suggest that as Achievement scores increased, test performance improved for less fragmented primed pictures in the instrumental condition and test performance improved for more highly fragmented primes in the experiential condition. Results from the secondary analyses suggest that the revised threshold measure may be more sensitive to individual differences. Results of the exploratory analyses with Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness and agentic positive emotionality (PEM-A) measures indicated no significant effects of any of these personality variables. Results suggest that facets of the scales may be more useful with regard to perceptual research, and that future research should examine narrowly focused personality traits as opposed to broader constructs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess performance of Alzheimer's (AD) and Multi-infarct (MID) demented patients on the explicit and implicit versions of two memory tasks, namely Word-Stem Completion and Word-Pair Learning. Consistently with previous studies, the AD patients were deficient on the explicit and implicit versions of both tasks. In MID patients, a dissociation emerged between normal implicit and deficient explicit Word-Stem Completion. Two multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate patients' ability on measures of lexical-semantic competence, explicit memory, and global intellective efficiency in predicting level of repetition priming. The results demonstrate a close association between explicit and implicit memory performance in AD patients but no relation between repetition <b>priming</b> <b>level</b> and measures of lexical-semantic competence or general intelligence. Overall, {{the results of the present}} study do not support previous conceptualizations suggesting that a breakdown in the structure of semantic memory is at the root of deficient priming in demented patients. Alternative interpretations of the deficient repetition priming effect in dementia, based on a common mechanism underlying conscious and unconscious retrieval deficits, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{studies have}} shown {{positive}} associations among sustained and intense inflammatory responses and the incidence of bacterial infections. Patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) {{and high levels of}} proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β), and IL- 6, have increased risk for developing nosocomial infections attributable to organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp., compared to those patients with lower levels. Our previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that these bacterial strains exhibit enhanced growth extracellularly when supplemented with high concentrations of pure recombinant TNF-α, IL- 1 β, or IL- 6. In addition, we have shown that the intracellular milieu of phagocytic cells that are exposed to supraoptimal concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) favors survival and replication of ingested bacteria. Therefore, we hypothesized that under conditions of intense inflammation the host's micromilieu favors bacterial infections by exposing phagocytic cells to protracted high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Our clinical {{studies have shown}} that methylprednisolone is capable of reducing the levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 in ARDS patients. Hence, we designed a series of in vitro experiments to test whether human monocytic cells (U 937 cells) that are activated with high concentrations of LPS, which upregulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines from these phagocytic cells, would effectively kill or restrict bacterial survival and replication after exposure to methylprednisolone. Fresh isolates of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter were used in our studies. Our results indicate that, compared with the control, stimulation of U 937 cells with 100 -ng/ml, 1. 0 -μg/ml, 5. 0 -μg/ml, or 10. 0 -μg/ml concentrations of LPS enhanced the intracellular survival and replication of all three species of bacteria significantly (for all, P = 0. 0001). Stimulation with ≤ 10. 0 ng of LPS generally resulted in efficient killing of the ingested bacteria. Interestingly, when exposed to graded concentrations of methylprednisolone, U 937 cells that had been stimulated with 10. 0 μg of LPS were able to suppress bacterial replication efficiently in a concentration-dependent manner. Significant reduction in numbers of CFU was observed at ≥ 150 μg of methylprednisolone per ml (P values were 0. 032, 0. 008, and 0. 009 for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, respectively). We have also shown that steady-state mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 in LPS-activated cells were reduced by treatment of such cells with methylprednisolone, in a concentration-dependent manner. The effective dose of methylprednisolone was 175 mg, a value that appeared to be independent of <b>priming</b> <b>level</b> of LPS and type of mRNA. We therefore postulate that a U-shaped relationship exists between the level of expression of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 within the phagocytic cells and their abilities to suppress active survival and replication of phagocytized bacteria...|$|E
