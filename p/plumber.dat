40|$|OBJECTIVES: A cross {{sectional}} study was undertaken to assess lung health among <b>plumbers</b> and pipefitters. Respiratory symptoms, lung function, and radiographic changes among 99 actively employed <b>plumbers</b> and pipefitters with > or = 20 years of union membership {{were compared with}} 100 telephone workers. METHODS: A respiratory symptom questionnaire was administered, including smoking and occupational histories. Spirometry was conducted according to standard criteria. Posteroanterior chest radiographs were evaluated by two experienced chest physicians, with a third arbitrating disagreed films. Members of the union were categorised as pipefitters (n = 57), <b>plumbers</b> (n = 16), or welders (n = 26), based on longest service, and compared with the telephone workers and internally (between groups). Lung health was also compared with employment in several work sectors common to Alberta for time, and for time weighted by exposure to dust and fumes. RESULTS: Compared with the telephone workers, <b>plumbers</b> and pipefitters had more cough and phlegm, lower forced vital capacity, and more radiographic changes (20 % with any change), including circumscribed (10 %) and diffuse pleural thickening (9 %). None of the <b>plumbers</b> and pipefitters had small radiographic opacities. Among the three subgroups of workers, <b>plumbers</b> had the highest prevalence of radiographic changes. Both <b>plumbers</b> and pipefitters showed higher odds ratios for cough and phlegm than the welders. No differences between groups were found for lung function. Indicators of lung health were not related to work in any sector. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Plumbers</b> and pipefitters had increased prevalence of symptoms suggestive of an irritant effect with no evidence of bronchial responsiveness. The chest radiographs showed evidence of asbestos exposure, especially in the <b>plumbers,</b> but at lower levels than previously reported. Health screening programmes for these workers should be considered, although the logistical problems associated with screening in this group would be considerable...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a <b>plumber</b> called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E
