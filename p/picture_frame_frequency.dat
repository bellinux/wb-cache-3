50|$|A {{frame is}} the total <b>picture.</b> The <b>frame</b> rate {{is the number of}} {{pictures}} displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice interleaving odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So field rate is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 405 lines (or 202.5 lines in a field.) So line rate (line frequency) is 405 times the <b>frame</b> <b>frequency</b> or 405•25=10125 Hz.|$|R
50|$|The <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> {{may contain}} a pane of <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> glass or an acrylic glass {{substitute}} such as acrylite or plexiglas {{to protect the}} picture. In some instances where the art in the frame is dispensable or durable, no protection may be necessary. Glass is common over watercolors and other artwork on paper, but rare over oil paintings, except very valuable ones in some museums. <b>Picture</b> <b>framing</b> glass may be treated with anti-reflective coatings to make the glass virtually invisible under certain lighting conditions. When a <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> {{is expected to be}} exposed to direct sunlight, or harsh lighting conditions such as fluorescent lights, UV filtering may be added to slow down the photocatalytic degradation of organic materials behind <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> glass.|$|R

2500|$|Series 5 saw the <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> {{being used}} {{less than in}} {{previous}} series and in addition, there were attempts to implement numerous tricks with the <b>picture</b> <b>frame,</b> including firing gunge and pushing out small objects like bouquets of flowers. e.g. when Huw Edwards was in the <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> he said [...] "News just in, this just out" [...] before the person operating the mouth hosed gunge out of his mouth.|$|R
25|$|Diasec is {{a process}} which uses acrylic glass as a {{substitute}} for normal glass in <b>picture</b> <b>frames.</b> This is done for its relatively low cost, light weight, shatter-resistance, aesthetics and because it can be ordered in larger sizes than standard <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> glass.|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> industry, {{a fillet}} (also {{referred}} to as a slip) is a small piece of moulding which fits inside a larger frame or, typically, underneath or in between matting, used for decorative purposes. The <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> term is probably related to, though not necessarily derived from, the engineering term, which it is frequently pronounced similarly to; however, unlike the use of fillets in mechanical engineering, the use of [...] "fillets" [...] in <b>picture</b> <b>frames</b> is wholly decorative.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Picture</b> <b>frames</b> have {{traditionally}} been made of wood, which {{is still the most}} common material, although other materials are used including silver, bronze, aluminum, and plastics such as polystyrene. A <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> may be of any color or texture, but gilding is common, especially on older wooden <b>frames.</b> Some <b>picture</b> <b>frames</b> have elaborate molding which may relate to the subject matter. Complicated older frames are often made of moulded and gilded plaster over a plain wood base. <b>Picture</b> <b>frames</b> {{come in a variety of}} profiles, but generally the lengths of moulding feature a [...] "lip" [...] and rabbet, the function of which is to allow a space to hold in the materials in the frame. The lip extends usually about a quarter of an inch past the edge of the rabbet.|$|R
