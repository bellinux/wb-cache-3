5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to <b>propeller</b> <b>speed,</b> which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{designers}} {{finally settled}} on an 'H' layout with two crankshafts and 'blade and fork' connecting rod attachments, the crankshafts being connected through the <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> reduction unit. The new engine followed {{the layout of}} the Napier Sabre and similarly used sleeve valves but with a simplified drive system.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E

500|$|The {{engine room}} on a bulker is usually near the stern, under the superstructure. Larger bulkers, from Handymax up, {{usually have a}} single {{two-stroke}} low-speed crosshead diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and/or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft. On the smaller bulkers, one or two four-stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable-pitch propeller via a reduction gearbox, which may also incorporate an output for an alternator. The average design ship speed for bulkers of Handysize and above is [...] The <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> is relatively low, at about 90 revolutions per minute, although {{it depends on the}} size of the propeller.|$|E
500|$|Turbo-electric transmission, {{which had}} been used in the prior class, was {{retained}} here. Advantages included the ability for the turbines to run at optimum speed without regard to <b>propeller</b> <b>speed,</b> which led to greater fuel economy and range, and an easier sub-division of machinery, which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. Each of the four propeller shafts was powered by a 5,424 kilowatt electric motor, fed by two two-phase turbo generators (General Electric for Maryland, Westinghouse for Colorado and West Virginia) rated at 5,000 volts). Eight oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers, each in its individual compartment, provided steam for the generators. Altogether, the ships' power plant was rated at 28,900 electrical horsepower (EHP) to provide a flank speed of [...] With a maximum bunker capacity of 4570 tons, the Colorados range without refueling at sea was [...]|$|E
2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{providing}} {{fuel to the}} engine, the fuel system {{is also used to}} control <b>propeller</b> <b>speeds,</b> compressor airflow and cool lubrication oil.

2500|$|While the Tiara series were {{basically}} traditional boxer engines, {{they did have}} some unique features.

2500|$|The DA36 E-Star, an {{aircraft}} designed by Siemens, Diamond Aircraft and EADS, employs a series hybrid powertrain with the propeller being turned by a Siemens [...] electric motor. The {{aim is to}} reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25 percent. An onboard [...] Austro Engines Wankel rotary engine and generator provides the electricity. A <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> reduction unit is eliminated. The electric motor uses electricity stored in batteries, with the generator engine off, to take off and climb reducing sound emissions. The series-hybrid powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the weight of the plane by 100kg compared with its predecessor. The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first ever flight of a series-hybrid powertrain.

50|$|Centurion series {{engines are}} always fitted with {{constant}} <b>speed</b> <b>propellers</b> which allow {{the engine to}} be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox.

2500|$|Development {{of the new}} 20 litre {{engine was}} led by Henry Royce {{from his home in}} Kent. Based {{initially}} on the 7.4 litre 40/50 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost engine, and drawing also on the design of a 7.2 litre Daimler DF80 aero engine used in a 1913 Grand Prix Mercedes that had been acquired, the power was increased by doubling the number of cylinders to twelve and increasing their stroke to 6.5inches, although their bore remained at 4.5inches of the 40/50. The engine was also run faster, and an epicyclic reduction gear was designed to keep the <b>propeller</b> <b>speed</b> below 1,100 rpm.
