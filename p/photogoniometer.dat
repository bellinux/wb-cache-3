40|$|Evaluation {{of solar}} heat gain and {{daylight}} distribution through complex window and shading systems requires {{the determination of the}} bi-directional transmission distribution function (BTDF). Measurement of BTDF can be time-consuming, and inaccuracies are likely because of physical constraints and experimental adjustments. A general calculation methodology, based on more easily measurable component properties, would be preferable and would allow much more flexibility. In this paper, measurements and calculations are compared for the specific case of prismatic daylight-redirecting panels. Measurements were performed in a <b>photogoniometer</b> equipped with a digital-imaging detection system. A virtual copy of the <b>photogoniometer</b> was then constructed with commercial ray-tracing software. For the first time, an attempt is made to validate detailed bi-directional properties for a complex system by comparing an extensive set of experimental BTDF data with ray-tracing calculations. The results generally agree under a range of input and output angles to a degree adequate for evaluation of glazing systems. An analysis is presented to show that the simultaneously measured diffuse and direct components of light transmitted by the panel are properly represented. Calculations were also performed using a more realistic model of the source and ideal model of the detector. Deviations from the <b>photogoniometer</b> model were small and the results were similar in form. Despite the lack of an absolute measurement standard, the good agreement in results promotes confidence in both the <b>photogoniometer</b> and in the calculation method...|$|E
40|$|Many {{daylighting}} applications {{require a}} precise {{knowledge of the}} directional transmission features of advanced fenestration materials. These photometric properties are described by a bi-directional transmission distribution function (BTDF), whose experimental assessment requires an appropriate equipment. A novel bi-directional <b>photogoniometer,</b> based on digital imaging techniques, has been designed and developed for that purpose. The main advantages of this device are the significant reduction of the time required for data measurement and its capability to assess an almost continuous BTDF function. These features can be achieved only through detailed and accurate calibration procedures of the bi-directional <b>photogoniometer,</b> which are described in this paper, together with digital image and data processing. Several experimental results, obtained for different fenestration materials, are used to illustrate the capabilities of this novel equipment...|$|E
40|$|Most {{energy-saving}} {{applications of}} advanced fenestration systems, e. g. solar blinds, novel types of glazing and daylight redirecting devices, require a precise {{knowledge of their}} directional light transmission features. These photometric properties are described by a Bi-directional Transmission Distribution Function (BTDF), which is experimentally assessed by a bi-directional <b>photogoniometer.</b> As such a function represents a heavy amount of data, {{there is a need}} for a synthetic and intuitive visualization of a system’s transmission behaviour. For this purpose, four kinds of graphical representations have been created, and are presented in this paper. They are based on bi-directional data assessed by a novel digital imaging-based <b>photogoniometer,</b> whose measurement principle allows a continuous knowledge of the whole transmission space, and therefore an appreciable liberty in data processing. The geometric properties of the different representations are described, together with the corresponding image operations. The information extraction from these graphical visualizations is given through a comparison example between a conventional venetian blind and an optimized prototype...|$|E
40|$|Shade-screens {{are widely}} used in {{commercial}} buildings {{as a way to}} limit the amount of direct sunlight that can disturb people in the building. The shade screens also reduce the solar heat-gain through glazing the system. Modern energy and daylighting analysis software such as EnergyPlus and Radiance require complete scattering properties of the scattering materials in the system. In this paper a shade screen used in the LBNL daylighting testbed is characterized using a <b>photogoniometer</b> and a normal angle of incidence integrating sphere. The data is used to create a complete bi-directional scattering distribution function (BSDF) {{that can be used in}} simulation programs. The resulting BSDF is compared to a model BADFs, both directly and by calculating the solar heat-gain coefficient for a dual pane system using Window 6...|$|E
40|$|Bi-directional Transmission (or Reflection) Distribution Functions, {{commonly}} named BTDFs (and BRDFs), {{are essential}} quantities to describe any complex fenestration system in details. They {{are defined as}} {{the ratio of the}} luminance diffused from a surface element in a given direction (after transmission or reflection), and the illuminance incident on the sample. However, these functions are capable of describing the regular (specular) as well as the diffuse components of emerging light, and their mutual knowledge is necessary to assess a glazing or shading system’s optical performances properly. Although the analytical expression of a BT(R) DF differs whether it is related to regular (specular) or diffuse light, a simultaneous assessment of the two components can be achieved under certain conditions, presented in this paper. They are thereafter analyzed for the particular data acquisition procedure developed for a novel type of bi-directional <b>photogoniometer,</b> based on digital imaging...|$|E

These photometric properties can be described by a Bi-directional Transmission Distribution Function (BTDF) whose experimental assessment requires appropriate equipment. A novel bi-directional transmission <b>photogoniometer,</b> based on digital imaging techniques, was designed and set up for that purpose. The apparatus takes advantage of a modern video image capturing device (CCD digital camera) {{as well as of}} powerful image analysis software (pattern recognition) to considerably reduce the scanning time of a BTDF measurement, in comparison to existing devices that use a conventional approach (mobile photometer). A detailed calibration and validation procedure was used to obtain optimal experimental accuracy for the device during the assessment of BTDF data. It included a spectral, a photometric and a geometrical calibration of the digital video system, as well as several additional corrections, leading to an overall relative accuracy better than 11 % for BTD...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{evaluation of}} daylight distribution through advanced fenestration systems (complex glazing, solar shading systems) requires {{the knowledge of}} their Bi-directional light Transmission Distribution Function (BTDF). An innovative equipment for the experimental assessment of these bi-directional functions has been developed, based on a digital imaging detection system. An extensive set of BTDF measurements was performed with this <b>photogoniometer</b> on venetian blinds presenting curved slats with a mirror coating on the upper side. In this paper, the measured data are compared with ray-tracing results achieved with a virtual copy of the device, that was constructed with a commercial ray-tracing software. The model of the blind was created by implementing the measured reflection properties of the slats coatings in the ray-tracing calculations. These comparisons represent an original and objective validation methodology for detailed bi-directional properties for a complex system; the good agreement between the two methods, yet presenting very different parameters and assessment methodologies, places reliance both on the digital-imaging detection system and calibration, and on the potentiality of a flexible calculation method combining ray-tracing simulations with simple components measurements...|$|E
40|$|Big mirrors {{are used}} in Concentrating Solar Power to {{concentrate}} sunlight onto an absorber where the produced heat drives an ordinary steam turbine cycle and electricity is generated. New mirror materials currently entering the market exhibit a higher microscopic surface roughness than the conventional glass mirrors, which causes {{a fraction of the}} reflected light to scatter away from the specular direction and occasionally miss the absorber. In order to quantify the amount that can contribute to the power generation process, the knowledge about the scatter distribution above the mirror is indispensable. In this diploma thesis I show how the roughness of a mirror affects the reflected light to scatter by reducing the surface profile to a minimum set of 2 statistical parameters, namely the root mean square roughness Rq and the auto correlation length T. A quantum mechanical approach yields an expression of the scatter distribution in terms of Rq and T. Around the specular peak the estimation shows good agreement with measurements carried out externally using a goniometer. In order to provide the ability of measuring the scatter distribution directly, a complete design of a new <b>photogoniometer,</b> the Mirror Reflectance Analyzer (MIRA) is devised. When assembled it will facilitate measuring the distribution in the entire 2 hemisphere with a nominal resolution of 1. 3 msr (1. 3 mrad per angular direction) in the order of seconds where usual goniometers need hours...|$|E
