40|$|ABSTRACT: Nowadays all {{educational}} {{authorities in}} Europe are {{making an effort}} to teach foreign languages starting at very early ages. Teachers of English at nursery and <b>pre-school</b> <b>levels</b> used to produce their own materials, although {{in the last few years}} we have seen a flourishing amount of teaching methods and materials for young learners issued by every well-known publishing house. With this panorama in mind, the difficulty of the teacher’s task has changed from one side to the other, as some times it is not easy to decide which books children should or shouldn’t buy. Taking this need into consideration, in this paper we intend to study all the elements involved in the assessment of course books and supplementary materials for young learners and provide examples of evaluation templates. The analysis includes the physical format of coursebooks, the components of the methods the authors, their adequacy in terms of Ministry of Education requirements, and then, the contents taught with the underlying pedagogy. There are other elements such as audiovisual aids and educational software, also taken into consideration...|$|R

40|$|Background Pre-school {{and primary}} school {{teachers}} are {{directly involved in}} the education of children. In addition to teachers’ competences, the quality of their work is significantly influenced by their psychological well-being. It is therefore important to focus on their well-being as well as on personality traits they have. The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between life satisfaction, happiness, optimism and personality traits of pre-school and primary school teachers in Croatia. Participants and procedure The study was conducted on a sample of 103 pre-school teachers and 117 primary school teachers who completed self-evaluated scales on personality traits, life satisfaction, happiness and optimism. Results The results demonstrated high levels of all personality traits in both samples. High levels of life satisfaction were positively associated with happiness and optimism. Personality traits were also positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness and optimism. There were no differences in life satisfaction, happiness, optimism or personality traits between pre-school and primary school teachers, except for openness to experience being higher in pre-school teachers. Emotional stability was a significant predictor of teachers’ well-being. Conclusions The results have significant implications for improvement of teaching practice at primary school and <b>pre-school</b> <b>levels.</b> The findings highlight the importance of teachers’ personality traits and their well-being for the quality of their work with children...|$|R
