Transport {{of chemicals}} through the wall <b>of</b> a <b>hose</b> occurs {{in the same manner}} as through gloves and chemical suits, driven by the chemical concentration gradient, but for air-supply hoses the chemical evaporating inside the air-supply hose is inhaled. A simple method based on the mathematical equivalence <b>of</b> filling a <b>hose</b> with a chemical to immersing it in a chemical has been developed. The method requires a short section <b>of</b> <b>hose</b> to be filled, plugged and weighed at intervals to determine the breakthrough time and permeation rate per meter.
