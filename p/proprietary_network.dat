500|$|An initial {{version of}} ADS, with a {{database}} consisting of 40 papers, was {{created as a}} proof of concept in 1988, and the ADS database was successfully connected with the SIMBAD database {{in the summer of}} 1993. [...] The creators believed this was [...] the first use of the Internet to allow simultaneous querying of transatlantic scientific databases. [...] Until 1994, the service was available via <b>proprietary</b> <b>network</b> software, but it was transferred to the nascent World Wide Web early that year. [...] The number of users of the service quadrupled in the five weeks following the introduction of the ADS web-based service.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the cooperatives, independently owned and operated for-profit companies built their own <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks</b> including Teleflora and 1-800-Flowers with their BloomNet division.|$|R
30|$|In {{line with}} this, and {{to account for}} the {{variability}} and requirements of the emerging care environment, the architecture allows incorporation of other systems, such as closed or <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks,</b> wireless and body sensor networks and other systems that manage device and resource constraints in specific operating environments. This, of course, requires gateway components to export data outside the subnet’s environment (see Figure 1). Closed or <b>proprietary</b> sensor <b>networks</b> usually provide this gateway functionality[32].|$|R

This was {{a departure from the}} repository-and-sandbox model because it enabled the early management of artifacts (that is, before they are checked in) and was not limited to the management of these first-order configuration items.|$|R
50|$|Several manufacturers, {{including}} Simrad, Raymarine, Stowe, and Mastervolt, {{have their}} own <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks</b> that are compatible with or akin to NMEA 2000. Simrad's is called SimNet, and Raymarine's is called SeaTalk NG. Stowe's is called Dataline 2000. Some of these, such as SimNet and Seatalk NG, are a standard NMEA 2000 network but use non-standard connectors and cabling; adapters are available to convert to standard NMEA 2000 connectors, or the user can simply remove the connector and make a direct connection.|$|R
40|$|Process control systems, {{with their}} {{reliance}} on <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks</b> and hardware, {{have long been}} considered immune to the network attacks that have wrecked so much havoc on corporate information systems. Unfortunately, new research indicates this complacency is misplaced – the move to open standards such as Ethernet, TCP/IP and web technologies has let hackers {{take advantage of the}} process industries ignorance.

40|$|There {{have been}} several {{comments}} that criticize auction rules that prevent the two major low-frequency incumbents from winning all of the newly available spectrum and incorporating it into their <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks.</b> Such rules include new-entrant set-asides, new-entrant bidding credits, and the open access plan. We disagree with these criticisms and argue that given the current market structure, such rules are likely to improve welfare and auction revenues. We are submitting this report to provide sound economic analysis of these claims. Auctions, spectrum auctions, market design...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{discovering}} <b>network</b> topology in <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks.</b> Namely, we investigate topology discovery in Cisco-based networks. Cisco devices run Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) which holds information about these devices. We first compare properties of topologies that can be obtained from networks deploying CDP versus Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Management Information Base (MIB) Forwarding Database (FDB). Then we describe a method of discovering topology of CDP-based networks. Our experiments show that the physical topology of the network including links that are in Forwarding Block state can be discovered...|$|R
50|$|The United States is {{vulnerable}} to Information Warfare attacks because our economic, social, military, and commercial infrastructures demand timely and accurate as well as reliable information services. This vulnerability {{is complicated by the}} dependence of our DoD information systems on commercial or <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks</b> which are readily accessed by both users and adversaries. The identification of the critical paths and key vulnerabilities within the information infrastructure is an enormous task. Recent advances in information technology have made information systems easier to use, less expensive, and more available to a wide spectrum of potential adversaries.|$|R

50|$|As CEO of Sun, Schwartz {{was known}} as one of the few Fortune 500 CEO's to use a blog for public communications. He was {{recognized}} for his efforts to bring greater transparency into the corporate world, and managed a public exchange with SEC Chairman Christopher Cox about the use of websites and blogs for the dissemination of financial information to meet Regulation Fair Disclosure. Schwartz generally believed the internet, and Sun's web presence on it, was a far more fair and efficient vehicle for the dissemination of Sun's financial information—as opposed to the expensive, and <b>proprietary</b> <b>networks</b> fostered by ratings agencies and the Wall Street Journal.|$|R
