50|$|<b>Press-in</b> studs are {{installed}} {{from the back}} side of the disk or drum hub and may require removal of the hub from the vehicle for installation or removal. They consist of a threaded portion and a larger diameter section, called the knurl, that is splined to prevent rotation. The diameter of the knurl is larger than the hole in the hub requiring a press fit to seat the stud. The stud is prevented from being pulled through the hub by a larger diameter stop on the end.|$|E

The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, <b>press-in</b> termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|E
50|$|Specialty {{equipment}} which installs piles using {{hydraulic rams}} to press piles into the ground. This system is preferred where vibration is a concern. There are press attachments that can adapt to conventional pile driving rigs to press 2 pairs of sheet piles at a time. Additional types of press equipment sit {{on top of}} existing sheet piles and grip onto previously driven piles. This system allows for greater <b>press-in</b> and extraction force to be used since more reaction force is developed. The reaction based machines operate at only 69 dB at 23 ft allowing for installation and extraction of piles in very close proximity to noise and vibration sensitive areas where traditional methods may threaten the stability of existing structures.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cylinder}} heads were another fundamental {{change of the}} Magnum engine, being designed to meet stricter requirements in both power and emissions by increasing efficiency. These heads were cast iron units with new wedge-shaped combustion chambers and high-swirl valve shrouding. Combustion chamber design was most important in these new heads: LA engine {{cylinder heads}} were given a full-relief open-chamber design, but the Magnum was engineered with a double-quench closed-chamber type. The higher-flowing intake ports stepped up intake flow dramatically {{in comparison to the}} original LA heads, and the exhaust ports improved cylinder evacuation as well. The shape and porting of the chambers allowed for more complete atomization of the air/fuel mixture, as well as contributing to more complete combustion; these virtues allowed for much greater efficiency of the engine as a whole. The intake and exhaust valves were located at the top of each combustion chamber. The valves themselves had shorter, 5/16" [...] diameter stems, to allow for the more aggressive camshaft. Intake valves had a port diameter of 1.92", while exhaust valves were 1.65". with 60cc combustion chambers. Spark plugs were located {{at the peak of the}} combustion chambers' wedge, between the exhaust ports; <b>press-in</b> heat shields protected them from the heat of the exhaust manifolds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the <b>press-in</b> method, <b>press-in</b> {{machines}} use static jacking {{force to}} install prefabricated piles, while gaining a reaction force by grasping {{several of the}} previously installed piles. The emergence of this piling technique in 1975 solved problems in urban piling construction such as noise and vibration associated with the piling work, restricted construction conditions due to the existing structures, and so on. Among a variety of <b>press-in</b> methods, rotary <b>press-in</b> {{is a relatively new}} technique to install tubular piles into hard ground by applying axial and rotational jacking force at the same time.

40|$|<b>Press-in</b> Piling {{technology}} has been introduced to solve the challenges faced by piling contractors during pile driving operation in soft soil. <b>Press-in</b> Piling machine, so called the “Silent Piler” operates based on reaction principle where the machine grips on previous installed piles during piling operation. This allows the <b>press-in</b> machine to work and travel firmly along the pile top, eliminating the risk of machine overturning due to soft machine base. In 1982, Giken Reaction Base (GRB) System has been introduced, allowing more supporting machineries such as the “Power Pack” of Silent Piler, the „Clamp Crane‟ and the „Pile Runner‟ to sit firmly and work on top of installed piles. With such arrangement of equipment, the entire piling procedures such as pile transportation, pile pitching and <b>press-in</b> piling work can be synchronized systematically. This changes the construction approach, making non-staging piling work possible in sensitive areas, difficult slope embankment, soft soil and marine condition, resulting in faster, easier and safer construction...|$|E

This technique permits the installation of, for example, bridge foundations, with minimal temporary works. By using static jacking force alone, environmental disturbance through noise and vibration is minimized. Since the <b>press-in</b> method provides a measurement of jacking resistance during installation, this value {{can be used to}} estimate the long-term capacity of the completed foundation.

40|$|Compression wood is {{commonly}} found in Masson pine. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the cell wall of Masson pine compression and opposite wood, nanoindentation was used. The {{results showed that the}} average values of hardness and cell wall modulus of elasticity of opposite wood were slightly higher than those of compression wood. With increasing age of the annual ring, the modulus of elasticity showed a negative correlation with microfibril angle, but a weak correlation was observed for hardness. In opposite and compression wood from the same annual ring, the differences in average values of modulus of elasticity and hardness were small. These slight differences were explained by the change of microfibril angle (MFA), the <b>press-in</b> mode of nanoindentation, and the special structure of compression wood. The mechanical properties were almost the same for early, transition, and late wood in a mature annual ring of opposite wood.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the determination of the real parameters of the cross-sectional values of sheet piling walls made of U-profile piles (moment of inertia and section modulus) and their drivability with regard to interaction of piles through soil. Among the main factors which influence this are the soil friction in the interlocks and the transmission of longitudinal shear forces in the interlocks of the sheet piles. In the field, the soil–interlock interaction depends mainly on the installation method and the soil properties. The aim of this research was to study the dependencies between the applied forces and the friction in the interlocks by full-scale physical modeling during <b>press-in</b> by taking the pile–pile and interlock–soil interactions into account. The results of the on-site full-scale tests as well as the laboratory physical modeling of U-profile piles in different soil conditions are presented in the paper. Using the data obtained, “force–displacements” diagrams were constructed to assess the influence of soil friction and resistance in the interlocks. The calculation model was improved based on the results to provide a more reliable numerical modeling and design of the “sheet pile–soil media” system. The physical modeling clearly shows the influence of soil behavior on the interlock between sheet piles, {{especially in the case of}} saturated sand...|$|E
40|$|Geotechnical {{applications}} such as new rapid pile testing methods and push-in pile installation techniques have highlighted {{the need for a}} better understanding of rate effects in sandy clay material. In the case of <b>press-in</b> piles a correlation between driving force and in-situ soil strength could help to confirm or modify design assumptions. In order to gain an insight to the problem, a new Rowe Cell-Vane Shear apparatus has been developed to rotate shear vanes inserted in reconstituted beds of sandy clay consolidated at 200 kN/m 2 over a wide range of shearing velocities. The apparatus consists of a modified triaxial test frame, double Rowe cell consolidometer, associated pressure unit, laboratory vanes with servo motor and gear head connected to a motion controller, torque transducer and data logging device. Three vanes 20 mm in diameter and length 20 mm, 40 mm and 80 mm were used. The vanes were rotated at a range of peripheral velocities from 0. 5 mm/s to 400 mm/s to generate correlations of undrained shear strength and applied rate of shear. The results of the investigation highlight that the peak shear resistance recorded increases with increasing peripheral velocity and conform to power and semi logarithmic correlations. It was found that the magnitude of vane displacement required to achieve full mobilisation of soil shear strength was dependant on the applied rate of shear. The failure of the material at low velocities was ductile and became more brittle with increasing velocity of shearing. Furthermore, secondary shear resistance is proposed as a possible technique to provide a better estimate of shear resistance as the impact of rate effects are reduced...|$|E
40|$|<b>Press-in</b> piling, {{known as}} pile jacking, is a {{relatively}} new technique for foundation construction. Jacked piles are gaining popularity because they are free from vibration and noise during installation. In this thesis, about 100 cases of static loading tests were collected for compiling a database for jacked piles. The data collected were classified according to different types of founding soil and pile. The relationships between final jacking load and ultimate pile capacity were also investigated for different types of founding soil. Time-dependent effects for jacked piles were investigated in the research. During pile installation pauses, the pile capacity and stiffness generally increase by about 30 % per log-time cycle when the reference time t 0 is taken as 1 hour. The change in pile capacity and stiffness with time after pile installation was also studied. Capacity setup was observed in clay and sand, while relaxation was observed in silty sand. The pile stiffness was found to increase with time after pile installation. Behaviour of driven piles and jacked piles was compared in terms of changes in capacity with time. It was found that the setup effect was more significant in driven piles than in jacked piles. From field and centrifugal test results, when a pile was subjected to a low number of loading cycles, a decrease in the toe resistance occurred; meaning a greater portion of load was taken by the pile shaft. However, a decrease in the shaft resistance occurred when the pile was subjected to a larger number of loading cycles. Cumulative pile settlement was found to increase with a declining rate as the number of loading cycles increased. The effect of cyclic loading on the pile stiffness was found to increase with the number of final jacking cycles. Considering {{the pros and cons of}} the cyclic load effects, three jacking cycles was recommended for pile construction...|$|E

Perhaps he was beginning to realize, in giving me a contract for translating and introducing Jacques Derrida, that the press had bitten off more than it could chew. Well, I read the piece. I had ordered Derrida off a catalogue, on impulse, not knowing his name, or anything about the French scene. It was a sort of self-help project, to which I still subscribe, shamefacedly. I have no general education, whereas Edward’s piece seemed to be incredibly knowledgeable in just that way. I read the piece carefully, made notes in the margin, and filed it. Those years were full of turmoil in my personal life, but I kept translating Derrida and kept teaching the “poststructuralists,”who were all still writing. (I think I invented that ugly and imprecise word, a few years later, in my introduction to the Grammatology.) I sometimes think I developed a sort of comradeship with them precisely because I was so untutored, plugging away in remote Iowa City. “French” feminism, contained in the red covers of Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron’s book, appearing in 1980, was a different matter entirely.

40|$|The burgeoning {{of a new}} print form—the women’s <b>press—in</b> {{early twentieth-century}} China {{signaled}} a radical transformation {{in the ways of}} women’s literary and cultural production. This dissertation focuses on the discursive and imaginative space afforded by the women’s press. It explores in the women’s journals the processes of knowledge production and circulation that re/formulated the notions of gender and national identity. I examine writings by women and also by men writing in a feminine voice or assuming a female identity. In addition, I include writings that deploy “woman” as a trope through which authors express concerns of national salvation, social transformation, or Chinese modernization. The dissertation shows how experiences and expressions of “modernity” intersect with women’s print culture, and how the women’s press mediates a mixed gendered space for both women and men authors to bring into light a wide range of concerns at a critical historical juncture as Chinese modernity unfolded. How and why did women collaborate, reconcile, or contest with men in their writings or debates on themes related to feminine literary tradition, nationalism, feminism, ethnicity, and the female body to envision and construct “modern” Chinese women? In order to answer these questions, this thesis examines in the women’s press the multifarious writings by various groups of women, including “traditionally” literate women, “progressive” feminist activists, “ethnic” Manchu women reformers, “new-style” urban professionals, and “modern” female students. By reexamining prevailing assumptions regarding the relationship between Chinese feminism and nationalism, the “modern” production of women’s literature, and the masculinist formation of the New Woman, this analysis seeks to both highlight women’s agency and subjectivities in their political and cultural engagements and to illustrate the complexity and multivalence in the imaginings of modern Chinese women. Throughout, I argue that the women’s press provides a productive site for us to understand gender, women’s writing, and modernity in late Qing and early Republican China. published_or_final_versionModern Languages and CulturesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the United States, most drugs {{stored in}} crash carts of {{emergency}} rooms are packaged in folding cartons with opening mechanisms that involve pressing and tearing {{the bottom of}} the package. Anecdotal evidence and a previous study conducted by the research team suggest that these packages are counterintuitive for lay users. The concept of affordances, how design features communicate actionable possibilities, can be applied to improve the usability of packaging. In order to measure the effect of individual design features and previous experience on opening time and error frequency during first opening attempt, a commercially available package for epinephrine was redesigned and tested with two panels of participants; 33 lay users and 17 healthcare providers. Each experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with three factors: location of opening mechanism (top or bottom), type of opening mechanism (<b>press-in</b> or tab), and colour contrast in opening area (with and without). By crossing all possible conditions (2 x 2 x 2), eight different folding carton designs resulted. Each participant was treated as a block and presented all eight designs in a random order. Participants stood behind a counter of a fixed height and completed eight opening tasks in a lab facility (lay users) and an emergency room (healthcare providers). They were instructed to imagine an emergency scenario where they needed to remove all contents from each package as quickly as possible. Results show that colour contrast had no significant effect on opening time, having a tab significantly reduces time to open. More specifically, tabs cued the user as to the correct end containing the opening feature regardless of it was positioned on the top or bottom of the package. When there was no tab, then having the opening at the top resulted in a significant reduction in time to open, compared to having the opening at the bottom. In an analysis comparing the eight designs, the actual commercial packages ranked as the worst designs in terms of opening time and error frequency. Findings have critical implications for designing packages that are more usable and for eliminating errors during product use...|$|E
