60|$|The {{continuation}} of MICHAEL’S PLACE, which we left on {{our right to}} visit Michael’s Grove and Brompton Crescent, is the corner house, now Dr. Cahill’s and Mr. Hewett’s. At No. 12, Lewis Schiavonetti, a distinguished engraver, died on the 7th of June, 1810, {{at the age of}} fifty-five. He was a native of Bassano, in the Venetian territory, and the eldest son of a stationer, whose large family and moderate circumstances made him gladly accept the offer of Julius Golini, a painter of some repute, to receive his son, at the age of thirteen, for instruction in the arts. [Picture: No. 12 Michael’s Place] In three years after, Golini expired in the arms of his youthful pupil. Upon the death of his master he determined to seek the patronage of Count Remaudini, who had given employment to Bartolozzi and Volpato, and began to study the mechanical process of engraving, under a poor man named Lorio, who, unable to support himself by his profession, officiated as sacristan to a church, and could offer him no better accommodation for study than the sacristy. The circumstances of Schiavonetti not permitting him to seek for higher instruction, he remained with this master about twelve months, when, finding that he had learned all that poor Lorio was able to teach, and feeling an aversion to work occasionally among dead bodies, he determined to alter his situation. A copy of a ‘Holy Family,’ from Bartolozzi, after Carlo Maratta, gained Schiavonetti immediate employment from Count Remaudini, and attracted the notice of Suntach, an engraver and <b>printseller</b> in opposition to Remaudini.|$|E

Other recorded provincial exhibitions which included The <b>Printseller's</b> Window are Folkestone Art Treasures Exhibition (1886) (together with his portrait of Wilkie Collins), Edinburgh Academy of Arts, and Goodman's own studio at 88 Kings Road in Brighton in 1891. The latest recorded date that The <b>Printseller's</b> Window was shown in Britain was at a show at the 19th Art Century Society in 1894, which prompted a withering review in The Pall Mall Gazette where the reviewer accused Goodman of affixing facsimiles of photographs to his painting. Goodman later responded in the press to this inaccurate criticism in equally withering terms. The <b>Printseller's</b> Window was acquired by a Connecticut art dealer in 1965, and eventually by the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester in 1998.|$|R

And, {{for total}} {{result of our}} English {{engraving}} industry during the last hundred and fifty years, I find that practically at this moment I cannot get {{a single piece of}} true, sweet, and comprehensible art, to place for instruction in any children's school! I can get, for ten pounds apiece, well-engraved portraits of Sir Joshua's beauties showing graceful limbs through flowery draperies; I can get--dirt-cheap--any quantity of Dutch flats, ditches, and hedges, enlivened by cows chewing the cud, and dogs behaving indecently; I can get heaps upon heaps of temples, and forums, and altars, arranged as for academical competition, round seaports, with curled-up ships that only touch the water with the middle of their bottoms. I can get, at the price of lumber, any quantity of British squires flourishing whips and falling over hurdles; and, in suburban shops, a dolorous variety of widowed mothers nursing babies in a high light with the Bible on a table, and baby's shoes on a chair. Also, of cheap prints, painted red and blue, of Christ blessing little children, of Joseph and his brethren, the infant Samuel, or Daniel in the lions' den, the supply is ample enough to make every child in these islands think of the Bible as a somewhat dull story-book, allowed on Sunday;--but of trained, wise, and worthy art, applied to gentle purposes of instruction, no single example {{can be found in the}} shops of the British <b>printseller</b> or bookseller. And after every dilettante tongue in European society has filled drawing-room and academy alike with idle clatter concerning the divinity of Raphael and Michael Angelo, for these last hundred years, I cannot at this instant, for the first school which I have some power of organizing under St. George's laws, get a good print of Raphael's Madonna of the tribune, or an ordinarily intelligible view of the side and dome of St. Peter's! ...|$|E
6000|$|As a {{proof that}} Clive did intend to {{practise}} his profession, {{and to live}} by it too, at this time he took four sporting sketches to a <b>printseller</b> in the Haymarket, and disposed {{of them at the}} rate of seven shillings and sixpence per sketch. His exultation at receiving a sovereign and half a sovereign from Mr. Jones was boundless. [...] "I can do half a dozen of these things easily in a morning," [...] he says. [...] "Two guineas a day is twelve guineas--say ten guineas a week, for I won't work on Sundays, and may take a holiday in the week besides. Ten guineas a week is five hundred a year. That is pretty nearly as much money as I shall want, and I need not draw the dear old governor's allowance at all." [...] He wrote an ardent letter, full of happiness and affection, to the kind father, which he shall find a month after he has arrived in India, and read to his friends in Calcutta and Barrackpore. Clive invited many of his artist friends to a grand feast in honour of the thirty shillings. The King's Arms, Kensington, was the hotel selected (tavern beloved of artists for many score years!). Gandish was there, and the Gandishites, and some chosen spirits from the Life Academy, Clipstone Street, and J. J. was vice-president, with Fred Bayham by his side, to make the speeches and carve the mutton; and I promise you many a merry song was sung, and many a health drunk in flowing bumpers; and as jolly a party was assembled as any London contained that day. The beau-monde had quitted it; the Park was empty as we crossed it; and the leaves of Kensington Gardens had begun to fall, dying after the fatigues of a London season. We sang all the way home through Knightsbridge and by the Park railings, and the Covent Garden carters halting at the Half-way House were astonished at our choruses. There is no half-way house now; no merry chorus at midnight.|$|E
60|$|Dick, who, {{in serious}} earnest, was {{supposed}} to have considerable natural talents for his profession, and whose vain and sanguine disposition never permitted him to doubt for a moment of ultimate success, threw himself headlong into the crowd which jostled and struggled for notice and preferment. He elbowed others, and was elbowed himself; and finally, by dint of intrepidity, fought his way into some notice, painted for the prize at the Institution, had pictures at the exhibition at Somerset House, and damned the hanging committee. But poor Dick was doomed to lose the field he fought so gallantly. In the fine arts, there is scarce an alternative betwixt distinguished success and absolute failure; and as Dick's zeal and industry were unable to ensure the first, he fell into the distresses which, in his condition, were the natural consequences of the latter alternative. He was for a time patronised by one or two of those judicious persons who make a virtue of being singular, and of pitching their own opinions against those of the world in matters of taste and criticism. But they soon tired of poor Tinto, and laid him down as a load, upon the principle on which a spoilt child throws away its plaything. Misery, I fear, took him up, and accompanied him to a premature grave, to which he was carried from an obscure lodging in Swallow Street, where he had been dunned by his landlady within doors, and watched by bailiffs without, until death came to his relief. A corner of the Morning Post noticed his death, generously adding, that his manner displayed considerable genius, though his style was rather sketchy; and referred to an advertisement, which announced that Mr. Varnish, a well-known <b>printseller,</b> had still on hand a very few drawings and painings by Richard Tinto, Esquire, which those of the nobility and gentry who might wish to complete their collections of modern art were invited to visit without delay. So ended Dick Tinto! a lamentable proof of the great truth, that in the fine arts mediocrity is not permitted, and that he who cannot ascend to {{the very top of the}} ladder will do well not to put his foot upon it at all.|$|E

6000|$|Having to {{turn with}} all his might to his new profession, Clive Newcome, one of the proudest men alive, chose to revolt and to be restive at almost every stage of his training. He had a natural genius for his art, and had {{acquired}} in his desultory way a very considerable skill. His drawing was better than his painting (an opinion which, were my friend present, he of course would utterly contradict); his designs and sketches were far superior to his finished compositions. His friends, presuming to judge of this artist's qualifications, ventured to counsel him accordingly, and were thanked for their pains in the usual manner. We had in the first place to bully and browbeat Clive most fiercely, before he would take fitting lodgings for the execution of those designs which we had in view for him. [...] "Why should I take expensive lodgings?" [...] says Clive, slapping his fist on the table. [...] "I am a pauper, and can scarcely afford to live in a garret. Why should you pay me for drawing your portrait and Laura's and the children? What the deuce does Warrington want with the effigy of his old mug? You don't want them a bit--you only want to give me money.--It would be much more honest of me to take the money at once and own that I am a beggar; and I tell you what, Pen, the only money which I feel I come honestly by, is that which is paid me by a little <b>printseller</b> in Long Acre who buys my drawings, one with another, at fourteen shillings apiece, and out of whom I can earn pretty nearly two hundred a year. I am doing Coaches for him, sir, and Charges of Cavalry; the public like the Mail Coaches best--on a dark paper--the horses and miles picked out white--yellow dust--cobalt distance, and the guard and coachman of course in vermilion. That's what a gentleman can get his bread by--portraits, pooh! it's disguised beggary, Crackthorpe, and a half-dozen men of his regiment came, like good fellows as they are, and sent me five pounds apiece for their heads, but I tell you I am ashamed to take the money." [...] Such used to be the tenor of Clive Newcome's conversation as he strode up and down our room after dinner, pulling his moustache, and dashing his long yellow hair off his gaunt face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course it}} is,' said Erskine. 'It {{is a very}} good forgery; but it is a forgery none the less. I thought at the time that Cyril was rather calm about the whole matter; but I {{remember}} he more than once told me that he himself required no proof of the kind, and that he thought the theory complete without it. I laughed at him, and told him that without it the theory would fall to the ground, and I warmly congratulated him on the marvellous discovery. We then arranged that the picture should be etched or facsimiled, and placed as the frontispiece to Cyril's edition of the Sonnets; and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line by line, till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning. One unlucky day I was in a print-shop in Holborn, when I saw upon the counter some extremely beautiful drawings in silver-point. I was so attracted by them that I bought them; and the proprietor of the place, a man called Rawlings, told me that they were done by a young painter of the name of Edward Merton, who was very clever, but as poor as a church mouse. I went to see Merton some days afterwards, having got his address from the <b>printseller,</b> and found a pale, interesting young man, with a rather common-looking wife--his model, as I subsequently learned. I told him how much I admired his drawings, at which he seemed very pleased, and I asked him if he would show me some of his other work. As we were looking over a portfolio, full of really very lovely things,--for Merton had a most delicate and delightful touch,--I suddenly caught sight of a drawing of the picture of Mr. W. H. There was no doubt whatever about it. It was almost a facsimile--the only difference being that the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy were not suspended from the marble table as they are in the picture, but were lying on the floor at the young man's feet. [...] "Where on earth did you get that?" [...] I said. He grew rather confused, and said--"Oh, that is nothing. I did not know it was in this portfolio. It is not a thing of any value." [...] "It is what you did for Mr. Cyril Graham," [...] exclaimed his wife; [...] "and if this gentleman wishes to buy it, let him have it." [...] "For Mr. Cyril Graham?" [...] I repeated. [...] "Did you paint the picture of Mr. W. H.?" [...] "I don't understand what you mean," [...] he answered, growing very red. Well, the whole thing was quite dreadful. The wife let it all out. I gave her five pounds when I was going away. I can't bear to think of it now; but of course I was furious. I went off at once to Cyril's chambers, waited there for three hours before he came in, with that horrid lie staring me in the face, and told him I had discovered his forgery. He grew very pale and said--"I did it purely for your sake. You would not be convinced in any other way. It does not affect the truth of the theory." [...] "The truth of the theory!" [...] I exclaimed; [...] "the less we talk about that the better. You never even believed in it yourself. If you had, you would not have committed a forgery to prove it." [...] High words passed between us; we had a fearful quarrel. I dare say I was unjust. The next morning he was dead.' ...|$|E
