50|$|When camels {{have only}} two toes present, the claws are {{transformed}} into nails (while both are made of keratin, claws are curved and pointed while nails are flat and dull). These claws consist of three parts: the <b>plate</b> (<b>top</b> and sides), the sole (bottom), and the bale (rear). In general, the claws of the forelegs are wider and blunter {{than those of the}} hind legs, and the gape is farther apart. Aside from camels, all even-toed ungulates put {{just the tip of the}} foremost phalanx on the ground.In even-toed ungulates, the bones of the stylopodium (upper arm or thigh bone) and zygopodiums (tibia and fibula) are usually elongated. The muscles of the limbs are predominantly localized, which ensures that artiodactyls often have very slender legs. A clavicle is never present, and the scapula is very agile and swings back and forth for added mobility when running. The special construction of the legs causes the legs to be unable to rotate, which allows for greater stability when running at high speeds. In addition, many smaller artiodactyls have a very flexible body, contributing to their speed by increasing their stride length.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, lap welds between Al 5754 to DP 600 steel (aluminum <b>plate</b> <b>top,</b> {{and steel}} plate bottom) were {{manufactured}} by {{friction stir welding}} (FSW). The effects of welding parameters (i. e. travel speeds and penetration depth into lower steel sheet) on the interfacial bonding, tensile strength, and failure mechanism were investigated. The results show that intermetallic compound of Fe 4 Al 13 was detected at the Al/Fe interface. The weld strength increases significantly by increasing the penetration depth into the lower steel substrate at all travel speeds. The failure mode under overlap shear loadings is premature failure through the aluminum substrate when the penetration depth is more than 0. 17  mm, and shear fracture when the penetration depth is less than 0. 17  mm...|$|E

30|$|Following an {{investigation}} of these topics, we began seeking a mechanism that yields high-acceleration motion, a mechanism that generates both global and local motions, and a method for judging the configurations of wire mechanisms. The redundant drive wire mechanism (RDWM) with double actuator modules (DAMs) for realizing fast and fine motion has been already proposed [13]. The DAM {{is a pair of}} actuators that control the length or tension of a single wire, generating a large translational force that greatly accelerates the <b>top</b> <b>plate.</b> Because the actuators are positioned outside of the <b>top</b> <b>plate,</b> the <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> develops low inertia and achieves high-acceleration motions. In addition, fine-local motions are generated on the <b>top</b> <b>plate.</b> However, RDWM requires a large number of actuators: at least eight in the planar case and 14 in the 3 D case.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{finite element}} model based on an {{improved}} higher order zigzag plate theory developed by the authors is refined {{in this study and}} applied to bending and vibration response of soft core sandwich plates. The theory satisfies interlayer transverse shear stress continuity including transverse shear stress free condition at the <b>plate</b> <b>top</b> and bottom surfaces and transverse normal compressibility of the core. The in-plane displacements vary cubically through the entire thickness, while transverse displacement is assumed to vary quadratically within the core. In order to have a better computational benefit, a C 0 finite element formulation is adopted. This is refined through satisfaction of certain constrains variationally using a penalty function approach. The performance of the model is demonstrated by comparing the present results with 3 D elasticity solutions and other available results...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFull {{optimization}} {{design of}} an electro-optic (E-O) deflector for a 44 giga-sample-per-second all-optical analog-to-digital converter application is {{reported in this}} paper. The E-O polymer based deflector is used for a spatial sampling of a radio frequency (RF) voltage applied through in-plane lateral configuration electrodes. The traditional poling configuration, in the metal-contact technique, by sandwiching the waveguide between a ground plane and a full <b>plate</b> <b>top</b> electrode is not adapted for chromophore orientation in lateral direction. We propose to build one set of electrodes, for both poling and driving the E-O polymer based optical deflector, by adding DC contacts for each strips via low-pass filter to avoid narrowing of the RF bandwidth. The DC poling contacts introduce only 1 dB additional insertion losses and reduce the bandwidth from 25. 5 down to 21. 6 GHz while the E-O effect should be increased due to the optimal chromophores orientation...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{instability}} of imperfect laminated sandwich plates with in-plane partial edge load Dynamic {{instability of}} laminated sandwich plates having inter-laminar imperfections with in-plane partial edge load-ing is studied {{for the first}} time using an efficient finite el-ement plate model. The plate model is based on a refined higher order shear deformation plate theory, where the trans-verse shear stresses are continuous at the layer interfaces with stress free conditions at <b>plate</b> <b>top</b> and bottom surfaces. A lin-ear spring-layer model is used to model the inter-laminar im-perfection by considering in-plane displacement jumps at the interfaces. Interestingly the plate model having all these re-fined features requires unknowns at the reference plane only. However, this theory requires C 1 continuity of transverse dis-placement (w) i. e., w and its derivatives should be continuous at the common edges between two elements, which is diffi-cult to satisfy arbitrarily in any existing finite element.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThe static response of laminated sandwich plates having imperfections at the layer interfaces is investigated by a refined plate theory. The plate theory represents parabolic through thickness variation of transverse shear stresses, which are continuous at the layer interfaces and become zero at the <b>plate</b> <b>top</b> and bottom surfaces. In this plate model the interfacial imperfection is represented by a linear spring-layer. Moreover, with all these features of an accurate modeling, it involves unknowns only at the reference plane of the plate. To have generality in the analysis, finite element method is adopted. But any existing plate element cannot be used, as the plate theory demands certain inter-elemental continuity. Thus an attempt has also been made to develop a new triangular element. As there is no published result on imperfect sandwich plates, the problems of perfect sandwich plates and ordinary laminated plate with inter-laminar imperfection are used for validation. A.
