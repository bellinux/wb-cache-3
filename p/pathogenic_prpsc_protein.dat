40|$|Background - Prion {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} the accumulation of the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>PrPSc</b> <b>protein,</b> mainly {{in the brain and}} the lymphoreticular system. Although prions multiply/accumulate in the lymph nodes without any detectable pathology, transcriptional changes in this tissue may reflect biological processes that contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of prion diseases. Little is known about the molecular processes that occur in the lymphoreticular system in early and late stages of prion disease. We performed a microarray-based study to identify genes that are differentially expressed at different disease stages in the mesenteric lymph node of sheep naturally infected with scrapie. Oligo DNA microarrays were used to identify gene-expression profiles in the early/middle (preclinical) and late (clinical) stages of the disease. Results - In the clinical stage of the disease, we detected 105 genes that were differentially expressed (= 2 -fold change in expression). Of these, 43 were upregulated and 62 downregulated as compared with age-matched negative controls. Fewer genes (50) were differentially expressed in the preclinical stage of the disease. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were largely associated with the following terms: glycoprotein, extracellular region, disulfide bond, cell cycle and extracellular matrix. Moreover, some of the annotated genes could be grouped into 3 specific signaling pathways: focal adhesion, PPAR signaling and ECM-receptor interaction. We discuss the relationship between the observed gene expression profiles and PrPSc deposition and the potential involvement in the pathogenesis of scrapie of 7 specific differentially expressed genes whose expression levels were confirmed by real time-PCR. Conclusions - The present findings identify new genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of natural scrapie infection in the lymphoreticular system, and confirm previous reports describing scrapie-induced alterations in the expression of genes involved in protein misfolding, angiogenesis and the oxidative stress response. Further studies will be necessary to determine the role of these genes in prion replication, dissemination and in the response of the organism to this disease...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{functions}} and mechanisms of prion proteins (PrPC) are currently unknown, but most {{experts believe that}} deformed or <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>proteins</b> (<b>PrPSc)</b> originate from PrPC, and {{that there may be}} plural main sites for the conversion of normal PrPC into PrPSc. In order to better understand the mechanism of PrPC transformation to PrPSc, the most important step is to determine the replacement or substitution site...|$|R
40|$|Prion protein {{consists}} of an ensemble of glycosylated variants or glycoforms. The enzymes that direct oligosaccharide processing, and hence control the glycan profile for any given glycoprotein, are often exquisitely sensitive to other events taking place within the cell in which the glycoprotein is expressed. Alterations in the populations of sugars attached to proteins can reflect changes caused, for example, by developmental processes or by disease. Here we report that normal (PrPC) and <b>pathogenic</b> (<b>PrPSc)</b> prion <b>proteins</b> (PrP) from Syrian hamsters contain {{the same set of}} at least 52 bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary N-linked oligosaccharides, although the relative proportions of individual glycans differ. This conservation of structure suggests that the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc is not confined to a subset of PrPs that contain specific sugars. Compared with PrPC, PrPSc contains decreased levels of glycans with bisecting GlcNAc residues and increased levels of tri- and tetraantennary sugars. This change is consistent with a decrease in the activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII) toward PrPC in cells where PrPSc is formed and argues that, in at least some cells forming PrPSc, the glycosylation machinery has been perturbed. The reduction in GnTIII activity is intriguing both with respect to the pathogenesis of the prion disease and the replication pathway for prions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc)</b> in controlling susceptibility to foreign prions, two Syrian hamster (SHa) prion strains, Sc 237 and DY, were transmitted to transgenic mice expressing chimeric SHa/mouse PrP genes, Tg(MH 2 M). First passage of SHa(Sc 237) prions exhibited prolonged incubation times, diagnostic of a species barrier. PrPSc of the new MH 2 M(Sc 237) strain possessed different structural properties from those of SHa(Sc 237), as demonstrated by relative conformational stability measurements. This change was accompanied by a disease phenotype different from the SHa(Sc 237) strain. Conversely, transmission of SHa(DY) prions to Tg(MH 2 M) mice showed no species barrier, and the MH 2 M(DY) strain retained the conformational and disease-specific properties of SHa(DY). These results suggest a causal relationship between species barriers, changes in PrPSc conformation, and the emergence of new prion strains...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{disease is}} caused by a single <b>pathogenic</b> <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc),</b> an {{abnormal}} conformer of the normal cellular prion protein PrPC. Depletion of PrPC in prion knockout mice makes them resistant to prion disease. Thus, gene silencing of the Prnp gene is a promising effective therapeutic approach. Here, we examined adeno-associated virus vector type 2 encoding a short hairpin RNA targeting Prnp mRNA (AAV 2 -PrP-shRNA) to suppress PrPC expression both in vitro and in vivo. AAV 2 -PrP-shRNA treatment suppressed PrP levels and prevented dendritic degeneration in RML-infected brain aggregate cultures. Infusion of AAV 2 -PrP-shRNA-eGFP into the thalamus of CD- 1 mice showed that eGFP was transported to the cerebral cortex via anterograde transport and the overall PrPC levels were reduced by ∼ 70 % within 4 weeks. For therapeutic purposes, we treated RML-infected CD- 1 mice with AAV 2 -PrP-shRNA beginning at 50 days post inoculation. Although AAV 2 -PrP-shRNA focally suppressed PrPSc formation in the thalamic infusion site by ∼ 75 %, it did not suppress PrPSc formation efficiently in other regions of the brain. Survival of mice was not extended compared to the untreated controls. Global suppression of PrPC in the brain is required for successful therapy of prion diseases...|$|R
40|$|Prions are the {{transmissible}} pathogenic agents {{responsible for}} {{diseases such as}} scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In the favoured model of prion replication, direct interaction between the <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc)</b> template and endogenous cellular prion protein (PrPC) is proposed to drive the formation of nascent infectious prions. Reagents specifically binding either prion-protein conformer may interrupt prion production by inhibiting this interaction. We examined the ability of several recombinant antibody antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) to inhibit prion propagation in cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells (ScN 2 a) infected with PrPSc. Here we show that antibodies binding cell-surface PrPC inhibit PrPSc formation in a dose-dependent manner. In cells treated with the most potent antibody, Fab D 18, prion replication is abolished and pre-existing PrPSc is rapidly cleared, suggesting that this antibody may cure established infection. The potent activity of Fab D 18 is associated with its ability to better recognize {{the total population of}} PrPC molecules on the cell surface, and with the location of its epitope on PrPC. Our observations support the use of antibodies in the prevention and treatment of prion diseases and identify a region of PrPC for drug targeting...|$|R
40|$|The unique {{phenotypic}} {{characteristics of}} mammalian prions {{are thought to}} be encoded in the conformation of <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>proteins</b> (<b>PrPSc).</b> The molecular mechanism responsible for the adaptation, mutation, and evolution of prions observed in cloned cells and upon crossing the species barrier remains unsolved. Using biophysical techniques and conformation-dependent immunoassays in tandem, we isolated two distinct populations of PrPSc particles with different conformational stabilities and aggregate sizes, which frequently co-exist in the most common human prion disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). The protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) replicates each of the PrPSc particle types independently, and leads to the competitive selection of those with lower initial conformational stability. In serial propagation with a nonglycosylated mutant PrPC substrate, the dominant PrPSc conformers are subject to further evolution by natural selection of the subpopulation with the highest replication rate due to its lowest stability. Cumulatively, the data show that sCJD PrPSc is not a single conformational entity, but a dynamic collection of two distinct populations of particles. This implies the co-existence of different prions, whose adaptation and evolution are governed by the selection of progressively less stable, faster replicating PrPSc conformers...|$|R
40|$|Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) {{differs from}} other human prion {{diseases}} {{in that the}} <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> <b>PrPSc</b> can be detected {{to a greater extent}} at extraneuronal sites throughout the body, principally within lymphoid tissues. However, a recent study using a high-sensitivity Western blotting technique revealed low levels of PrPSc in skeletal muscle from a quarter of Swiss patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD). This posed the question of whether PrPSc in muscle could also be detected in vCJD, sCJD, and iatrogenic (iCJD) patients from other populations. Therefore, we have used the same high-sensitivity Western blotting technique, in combination with paraffin-embedded tissue blotting, to screen for PrPSc in muscle tissue specimens taken at autopsy from 49 CJD patients in the United Kingdom. These techniques identified muscle PrPSc in 8 of 17 vCJD, 7 of 26 sCJD, and 2 of 5 iCJD patients. Paraffin-embedded tissue blotting analysis showed PrPSc in skeletal muscle in localized anatomical structures that had the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of nerve fibers. The detection of PrPSc in muscle tissue from all forms of CJD indicates the possible presence of infectivity in these tissues, suggesting important implications for assessing the potential risk of iatrogenic spread via contaminated surgical instruments...|$|R

40|$|On {{our initial}} {{discovery}} that prion protein (PrP) -derived peptides {{were capable of}} capturing the <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc),</b> we {{have been interested in}} how these peptides interact with PrPSc. After screening peptides from the entire human PrP sequence, we found two peptides (PrP 19 – 30 and PrP 100 – 111) capable of binding full-length PrPSc in plasma, a medium containing a complex mixture of other proteins including a vast excess of the normal prion protein (PrPC). The limit of detection for captured PrPSc was calculated to be 8 amol from a ≈ 105 -fold dilution of 10 % (wt/vol) human variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease brain homogenate, with > 3, 800 -fold binding specificity to PrPSc over PrPC. Through extensive analyses, we show that positively charged amino acids play an important, but not exclusive, role in the interaction between the peptides and PrPSc. Neither hydrophobic nor polar interactions appear to correlate with binding activity. The peptide–PrPSc interaction was not sequence-specific, but amino acid composition affected binding. Binding occurs through a conformational domain that is only present in PrPSc, is species-independent, and is not affected by proteinase K digestion. These and other findings suggest a mechanism by which cationic domains of PrPC {{may play a role in}} the recruitment of PrPC to PrPSc...|$|R
40|$|Background. Due to the bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), specified risk material (SRM) as well as animal meat and bone meal (MBM) are banned from the food and feed chain because of a possible infection with <b>pathogenic</b> prions (<b>PrPSc).</b> Nowadays, prions are widely accepted {{to be responsible for}} TSE(transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) -caused illnesses like BSE and scrapie, and especially for the occurrence of the new variant of CJD in humans. Presently, SRM and MBM are burnt under high temperatures to avoid any hazards for humans, animals or the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a method using animal fat separated from Category I material which includes SRM and the carcasses of TSE-infected animals, or animals suspected of being infected with TSE, as a source for producing biodiesel by transesterification, analogous to the biodiesel process using vegetable oil. Methods. For this purpose, animal fat was spiked with scrapie-infected hamster brain equivalents - as representative for a TSE-infected animal - and the biodiesel manufacturing process was downscaled and performed under lab-scale conditions. Results and Discussion. The results analysed by Western blotting showed clearly that almost each single step of the process leads to a significant reduction of the concentration of the <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc)</b> in the main and side-products. Conclusion. The data revealed that the biodiesel production, even from material with a high concentration of pathogenic prions, can be considered as safe. Recommendations and Outlook. The obtained results indicated that biodiesel produced from prion-contaminated fat was safe under the tested process conditions. However, it has to be pointed out that the results cannot be generalized because a different process control using other conditions may lead to different results and then has to be analysed independently. It is clear that the production of biodiesel from high risk material represents a more economic usage than the combustion of such material...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{propagation}} {{is mediated}} by the structural alteration of normal prion protein (PrPC) to generate <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc).</b> To date, compounds for the inhibition of prion propagation have mainly been screened using PrPSc-infected cells. Real time-quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) is one alternative screening method. In this study, we assessed the propagation inhibition effects of known anti-prion compounds using RT-QuIC and compared the results with those from a PrPSc-infected cell assay. Compounds were applied to RT-QuIC reactions at 0 h or 22 h after prion propagation {{to determine whether they}} inhibited propagation or reduced amplified aggregates. RT-QuIC reactions in presence of acridine, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and tannic acid inhibited seeded aggregation with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at 0 h. After treatment at 22 h, amplified fluorescence was decreased in wells treated with either acridine or tannic acid. Compound activities were verified by western blot of RT-QuIC products and in a dye-independent conversion assay, the Multimer Detection System. Protease K-resistant PrPSc fragments (PrPres) were reduced by DSS and tannic acid in the PrPSc-infected cell assay. Importantly, these inhibitory effects were similar despite different treatment times (0 h versus 3 days). Consequentially, RT-QuIC enabled the more specific classification of compounds according to action (i. e., inhibition of prion propagation versus reduction of amplified aggregates). RT-QuIC addresses the limitations of cell-based screening methods and can be used to further aid our understanding of the mechanisms of action of anti-prion compounds...|$|R
40|$|Activation of {{microglia}} is {{a central}} event in the atypical inflammatory response occurring during prion encephalopathies. We report that the prion protein fragment encompassing amino acids 90 - 231 (PrP 90 - 231), {{a model of the}} neurotoxic activity of the <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrP(Sc)),</b> causes activation of both primary microglia cultures and N 9 microglial cells in vitro. This effect was characterized by cell proliferation arrest and induction of a secretory phenotype, releasing prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and nitric oxide (NO). Conditioned medium from PrP 90 - 231 -treated microglia induced in vitro cytotoxicity of A 1 mesencephalic neurons, supporting the notion that soluble mediators released by activated microglia contributes to the neurodegeneration during prion diseases. The neuroinflammatory role of COX activity, and its potential targeting for anti-prion therapies, was tested measuring the effects of ketoprofen and celecoxib (preferential inhibitors of COX 1 and COX 2, respectively) on PrP 90 - 231 -induced microglial activation. Celecoxib, but not ketoprofen significantly reverted the growth arrest as well as NO and PGE 2 secretion induced by PrP 90 - 231, indicating that PrP 90 - 231 pro-inflammatory response in microglia is mainly dependent on COX 2 activation. Taken together, these data outline the importance of microglia in the neurotoxicity occurring during prion diseases and highlight the potentiality of COX 2 -selective inhibitors to revert microglia as adjunctive pharmacological approach to contrast the neuroinflammation-dependent neurotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob {{disease in}} people who had {{consumed}} contaminated meat products from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy emphasize the need for measures aimed at preventing the transmission of the <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc)</b> from materials derived from cattle. Highly stringent scrutiny is required for fetal bovine serum (FBS), a growth-medium supplement used {{in the production of}} parenteral vaccines and therapeutic recombinant proteins and in the ex vivo expansion of stem cells for transplantation. One such approach is the implementation of manufacturing steps dedicated to removing PrPSc from materials containing FBS. We evaluated the use of the QyuSpeed D (QSD) adsorbent hollow-fiber anion-exchange chromatographic column (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) for the removal of PrPSc from cell culture media supplemented with FBS. We first established that QSD filtration had no adverse effect on the chemical composition of various types of culture media supplemented with 10 % FBS or the growth and viability characteristics of human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK- 21) cells, African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-k 1) cells propagated in the various culture-medium filtrates. We used a 0. 6 -mL QSD column for removing PrPSc from up to 1000 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 % FBS previously spiked with the 263 K strain of hamster-adapted scrapie. The Western blot analysis, validated alongside an infectivity assay, revealed that the level of PrPSc in the initial 200 mL flow-through was reduced by 2. 5 to > 3 log 10, compared with that of the starting material. These results indicate that QSD filtration removes PrPSc from cell culture media containing 10 % FBS, and demonstrate the ease with which QSD filtration can be implemented in at industrial-scale to improve the safety of vaccines, therapeutic recombinant proteins, and ex vivo expanded stem cells produced using growth media supplemented with FBS...|$|R
40|$|In the 'protein only' hypothesis, prion {{diseases}} {{are thought to}} result from the conformational change of a normal isoform of a prion protein (PrPC) to a protease-resistant, <b>pathogenic</b> form called <b>PrPSc.</b> This conversion rests on an autocatalytic process requiring the presence of pre-existing PrPSc. Theoretical kinetic analysis of the dynamic process, including the turnover of the normal prion protein, shows that the system exhibits bistability properties, indicating that the very slow accumulation of the abnormal form of the protein in the brain could in fact be the consequence and {{not the cause of}} the disorders. The cause would be a transition between two alternative steady states of the system. The presence of a small amount of the <b>PrPSc</b> <b>protein</b> in lymphocytes does not necessarily constitute any indication of a non-symptomatic but infectious pathogenic state. Moreover, infectious prion particles should not be seen as necessarily composed of the abnormal isoform of the protein, as usually stated.

50|$|The {{infectious}} agent is a misfolded {{form of a}} host-encoded protein called prion (PrP). Prion proteins are encoded by the Prion Protein Gene (PRNP).

The two forms do not differ in their amino acid sequence, however, the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>PrPsc</b> isoform differs from the normal PrPc form in its secondary and tertiary structure. The PrPsc isoform is more enriched in beta sheets, while the normal PrPc form is enriched in alpha helices. The differences in conformation allow PrPsc to aggregate and be extremely resistant to protein degradation by enzymes or by other chemical and physical means. The normal form, on the other hand, is susceptible to complete proteolysis and soluble in non-denaturing detergents.|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting man and various animal species. A {{large body of}} evidence supports {{the notion that the}} causative agent of these diseases is the prion, which, devoid of nucleic acids, is composed largely, if not entirely, of a conformationally abnormal isoform (PrP(Sc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPc). PrPc is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed sialoglycoprotein, the normal function of which is, however, still ill defined. Several modules have been recognised in PrPc structure. Their extensive analysis by different experimental approaches, including transgenic animal models, has allowed to assigning to several modules a putative role in PrPc physiology. Concurrently, it has underscored the possibility that alteration of specific domains may determine the switching from a beneficial role of PrPc into one that becomes detrimental to neurons, and/or promote the conversion of PrPc into the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>PrP(Sc)</b> conformer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA major {{hallmark}} of prion diseases is the cerebral amyloid accumulation of the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>PrPSc,</b> an abnormally misfolded, protease-resistant, and β-sheet rich protein. PrP 106 – 126 {{is the key}} domain responsible for the conformational conversion and aggregation of PrP. It shares important physicochemical characteristics with PrPSc and presents similar neurotoxicity as PrPSc. By combination of fluorescence polarization, dye release assay and in situ time-lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM), we investigated the PrP 106 – 126 amide interacting with the large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and the supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). The {{results suggest that the}} interactions involve a poration-mediated process: firstly, the peptide binding results in the formation of pores in the membranes, which penetrate only half of the membranes; subsequently, PrP 106 – 126 amide undergoes the poration-mediated diffusion in the SLBs, represented by the formation and expansion of the flat high-rise domains (FHDs). The possible mechanisms of the interactions between PrP 106 – 126 amide and lipid membranes are proposed based on our observations...|$|R
40|$|The agent {{responsible}} for prion disease may exist in different forms, {{commonly referred to}} as strains, with each carrying the specific information that determines its own distinct biological properties, such as incubation period and lesion profile. Biological strain typing of ovine scrapie isolates by serial passage in conventional mice has shown some diversity in ovine prion strains. However, this biological diversity remains poorly supported by biochemical prion strain typing. The protein-only hypothesis predicts that variation between different prion strains in the same host is manifest in different conformations adopted by PrPSc. Here we have investigated the molecular properties of PrPSc associated with two principal Prnpa mouse-adapted ovine scrapie strains, namely, RML and ME 7, in order to establish biochemical prion strain typing strategies that may subsequently be used to discriminate field cases of mouse-passaged ovine scrapie isolates. We used a conformation-dependent immunoassay and a conformational stability assay, together with Western blot analysis, to demonstrate that RML and ME 7 <b>PrPSc</b> <b>proteins</b> show distinct biochemical and physicochemical properties. Although RML and ME 7 <b>PrPSc</b> <b>proteins</b> showed similar resistance to proteolytic digestion, they differed in their glycoform profiles and levels of proteinase K (PK) -sensitive and PK-resistant isoforms. In addition, the PK-resistant core (PrP 27 - 30) of ME 7 was conformationally more stable following exposure to guanidine hydrochloride or Sarkosyl than was RML PrP 27 - 30. Our data show that mouse-adapted ovine scrapie strains can be discriminated by their distinct conformers of PrPSc, which provides a basis to investigate their diversity at the molecular level...|$|R

Many investigators have therefore preferred to work with peptide fragments of PrP, suggesting that these peptides might serve as structural and functional models for biologically active prions. We have used x-ray fiber diffraction to compare a series of different-sized fragments of PrP, to determine the structural commonalities among the fragments and the biologically active, self-propagating prions. Although all of the peptides studied adopted amyloid conformations, only the larger fragments demonstrated a degree of structural complexity approaching that of PrP.

40|$|Prion diseases, {{also known}} as {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and other mammalian species. The central event in TSE pathogenesis is the conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the aggregate, β-sheet rich, amyloidogenic form, PrPSc. Increasing evidence indicates that distinct PrPSc conformers, forming distinct ordered aggregates, can encipher the phenotypic TSE variants related to prion strains. Prion strains are TSE isolates that, after inoculation into syngenic hosts, cause disease with distinct characteristics, such as incubation period, pattern of PrPSc distribution, and regional severity of histopathological changes in the brain. In analogy with other amyloid forming <b>proteins,</b> <b>PrPSc</b> toxicity is thought to derive from the existence of various intermediate structures prior to the amyloid fiber formation and/or their specific interaction with membranes. The latter appears particularly relevant for the pathogenesis of TSEs associated with GPI-anchored PrPSc, which involves major cellular membrane distortions in neurons. In this review, we update the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying three fundamental aspects of the basic biology of prions such as the putative mechanism of prion protein conversion to the <b>pathogenic</b> form <b>PrPSc</b> and its propagation, the molecular basis of prion strains, and the mechanism of induced neurotoxicity by PrPSc aggregates...|$|R

Studies referring to the Part I {{have been carried out}} at the University of Cagliari and were focalized on the evaluation and experimental validation of the method known as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which allows to determine, and also to predict, types and degree of interaction of two or more drugs in combination with one another(s). I have successfully applied the ANN approach to combinations of two cytotoxic compounds, i. e. cis-platinum (CDDP), a potent antineoplastic used in the therapy of some types of carcinoma, with Cu(II) complexes that were previously shown to be endowed with potent cytotoxic activity in vitro (Pivetta et al., J Inorg Biochem. 2011 and 2012). Binary combinations comprising CDDP and Cu(II) complexes revealed (Part I, Chapter I) a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect against leukemia cell lines (Pivetta et al., Talanta 2013). The synergistic effect was confirmed in CDDP-resistant leukemia and ovarian cancer cell lines (Part I, Chapter II). Investigations on molecular bases of the CDDP – Cu(II) complexes synergism are in progress. As for the Part II of my research, I firstly investigated the mechanisms underlying the process of generation of <b>pathogenic</b> prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc).</b> These studies were carried out in part at the University of Cagliari, and in part at the Rocky Mountains Laboratories (RML) of the NIAID/NIH in USA (Hamilton, Montana), during my 14 -month research internship as supplemental visiting fellow in a graduate partnership program. The studies carried out in Cagliari have investigated 1 H NMR modifications of brain metabolite profiles in sheep from a Sardinian farm hit by natural Scrapie with the aim to discriminate infected vs. Uninfected, and early vs. late phases of the prion infection (Part II, Chapter I). The overall results, obtained by different chemometric tools, were able to describe a metabolite profile of scrapie-infected sheep brain, with and without clinical sign, different to that of healthy ones, and to suggest Ala as a biomarker of PrPSc deposition (Scano et al., J Molecular Biosystem, 2015) Studies conducted at the RML of NIAID/NIH have addressed the structural features of PrPSc in order to identify regions of the protein involved in the process of misfolding (Part II, Chapter II). So far, data suggest that i) the N-terminal portion of the prion protein may have a role in the modulation of the protein aggregation process, typical of prion diseases, while ii) the central portion seems capable to undergo aggregation into fibrils {{even in the absence of}} other regions of the protein. However, further studies are needed to confirm the proposed role in promoting/hindering the misfolding and subsequent aggregation process of the various protein regions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTransmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), {{also called}} prion diseases, are fatal, infectious, genetic or {{sporadic}} neurodegenerative disorders {{of humans and}} animals. In humans, TSEs are represented by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia and Kuru. In animals, the most prominent prion diseases are scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle and chronic wasting disease (CWD) of deer and elk. A critical event in prion diseases is the accumulation in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) of the abnormally folded <b>PrP(Sc)</b> <b>protein</b> that is the protease-resistant isoform of a normal cellular protein encoded by the host and called PrP(C). PrP(Sc) (also known as rPrP(Sc) or PrP 27 - 30) represents the main marker of prion diseases and is routinely used in the reference method for the diagnosis of prion diseases. Most of the therapeutic strategies developed so far aimed at identifying compounds that diminish the levels of PrP(Sc), with variable success when tested in vivo. In this review, we present an alternative approach in which small molecules that induce PrP(Sc) oligomers are identified. By using virtual and cellular screenings, we found several thienyl pyrimidine compounds that trigger PrP(Sc) oligomerization and trap prion infectivity...|$|R
40|$|While agent host-range {{and strain}} {{properties}} convinced early researchers of a viral etiology, the once unorthodox postulate that prion transmission occurs by conformational corruption of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC) by a <b>pathogenic</b> isoform (<b>PrPSc)</b> is now widely accepted. Indeed, conformational templating is increasingly {{understood to be}} a general mechanism of protein-mediated information transfer and pathogenesis. The high infectivity of prions, their capacity to cause neurodegeneration in genetically tractable animal models, {{as well as the}} ability to culture prions in cells, or under cell-free conditions using defined components, provide finely controlled experimental settings in which to elucidate general mechanisms for all diseases involving protein conformational templating, and thus to develop integrated therapeutic approaches.

40|$|AbstractCharacteristic {{differences}} of prions {{may account for}} the conformational diversity of the pathogenic isoform of prion <b>protein</b> (<b>PrPSc).</b> Here, we applied a protein detection procedure by using fluorescent-labelled peptides for detecting <b>PrPSc.</b> Five prion <b>protein</b> (PrP) related peptides were found to change significantly their fluorescent intensities with prion-affected animal samples. Their reactivity was different among atypical L-BSE, classical BSE and scrapie. The pull-down assay revealed that they precipitated PrPSc specifically. These findings suggest that fluorescent intensity changes depend on peptide–PrPSc binding. This novel approach may distinguish the fine structural differences in PrPSc, which were not detected by the pull-down assay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{key event}} in {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is {{the conversion of the}} soluble, protease-sensitive glycosylated prion protein (PrP(C)) to an abnormally structured, aggregated and partially protease-resistant isoform (PrP(Sc)). Both PrP isoforms bear two potential glycosylation sites and thus in a typical western blot with an anti-PrP antibody three distinct bands appear, corresponding to the di-, mono- or unglycosylated forms of the protein. The relative intensity and electrophoretic mobility of the three bands are characteristic of each TSE strain and have been used to discriminate between them. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we used lectin-based western blotting to evaluate possible variations in composition within sugar chains carried by PrP(Sc) purified from subjects affected with different TSEs. Our findings indicate that in addition to the already well-documented differences in electrophoretic mobility and amounts of the glycosylated PrP(Sc) forms, TSE strains also vary in the abundance of specific N-linked sugars of the <b>PrP(Sc)</b> <b>protein.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results imply that PrP glycosylation might fine-tune the conversion of PrP(C) to PrP(Sc) and could play an accessory role in the appearance of some of the characteristic features of TSE strains. The differences in sugar composition could also be used as an additional tool for discrimination between the various TSEs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrion {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by scrapie form of prion <b>protein,</b> <b>PrPSc.</b> Prion <b>protein</b> (PrP) is bound to the cell via glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The role of GPI anchor in PrPSc replication and propagation remains unclear. It {{has been shown that}} anchorless and truncated PrP accelerate the formation and propagation of prions in vivo and further increases the risk for transmission of prion diseases among species. To explain the role of anchorless forms of PrP in the development of prion diseases, we have prepared five C-terminal PrP truncated variants, determined their thermodynamic properties and analyzed the kinetics of conversion into amyloid fibrils. According to our results thermodynamic and kinetic properties are affected both by pH and truncation. We have shown that the shortest variant was the most destabilized and converted faster than other variants in acidic pH. Other variants converted with longer lag time of fibrillization than WT despite comparable or even decreased stability in acidic pH. Our results indicate that even the change in length for 1  amino acid residue can {{have a profound effect on}} in vitro conversion...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are neurodegenerative diseases that {{are characterized by}} {{the conversion of the}} cellular prion protein PrP(c) to the <b>pathogenic</b> isoform <b>PrP(sc).</b> Several antibodies are known to interact with the cellular prion protein and to inhibit this transition. An antibody Fab fragment, Fab POM 1, was produced that recognizes a structural motif of the C-terminal domain of mouse prion protein. To study the mechanism by which Fab POM 1 recognizes and binds the prion molecule, the complex between Fab POM 1 and the C-terminal domain of mouse prion (residues 120 - 232) was prepared and crystallized. Crystals of this binary complex belonged to the monoclinic space group C 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 83. 68, b = 106. 9, c = 76. 25  Å, β = 95. 6 °...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of the cellular isoform of the prion protein into the <b>pathogenic</b> isoform <b>PrP(Sc)</b> is the key event in prion diseases. The disease can occur spontaneously genetically or by infection. In earlier studies we presented an in vitro conversion system which simulates the structural transition in recPrP by varying low concentrations of SDS at constant NaCl. In the present study we adopted the conversion system from experimental Scrapie in hamster to bovine recPrP and generated amyloid fibrils. The intermediate state which is optimal for fibril formation is a soluble, beta-rich state. The system was extended using BSE-prions as seeds and led to an acceleration of fibril formation by orders of magnitude. This seeded amyloid formation assay avoids any PK-treatment, is therefore able to detect even PK-sensitive PrP(Sc) and does not require cellular components...|$|R
