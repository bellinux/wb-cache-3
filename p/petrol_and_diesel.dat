5|$|The 1980s were {{challenging}} for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried {{to revive the}} industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive chassis cab models {{with a choice of}} <b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> powerplants. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports hatchback. The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{retail prices}} of <b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> {{are high in}} India to make {{electricity}} driven vehicles more economical {{as more and more}} electricity is generated from solar energy in near future without appreciable environmental effects. During the year 2013, many IPPs offered to sell solar power below 6.50 Rs/kWh to feed into the low voltage (< 33 KV) grid. This price is below the affordable electricity retail tariff for the solar power to replace <b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> use in transport sector.|$|E

25|$|The {{wholesale}} price of Mogas 95 unleaded petrol is the regional benchmark, including the benchmark price for Australia. This {{is a result}} of Singapore having a large refining capacity.

The retail price of Australian petrol is thus influenced by the {{wholesale price}} of petrol in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|In {{the area}} of fuels, the 2001 Biofuels Directive {{requires}} that 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (<b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel)</b> should be replaced by biofuels by 31 December 2010, with an intermediate target of 2% {{by the end of}} 2005. In February 2007 the European Commission proposed that, from 2011, suppliers will have to reduce carbon emissions per unit of energy by 1% a year from 2010 levels, to result in a cut of 10% by 2020 Stricter fuel standards to combat climate change and reduce air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Located {{south of}} Perth, the heavy {{industrial}} area of Kwinana has the nation's largest oil refinery with {{a capacity of}} 146,000 barrels of oil per day, producing most of the state's <b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel.</b> Kwinana also hosts alumina and nickel processing plants, port facilities for grain and other bulk exports, and support industries for mining and petroleum such as heavy and light engineering, and metal fabrication. Shipbuilding (e.g. Austal Ships) and associated support industries are found at nearby Henderson, just north of Kwinana. Significant secondary industries include cement and building product manufacturing, flour milling, food processing, animal feed production, automotive body building and printing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} of fuels, the 2001 Biofuels Directive {{requires}} that 5.75% of all transport fossil fuels (<b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel)</b> should be replaced by biofuels by 31 December 2010, with an intermediate target of 2% {{by the end of}} 2005. However, MEPs have since voted to lower this target in the wake of new scientific evidence about the sustainability of biofuels and the impact on food prices. In a vote in Strasbourg, the European parliament’s environment committee supported a plan to curb the EU target for renewable sources in transport to 4% by 2015. They also said that a thorough review would be required in 2015 before the EU could progress to an 8–10% mark by 2020.|$|E

25|$|The EU has mainly {{acted to}} {{mitigate}} road transport greenhouse emissions mainly through its voluntary agreement on CO2 emissions from cars and subsequently through Regulation 443/2009 which sets mandatory CO2 emission limits for new cars. The EU promoted {{the use of}} biofuels through the directive on {{the promotion of the}} use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport (2003/30/EC), also known as Biofuel Directive, which calls for countries across the EU aiming at replacing 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (<b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel)</b> with biofuels by 2010. None of these regulations, however, were based on carbon intensity of fuel. Fuel quality standards in the European Union are regulated by Directive 98/70/EC.|$|E
25|$|After the visa-free {{arrangement}} was activated, border trade has picked up. Norwegians buy <b>petrol</b> <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> {{for less than}} half the price in Norway. This is the border in Europe with largest difference in fuel price. Norwegians also buy some Russian products such as building material and some services like hair dressing. Products produced in EU, Japan etc. such as clothes and electronics are more expensive in Russia because of tolls so Russians often buy them tax-free in Kirkenes. There are restrictions on food import in both directions, especially meat, and alcohol may only be imported into Norway if staying in Russia more than 24 hours, so food and alcohol are less often traded, which otherwise are the most traded goods over the Sweden–Norway and Finland–Norway border.|$|E

Experiments and developments of independent front suspension, air suspension, rubber suspension, glass fibre construction and disc brakes take place during the 1950s. 1959 sees {{the introduction of a}} turbocharged coach capable of almost 100mph, for non-stop motorway services. High speed (motorway) buses are developed with passenger toilets.
