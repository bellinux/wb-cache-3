40|$|Categories {{are known}} to be useful for {{organizing}} structural aspects of mathematics. However, they are also useful in finding out what structure can be dismissed (coherence theorems) and hence in aiding calculations. We want to illustrate this for finite set theory, linear algebra, and group representation theory. We begin with some combinatorial set theory. Let N denote the set of natural numbers. We identify each n⁄⁄Œ⁄⁄N with the finite set n = { j⁄⁄Œ⁄⁄N: 0 £ j < n}. However, we must be careful to distinguish the cartesian product m ⁄⁄ ¥ ⁄⁄n = { (i⁄⁄,⁄⁄j) : 0 £ i < m, 0 £ j < n} from the isomorphic set mn. Let S denote the skeletal category of finite sets; explicitly, the objects are the n⁄⁄Œ⁄⁄N and the morphisms are the functions between these sets. We need to discuss the explicit construction of finite products in S⁄⁄. Let <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> n, : mn aAm and <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> n, : mn aAn be the functions given by <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> n, (k) = i and <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> n, (k) = j where k = i ⁄⁄n + j. That <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> n, and <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> n, are functions, and that (mn⁄⁄, ⁄ <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> n,,⁄ ⁄ <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> n,) is the categorical binary product of m and n in S⁄⁄, follow from the fact that each natural number 0 £ k < mn has a unique expression i n the form k = i ⁄⁄n + j with 0 £ i < m and 0 £ j < n. Moreover, each natural number 0 £ h < mnp has a unique expression h = i ⁄⁄n ⁄⁄p + j ⁄⁄p + k with 0 £ i < m ⁄, 0 £ j < n and 0 £ k < p. So, referring to the diagram mnp mn <b>m</b> n <b>p</b> mnp np <b>m</b> n <b>p</b> p 1 mn p, p 0 mn <b>p,</b> <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> n, <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> np, <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> np, <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> n, <b>p</b> 1 n p, p 0 n p, we see that <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> n, ∞ ⁄ p 0 mn p, = <b>p</b> 0 <b>m</b> np,, <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> n, ∞ ⁄ p 0 mn p, = = p 0 n p, ∞ ⁄ <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> np,, <b>p</b> 1 mn p, = p 1 n p, ∞ ⁄ <b>p</b> 1 <b>m</b> np,.

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} and mechanism of P 2 -microglobulin (<b>P</b> 2 <b>M)</b> removal {{by a new}} polyacrylonitrile membrane dialyser (CX 2), and the physiokinetics of <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> during treatment were studied. In vitro experiments showed that mean pore size of the CX 2 membrane was 120 A, and the molecular cut-off point was less than 66 000 daltons. The diffusive capacity of the PAN 12 CX 2 dialyser (1. 2 <b>m</b> 2) for <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> was calculated to be 27. 3 ml/min at a blood flow of 200 ml/min, and it was considered that, compared to the elimination by local filtration induced by back-filtration and adsorption, diffusion was the major eliminating mechanism for <b>P</b> 2 <b>M.</b> Although the elimin-ation of <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> increased linearly by augumentation of the ultrafiltration volume, diffusion was a major contributing factor for <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> removal even in haemodiafiltration. Serum <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> decreased to 51 % and 44 % of initial values after correction of haemoconcentration by a clinical hae-modialysis or haemodiafiltration even under relatively low blood and filtrate flow conditions, and sieving coef-ficient and clearance of CX 2 for <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> compared well with in vitro results. The one-pool model simulation demon-strated that from 50 to 60 mg of <b>P</b> 2 <b>M</b> was transferred from the intra- to the extracellular space during treatment.

5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E
