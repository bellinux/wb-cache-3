50|$|Until 1973, company {{profits were}} taxed as profits, and {{dividend}} payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a <b>partial</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies {{were required to}} withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits. (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a dividend received a tax credit representing the ACT paid, which could be set off against their overall income tax liability. Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.|$|E
40|$|An {{overlooked}} {{aspect of}} the debate surrounding Australia’s dividend <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> is the international experience with dividend imputation. Between 1999 and 2008, nine countries removed their dividend <b>imputation</b> <b>systems.</b> A number of questions arise. What was the motivation for removing imputation? How were dividends taxed after imputation was removed? What happened to corporate tax rates? And ultimately, what are the lessons for Australia? This paper seeks to provide answers to these questions. Along with Canada, Chile, Mexico and New Zealand, Australia is one of o nly five countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that continues to operate a full <b>imputation</b> tax <b>system</b> where all corporate tax is credited to domestic shareholders. Malta, a non-OECD country, also has a full <b>imputation</b> <b>system.</b> The OECD lists Korea and the United Kingdom as operating <b>partial</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>systems.</b> However, as the tax credits provided in these countries are not linked {{to the amount of}} corporate tax paid, these are not true <b>imputation</b> tax <b>systems.</b> Many countries have shifted away from <b>imputation</b> <b>systems,</b> including the United Kingdom (1999), Ireland (1999), Germany (2001), Singapore (2003), Italy (2004), Finland (2005), France (2005), Norway (2006) and Malaysia (2008).

50|$|The basic {{structure}} of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a <b>partial</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> was introduced for dividend payments. Unlike the previous imputation system, the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid the advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed). Individuals and companies who received a dividend from a UK company received a tax credit representing the ACT paid. Individuals could set off the tax credit against their income tax liability.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} comparative and comprehensive understanding of corporate dividend policy in European Countries. I examine the dividend policy of the firm in the UK, Germany, France and Italy. The thesis is motivated by the importance of dividend policy theory {{in the area of}} finance, the mixed theoretical and empirical evidence, the predominately US based literature and by the financial, institutional and corporate governance differences between European countries. The thesis examines the "big three imperfections" of the dividend policy: taxation, asymmetric information and agency costs. The uniqueness of the thesis is its European character. The main argument is that differences in taxation and corporate governance systems between European countries can prove a useful tool for providing some answers to the dividend puzzle. With respect to dividend taxation systems the UK operates a <b>partial</b> <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> while Germany, France and Italy operate full imputation systems. With respect to the corporate governance systems the UK is characterised as a market-based country while Germany, France and Italy are characterised as bank-based systems. In general results show that there are significant differences between dividend taxation systems in European countries that result in variations of the tax discrimination variable. In all countries ex-day returns are positive and significant suggesting that ex-day prices fall by less than the amount of dividends. Results confirm that in countries where the differential taxation between dividends and capital gains is high, ex-day returns are high. Also, I find that changes in the tax systems that affect taxes on dividend and/or capital gains alter significantly ex-day returns. Furthermore, the corporate governance differences between market-based and bank-based countries result in different levels of information asymmetries and/or agency conflicts. Results in all the countries show significant share price reaction on the dividend announcement days. Evidence provides support to the information content of dividend hypothesis. Moreover, I do not find evidence to reject the signalling hypothesis over the over investment hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} methods to efficiently estimate the mean response in a linear model with an unknown error distribution {{under the assumption}} that the responses are missing at random. We show how the asymptotic variance is affected by the estimator of the regression parameter and by the imputation method. To estimate the regression parameter the Ordinary Least Squares method is efficient only if the error distribution happens to be normal. If the errors are not normal, then we propose a One Step Improvement estimator or a Maximum Empirical Likelihood estimator to estimate the parameter efficiently. In order to investigate the impact that imputation has on estimation of the mean response, we compare the Listwise Deletion method and the Propensity Score method (which do not use imputation at all), and two imputation methods. We show that Listwise Deletion and the Propensity Score method are inefficient. <b>Partial</b> <b>Imputation,</b> where only the missing responses are imputed, is compared to Full Imputation, where both missing and non-missing responses are imputed. Our results show that in general Full Imputation is better than <b>Partial</b> <b>Imputation.</b> However, when the regression parameter is estimated very poorly, then <b>Partial</b> <b>Imputation</b> will outperform Full Imputation.

40|$|Extract] Division 220 {{facilitates}} {{the entry of}} New Zealand resident companies to the Australian <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> {{to gain access to}} franking credits when they make payments of Australian income tax or withholding tax or receive a franked distribution from an Australian company. These Australian franking credits can then be passed on to the NZ companies' Australian shareholders, alleviating the double taxation otherwise suffered by those shareholders from the "triangular" nature of their investment. Australian shareholders will access their franking benefits on a pro rata basis, ie in proportion to their shareholding in the NZ company. The taxation problems created by trans-Tasman triangular investments and the background to the enactment of Div 220 are examined in [220. 1040]. The Regulatory Impact Statement prepared for the legislation that enacted Div 220 (see [220. 1040]) estimated that between 500 and 1, 000 NZ companies would elect to enter the Australian <b>imputation</b> <b>system,</b> while between 50 and 100 large Australian companies (and an unknown number of smaller companies) may benefit from the reciprocal changes to the NZ <b>imputation</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|Countries {{around the}} globe are {{currently}} struggling with the seemingly conflicting goals of maintaining the integrity of their company / shareholder tax regime whilst not presenting a disincentive to both inward and outward investment. In this regard, the standard adopted by most deveoped nations, the <b>imputation</b> <b>system,</b> is proving difficult {{to adapt to the}} pressures of a global economy. <b>Imputation</b> <b>systems</b> can generate a particularly perverse taxation result in circumstances where a country is merely a conduit for the flow of foreign source income and also in so called triangular situations. Whilst many countries have enacted special conduit relief provisions, few have tackled the problems presented by triangular taxation. Reforms to a country's imputation regime necessary to tackle triangular taxation are comprehensive, complex and problematic. In fact the current worldwide trend is towards credit and exemption regimes partly because of issues such as conduit and triangular taxation. This is to be contrasted with the Australian and New Zealand experiment. It is suggested that notwithstanding the trade-off in equity (and possibly revenue), the adoption of an alternative company/shareholder taxation regime may be preferable to attempting to amend the <b>imputation</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

We also formulate the input files that are needed to run the CANCEIS software. The advantages of using DLT are that {{it is easy to}} understand the edit rules; and DLTs are input, not part of the software, making it easier to change when edit rules are changed. We also compare the imputation results between the CANCEIS experiments and the 2006 Census Edited File. The comparison is for our curiosity beause the constructed DLTs are not identical to the edit rules specified in the 2006 edit specs.

We also discuss potential impacts if the <b>imputation</b> <b>system</b> was dismantled or adjusted, perhaps in conjunction with a reduction in the corporate tax rate. A key theme is that the financial effects of imputation are often contentious. Most notably, the impact of imputation credits on share prices and cost of capital is subject to much debate: the notion that imputation is not priced is an extreme position, and an unreliable basis for policy formulation. More attention should be afforded to how imputation influences the behaviour of investors and companies. In this respect, the incentive that imputation provides for increasing dividend payouts is one of its clearest effects; and a key benefit through enhancing discipline in the use of capital. The effects of any removal of imputation are likely to be felt most strongly among smaller, domestic companies...|$|R

These problems are critical because the structures and mechanisms of the missing data are usually more complicated than other longitudinal studies with fewer repeated measures. For an incomplete longitudinal data set, different longitudinal modeling strategies are developed based on various assumptions on the mechanisms underlying the missingness. In this paper, we demonstrate a systematic method to test the missingness mechanisms underlying intermittent missing data (occasional missed data points) and dropouts (missing data due to premature withdrawal). For dropouts, we use a dimension-reduction technique based on bootstrap and multiple <b>partial</b> <b>imputation.</b> Based on the procedure demonstrated, proper longitudinal modeling choices can be recommended...|$|R
