40|$|The explorative {{research}} is {{set out to}} evaluate if FAWE Rwanda Chapter has, {{in the eyes of}} informants, implemented the objectives set for their school program; ‘The Centre of Excellence for Girls’. By a target achievement evaluation model aims this research to explore if the organizational structure design of ‘The Centre of Excellence for Girls’ has had any impact on FAWE Rwanda Chapter’s possibilities to successfully implement their objectives. This research includes six depth-interviews with informants from ‘The Centre of Excellence for Girls’ and one depth-interview with an informant from FAWE Rwanda Chapter. Questionnaire forms where handed out to two of the <b>participating</b> <b>informant</b> groups; the teachers and the students at ‘The Centre of Excellence for Girls’. Forty questionnaire forms were handed out to the students and ten questionnaire forms to the teachers, with the purpose to support or weaken the data given from the depth-interviews. The result shows that FAWE Rwanda Chapter has not completely succeeded to implement their set objectives. Some of the objectives are implemented, while some are not! The result shows that the decentralized organizational structure of ‘The Centre of Excellence’ is rather complicated. This has lead up to lacks in the information flow and miscommunication in between the organizational levels, and lacks in understanding the purpose of the objectives...|$|E

Hur uppfattningar om etnicitet, ras och nationalitet, relaterar till kulturella skillnader och hur andrafiering och {{stereotyper}} motiveras och betraktas. Informanterna i studien visar generellt en stor tolerans mot andra men visar också tydliga tendenser till andrafiering och ingruppsbias. I sina tolkningar av ”den kulturellt andre” märks att de baserar sina antaganden och resonemang på individuella och kollektiva gruppstereotyper. De accepterar inte interpersonella uttryck för rasism och diskriminering men är relativt omedvetna om vad som skapar strukturell diskriminering och de är också mer toleranta mot diskriminering motiverat av vinstintresse.  Through {{this study}} I {{will attempt to}} show how a public might understand and relate to prejudice, racism and discrimination.

40|$|Title: The {{frightening}} subject: child sexuality – {{a qualitative}} interview study {{about a few}} preschool teachers approach to child sexuality. Author: Linda Olsson Mentor: Victoria Kawesa Term: autumn of 2015 The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate how child sexuality is imagined and understood according to the experiences and knowledge of four different preschool teachers. My main focus lied within finding out how preschool teachers approach the subject by asking them to share their experiences of children’s sexual behaviors. This is a qualitative study and the method used to collect the material was interviews. Four preschool teachers were asked to participate in my study. The theoretical approach in this independent work is social constructivism, and an intersectional perspective is used to analyze the results. The interviews are analyzed from a discourse analysis point of view, which means that my conclusions are based on my interpretations of how the informants in the study talk about and react to the subject. My main conclusions are that the different preschool teachers in my study treats the subject in different ways, and the approach towards children’s sexual expressions is handled in many various ways. All of the <b>participating</b> <b>informants</b> agreed that more education about child sexuality is needed. Another conclusion that my study confirms is that the subject is hard to talk about, among teachers, between teachers and parents and among children and grown ups.

40|$|The issue, with {{international}} and national overtones, of direct {{relevance to the}} present study, relates to the shaping of beginning teachers’ identities in the workplace. As the shift from an initial teacher education programme into initial practice in schools {{is a period of}} identity change worthy of investigation, this study focuses on the transformative search by nine beginning primary teachers for their teaching identities, throughout the course of their initial year of occupational experience, post-graduation. The nine beginning teacher participants work in a variety of primary school settings, thus strengthening the representativeness of the research cohort. Privileging ‘insider’ perspectives, the research goal is to understand the complexities of lived experience from the viewpoints of the <b>participating</b> <b>informants.</b> The shaping of identity is conceived of in dimensional terms. Accordingly, a framework composed of three dimensions of beginning teacher experience is devised, namely: contextual; emotional; temporo-spatial. Data collection and analysis is informed by principles derived from sociocultural theories; activity theory; figured worlds theory; and, dialogical self theory. Individual, face-to-face semi-structured interviews, and the maintenance of solicited digital diaries, are the principal methods of data collection employed. The use of a dimensional model fragments the integrated learning experiences of beginning teachers into constituent parts for the purpose of analysis. While acknowledging that the actual journey articulated by each participant is a more complex whole {{than the sum of its}} parts, key empirically-based claims are presented as per the dimensional framework employed: contextuality; emotionality; temporo-spatiality. As a result of applying the foci of an international literature to an under-researched aspect of Irish education, this study is offered as a context-specific contribution to the knowledge base on beginning teaching. As the developmental needs of beginning teachers constitute an emerging area of intense policy focus in Ireland, this research undertaking is both relevant and timely...|$|R

The conclusions drawn from the results is that teachers found all strategies listed by the Swedish National Agency for Education to have importance even though some were more important than others. Furthermore, with regards to the vocabulary learning, the conclusion has been drawn that teachers use several techniques in their teaching. However, the summary of the vocabulary strategies shows the importance to vary.

This study will evaluate police practice of this law (Paragraph 219 under the Penal Code of 1902, paragraph 282 / 283 according to the Penal Code of 2005). Special trained police officers and others working within law enforcement, such as prosecutors and judges, have <b>participated</b> as <b>informants</b> in this study. They have answered questions about what challenges and dilemmas this legal provision offers. The challenges appear at two levels: The law against repeated and severe domestic abuse requires {{a significant amount of}} police resources that involves hard prioritizing. Furthermore, what kind of actions should be highlighted in a domestic abuse investigation is another issue as there is no clear definition of ‘abuse’. It is insufficient to merely read the legal text in order to grasp what it criminalizes – one also has to research the legal sources. The Supreme Court has decided that in order to apply this law a regime of control and violence must be evident within the close relationship. In identifying such a regime, the police must not only pay attention to the specific incidents of physical violence, but also focus on what happens in between these events. The totality and complexity of domestic abuse including the psychological violence involved is of major importance with regard to how the law against repeated and severe domestic abuse is enforced...|$|R

Contrary to the assertions of multiple studies that failures of PMTCT programs are a result of inadequate knowledge of mother-to-child transmission and PMTCT interventions, lack of support and acceptance by family and community, as well as poor quality of services, this study found these factors to be statistically insignificant in explaining PMTCT achievements. The study further found that HIV/AIDS related stigma and gender imbalances create many missed opportunities for HIV-positive mothers to apply acquired knowledge on mother-to-child transmission and PMTCT interventions, mobilize support from family and community, and access more affordable care. Factors found to influence women’s decisions to utilize and adhere to PMTCT services include supportive counseling, striving for motherhood, maternal attachment and concern for the child’s wellbeing, assurance of confidentiality and testimonials of other successful mothers. Based on the study findings, policy recommendations have been proposed along with suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} to what extent there was congruence between the thinking of {{the framers of the}} Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP) between 1989 and 1991, and the parents participating in the program today. To this end, the original goals of the framers were examined as well as their current reflections on how the program actually works in the 2006 - 2007 school year, and parents were asked to explore their reasons for participation in the program in the 2006 - 2007 school year. The specific research questions investigated were: (1) What was the original intent of the framers/activists of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program? (2) From the framers 2 ̆ 7 perspectives, how has the program changed or developed in relation to their original thoughts? (3) How has the thinking of the framers changed over time? (4) From the parents 2 ̆ 7 perspectives, why do parents participate in the program today? (5) Is the parents 2 ̆ 7 intent congruent with the framers or do the parents have different motives for participation? Six framers and four parent focus groups consisting of between three and five parents in each <b>participated</b> as <b>informants</b> in this qualitative study. Interviews were transcribed, inductively coded and, using the constant comparative method, multiple key themes were identified and grounded theory developed. This study surfaced three major themes and explored the perspectives of the framers and participating parents on these themes concerning the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program: the importance of parental empowerment, program leadership, and school accountability. Implications for both the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program leaders and participants and others seeking to learn from the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program experience are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Author's {{version of}} {{an article in the}} journal: Nursing Ethics. Also avaliable from the {{publisher}} at: httjp://dx. doi. org/ 10. 1177 / 0969733012455564 The aim of the article is to show the importance of moral sensitivity when including persons with dementia in research. The article presents and discusses ethical challenges encountered when a total of fifteen persons with dementia from two nursing homes and seven proxies were included in a qualitative study. The examples show that ethical challenges may be unpredictable. As researcher you <b>participate</b> with the <b>informants</b> in their daily life and in the interview situation, and {{it is not possible to}} plan all that may happen. A procedural proposal to an ethical committee at the beginning of a research project based on traditional research ethical principles may serve as a guideline, but it cannot solve all the ethical problems one faces during the research process. Our main argument in the article is therefore that, moral sensitivity is required in addition to the traditional research ethical principles throughout the whole process observing and interviewing the respondents...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 46) Social indicator and key informant {{approaches to}} needs assessment were utilized {{in the present}} study to explore the need for mental health services among the immobilized. The immobilized population was defined as those who were psychologically or physically disabled such that they were unable to use public transportation and therefore unable to use existing services. The social indicator approach identified four high risk groups as possible homebound individuals. These groups were: aged living alone; aged persons in poverty; disabled or handicapped; and, disabled or handicapped and unable to work. Trained volunteer interviewers were used to contact agencies designated as key informants. Fifty key <b>informants</b> <b>participated</b> in the telephone interview. Forty-five of these agencies had received requests from the target population. Only 13. 3 % of the agencies which had received requests for services felt they could provide them. It was concluded that a need for such services exists, is net being currently met, and that an appropriate program should be establishe...|$|R
