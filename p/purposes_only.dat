According to the Notitia, the tribuni (commanders) of the scholae {{reported to the}} magister officiorum, a senior civilian official. However, this was probably for administrative <b>purposes</b> <b>only.</b> On campaign, a tribunus scholae probably reported direct to the emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the opening phases of the East Timor {{operation}} began in 1999, the issue regarding the purpose of the Army Reserve still had not been resolved. Instead of being able to provide formed units to augment the Regular Army, the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round-out <b>purposes</b> <b>only.</b> As a result, in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET, mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing. As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000, however, a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full-time service.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway {{opened in}} late 1853, {{and the effects}} on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite {{petitions}} from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was maintained for drain <b>purposes</b> <b>only.</b> Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until {{the early years of}} the 20th century. There is still a public right of navigation as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{entry into}} the war in late 1941 stopped plans for the {{deployment}} of Australian armour to the Middle East. By the beginning of 1943 the Australian Armoured Corps was at its peak with 1,460 tanks on strength, {{the majority of them}} Matildas and light and medium M3s. Meanwhile, 65 production AC1 vehicles and one AC3 had been completed by June 1943. That year, the 3rd Army Tank Battalion was equipped with a squadron of AC1 tanks, which were modified to resemble German tanks and used in the filming of the movie, The Rats of Tobruk. This appears to have been the only time a squadron of Sentinels was used for any purpose. Nevertheless, the completed Sentinel tanks were used for evaluation <b>purposes</b> <b>only</b> and were not issued to operational armoured units, as the Australian Cruiser tank program was terminated in July 1943. By this time the Japanese threat had lessened, and US and British-made M3 Grant and Matilda tanks were being supplied to Australia from the Middle East, and it was felt that Australia's manufacturing resources would be better spent on railway locomotive production.|$|E
