A PGRP-LE-dependent induction of autophagy to control Listeria monocytogenes has also been reported. We identified and partially characterized a novel PGRP-LE homologue, from Tenebrio molitor and analyzed its functional role in the survival of the insect against infection by a DAP-type PGN containing intracellular pathogen, L. monocytogenes.

40|$|The gram-positive {{bacterium}} Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} pathogen responsible {{for a variety of}} diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening conditions such as sepsis. Cell wall-associated and secreted proteins (e. g., protein A, hemolysins, and phenol-soluble modulin) and cell wall components (e. g., peptidoglycan and alanylated lipoteichoic acid) {{have been shown to be}} inflammatory, and these staphylococcal components may contribute to sepsis. On the host side, many host factors have been implicated in the innate detection of staphylococcal components. One class of pattern recognition molecules, Toll-like receptor 2, has been shown to function as the transmembrane component involved in the detection of staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid and phenol-soluble modulin and is involved in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes/macrophages in response to these components. Nod 2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2) is the intracellular sensor for muramyl dipeptide, the minimal bioactive structure of peptidoglycan, and it may contribute to the innate immune defense against S. aureus. The staphylococcal virulence factor protein A was recently shown to interact directly with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 in airway epithelium and to reproduce the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Finally, <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> L is an amidase that inactivates the proinflammatory activities of peptidoglycan.

40|$|NOD 2 /CARD 15 is {{the first}} {{characterized}} susceptibility gene in Crohn disease. The Nod 2 1007 fs (Nod 2 fs) frameshift mutation is the most prevalent in Crohn disease patients. Muramyl dipeptide from bacterial peptidoglycan is the minimal motif detected by Nod 2 but not by Nod 2 fs. Here we investigated the response of human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from Crohn disease patients not only to muramyl dipeptide but also to several other muramyl peptides. Most unexpectedly, we observed that patients homozygous for the Nod 2 fs mutation were totally unresponsive to MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) (M-Tri(DAP)), the specific agonist of Nod 1, and to Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. In contrast, PBMCs from a patient homozygous for the Nod 2 R 702 W mutation, also associated with Crohn disease, displayed normal response to Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. In addition, the blockage of the Nod 1 /M-Tri(DAP) pathway could be partially overcome by co-stimulation with the Toll-like receptors agonists lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharide. Investigation into the mechanism of this finding revealed that Nod 2 fs did not act as a dominant-negative molecule for the Nod 1 /M-Tri(DAP) pathway, implying that the blockage is dependent upon the expression or activity of other factors. We demonstrated that PBMCs from Nod 2 fs patients express high levels of the <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> S, a secreted protein known to interact with muramyl peptides. We proposed that through a scavenger function, <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> S may dampen M-Tri(DAP) -dependent responses in Nod 2 fs patients.

PGRP-LCx, the default peptidoglycan receptor of the Imd/Relish pathway, has strong affinity for all polymeric peptidoglycans tested and for monomeric peptidoglycan. PGRP-LCa does not have affinity for polymeric or monomeric peptidoglycan. Instead, PGRP-LCa can form heterodimers with LCx when the latter is bound to monomeric peptidoglycan.

40|$|Genetic {{evidence}} indicates that Drosophila defense against Gram-positive bacteria is mediated by two putative pattern recognition receptors acting upstream of Toll, namely Gram-negative binding protein 1 (GNBP 1) and <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> SA (PGRP-SA). Until now however, the molecular recognition proceedings for sensing of Gram-positive pathogens were not known. In the present, we report the physical interaction between GNBP 1 and PGRP-SA using recombinant proteins. GNBP 1 was able to hydrolyze Gram-positive peptidoglycan (PG), while PGRP-SA bound highly purified PG fragments (muropeptides). Interaction between these proteins was enhanced {{in the presence of}} PG or muropeptides. PGRP-SA binding depended on the polymerization status of the muropeptides, pointing to constraints in the number of PGRP-SA molecules bound for signaling initiation.

40|$|Drosophila <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> LC (PGRP-LC), a {{transmembrane protein}} {{required}} for the response to bacterial infection, acts {{at the top of}} a cytoplasmic signaling cascade that requires the death-domain protein Imd and an IκB kinase to activate Relish, an NF-κB family member. It is not clear how binding of peptidoglycan to the extracellular domain of PGRP-LC activates intracellular signaling because its cytoplasmic domain has no homology to characterized proteins. Here, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC binds Imd and that its cytoplasmic domain is critical for its activity, suggesting that PGRP-LC acts as a signal-transducing receptor. The PGRP-LC cytoplasmic domain is also essential for the formation of dimers, and results suggest that dimerization may be required for receptor activation. The PGRP-LC cytoplasmic domain can mediate formation of heterodimers between different PGRP-LC isoforms, thereby potentially expanding the diversity of ligands that can be recognized by the receptor...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe Drosophila host {{defense against}} gram-negative {{bacteria}} is {{mediated by the}} Imd pathway upon sensing of peptidoglycan by the <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> (PGRP) -LC. Here we report a functional analysis of PGRP-LB, a catalytic member of the PGRP family. We show that PGRP-LB is a secreted protein regulated by the Imd pathway. Biochemical studies demonstrate that PGRP-LB is an amidase that specifically degrades gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycan. In agreement with its amidase activity, PGRP-LB downregulates the Imd pathway. Hence, activation of PGRP-LB by the Imd pathway provides a negative feedback regulation to tightly adjust immune activation to infection. Our study also reveals that PGRP-LB controls the immune reactivity of flies {{to the presence of}} ingested bacteria in the gut.

40|$|SummaryInteractions between commensals and {{the host}} impact the {{metabolic}} and immune status of metazoans. Their deregulation is associated with age-related pathologies like chronic inflammation and cancer, especially in barrier epithelia. Maintaining a healthy commensal population by preserving innate immune homeostasis in such epithelia thus promises to promote health and longevity. Here, we show that, in the aging intestine of Drosophila, chronic activation of the transcription factor Foxo reduces expression of <b>peptidoglycan</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>protein</b> SC 2 (PGRP-SC 2), a negative regulator of IMD/Relish innate immune signaling, and homolog of the anti-inflammatory molecules PGLYRP 1 – 4. This repression causes deregulation of Rel/NFkB activity, resulting in commensal dysbiosis, stem cell hyperproliferation, and epithelial dysplasia. Restoring PGRP-SC 2 expression in enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium, in turn, prevents dysbiosis, promotes tissue homeostasis, and extends lifespan. Our results highlight the importance of commensal control for lifespan of metazoans and identify SC-class PGRPs as longevity-promoting factors...|$|E

40|$|In innate immunity, pattern {{recognition}} molecules recognize cell wall components of microorganisms and activate subsequent immune responses, {{such as the}} induction of antimicrobial peptides and melanization in Drosophila.

PGRP-LC loss-of-function mutations affect the imd-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides and resistance to Gram-negative bacteria, whereas PGRP-LE binds to the DAP-type peptidoglycan, and a gain-of-function mutation induces constitutive activation of both the imd pathway and melanization. Here, we generated PGRP-LE null mutants and report that PGRP-LE functions synergistically with PGRP-LC in producing resistance to Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium infections, which have the DAP-type peptidoglycan. Consistent with this, PGRP-LE acts both upstream and in parallel with PGRP-LC in the imd pathway, and is required for infection-dependent activation of melanization in Drosophila.

The structure reveals important features not observed previously in the complex between PGRP-Iα and a muramyl tripeptide lacking D-Ala at stem positions 4 and 5. Most notable are ligand-induced structural rearrangements in the PGN-binding site that are essential for entry of the C-terminal portion of the peptide stem and for locking MPP in the binding groove.

To define the cell wall components sensed by the host, we used highly purified peptidoglycan fragments of two principal Gram-positive bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We report that in both peptidoglycans, the minimal structure needed to activate the Toll pathway is a muropeptide dimer and that the free reducing end of the N-acetyl muramic acid residues of the muropeptides is essential for activity. Monomeric muropeptides were inactive and inhibitory in combination with dimers. Finally, peptidoglycan was degraded by the haemolymph of wild-type but not GNBP 1 mutant flies.
