In this study we examine the participation of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on the boards of natural gas companies between 1930 and 1998. We focus on the 1938, and 1954 regulation and 1986 partial deregulation of the natural gas industry. Using datasets covering the period from 1930 to 1990 and 1978 to 1998, we test whether regulation and deregulation altered the composition of companies' boards as the firms' environment changed. In particular, did regulation cause an increase and deregulation a decrease, in the number of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on corporate boards? We find evidence that the number of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> increases as firms shift from market to political competition.

40|$|An {{earlier version}} of this paper was {{entitled}} “Deregulation and Board Composition: Evidence on the Value of the Revolving Door. ”It is generally agreed that boards are endogenously determined institutions that serve both oversight and advisory roles in a firm. While the oversight role of boards has been extensively studied, relatively few studies have examined the advisory role of corporate boards. We examine the participation of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> on the boards of natural gas companies between 1930 and 1998. We focus on the expansion of federal regulation of the natural gas industry in 1938 and 1954 and subsequent partial deregulation in 1986. Using data sets covering the periods from 1930 to 1990 and 1978 to 1998, we test whether regulation and deregulation altered the composition of companies' boards as the firms' environment changed.

40|$|I {{investigate}} whether cross-sectional differences among politically connected directors {{are associated with}} differences in tax avoidance behavior. Recent {{research suggests that the}} presence of politically connected directors impacts firms? tax avoidance. However, {{it is likely that the}} influence of a politically connected director depends on the characteristics of the politically connected director. I extend this line of research and explore instances where the influence of politically connected directors on tax avoidance is likely to vary. First, I examine whether the political profile of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> is related to firms? tax avoidance activities. Second, I examine whether the director?s relationship to the political party in power impacts firms? tax avoidance. Finally, I examine whether the length of a director?s government service influences firms? level of tax avoidance. I find evidence of an association between the characteristics of <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> and firms? tax avoidance strategies, but there is variation in the extent of the benefit that some politically connected directors provide. My study is the first study to attempt to empirically identify underlying mechanisms by which <b>political</b> <b>directors</b> influence firms? tax avoidance strategies...|$|R
5|$|Between October 1915 and June 1916, Bogdan-Pitești managed another press venue, Libertatea ("Freedom"). Its <b>political</b> <b>director</b> was retired statesman Nicolae Fleva, later {{replaced}} by Arghezi. In February 1916, Galaction and Arghezi launched Cronica, another review with a pro-German agenda, and which may itself {{have been published}} with discreet assistance from Bogdan-Pitești. Although Bogdan-Pitești, Domnica and Caragiale paid a mysterious visit to Berlin in early 1916, they were never listed as foreign spies by Siguranța Statului counter-intelligence. Bogdan-Pitești's name then surfaced in a February 1916 conversation between German statesman Matthias Erzberger and Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest. Erzberger asked if the Vlaici landowner could ever help advance the Germanophile cause; the Archbishop, a loyal German subject, replied that Bogdan-Pitești was unreliable. Allegations later surfaced that Bogdan-Pitești {{was one of the}} men receiving payoffs from the German spy Albert E. Günther, manager of Steaua Română company. The dossier attesting this was lost, but secondary sources have it that Bogdan-Pitești alone received 840,000 lei from Günther's hands.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, {{it would have made}} him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election <b>political</b> <b>director,</b> as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{the editor}} of the paper l'Observateur was beaten in the street, {{stripped}} naked and photographed by members of the security police a few hundred yards from the Central Police Station.

One of the named deputies, Uch Ven, tabled a censure motion that had been drawn up against the minister.
