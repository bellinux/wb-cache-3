Materials & Method: A total of 104 private dental <b>practitioners</b> {{participated in the}} survey, of which 40 dentists were only private <b>practitioners</b> and 73 dentists were private <b>practitioners</b> as well as academicians. A closed ended questionnaire was administered to all the private dental <b>practitioners</b> of Davangere city.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the role of {{complementary}} and alternative medical (CAM) <b>practitioners</b> in integrative practices where general <b>practitioners</b> (GPs) and CAM <b>practitioners</b> were co-located. Design: This study used grounded theory, a qualitative methodology from the interpretive paradigm. Setting: A total of 23 integrative <b>practitioners</b> (10 general <b>practitioners</b> and 13 naturopaths) were interviewed. The informants were drawn from 16 integrative practices and one non-integrative general medical practice. Results: In 11 out of 16 integrative practices the CAM <b>practitioners</b> yielded their primary contact role to the GPs. CAM <b>practitioners</b> were restricted to expanding the range of treatment options available to patients. However, the role of the CAM <b>practitioners</b> was influenced by the level of CAM training the GP(s) in the practice had undertaken. The more CAM training the GPs had undertaken, the more CAM <b>practitioners</b> were enlisted as diagnosticians as well as treatment providers. Conclusion: CAM <b>practitioners</b> in integrative practices had an accessory role to the GPs in the practice, deferring diagnosis and assessment activities to the GPs. However, where GPs had significant training in CAM, the CAM <b>practitioner's</b> role included both treatment and diagnostic activities. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the level of}} psychotherapy knowledge of general <b>practitioners,</b> especially {{in the field of}} transference. To {{evaluate the}} impact of general practitioners’ training level on the frequency and nature of emotions felt by the physicians towards their patients. Methods: We used a sample of 202 general <b>practitioners,</b> who were asked to answer 30 questions and were divided into three groups, using the “training scale”. The three groups were: <b>practitioners</b> with a practical and theoretical training, <b>practitioners</b> with a practical training only, and <b>practitioners</b> without any training. Results: Most of the <b>practitioners</b> trained for psychoanalysis (63. 89 %) declared having already experienced positive and negative transference. On this opposite, the majority of non-trained <b>practitioners</b> (51. 06 %) confessed that they had never been subjected to transference. Among non-trained <b>practitioners,</b> 37. 59 % indicated using psychoanalytical concepts to promote recovery of their patients, as compared to 80. 56 % of trained <b>practitioners,</b> this difference being statistically significant. Finally, the <b>practitioner’s</b> training level was directly proportional to the frequency of love feeling experienced during their consultations. Only this feeling presented a statistically significant correlation. Conclusion: <b>Practitioners</b> trained for psychoanalysis declared experiencing transference in consultation and using the concepts learned to improve the therapeutic relationship. Only the love feeling was statistically more detected by trained <b>practitioners,</b> who can use it as a therapeutic leverage or at least a mean to avoid a deterioration of the physician-patient relationship...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{characteristics of}} collaboration between nurse <b>practitioners</b> and medical <b>practitioners</b> {{in the primary}} healthcare setting in Australia. Background: Recent definitions of collaboration in the literature describe it as being based on communication, shared decision-making and the respect and equality of team members. However, research demonstrates a tension between this theoretical ideal and how collaboration between nurse <b>practitioners</b> and medical <b>practitioners</b> occurs in practice. Different socialization processes of the two professions and legislative requirements influence collaborative practice. The way these two professions overcome traditional boundaries and realize collaborative practice in the primary healthcare setting needs to be examined. Design: Mixed methods multiple case study including up to six sites {{with a minimum of}} six and a maximum of 20 participants in total. Methods: Data on collaborative practice between nurse <b>practitioners</b> and medical <b>practitioners</b> in primary health care will be collected in three phases: (1) two-week direct observation in the practice setting to capture actual behaviour and context; (2) questionnaire to measure dimensions of collaboration; and (3) one-to-one semi-structured interviews with nurse <b>practitioners,</b> medical <b>practitioners</b> and practice managers to record experiences, perceptions and understanding of collaboration. Discussion: Triangulation of findings will generate a comprehensive understanding of how collaboration between nurse <b>practitioners</b> and medical <b>practitioners</b> in Australia occurs in the primary care setting.
