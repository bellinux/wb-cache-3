My objective was to study current changes in the field of Information and Media Education (IME) in today’s digital world. I assessed {{the degree to which the}} info-documentary dimension has been progressively introduced into the curricula of traditional disciplines and whether this resulted in curricular recompositions. Specifically, I wanted to identify the scope and the contents of this education with the aim to understand whether or not it could build an info-documentary look that might provide an interpretative framework for understanding the world. I will present the French research context as a first step. Regarded as a necessity today, information and media education is an unified concept marked by a shift from a singular to a pluralist conception of information culture “in the new age”. As a field of practice, information-documentation has not been regarded as a discipline. But recent official documents, introduced “interdisciplinary practical teachings”, focusing on digital learning and linking information-communication and citizenship. A clear reference was made to information and communication sciences and to the sociology of culture and media. And the role of teacher-librarian was more prominent as he or she was described as the person in charge of supervising the acquisition by all students of “an information and media culture”. However, without dedicated teaching, information-documentation was addressed only on a pragmatic and operative mode and the responsibility of the different actors remained unclear. Far from opposing ‘education’ and ‘teaching’, I studied these areas of uncertainty. In particular I questioned how the actors seized the institutional guidelines. I was concerned with who did what. To arrive at answers to these and other questions, I administered a questionnaire survey of 17 open and closed questions, to all actors in education (e. g., teachers, teacher-librarians, <b>principal</b> <b>educational</b> <b>advisers,</b> school leaders) via academic mailing lists. In this first research phase the questionnaires helped me attempt to identify trends concerning the integration of IME, including perceived importance, aims and issues, modalities of inclusion, supporting devices, collaborations and partnerships, contents such as knowledge and progression, barriers, and levers to its implementation. This phase helped me prepare for the second stage, more qualitative, stage of data collection. In the second stage I aimed at deepening the understanding of the practices declared by the actors through interviews and observations in a few selected schools. Several elements emerged that highlighted a strong disciplinary mark that can be an obstacle to an open and pluralistic approach of EIM. Key among these results is evidence that information-documentation is rarely thought as an epistemological unit in its continuity and its coherence...|$|R
