40|$|We study {{impact of}} {{multiplexing}} {{on the global}} phase synchronizability of different layers in the delayed coupled multiplex networks. We find that at strong couplings, the multiplexing induces the global synchronization in sparse networks. The introduction of global synchrony depends on the connection density of the layers being multiplexed, which further depends on the underlying network architecture. Moreover, multiplexing {{may lead to a}} transition from a quasi-periodic or chaotic evolution to a periodic evolution. For the periodic case, the multiplexing may lead to a change in the period of the dynamical evolution. Additionally, delay in the couplings may bring upon synchrony to those multiplex networks which do not exhibit synchronization for the undelayed evolution. Using a simple example of two globally connected layers forming a multiplex network, we show how delay brings <b>upon</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> for the inter layer global synchrony, that is not possible for the undelayed evolution.

The generation program used for creating the necessary equilibrium lookup tables to the simulation is validated against an older version to make the generation for different fuel mixtures more consistent. Calculation of the isothermal compressibility of a multiple phase mixture is implemented together with unsuccessful measures to significantly decrease computational power. The program is also successfully modified to generalize the number of reaction products treated. The influence of the table resolution to Rocflam-II simulations is studied using the Vinci subscale thrust chamber.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the anti-HIV drug Elvitegravir (EVG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and UV-visible absorption spectra. The mechanism for quenching the fluorescence of BSA by EVG is discussed. It was found that EVG can quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA through a static quenching procedure. The quenching type, association constant, and number of binding sites were investigated. The binding constant of EVG with BSA was calculated at different temperatures based on fluorescence quenching results. The thermodynamic parameters ΔHθ, ΔGθ, and ΔSθ were determined. The positive ΔSθ and negative ΔHθ and ΔGθ values showed that a spontaneous interaction may involve both roles of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding. The interaction of BSA with EVG was also confirmed by UV absorption spectra. The average distance, r, between donor (BSA) and acceptor (EVG) was obtained according to Förster’s theory of nonradiation energy transfer. Synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra were used to investigate the conformational change of BSA molecules that occur upon addition of EVG and showed, <b>upon</b> binding, <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of increasing hydrophobicity around tryptophan residues of BSA...|$|R

In this study, we report the influence of ESS recorded hourly during the first 8 hours after surgery on the mobility degree, postoperative nonsurgical complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS). Methods. We randomized 1152 surgical patients into three groups for postoperative observation: (1) ESS group (n= 409), (2) Verbal Numeric Rate Scale (VNRS) for pain group (n= 417), and (3) an ordinary qualitative observation (Control) group (n= 326).
