I can tell Ike how to swing, I can teach him to pitch, [...] the game of baseball, but he's {{the only one to}} make it to the big leagues. You can't teach heart and soul. That's what it takes to play in the game.|$|E
500|$|The new {{creative}} team, {{while avoiding}} references aimed specifically at adults, {{was determined not}} to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material. Norris said that her goal was [...] "to make a show that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> was too good for children... we started out with really high ambitions." [...] To that end, adult historical satires such as Blackadder and the Monty Python films were shown at the first writers' meeting to demonstrate the proposed tone, and these influences would be visible throughout the show's run.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, Wainwright paired up with Diane Taylor, {{a former}} Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police, {{to create the}} programme, and the {{production}} expanded from Jones and Lindsay's original concept. From Taylor's perspective, police procedurals were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies, but what she felt were inaccuracies of how officers behaved, saying: [...] "that's what really irritates me in other dramas– detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless. You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is much more interesting. I could pull a thousand cases out of my head <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> would never happen. People need drama because they would not believe the reality".|$|E

500|$|Fantasia told Us Weekly {{that the}} lyrics revolve around [...] "how I don't let {{people talk about}} me {{like they used to}} [...] I control how I feel". She said the song deals with her {{attempted}} suicide and demanding relationships with her family, and how she wanted to bless people through her personal story and music. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Fantasia said the following about the song's message: [...] "I wanted people to know that I've been through the rain, I 've been broken into pieces, I had a daughter at such a young age. There were times <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'That's it for her,' but that didn't happen." [...] Christian Todays Czarina Ong referred to [...] "I Made It" [...] as Fantasia's [...] "victory song" [...] and [...] "her song of success". According to Rito P. Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the song represents how Fantasia has reconciled with her feelings of [...] "heartbreak, betrayal, and the character-forming pain of rejection and failure".|$|E
500|$|According to Houston, {{the song}} was direct, so she wanted the video to be direct and {{concentrate}} {{on her face and}} on the lyrics. Whitaker also expressed a same opinion of the song. He said, [...] "I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she has, you know, that I guess <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> is like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit." [...] The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for Camera Obscura, a journal of feminism and film theory, [...] "the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film." [...] When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior to the beginning of films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E

500|$|Burton {{revealed}} that Dylan is [...] "a lot more" [...] like himself. [...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although some <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "You are Jason and that's it."

So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character."

Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others [...] particularly among the wealthier strata of society [...] deemed him to be [...] "a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as [...] "a smuggler and a bad man. He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts." [...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible better than I do... He is either a very good man or a very bad one, and I can't {{make up my mind}} which." ...|$|E
