25|$|The Oberons were {{equipped}} with Type 187 active-passive sonar, Type 2007 <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> and Type 2019 sonar.|$|E
25|$|H/SQC-1 sonar (with {{transducer}} {{designated as}} Type 604) is a <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> installed on first generation Chinese nuclear submarines {{when they were}} first launched, and it is no longer in service, replaced by H/SQZ-262B.|$|E
25|$|The {{display of}} most <b>passive</b> <b>sonars</b> {{used to be}} a {{two-dimensional}} waterfall display. The horizontal direction of the display is bearing. The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{we propose}} the {{modified}} SED (Subband Energy Detection) which can assign weights {{adapting to the}} receiving signal level for the broadband energy detection in the <b>passive</b> <b>SONARs.</b> SED {{which is one of}} the broadband processing mainly employed by <b>passive</b> <b>SONARs</b> to detect a target is more robust against interference like multi signals or a clutter than CED (Conventional Energy Detection), but it degrades detection performance to assign weights independent of extracted extrema level of the receiving signal. Therefore, in this paper, the weighting method which can efficiently assigns rewards or penalties adapting to extracted extrema level of the receiving signal is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed method, we conducted experiments by using simulation and real ocean acoustic signal which is acquired from Yellow Sea. From the experiments, our proposed method has shown better performance than conventional SED...|$|R
50|$|To {{communicate}} with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude {{is basically a}} sonar telephone. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by <b>passive</b> <b>sonars</b> on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>sonar</b> arrays for {{submarines}} {{were developed}} from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were {{arranged in a}} steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays.|$|E
25|$|The detection, {{classification}} and localisation {{performance of}} a sonar depends {{on the environment and}} the receiving equipment, as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a <b>passive</b> <b>sonar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{gyro compass}} was {{introduced}} in 1908. The first <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> hydrophones were introduced into the RN in 1914 while ASDIC (active sonar) came in afterwards. Radar {{was introduced in}} the 1930s. Wireless (radio) technology greatly improved during the period and direction finding sets were used.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{difficult}} to draw a line between tactical sensors and strategic MASINT sensors. Indeed, the same sensor may be used tactically or strategically. In a tactical role, a submarine might use acoustic sensors—active and passive sonar—to close in on a target or get away from a pursuer. Those same <b>passive</b> <b>sonars</b> may be used by a submarine, operating stealthily in a foreign harbor, to characterize the signature of a new submarine type.|$|R
50|$|Independence {{tested the}} MCM and ASW mission modules for the {{littoral}} combat ship designs {{during the summer}} of 2014. It {{was the first time the}} ship had conducted end-to-end missions, and the crew successfully performed at the high operational tempos. When moving through a mock minefield twice, the suite of counter-mine technologies detected mines each instance and completed search, detect, and destroy phases; it was also the first time all three components of the MCM package had been integrated on board the ship. Testing of the ASW package was conducted in September, where for the first time both the active and <b>passive</b> <b>sonars</b> were towed at once to make sure the two systems did not cross.|$|R
50|$|The Dolphin class {{uses the}} ISUS 90-1 TCS weapon control system {{supplied}} by STN Atlas Elektronik, for automatic sensor management, fire control, navigation, and operations. The installed radar warning receiver is a 4CH(V)2 Timnex {{electronic support measures}} system, scanning from 2GHz to 18GHz frequency bands and able to pinpoint radar sites with accuracy between 1.4 and 5 degrees of angle (depending on frequency). It is developed by Elbit in Haifa. Active surface search radar is an Elta unit operating on I band. The sonar suite includes the Atlas Elektronik CSU 90 hull-mounted passive and active search and attack <b>sonar.</b> The PRS-3 <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar</b> is also supplied by Atlas Elektronik, the flank array is a FAS-3 <b>passive</b> search <b>sonar.</b> The submarines have two Kollmorgen periscopes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>sonar</b> listens without transmitting. It {{is often}} {{employed}} in military settings, {{although it is}} also used in science applications, e.g., detecting fish for presence/absence studies in various aquatic environments - see also passive acoustics and passive radar. In the very broadest usage, this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound, though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>sonar</b> {{systems may}} have large sonic databases, but the sonar {{operator}} usually finally classifies the signals manually. A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e. {{the speed of}} a ship, or the type of weapon released), and even particular ships. Publications for classification of sounds are provided by and continually updated by the US Office of Naval Intelligence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>sonar</b> on {{vehicles}} {{is usually}} severely limited because of noise {{generated by the}} vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{intent was}} to build the {{submarines}} in Canada to an existing NATO design. CASAP and NSOS were merged to form a group to select the submarine design. The group developed the Statement of Requirement (SOR) needed {{for the evaluation of}} designs. The SOR called for a safe, reliable design that had modern anti-submarine warfare and under-ice capability, being capable of breaking through ice up to 3 m thick. The SOR placed less emphasis on hydrodynamic performances or anti-ship and inshore operational capabilities. They also needed to have a low noise and radiation signatures, the most modern <b>passive</b> <b>sonars</b> and command, control and communications systems. The SOR also stated that the submarine have six torpedo tubes and be able to fire the Mark 48 torpedo.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{estimating}} spatial and temporal frequencies using a sensor array. The attention is focused on radar applications, but the models and techniques treated could be of interest {{in a wide range of}} applications such as communications, <b>passive</b> sensors, <b>sonar,</b> seismology and medical imaging...|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Clamagore {{became one}} of only nine boats to undergo the GUPPY III conversion. [...] She had a 15 ft hull {{extension}} added forward of the control room, a plastic sail and the BQG-4 PUFFS <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar,</b> which included the three sharkfin sensors on her deck.|$|R
25|$|Between 2004 and 2006, the Indonesian Type 209/1300 {{submarine}} Cakra {{underwent a}} refurbishment by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in South Korea. The refurbished submarine featured new batteries, overhauled engines, and modernized combat system. Both submarines' existing STN Atlas-Elektronik CSU 3-2 sonar suite were replaced with L-3 ELAC Nautik's LOPAS 8300 <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> system and Kongsberg MSI-90U MK2 CMS. In 2009, Daewoo won another order to refurbish Nanggala, which {{was completed in}} early 2012.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{deployed}} U-boats (submarines) {{after the}} war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the Kaiserliche Marine employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats {{led to the development}} of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (<b>passive</b> <b>sonar,</b> 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines (HMS R-1, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918). To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.|$|E
25|$|Since {{active sonar}} reveals the {{presence}} and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods {{to minimize the risk}} of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to <b>passive</b> <b>sonar.</b> In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.|$|E
25|$|H/SQG-4 <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar</b> is {{also known}} as Type 204 sonar, it can be either used as part of H/SQZ-262 {{integrated}} sonar system, or as an independent system. Started in 1987, SQG-4 incorporated western technologies, namely French Thomson-CSF DUUX-5, and it deploys three arrays {{on each side of the}} submarine.|$|R
50|$|All boats {{received}} the BQG-4 PUFFS <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar,</b> identifiable {{by the three}} shark fin-like sonar domes added to the topside superstructure. The conning tower in the sail gained an additional five-foot (1.5 m) section to accommodate the Mk 101 fire control system and Mk 37 director. All GUPPY III boats received a plastic sail.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} sensor suites on board {{submarines}} the <b>Passive</b> Ranging <b>Sonar</b> (PRS) {{is a separate}} sensor, usually with three or more hydrophone groups {{on either side of}} the submarine. The aperture of this sensor is limited by the length of the boat, which makes ranging up to moderate distances possible. The combination of the towed and flank array sonar can be used to create a <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar</b> with a much larger acoustic aperture, resulting in a very long ranging capacity. Based on simulated data a calculation method was developed that combines adaptive beamformers, fine bearing estimation and a target localisation technique originating from an acoustic artillery ranging system. The method was evaluated on operational recordings of a towed and flank array sensor. If the target is detectable on both sensors, ranging can be performed instantaneous. The method is robust and can provide an increased passive ranging performance...|$|R
25|$|Modern naval warfare makes {{extensive}} use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.|$|E
25|$|The {{breaking}} waves {{created in}} the shallow waters of the Barents Sea generate background signals, so that when two submarines approach one another head-on, each detects the other when {{the distance between the}} two vessels is just a couple of hundred meters. Graylings <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> detected Novomoskovsk at a distance of about a kilometer (0.54 nautical mile). With the distance closing and Graylings combat information center still trying to decide on the best way of avoiding a collision, Graylings commanding officer, Commander Richard Self, tried to change course and to surface, but the attempts were thwarted by Graylings momentum. Grayling collided with the upper structure of Novomoskovsk, which suffered a large scratch on her starboard bow. The American submarine limped away also with minor damage. The American submarine was repaired and remained in service until her decommissioning in 1997. Novomoskovsk also returned to service, and after a major upgrade she is expected to stay in the Russian Navy until 2020.|$|E
500|$|Tritons long-range, passive detecting-ranging sonar was the AN/BQR-7, {{which had}} a {{listening}} range up to [...] for surfaced or snorkeling submarines, optimized to , with target tracking capability within 5 degrees of accuracy. The chin-mounted AN/BQR-2 <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> array supplemented the active BQS-4, with a range up to [...] and a bearing accuracy of 1/10 of degree, allowing the BQR-2 {{to be used for}} fire control in torpedo attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{innovation}} {{created by}} Kayo was a low-frequency <b>passive</b> bow <b>sonar</b> system, the BQR-4, which was originally to be {{wrapped around the}} submarine's conning tower. Testing on [...] showed that self-noise would greatly reduce detection range, and the sonar was relocated to the bow. Due to the large sonar dome above the torpedo tubes, in the Barracuda-class the torpedo tubes remained in their traditional bow position.|$|R
50|$|Australian Oberons had {{different}} electronic equipment, using primarily American radar and sonar systems. They had Sperry BQG-4 Micropuffs <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar</b> and Krupp CSU3-41 attack sonar. Instead of the British Tigerfish torpedoes, the Australians used American Mark 48 torpedoes. They had a slightly larger payload, carrying 22 torpedoes for the forward tubes, six {{of which were}} preloaded. Shortly after entering service, the aft torpedo tubes in all six submarines were sealed.|$|R
25|$|The SOUP refits {{comprised}} a new US {{fire control}} system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry <b>passive</b> ranging <b>sonar</b> with the Type 719 short range sonar removed. The new sonar {{was placed in}} the upper casing on the pressure hull. New communications and navigational systems were installed. The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mark 48 torpedoes, however the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalized in 1985.|$|R
500|$|It was recommissioned as Velebit in 1996. According to the 2007 {{edition of}} The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, Velebit was {{fitted with a}} STN-Atlas Elektronik PP-10 active and PSU-1-2 <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> and a {{portable}} navigational radar {{may have been used}} on board along with the GPS. The claim is contradicted by other sources with news reports stating the submarine was completed without an active sonar, effectively being [...] "blind" [...] underwater. During the 1990s Velebit had the pennant number [...] "3" [...] painted on its side. After the existing battery set needed for underwater propulsion expired and needed replacement, crew training and boat operations were limited to surface drives.|$|E
500|$|From 1979 and 1981 he {{commanded}} the minesweeper HMS Soberton {{for nearly two}} years in the Fishery Protection Squadron around the British coast. Between 1981 and 1983 he also served as flag lieutenant to Commander-in-Chief Fleet, a period where he was involved in the Falklands War. [...] Promoted to the rank of commander on 30 June 1983, he assumed command of the frigate HMS Phoebe. The frigate operated in NATO waters, {{at the time of the}} RN’s first operational experience with surface ship towed <b>passive</b> <b>sonar.</b> In 1985 he attended the Joint Services Defence College and was soon appointed to the Defence Staff in the Ministry of Defence in the Directorate of Defence Policy. Promoted to captain on 30 June 1988, he left the Directorate of Policy and commanded HMS Norfolk. He was also responsible for helping re-equip 9th Frigate Squadron, the first Type 23 frigate squadron.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Boston, {{the ship was}} extensively examined by the US Navy. Her very large GHG <b>passive</b> <b>sonar</b> array was removed and installed on the submarine [...] for testing. American interest in magnetic amplifier technology increased again after findings in investigations of the fire control system of Prinz Eugen. The guns from turret Anton were removed while in Philadelphia in February. On 1 May the German crewmen left the ship and returned to Germany. Thereafter, the American crew had significant difficulties in keeping the ship's propulsion system operational—eleven of her twelve boilers failed after the Germans departed. The ship was then allocated to the fleet of target ships for Operation Crossroads in Bikini Atoll. Operation Crossroads was a major test {{of the effects of}} nuclear weapons on warships of various types. The trouble with Prinz Eugens propulsion system may have influenced the decision to dispose of her in the nuclear tests.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{goal of this}} research was to investigate the performance of low frequency <b>passive</b> <b>sonars</b> in the Arafura Sea. Sound speed profiles representative of the wet and dry monsoon seasons and geoacoustic data were inputted into a finite element primitive equation transmission loss model to model the expected propagation at three frequencies, 10, 50 and 300 Hz. Initial detection ranges for several source/receiver depth combinations and geoacoustic areas (deep/ shallow water) were compared and evaluated. Results demonstrate that low frequency (- 10 Hz) detection ranges suffer due to cutoff frequency problems and to surface-decoupling loss. Propagation in deep water has the added disadvantage of excessive loss of signal power due to spherical spreading considerations. Conversely, higher frequencies (300 Hz) provided extended detection ranges in shallow water due to trapping of energy within the entire 50 m to 100 m water column. Additionally, investigation into advantages to be gained through advanced signal processing techniques shows that improvements of the order of 10 to 15 dB of detection gain are possible through the utilization of inverse beamforming.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our efforts}} to teach hardware-b sed b amforming at the undergraduate level. A DSP based beamformer {{is at the heart}} of numerous military systems, including active and <b>passive</b> <b>sonars,</b> RF direction finding equipme t, and phased-array radars. While the military has needed engineers capable of designing and enhancing these and other systems, civilian applications of these same technologies have recently made beamforming an important topic for many engineers. High interest topics include E 911 mobile position location, space division multiple access (SDMA), cellular/PCS base station antenna design, and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications within a densely packed constellation. Beamforming is routinely discussed in a course on multidimensional signal processing but an actual hardware system to design or enhance is often not available. The use of powerful software, such as MATLAB, to simulate the geometries and techniques necessary to learn about beamforming has become standard. However, proceeding beyond MATLAB simulation to a real-time hardware implementation has been impeded by a very expensive and abrupt transition, in terms of both cost and the learning curve of unfamiliar systems and software.
