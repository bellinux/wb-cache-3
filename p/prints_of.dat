5|$|Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. <b>Prints</b> <b>of</b> their {{photographs}} of the fairies, {{along with a few}} other items including a first edition of Doyle's book The Coming of the Fairies, were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the National Science and Media Museum), where it is on display. The collection included <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.|$|E

5|$|But at {{some point}} in 1972, family {{friendly}} programming began being interspersed with (and was eventually replaced by) “blue movies”, such as Swedish Fly Girls. The chain would come to be known for its generally risque material. In 1981, <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> both Caligula and Dracula Sucks were confiscated from multiple Towne locations, and the company was sued by the Government of Alberta under obscenity laws.|$|E

50|$|The {{title page}} states 1835 as the {{publication}} date, but because <b>of</b> the <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> the Doctrine and Covenants the same year, <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> the hymnal was not completed until February 1836.|$|R
5|$|Founded in 1877, Tyldesley Good Templars Band was the town's first brass band. Tyldesley Band is {{a member}} of the North West Brass Band Association and meets in the chapel on Milk Street. Tyldesley Little Theatre in Lemon Street is home to an amateur {{dramatic}} society, members of the Greater Manchester Drama Federation. The auditorium is a small 150-seat theatre with a traditional proscenium arch stage, stalls and balcony seating. The town's industrial landscape was recorded in the 1960s and 1970s in the paintings and <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> artist Roger Hampson.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{returned}} {{all eight}} broadcast <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> Galaxy 4 and The Underwater Menace to the BBC to be disposed of. In the mid-1980s, former ITV engineer Terry Burnett purchased episode 3 of Galaxy 4 and episode 2 of The Underwater Menace from another collector, unaware of their value (the only extant {{episode of the}} former serial, and one of just two from the latter). In December 2011, after a chance encounter with Doctor Who Restoration Team member Ralph Montagu, Burnett returned the episodes to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Skelton {{believed}} that his life's work {{was to make}} people laugh; {{he wanted to be}} known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.|$|E

5|$|The Bellman Society (Bellmansällskapet), {{founded in}} Stockholm {{on the anniversary}} of Bellman's birth in 1919, fosters {{interest}} in Bellman and supports research into the man and his work.

5|$|The {{back cover}} on early <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> the CD {{featured}} a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints {{for fear of}} litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on the back cover. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|E

50|$|Getse Mahapandita was {{instrumental}} in arranging the block <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> the 'Collection of Nyingma Tantras' (Tibetan: Nyingma Gyübum) gathered by Jigme Lingpa, and for which Getse Mahapandita wrote the catalogue. Getse Mahapandita solicited the carving of the blocks for the block <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> the Nyingma Gyübum through the patronage of the Derge Royal Family, who favoured and honoured Jigme Lingpa. Getse Mahapandita also arranged for the <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> texts by Jigme Lingpa and Longchenpa. Getse Mahapandita proof read all of these works.|$|R
5|$|The song Yerushalayim Shel Zahav ("Jerusalem of Gold") is {{featured}} in the film's soundtrack and plays {{near the end of}} the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by Naomi Shemer) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the Six-Day War. In Israeli <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> the film the song was replaced with Halikha LeKesariya ("A Walk to Caesarea") by Hannah Szenes, a World War II resistance fighter.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate whether pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might have walked or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E
5|$|To market Zorro, TriStar {{purchased}} a 30-second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million. Sony, {{who had been}} known for their low-key presence at the ShoWest trade show, showed clips from the film, while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10, 1998. The studio also attached Zorros trailer to <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> Godzilla. Sony launched an official website in June 1998. Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late-1990s, and Zorro was Sony's first film to use VRML.|$|E

A series of diffracting objects were printed onto clear substrates and evaluated with a coherent light source.

5|$|As with {{at least}} 4% of Méliès's output (including major films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies, The Impossible Voyage, and The Barber of Seville), some <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> A Trip to the Moon were {{individually}} hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each worker was assigned a different color in assembly line style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E
5|$|Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, PewDiePie {{originally}} {{pursued a}} degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers after becoming disinterested with his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.|$|E
