40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with identification of nonlinear instabilities in rotating multibody systems and subsequent control to eliminate the vibrations. Three nonlinear mechanical systems of this type are investigated and instabilities arising from their inherent nonlinearities are shown to exist {{for a range of}} system parameters and conditions. Subsequently, various nonlinear methods of vibration control have been employed to eliminate or suppress the instabilities. Analytical and numerical models have been designed to demonstrate various unstable dynamical behaviour with consistent results. The motion is studied by means of time history, phase space, frequency spectrum, Poincare map, Lyapunov characteristic exponents and Correlation Dimension. Numerical simulations have also shown the effectiveness and robustness of the control techniques over a range of instability conditions for each model. The dynamics of a rotating body with internal energy dissipation is first investigated. Such a model may be considered to be representative of a simplified spinning spacecraft. A comprehensive stability analysis is performed and regions of highly nonlinear behaviour are identified for more rigorous investigation. Numerical simulations using typical satellite parameter values are performed and the system is found to exhibit chaotic motion when a sinusoidally varying torque is applied to the spacecraft for a range of forcing amplitude and frequency. Analysis of this model using Melnikov’s method is performed and a sufficient criterion for chaotic instabilities is obtained in terms of system parameters. Evidence is also presented, indicating that the onset of chaotic motion is characterised by period doubling as well as intermittency. Subsequently, Control of chaotic vibrations in this model is achieved using three techniques. The control methods are implemented on the model under instability conditions. The first two control techniques, recursive proportional feedback (RPF) and continuous delayed feedback are recently developed model independent methods for control of chaotic motion in dynamical systems. As such these methods are employed on all three rotating multibody systems in this dissertation. Control of chaotic instability in this model is also achieved using an algorithm derived using Lyapunov’s second method. Each technique is outlined and the effectiveness of the three strategies in controlling chaotic motion exhibited by the present system is compared and contrasted. The dynamics of a dual-spin spacecraft with internal energy dissipation {{in the form of an}} axial nutational damper is also investigated for non-linear phenomena. The problem involves the study of a body with internal moving parts that is characterised by a coupling of the motions of the damper mass and the angular rotations of the platform and rotor of the spacecraft. Two realistic spacecraft parameter configurations are investigated and each is found to exhibit chaotic motion when a sinusoidally varying torque is applied to the spacecraft rotor for a range of forcing amplitude and frequency. Onset of chaotic motion was shown to be characterised by period doubling and Hopf bifurcations. An investigation of the effects of damping upon the configuration is also performed. Predicted instabilities indicate the range of rotor speeds, perturbation amplitudes and damping coefficients to be avoided in the design of dual-spin spacecraft. Control of chaotic vibrations in this model is also achieved using recursive proportional feedback (RPF) and continuous delayed feedback. Subsequently a more effective model dependent method based on energy considerations is derived and implemented. The effectiveness and robustness of each technique is shown using numerical simulations. Another rotating multibody system that is physically distinct from the previously described models is also investigated for nonlinear instabilities and control. The model is in the form of a driveline which incorporates a commonly used coupling called a Hooke’s joint. In particular, torsional instabilities due to fluctuating angular velocity ratio across the joint are examined. Linearised equations are used for the prediction of critical speed ranges where parametric instabilities characterised by exponential build up of torsional response amplitudes occur. Predicted instabilities indicate the range of driveshaft speeds to be avoided during the design of a driveline which employs a Hooke 2 ̆ 7 s joint. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the existence of parametric, quasi-periodic and chaotic instabilities. Subsequently, suppression of these vibrations is achieved using the previously described model independent techniques. Chaotic vibrations have also been observed in a range of simple mechanical systems such as a periodically kicked rotor, forced pendulum, synchronous rotor, aeroelastic panel flutter and impact <b>print</b> <b>hammer</b> to name but a few. It is thus becoming of increasing importance to engineers to be aware of chaotic phenomena and be able to recognise, quantify and eliminate these undesirable vibrations. The analytical and numerical methods described in this dissertation may be usefully employed by engineers for detecting as well as controlling chaotic vibrations in an extensive range of physical systems...|$|E

40|$|Written on {{invitation}} by the ‘Journal of Visual Culture’, {{and guest}} editor Professor Anne Massey, {{for a special}} volume on the ‘Independent Group’, Walsh’s 10, 000 -word essay (which exceeded the 5, 000 word length but was left unedited due to its importance and originality) presents an account of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> Ltd, a design firm established by Nigel Henderson and Eduardo Paolozzi in the 1950 s. Building on her pioneering and ongoing research into Henderson, the initial lecture, on which the article is based, {{was presented at the}} ICA in London (2012) and led to an invitation to deliver a lecture for the first major exhibition of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> held at Fristsite Gallery in Colchester, UK, in January 2013. Walsh’s research was acknowledged throughout Firstsite’s exhibition publication ‘Hammer Prints’. Drawing on archival material that Walsh had exclusive access to in the extended family archives and estates of Henderson, Paolozzi, Alison and Peter Smithson, and Richard Hamilton, the article re-situates the ethos and designs of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> within the wider aesthetic concerns and strategies of the Independent Group and the reordering of the visual first proposed by the artists in collaboration with the Smithsons in the seminal exhibition ‘Parallel of Life and Art’ (ICA, 1953). The article argues that the importance of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> has been significantly marginalised by art history as a category of applied arts. As Walsh demonstrates, a more complex account of <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> is revealed once it is reconnected to both artists’ interest in gestalt principles of perception, contemporary theorisations of ‘pattern’, ontological questions of art posed by Malraux’s idea of the ‘imaginary museum’, and Duchamp’s idea of the ‘portable museum’.

5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced <b>print</b> <b>hammers</b> comprised a <b>print</b> line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|R

Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done [...] "with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions". Lyubov Popova was {{also a member of the}} textile faculty, and in 1922, when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory, Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry. Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries, and also work that was thematic. Before her death in 1924, Popova produced fabrics with grids of <b>printed</b> <b>hammers</b> and sickles, which would predate work by others in the political climate of the first five-year plan.|$|R

50|$|Comb printers, {{also called}} line matrix printers, {{represent}} the fifth major design. These printers are {{a hybrid of}} dot matrix printing and line printing. In these printers, a comb of <b>hammers</b> <b>prints</b> {{a portion of a}} row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row can be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advances and the next pixel row is printed. Because far less motion is involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers are very fast compared to dot matrix printers and are competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics. The Printronix P7000 series of line matrix printers are still manufactured as of 2013.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 {{he moved}} {{with his family to}} the village of Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex. The Hendersons were joined by the Paolozzis who owned joint cottages that neighboured theirs. With Paolozzi, Henderson {{established}} <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> Limited, a design company producing wallpapers, textiles and ceramics that were initially manufactured at Landermere Wharf. Henderson's company did not hinder his collaboration with others from the Independent Group. Colin St John Wilson, a long time member of the Independent Group, invited Henderson to form a solo exhibition at the School of Architecture in Cambridge. Wilson also donated a collage screen started by Henderson in 1949 to the Pallant House Gallery in 2004.Nigel Henderson's work was included in the 1990 Institute of Contemporary Arts exhibition, The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} drum printer design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the print position. As the desired character for each column passes the <b>print</b> position, a <b>hammer</b> strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|R

5000|$|After Paris, {{he moved}} back to London {{eventually}} establishing his studio in Chelsea. The studio was a workshop filled with hundreds of found objects, models, sculptures, materials, tools, toys and stacks of books. Paolozzi was interested in everything and would {{use a variety of}} objects and materials in his work, particularly his collages. In 1955 he moved with his family to the village of Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex. Together with Nigel Henderson he established <b>Hammer</b> <b>Prints</b> Limited, a design company producing wallpapers, textiles and ceramics that were initially manufactured at Landermere Wharf, and when his evening course in printed textile design at the Central School of Art and Design attracted the Trinidadian graphics student Althea McNish, he was instrumental in pointing her towards her future career as a textile designer. Paolozzi came to public attention in the 1950s by producing a range of striking screenprints and [...] "Art Brut" [...] sculpture. He was a founder of the Independent Group in 1952, which is regarded as the precursor to the mid-1950s British and late 1950s American Pop Art movements. His seminal 1947 collage [...] "I was a Rich Man's Plaything" [...] is considered the earliest standard bearer representing Pop Art. He always described his work as surrealist art and, while working {{in a wide range of}} media though his career, became more closely associated with sculpture. Paolozzi is recognized for producing largely lifelike statuary works, but with rectilinear (often cubic) elements added or removed, or the human form deconstructed in a cubist manner.He taught sculpture and ceramics at several institutions, including the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (1960-62), University of California, Berkeley (in 1968) and at the Royal College of Art. Paolozzi had a long association with Germany, having worked in Berlin from 1974 as part of the Berlin Artist Programme of the German Academic Exchange Programme. He was a professor at the Fachhochschule in Cologne from 1977 to 1981, and later taught sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich. Paolozzi was fond of Munich and many of his works and concept plans were developed in a studio he kept there, including the mosaics of the Tottenham Court Road Station in London. He took a stab at industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Paolozzi decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's Studio Linie.|$|R
