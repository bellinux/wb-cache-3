40|$|Learning - {{the process}} by which new skills and {{behaviours}} are acquired - is a central concept in the understanding of mental handicap. Discrimination learning Is specifically identified as an essential pre-requlslte for the acquisition of a variety of more complex behaviours and skills. Many studies have reported that severely mentally handicapped persons show a relative inability to profit from unstructured learning experiences, and frequently fail to learn discriminations trained through simple differential reinforcement (trial-and-error training). <b>Programmed</b> <b>training</b> procedures are identified as important vehicles to facilitate the discrimination learning of severely mentally handicapped children. An initial study is reported that confirms the superiority of programmed over trial-and-error discrimination training, and demonstrates this superiority is maintained over a series of similar discrimination tasks. The results also demonstrate that stimulus fading procedures can be successfully implemented using micro-computer technology, and that 'errorless' learning can be effected through the sequencing and fading of trainer prompts. However, programmed procedures are not invariably effective in teaching discriminations to developmentally impaired persons, and failures to learn following <b>programmed</b> <b>training</b> are not infrequently reported. In a series of studies, some of the basic procedural parameters underlying diverse programmed techniques were evaluated as determinants of the development (or lack of development) of appropriate stimulus controL Increasing the salience of S+, whether through manipulation of S+ or S-, was shown to be more effective than increasing the salience of S-. Further, congruence between prompt and training cue dimensions was shown to be a significant variable affecting the outcome of training. The effectiveness of programmed procedures was also shown to interact with task difficulty. Finally, wide individual differences in learning within the population of severely mentally handicapped persons have frequently been reported, and were also observed in the present research. In a final study, individual differences in some basic cognitive abilities and aspects of classroom behaviour were assessed and shown to be significantly correlated with discrimination performance. The results are related to the literature on compound conditioning (e. g., Kamin, 1968) and theories of discrimination learning (Terrace, 1966; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972; Zeaman and House, 1963, 1979), and suggest the importance of attentlonal processes in discrimination learning.

The training programme covered forty-four training units. The research was made on a sample of 120 fifteen years old football players of cadet rank. For the assessment of ball handling the three tests were used: horizontal ball rebounding from a wall 20 s, dribbling speed of the ball in slalom and juggling alternating with both feet in a square space of 1 x 1 m. In the area of comparative statistics, we used discriminant parametric procedure t-test for big paired samples. Results: Based on the numerical values of the t-test it can be concluded that there are no statistically significant differences in all three variables to estimate the dribbling speed. This confirmed the hypothesis that the expected significant positive quantitative changes of situational-motor abilities influenced by the proposed model of training in preparation period with fifteen years old football players. Discussion: In this research the authors were guided by the fact that this kind of training program in preparation period, where dominates the situational model training is very effective in terms of raising the dribbling speed with fifteen years old, because the model that is used in this training period abounds in exercises in which dominates dribbling speed, in stright line and with changes in direction. The obtained results can be directed towards innovation plans and programs in the preparation period, and the adaptation of the same needs of the respective population.

40|$|Introduction: Requirements {{and needs}} of {{properly}} <b>programmed</b> <b>training</b> process, especially in the pre-season, look for a precise definition of the functional parameters of all the players. The level of anaerobic threshold, as well as research on the same, {{may be a good}} indicator of proper dosage of loading. The aim of the research is to determine the differences in running speed and heart rate at the level of anaerobic threshold in relation to the position of the player. Methods: Age of the respondents in this study included boys from 14 to 16 years of age (60 football players). The sample of respondents was divided according to playing position, as follows: center-backs (12 players), wing-backs (15 players), midfielders (14 players), forwarders (13 players) and goalkeepers (6 goalkeepers). An estimation of maximum heart rate and anaerobic threshold was performed using the Conconi test – (Conconi et al. 1996). Prior to testing players had ten minutes to warm up and {{after a few minutes of}} rest the testing began. Players started with jogging test (10 km/h) and after every 200 m running speed was increased by 0. 5 km/h. Within certain sections the load is constant which is achieved by increasing speed after each 200 m, and then maintaining that speed until the end of the section. After processing the results within the particular software (“Polar Precision Performance SW”) the values needed for this research were collected. Multivariate methods MANOVA and discriminant analysis will be applied in the paper. Regarding the univariate procedures, ANOVA t-test and Roy’s test shall be applied. The descriptive parameters, mean value, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum of all values, the coefficient of variation (CV) of confidence intervals, skewness as the measures of asymmetry, kurtosis as the measure of flatness and the value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, shall be presented. Results: By using the multivariate analysis of variance and based on the results, no statistically significant difference was observed. Discriminant analysis, which is a superior method compared to multivariate analysis of variance, because in addition to the quantitative values of the analyzed features it also observes their mutual relationship, revealed no significant difference also. Univariate analysis confirmed the assumption, which means no significant differences were found between the groups regarding the observed variables. However, the mean values for midfield players in all monitored parameters were the highest. Discussion: The results of this study indicate similar estimates of values of the anaerobic threshold between the groups divided according to their playing position. However, the mean values for midfield players in all monitored parameters were the highest: heart rate at the anaerobic threshold (186. 36 beats/min), running speed at anaerobic threshold (14. 07 km/h) and percentage value of anaerobic threshold in relation to the maximum heart rate (92. 07 %), which separates them from other playing positions and points to the existence of certain differences. Comparing the results of this study with research performed by Dillerna et al. (2012) shows that similar results were obtained, and the best results are achieved by female midfield players. Also, by measuring heart rate during official games, Coelho et al. (2011), within the sample of 26 players from U- 17 and 18 players from U- 20 category, found that midfield players, presented in percentage, spent the most of the time in the zone 3 (p< 0. 05), and spent more time in zone 4 compared to the forward players and center-backs (p< 0. 05). The above studies indicate a significantly higher engagement of midfield players compared to other positions.

40|$|Effective {{fireground}} decision - making requires good {{situation awareness}} (SA) and appropriate selection {{from the information}} available to the incident commander. Individuals can display different information bias / scope in {{their view of the}} operational incident: either a liberal bias / scope towards accepting information as true with a risk of false alarm errors and / or a conservative bias / scope towards rejecting information with a risk of misses. Such decision - making bias / scope was examined over a series of five separate studies including operational fire fighters and incident commanders. The studies included a breathing apparatus (BA) exercise, two different table top operational incidents (domestic and commercial) and two exercises for flexible duty managers (FDM) in an assessable simulated fireground incident in 2012 and again in 2013. The studies were based on realistic incidents that both fire fighters and FDMs would be expected to respond to, in the final two studies each individual had to take over command and move towards a successful conclusion from an operational, environmental and social perspective. In all the studies, participants were required to answer true or false to a series of probe statements about the incident, which were analysed by a signal detection tool (QASA) to give a measure of actual situational awareness (ASA), perceived situational awareness (PSA) and bias / scope. The first exercise was a BA exercise undertaken to identify if bias was shown by FF’s when undertaking training, the data analysed by the QASA identified that most individuals displayed a high level of ASA about the incident, but also showed either a conservative bias / scope (with miss errors) or a liberal bias /scope (with false alarm errors). The results however also show that two individuals can appear to have similar ASA, but in fact still have very different bias / scope in regard to that knowledge. Once it was established that bias was identified this was developed using table top exercises as it allowed more participants and more control over undertaking the research within normal <b>programmed</b> <b>training</b> periods. The analysis of the two table top exercises showed ASA was high in both, but fire fighters perceived their PSA in a similar way if they had high confidence in one exercise they also had high confidence in the other exercise, or vice versa. However there was no significant correlation between the ASA scores and the PSA scores, with the pattern of bias / scope tendencies being differed across the two studies; with no significant correlation. In reviewing these results the identified difference in undertaking the 2 exercises was that in the second FF’s were familiar with the process and this allow a more relaxed approach, reducing pressure on the individual. While individuals showed bias patterns within the exercises undertaken, more pressurized exercises were identified to see if this bias was consistent for the individual when under pressure. Using the assessable incident commander exercises run by the FRS to test incident commander competence at a FDM level to undertake this. The exercises were used in 2012 and 2013 using the same individuals to compare their results, the outcome of these two simulated assessable fireground incident studies were; •	for ASA: there was no significant correlation: r = -. 120 and p=. 623; •	for PSA: there was a significant positive correlation: r =. 577 and p =. 012; •	for bias / scope there was found a strongly positive significant correlation across the scores: r =. 592 which is significant at the. 008 level. The conclusion of the research is that individuals hold bias / scope tendencies and under pressure these tendencies are shown to be resting and will impact (condition) the individual’s decisions during periods of operational command during stressful conditions. The finding of bias / scope patterns is an important one that may have implications for understanding errors in incident ground decision - making. The finding of resting bias / scope patterns in FDM is an even more important one, which will have implications for understanding errors in incident ground decision - making and how we can help to reduce them. In semi structure interviews with FDMs who had undertaken the assessable exercises, they believed that knowing their bias was a first step to altering it to allow them to improve their decision making at pressurized incidents. Which supported the ultimate goal of the current research to further the understanding of bias / scope tendency, in order to support the training of effective fireground decision - making...|$|E
