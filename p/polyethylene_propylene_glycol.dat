The filament, a copper salt, grows from anode to cathode along the epoxy-glass interface. Ready and Turbini (2000) identified this copper salt as the Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl, atacamite compound. This work has investigated the influence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (PEPG) fluxing agents on the chemical nature of CAF.

40|$|Different {{chelating}} agents such as <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>glycol),</b> <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> monooctadecanoate and palm oil {{were used for}} modification of the surface-treated montmorillonite (MMT). The work also included {{the development of a}} technique for mixing {{chelating agents}} with MMTs using different methods and different proportions of MMT/chelating agent/ethanol. Evaluation of the result of mixing was performed by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). The results showed that the chelating agents used were intercalated in MMT, increasing the interlayer spacing. The OMMT was used in the manufacture of composites with rigid PVC using a microcompounder. The master batch concept turned out to be promising in terms of dispersion and delamination of clay, as observed in HR-SEM photographs. However, despite good dispersion and exfoliation of MMT, poor compatibility between clay platelets and PVC matrix remains to be solved to enable full exploitation of its engineering potential. Despite this drawback, good thermal stability and mechanical properties have already been achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{cellular}} toxicities of surfactants, a solvent, and an antifreeze {{that are}} included in herbicide formulations were assessed by measuring their effects on membrane integrity, metabolic activity, mitochondrial activity, and total protein synthesis rate in a cell culture. <b>Polyethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> and monoethylene glycol exhibited no cellular toxicity even at {{a high concentration of}} 100 mM. Sodium lauryl ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether significantly damaged the membrane, disturbed cellular metabolic activity, and decreased mitochondrial activity and the protein synthesis rate; however, their toxicity was far below those of the severely toxic chemicals at comparable concentrations. The severely toxic category included polyoxypropylene glycol block copolymer, polyoxyethylene tallow amine, and polyoxyethylene lauryl amine ether. These surfactants were cytotoxic between 3. 125 µM and 100 µM in a dose-dependent manner. However, the toxicity graph of concentration vs toxicity had a point of inflection at 25 µM. The slope of the toxicity graph was gentle when the concentration was below 25 µM and steep when the concentration was greater than 25 µM.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop alpha-tocopherol (T) topical formulations and evaluate the ex vivo and in vivo permeation. Franz diffusion cells were used for the ex vivo permeation, and neonatal rats were used for in vivo permeation. Seven gel formulations and 21 liquid formulations were investigated for physical stability, viscosity and permeation of T. Analysis of T was performed by a validated HPLC method using a UV detector. The ex vivo permeation from gel and emulsion formulations was very poor (0. 001 – 0. 015 %). The highest permeation was observed from monophasic liquid formulations containing dimethyl sulfuxide (DMSO), tocopheryl <b>polyethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (TPGs), <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> ethanol, and 9. 5 % T. The in vivo results demonstrated higher retention in the epidermis compared to subcutaneous tissues; 1377 and 1. 13 µg g– 1, respectively.

30|$|The results {{presented}} here indicate that detection of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is common in}} hospital patients, particularly those managed from drug overdoses or other toxic ingestions. The major source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> comes from iatrogenic administration of poorly water-soluble medications, especially intravenous lorazepam used for sedation. Intravenous formulations of lorazepam may contain up to 80 % (v/v) <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Other intravenous medications that may contain <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> include diazepam, etomidate, and phenytoin (Al-Khafaji et al. 2002; Arbour 1999; Chicella et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002). Another source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is activated charcoal preparations that use <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as the excipient to make the charcoal less gritty and easier to administer (Krasowski et al. 2012). Although the toxic plasma concentration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is not well-defined, toxicity has been reported with plasma concentrations as low as 100  mg/dL (Zar et al. 2007). However, even if not directly toxic, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> increases plasma osmolality and complicates the use of osmolal gap in clinical diagnosis and management, especially for patients receiving multiple doses of propylene glycol-containing medication, as may be done in intubated patients requiring extended sedation (Krasowski et al. 2012). <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> has also been reported as an interferent in enzyme assays for ethylene glycol (Malandain & Cano 1996; Juenke et al. 2011). Our study demonstrates that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may be detected in patients who have ingested ethylene glycol, with iatrogenic drugs such as intravenous lorazepam or activated charcoal being common sources of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> These findings illustrate the importance of specific assays for determination of ethylene glycol in human samples.|$|R

The current research is based on developing an improved and fundamental understanding of technology that will allow the conversion of this crude glycerin to a <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> based antifreeze product. Hydrogenolysis of glycerol to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was performed using copper chromite catalyst.

In fact, {{there are no}} reports specifying a maximum safe dose of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> through intraperitoneal administration. We report here a case of unexpected seizures in Sprague Dawley rats after receiving an intraperitoneal injection containing <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Nine-week-old, 225 – 250 gram male rats were reported to experience tremor progressing to seizures within minutes after given injections of resveratrol (30 [*]mg/kg) dissolved in a 40 [*]:[*] 60 propylene glycol/corn oil vehicle solution by direct intraperitoneal (IP) slow bolus injection or via a preplaced intraperitoneal catheter. The World Health Organization suggests a maximum dose of 25 [*]mg/kg/day of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> taken orally {{and no more than}} 25 [*]mg/dL in blood serum, whereas the animals used in our study got a calculated maximum 0. 52 [*]g/kg (25 times lower dose). Blood tests from the seizing rat support a diagnosis of hemolysis and lactic acidosis which may have led to the seizures, all of which appeared to be a consequence of the <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> administration. These findings are consistent with oral and intravenous administration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> toxicity as previously reported in other species, including humans. To our knowledge, this report represents the first published case of status epilepticus due to an IP injection containing <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vapor {{dispersed}} into the air of an enclosed space produces a marked and rapid bactericidal effect on microorganisms introduced into such an atmosphere in droplet form. Concentrations of 1 gm. of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vapor in two to four million cc. of air produced immediate and complete sterilization of air into which pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci, H. influenzae, and other microorganisms as well as influenza virus had been sprayed. With lesser concentrations of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> rapid and marked {{reduction in the number of}} air-borne bacteria occurred, but complete sterilization of the air required a certain interval of time. Pronounced effects on both pneumococci and hemolytic streptococci were observed when concentrations as low as 1 gm. of glycol to fifty million cc. of air were employed. Numerous control tests showed that failure of the glycol-treated microorganisms to grow on the agar plates was due to actual death of the bacteria. The means by which <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vapor produces its effect on droplet-borne bacteria is discussed and data relating the bactericidal properties of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in vitro to the lethal action of its vapor is presented. Atmospheres containing <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vapor are invisible, odorless, and non-irritating. This glycol is essentially non-toxic when given orally and intravenously. Tests on possible deleterious effects of breathing <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> containing atmospheres over long periods of time are being carried out...|$|R
