40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the institution of}} political representation seeking to identify the limits and possibilities that it offers to deepening democracy. Based on a reconstruction of the political debate of the late 18 th century, which introduced the representative principle as a key tool for modern democracies, the text raises the principal arguments for and against representation and {{analyzes the}} origins of the institute. It then contextualizes the debate in contemporary societies by discussing central factors that permeate the quality of representation, such as the ties to and control of representatives, the role of public deliberation and the relationship with the mechanisms of direct and semidirect democracy. The article concludes that the democratic deficit, based on the close application of political representation, can be remedied with the combination of participative tools, such as the plebiscites, referendums, <b>popular</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>initiatives,</b> public policy management councils and participative budget processes...|$|R

S. schools. Schools raising academic achievement emphasize high student expectations, classroom management, positive feedback, tailored teaching strategies, professional work environments, and student responsibility. Sparked by the fiscal crisis of the 1970 s, Chicago school reform efforts aimed to reverse poor performance, better serve disadvantaged and minority students, and lower drop out rates by employing site-based management (SBM), teacher empowerment, and community involvement. Research reveals decentralized decision making strategies characterized by primary community control, teacher control, or principal control. The Chicago Reform Act devised a set of 10 system-wide goals, required that resources be allocated to the most needy students, and established local school councils (LSCs) comprised of 6 parents, 2 teachers, 2 community residents, a buildin...|$|R

The PAH's campaign - [...] "There are lives at stake" [...] - referred to the high rates of suicide among those evicted and detailed strict guidelines of how escraches were to be conducted in nonviolent manner, without insults or affecting the children of the deputies.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of popular participation {{established in the}} Constitution (Article 103) are voting, referendums, plebiscites, popular consultations (consulta popular), open council meetings (cabildo abierto), <b>popular</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> and recall (revocatoria del mandato, lit. revocation of mandate). The various other forms of political participation allowed by the Constitution besides regular elections give the 1991 Constitution its participative character. These forms of political participation are regulated by Law 134 of 1994 and Law 1757 of 2015, although articles 104 through 106 further specify that the President {{with the approval of}} all ministers and the Senate may consult the people on matters of national importance (article 104), that governors and mayors may likewise consult voters on issues falling under their jurisdiction (article 105) and detail the different forms of political participation at a local level (article 106).|$|E
5000|$|Two {{examples}} of this are the rural coasts of Veneguera (Gran Canaria) and El Rincon (Tenerife). These two areas were seen as being under threat during the decade of development during the 1980s. The growth of the ecologist and social sectors lead {{to the creation of}} a <b>Popular</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Initiative,</b> calling for a halt to the development of tourism on the islands. It received more than the necessary amount of signatures, and after going to parliament was respected and seen as the decision of the people. This theme continued into the 21st Century with the campaign relating to the growth of tourism, the campaign was called ´Canarias tiene un límite: Ni una cama más´ ( [...] The canaries have a limit: Not one bed more). This campaign was particularly prominent on the island of Lanzarote.|$|E

The ban came into force on 1 January 2012. Bullfights by matadors were banned in Catalonia at the end 2011 but bull-dodging, in which bulls are [...] not killed, remains lawful.

The Court ruled that, though an autonomous region is allowed to regulate bullfighting, an autonomous region is not in a legal position to fully ban such fights.|$|E
5000|$|Ada Colau {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages (PAH) in 2009, and acted as the organization's spokeswoman until 2014. Colau rose to national prominence after calling a representative of the Spanish Banking Association [...] "a criminal" [...] while representing the PAH at a parliamentary hearing on the housing crisis in February 2013. Colau supports the use of escraches, public protests outside the homes of government officials. That same month, a <b>Popular</b> <b>Legislative</b> <b>Initiative</b> proposed by the PAH and supported by over 1,400,000 signatories was debated {{on the floor of the}} Spanish Congress.

Colau is coauthor of the book Mortgaged Lives, based on her experiences of grassroots campaigning and direct action with the PAH.|$|E
5000|$|Otmar Jung's post-doctoral {{dissertation}} of 1985 is {{the most}} comprehensive study of the Princes' expropriation to date. In the first part, he analyzes the historical, economic and legal aspects of all property disputes {{for each of the}} German states. This analysis takes up 500 pages of the more than 1200 pages. Jung uses this approach in order to counter the danger of prematurely assuming that the Prussian solution was the typical one. In the second part, Jung details the events. His intention is to show that the absence of elements of direct democracy in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany cannot legitimately be justified by [...] "bad experience" [...] in the Weimar Republic as is often done. On closer examination, the Weimar experience was different. According to Jung, the <b>popular</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>initiative</b> of 1926 was a laudable attempt to complement the parliamentary system where it was not able to provide a solution: in the question of a clear and final separation of the assets {{of the state and the}} former Princes. Here, the referendum was a legitimate problem-solving process. One of the results of the campaign, according to Jung, was that it brought to light technical defects in the referendum process, for instance because abstentions and [...] "no" [...] votes had exactly the same effect. By correcting misonceptions about elements of direct democracy in the Weimar Republic, Jung wants to pave the way for a less prejudiced discussion of elements of direct democracy in the present.|$|E
