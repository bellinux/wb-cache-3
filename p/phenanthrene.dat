25|$|For example, in <b>phenanthrene</b> one Clar {{structure}} has two sextets at the extremities, {{while the other}} resonance {{structure has}} just one central sextet; therefore in this molecule the outer rings have greater aromatic character whereas the central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive. In contrast, in anthracene the resonance structures have one sextet, which can be {{at any of the}} three rings, and the aromaticity spreads out more evenly across the whole molecule. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the UV absorbance spectra of these two isomers; <b>phenanthrene</b> has a highest wavelength absorbance around 290nm, while anthracene has highest wavelength bands around 380nm. Three Clar structures with two sextets each are present in chrysene. Superposition of these structures reveals that the aromaticity in the outer rings is greater (each has a sextet in two of the three Clar structures) compared to the inner rings (each has a sextet in only one of the three).|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs, also poly{{aromatic hydrocarbons}} or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) are hydrocarbons—organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen—that {{are composed of}} multiple aromatic rings (organic rings in which the electrons are delocalized). Formally, the class is further defined as lacking further branching substituents on these ring structures. The simplest such chemicals are naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and <b>phenanthrene.</b>|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Biological chemistryAs the Norwegian {{oil fields}} mature, the wells produce more water. This {{produced}} water containing a diverse mixture of dissolved PAHs is eventually {{released to the}} environment. A major part of these discharges are alkylated PAHs, but {{due to lack of}} pure compounds the e↵ect of alkylated PAHs have been scarcely studied. Studies on the metabolism of monomethylated <b>phenanthrenes</b> by the benthic invertebrate Nereis diversicolor gave di↵erent product distributions depending on the position of the substituent. Now various dimethylated <b>phenanthrenes</b> are needed for further environmental studies. In this thesis a selection of dimethylated <b>phenanthrenes</b> has been prepared using a combination of Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM), Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling, and Directed remote-Metalation (DreM). 2, 7 -, 2, 3 -, 1, 7 - and 2 - 6 -dimethyl- 9 -phenanthrol have been made into the corresponding <b>phenanthrenes</b> by a simple Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of the triflate protected alcohol.

25|$|Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist {{analgesic}} of the <b>phenanthrene</b> series. It is chemically {{related to the}} widely used opioid antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. It is available in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL. Both strengths contain 0.94% sodium citrate hydrous, 1.26% citric acid anhydrous, 0.1% sodium metabisulfite, and 0.2% of a 9:1 mixture of methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives; pH is adjusted, if necessary, with hydrochloric acid. The 10mg/mL strength contains 0.1% sodium chloride.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are molecules containing {{two or more}} simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms (see also simple aromatic rings). Examples are naphthalene, anthracene, and <b>phenanthrene.</b> In fused aromatics, not all carbon–carbon bonds are necessarily equivalent, as the electrons are not delocalized over the entire molecule. The aromaticity of these molecules can be explained using their orbital picture. Like benzene and other monocyclic aromatic molecules, polycyclics have a cyclic conjugated pi system with p-orbital overlap {{above and below the}} plane of the ring.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a <b>phenanthrene</b> opioid {{receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-{{opioid receptor}}s {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E

2500|$|After the 6π electrocyclization of the Z {{form to the}} [...] "close-ring" [...] form, most unsubstituted diarylethenes {{are prone}} to oxidation, leading to a re-aromatization of the π-system.

Reaction of the product of this reaction with molecular oxygen affords <b>phenanthrene,</b> and it has been suggested by some studies that dehydrogenation may even occur spontaneously. The dihydrophenanthrene intermediate has never been isolated, but it has been detected spectroscopically in pump-probe experiments by virtue of its long wavelength optical absorption band. Although both the E-Z isomerization and the 6π electrocyclization are reversible processes, this oxidation renders the entire sequence irreversible.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{creosote}} {{will contain}} substances from six groups. The two groups {{occur in the}} greatest amounts and are {{the products of the}} distillation process—the [...] "tar acids", which distill below 205°C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205° and 255°C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255°C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, <b>phenanthrene,</b> acenapthene, and fluorene. Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote will contain several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the [...] "tar bases" [...] and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans. Lastly, creosote will contain a small number of aromatic amines produced by the other substances during the distillation process and likely resulting from a combination of thermolysis and hydrogenation. The tar bases are often extracted by washing the creosote with aqueous mineral acid, although they're also suggested to have antiseptic ability similar to the tar acids.|$|E
