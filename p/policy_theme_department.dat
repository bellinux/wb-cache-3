Geo-referencing techniques can be used to assign a spatial footprint to place names, adding value to these data and allowing the geographic information within them to be exploited when coupled with GIS technology. This paper discusses a method of analysing and visualising interview transcripts {{in order to understand the}} spatial extent of public policy practitioners’ activities. Through aggregation and statistical mapping it is possible to gain insight into the importance of space across a range of public <b>policy</b> <b>themes</b> and to understand the relationship between practitioner defined <b>policy</b> <b>themes</b> and the formal administrative boundaries within which they typically work. The research demonstrates that spatial working practices rarely conform to formal administrative boundaries and that there are varying degrees of spatial focus between different <b>policy</b> <b>themes</b> within localities. It also reveals that spatial working practices can be continued to be influenced by historic geographies and can be pulled in different directions reflecting both the devolved nature of the sector and the particular geographical context of the setting. It concludes that mapping the interview transcript can add value and provide additional insights to more conventional analysis...|$|R

40|$|Our society faces a dilemma. While {{continued}} {{economic growth}} is ecologically unsustainable, low or negative rates of economic growth are accompanied by adverse social impacts. Hence {{there is a need}} for macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable post-growth pathways. The emerging field of ecological macroeconomics aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different models incorporate <b>policy</b> <b>themes</b> from the post-growth literature. Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to eight <b>policy</b> <b>themes.</b> It was found that environmental interactions and the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the combination of input-output analysis with stock-flow consistent modelling was identified as a promising avenue for developing macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide interpretation of what “the economy” entails, future research will benefit from employing a range of approaches...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{observers}} {{have pointed to}} {{the significance of the}} study of history as a source of alternative solutions to contemporary social problems. Nevertheless, effective learning methods and teaching materials to achieve that goal have not been produced. The objective of this research paper was to design and evaluate the card game which would allow high school students to apply the historical events of various famous individuals in world history to the creation of policies capable of revitalizing Japan’s economy. Verification of the learning effectiveness of these educational materials revealed that after their use the number of policies offered by the students to invigorate Japan’s economy increased after the play. That was especially true for policies addressing the problem from cultural and social perspectives. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the game rules helped them to create policies adapting historical events to the modern context. Especially noteworthy factors promoting this change were the remembering of existing knowledge connected to the <b>policy</b> <b>themes</b> through the use of educational media and the establishment of connections between the <b>policy</b> <b>themes</b> and existing knowledge.
