5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high <b>pixel</b> <b>density</b> mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E

The device comes with either 16 or 32GB of internal storage, and also includes a MicroSD slot for up to 128GB of additional storage. The BoomSound stereo speakers were also improved with deeper enclosures, a larger amplifier, and an updated DSP for improved sound quality. It also incorporates a sensor hub for discrete motion tracking.|$|E

This is the first Pebble smartwatch to have a color display, and still retains a LED backlight as well. The watch also has a vibrating motor for silent alarms, and smart notifications. The watch {{comes with a}} redesigned charging cable that, like its predecessor's cable, magnetically attaches itself to the watch {{in order to maintain}} its water resistance. Unlike its predecessor, the cable attaches {{to the back of the}} watch rather than the side, and has the potential to transfer data rather than just power. The band attaches with standard 22mm pins. The watch is also equipped with an ambient light sensor and 6 axis accelerometer.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of DSLR sensors is typically measured in megapixels. More expensive cameras and cameras with larger sensors {{tend to have}} higher megapixel ratings. A larger megapixel rating does not mean higher quality. Low light sensitivity {{is a good example}} of this. When comparing two sensors of the same size, for example two APS-C sensors one 12.1 MP and one 18 MP, the one with the lower megapixel rating will usually perform better in low light. This is because the size of the individual pixels is larger, and more light is landing on each pixel, compared with the sensor with more megapixels. This is not always the case, because newer cameras that have higher megapixels also have better noise reduction software, and higher ISO settings to make up for the loss of light per pixel due to higher <b>pixel</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E

25|$|The device {{featured}} a small 1.55inch multi-touch screen {{with a lower}} resolution of 240×240 pixels but a higher <b>pixel</b> <b>density</b> of 220 pixels per inch, as opposed to the larger 2.2inch screen on the fifth-generation iPod Nano. The device had a 0.39 watt-hour battery rated at 3.7 volts, giving a capacity of 105 mAh, and specified to give 24 hours of music playback on a single full charge. The device took about three hours for one full charge. The device retained the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. This Nano lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder microphone (although plugging in headphones with a built in microphone revealed a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It also lost support for video playback, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) could be synced onto the device, and the audio from them would play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen. It still included the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an FM radio tuner with RDS (Radio Data System). It had a black on white screen contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod Nano had the same price point as the 5th generation device.|$|E

The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense the iPad's orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down.

TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's [...] "brilliant" [...] design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being [...] "smarter and more intuitive than ever", {{along with the}} quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and <b>pixel</b> <b>density</b> in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone. The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be [...] "simply and cleanly designed" [...] in comparison to the 5s, noting that the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered [...] "good, even great, but there’s little about it that’s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{difficulties}} of handwriting recognition is the variability among symbols because of the different writer styles. In this paper we introduce the boosting of blurred shape models with error correction, which is a robust approach for describing and recognizing handwritten symbols tolerant to this variability. A symbol is described by a probability density function of blurred shape model that encodes the probability of <b>pixel</b> <b>densities</b> of image regions. Then, to learn the most distinctive features among symbol classes, boosting techniques are used to maximize the separability among the blurred shape models. Finally, the set of binary boosting classifiers {{is embedded in the}} framework of Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC). Our approach has been evaluated in two benchmarking scenarios consisting of handwritten symbols. Compared with state-of-the-art descriptors, our method shows higher tolerance to the irregular deformations induced by handwritten strokes. ...|$|R

In Windows 8.1, the global setting to disable DPI virtualization (only use XP-style scaling) is removed. At <b>pixel</b> <b>densities</b> higher than 120 PPI (125%), DPI virtualization is enabled for all applications without a DPI aware flag (manifest) set inside the EXE. Windows 8.1 retains a per-application option to disable DPI virtualization of an app. Windows 8.1 also adds the ability for each display to use an independent DPI setting, although it calculates this automatically for each display. Windows 8.1 prevents a user from forcibly enabling DPI virtualization of an application. Therefore, if an application wrongly claims to be DPI-aware, it looks awful at high-DPI displays in 8.1, and a user cannot correct that.|$|R
