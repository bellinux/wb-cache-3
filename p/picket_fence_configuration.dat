50|$|<b>Picket</b> <b>fences</b> are {{a type of}} fence {{often used}} decoratively for {{domestic}} boundaries, distinguished by their evenly spaced vertical boards, the pickets, attached to horizontal rails. <b>Picket</b> <b>fences</b> are particularly popular in the United States, with the white <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> coming to symbolize the ideal middle-class suburban life. Until the introduction of advertising in the 1980s, cricket fields were usually surrounded by <b>picket</b> <b>fences.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fyvush Finkel and Kathy Baker {{appeared}} as their <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> {{characters in the}} first season. Likewise, Mandy Patinkin and Hector Elizondo brought their Chicago Hope characters to <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> that year. Both Adam Arkin and Lauren Holly had previously appeared on <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> as a lawyer and as a deputy sheriff, respectively.|$|R
50|$|A <b>picket</b> <b>fence,</b> ideally white, has iconic {{status as}} Americana, symbolizing the ideal middle-class {{suburban}} life, {{with a family}} and children (2.5 children and a dog), large house, and peaceful living. This {{stems from the fact}} that houses in quiet, middle-class neighborhoods often have gardens enclosed by <b>picket</b> <b>fences.</b> In recent years, some people have associated <b>picket</b> <b>fences</b> with what they regard as the more negative aspects of this lifestyle. For example, the director David Lynch uses ironic images of the <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> in his 1986 film Blue Velvet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Picket</b> <b>fences</b> are {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} United States, where the style has been used since America's earliest colonial era and remains popular today. They are a decorative way to contain pets and children without blocking views, and are used around both front and back yards. Traditionally <b>picket</b> <b>fences</b> were made out of wood and painted white (or whitewashed), but now <b>picket</b> <b>fences</b> are also widely available in polyvinyl chloride (PVC).|$|R
30|$|The interharmonic {{causes the}} <b>picket</b> <b>fence</b> effects if the {{frequency}} falls between two adjacent bin components.

50|$|<b>Picket</b> <b>fences</b> {{can be made}} {{of several}} types of {{material}}s. Historically, wood {{has been the most}} popular material used for <b>picket</b> <b>fences.</b> This wood can be untreated, treated, or naturally insect and rot resistant. Other non-wood options are available; including vinyl, aluminum, and PVC.|$|R

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences,</b> which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences,</b> and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences.</b> Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences.</b> We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson. Ladner, British Columbia served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in Cloverdale, with the local employees being used for the butchering and cleaning up scenes.|$|R

5000|$|Also, as {{the story}} goes, David E. Kelley and Chris Carter (creator of The X-Files) were talking {{in a parking lot}} on the Fox lot one day and thought it might be {{interesting}} to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Originally, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints- one from the X-Files perspective and the other from <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences.</b> The official approval was never given by Fox and CBS, so the only remnants remaining of this effort are the X-Files episode [...] "Red Museum" [...] and the <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> episode [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] having similar plotlines involving cows. While every reference to <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> has been purged from the X-Files episode, there still are some small winks left in the <b>Picket</b> <b>Fences</b> episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files and some minor characters there.|$|R
