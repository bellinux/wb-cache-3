As Gareth Mallory, the newly appointed M, continues fighting <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> that threaten the future of MI6, Bond follows a trail from Mexico to Austria and Morocco as he is drawn into a confrontation with an enemy from his past; one who holds a dangerous secret that will force him to question the value of everything he has fought to protect.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. <b>Political</b> <b>pressures,</b> {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{various levels}} of {{government}} in the Socialist Republic of Croatia initiated planning processes aimed at development of road transport infrastructure of the then constituent republic of Yugoslavia. The first proposal of a motorway link in Croatia was made by Josip Roglić, {{a member of the}} Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts at the time. He proposed the motorway to be built between Zagreb and Split. In 1962, a formal proposal was made by local authorities in Split, resulting in Croatian government adopting a framework motorway development plan in 1966. Designs were commissioned in 1967, extending the route north to Maribor, Slovenia for the first time. The extension largely used the same corridor as an existing ZagrebMaribor roadZagorje Highwaya congested and insufficiently safe two-lane road with at-grade intersections, connecting numerous towns and villages between Zagreb and Maribor. The road itself represented yet another upgrade of a transport route recorded along ZagrebMaribor corridor since Middle Ages. The plan was shelved because of <b>political</b> <b>pressures</b> following suppression of Croatian Spring only to be reinstated upon Croatian independence from Yugoslavia.|$|E
40|$|The US-China game of Renminbi (RMB) /US Dollar {{exchange}} rate has aroused increasing attention recently. From the US perspective, appreciation of RMB {{exchange rate}} {{could reduce the}} US-China trade deficit, boost the US economy and thus lower the unemployment rate (Cheng and Zhang, 2012). Therefore it is crucial for the US government {{to figure out whether}} there is an influence from US <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> on RMB flexibility and {{the most effective way to}} accelerate the appreciation of RMB exchange rate. Aminian et al (2008) believed that US <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> may be one of the causes for the appreciation of RMB exchange rate, while Liu and Pauwels (2012) stated that there is no significant impact from external <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> on RMB exchange rate. Previous studies only examined the impact of one aspect of US <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> on the RMB exchange rate. That’s why the conflict appears. This paper will fill in the gap of previous literature and resolve the conflict by investigating the impact of US <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> from three aspects, namely, from US Congress, the US public media and from US lobbyists. This paper finds that the <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> from Congress and the US public media alone have little impact on the RMB exchange rate in the short run, while the <b>political</b> <b>pressure</b> from US lobbyist...|$|R
