5|$|Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin; James Chaney, {{an activist}} {{who was one}} of three civil rights workers murdered in 1964; and Hartley <b>Peavey,</b> founder of <b>Peavey</b> Electronics {{headquartered}} in Meridian. The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966â€“1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists. For the first time, an all-white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing <b>Peavey,</b> and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. <b>Peavey</b> also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E
50|$|The CS series {{amplifiers}} (mainly the CS800) {{are some}} of the most used amplifiers in the world, and among <b>Peavey's</b> best selling products.|$|R
50|$|In {{the sport}} {{not only is}} skill {{required}} but {{you also need to}} use the right equipment. When competing you will need a few basic items: cross-cut saws, bow saws, axes, <b>peaveies,</b> foot and leg protection, and climbing gear for the pole climb.|$|R
50|$|Other Explorer-esque guitars {{include the}} ESP EX Dean Guitars' Z, Greco guitars' Explorer, Aria Pro II, Kramer's Condor, <b>Peavey's</b> Rotor series, Rondo Music's Douglas Halo and Agile Ghost, Gordon-Smith's Explorer, Chapman Guitars' Ghost Fret, and the Cort Effector, {{which is an}} Explorer version with {{built-in}} effects, but no pickup toggle switch.|$|R
5|$|The total {{manufacturing}} {{employment of}} Lauderdale County in April 2010 was 2,850 people. <b>Peavey</b> Electronics Corporation, which has manufactured guitars, amplifiers, and sound equipment since 1965, operates {{its headquarters in}} the city. Other businesses in the area include Avery Dennison, Structural Steel Services, Sara Lee, Tower Automotive, and Teikuro Corporation. The city {{is also home to}} four industrial parks.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert Giroux,"Even {{though the}} police decided, after severe questioning, that <b>Peavey</b> {{was not the}} murderer, the Hollywood {{correspondent}} of the New York Daily News, Florabel Muir, came to a private conclusion that <b>Peavey</b> was the murderer. In that era of ingenious women reporters, Muir thought she could engineer a scoop by tricking <b>Peavey</b> into a confession. She knew (from the movies) that blacks were deathly afraid of ghosts. With the help of two confederates, Frank Carson and Al Weinshank, she offered <b>Peavey</b> ten dollars if he would identify Taylor's grave in the Hollywood Park Cemetery (which she had already visited).|$|E
25|$|Becker used {{various types}} of {{amplifiers}} in his music. Before joining Cacophony, he used a small <b>Peavey</b> Studio Pro 40 with the older style <b>Peavey</b> vertical silver stripes on the grille cloth. During his early days Becker was also seen with a red Marshall JCM800 head and 4x12 cabinet.|$|E
5000|$|A {{good example}} of a {{moderately}} complex analog modeling circuit is <b>Peavey's</b> [...] "T-Dynamics" [...] power amplifier design, which (using 100% analog circuitry) emulates complex clipping and bias-shifting characteristics of push-pull tube power amplifiers, {{as well as the}} typically high-ish output impedance of such. Vox [...] "Valve Reactor" [...] power amplifier, Hughes&Kettner [...] "Dynavalve" [...] power amplifier, Pritchard guitar amplifiers and Quilter musical instrument amplifiers are other examples of units that feature analog circuit designs of similar nature. Roland's earliest [...] "Blues Cube" [...] amplifiers employed analog tube modeling circuitry, though Roland did not model specific tube amplifiers, moreso the overall characteristics of a generic tube-based preamplifier circuit. <b>Peavey's</b> [...] "TransTube" [...] preamplifiers are designs of similar nature. Pritchard amplifiers also model characteristics of tube-based circuits in general and without attempt to model any [...] "amp-specific" [...] tones per se.|$|R
50|$|Some {{keyboard}} amps may {{be equipped}} with a compressor or limiter to protect the speaker from damage when the amplifier is being used at high volume levels. Some keyboard amps (e.g., Yorkville's 200 watt keyboard amp and <b>Peavey's</b> KB-4) have an extension speaker jack, which enables the amp {{to be connected to}} a second speaker cabinet for more volume.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} model Bandits had a {{power rating}} of 50 watts RMS into an 8 ohm speaker. The power rating has gradually increased over time, and current model Bandits are rated at 80 watts RMS into 8 ohms, and 100 watts RMS into 4 ohms. In the mid-1990s, the Bandit {{was used to}} introduce <b>Peavey's</b> proprietary TransTube circuitry, a solid-state technology aimed at emulating the sound of tube amplifiers.|$|R
25|$|The JSX began {{life as a}} {{prototype}} <b>Peavey</b> XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature <b>Peavey</b> model. However he still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. Satriani has used other amplifiers {{over the years in}} the studio, such as the <b>Peavey</b> 5150 (used to record the song 'Crystal Planet'), Cornford, and the Mesa/Boogie Mark IIC+ (used to record the song 'Flying in a Blue Dream'), amongst others. He has recently switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, <b>Peavey</b> {{died in a}} San Francisco asylum {{where he}} had been hospitalised for syphilis-related dementia.|$|E
25|$|Alongside Marshall, Takasaki {{has used}} other amp brands. From 1986 to 1988, he used Mesa Boogie amps and cabinets, which were {{possibly}} used to record Hurricane Eyes. In 1988, Takasaki began using Lee Jackson Metaltronix amps, using the M-1000 amps on Soldier of Fortune, On the Prowl, {{and the following}} tours. In 1992, Takasaki would begin using <b>Peavey</b> amps, making use of their solid state Supreme 160 heads, which could be heard on Loudness and the live release Once and for All. <b>Peavey</b> {{would be the last}} company he would endorse before switching back to Marshall in late 1992.|$|E
50|$|The Radial Pro Series were <b>Peavey's</b> {{high end}} drum line. In {{production}} from 1994 until 2002, {{it consisted of}} the RBS-1 prototypes, radial pro 1000, 750/751, and 500/501 models. The flagship 1000 model consisted of a radial bridge that took all the mounting stresses, and a 3-ply thin maple shell to enhance the resonance. The 750/751 series had composite bridges and stained 4-ply thin maple shells. The 500/501 series had composite bridges and wrapped 5-ply North American thin hickory shells.|$|R
50|$|Log rolling or log decking are {{two events}} which rarely run together; a meet has either {{one or the}} other. Both events involve the use of <b>peaveys</b> {{and a pair of}} {{competitors}} to maneuver a log to a set destination. In log decking, the competitors must push the log {{to the top of a}} ramp. In log rolling, the competitors may either have a straight course or a course which requires a series of turns in order to maneuver a log to its finish line. This event is typically run as either a doubles or team event.|$|R
25|$|Satriani has {{endorsed}} Ibanez's JS Series guitars, and <b>Peavey's</b> JSX amplifier. Both lines were designed specifically as signature products for Satriani. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars {{are made by}} Ibanez, including the JS1000, and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the DiMarzio PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the DiMarzio Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he uses in the bridge and neck positions, respectively, from 2005 to present day).|$|R
25|$|As of very recently, Becker {{has allowed}} Paradise Guitars USA {{to release a}} Jason Becker {{signature}} guitar. It is similar in appearance to the numbered <b>Peavey</b> but with a different headstock shape.|$|E
25|$|Satriani's guitars {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, and his 24-fret JS model features a signature single-coil sized humbucker called the Satch Track {{in the neck}} position. Some of his guitars are still equipped with the pickup models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups. Satriani has used {{a wide variety of}} guitar amps, using Marshall for his main amplifier (notably the limited edition blue coloured 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his <b>Peavey</b> signature series amps, the <b>Peavey</b> JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.|$|E
25|$|Cootes and <b>Peavey</b> make a plan {{to steal}} the {{necklace}} during a poetry-reading, while Eve, having heard from Freddie that Joe Keeble plans to give him money, questions Keeble about why he isn't helping out her friend; he enlists her as a helper in the diamond-stealing plot. As Psmith begins his reading of McTodd's poems, Cootes turns off the lights and <b>Peavey</b> grabs the necklace, flinging {{it out of the}} window to where Eve is standing; she hides it in a flowerpot. Returning later to fetch it, she wakes the vigilant Baxter, but evades him, leaving him locked out and stashing her flowerpot on a windowsill.|$|E
5000|$|Today many analog {{modeling}} circuits {{may have}} a digitally-controlled interface, and the analog signal paths within such units are often [...] "re-routed" [...] and reconfigured with aid of digital logic and semiconductor-based switching circuitry. In addition, many [...] "digital" [...] modeling devices that employ DSP may also employ analog modeling circuits. Roland and Line 6, for example, employ analog power amplifier emulation in some of their amplifier models. <b>Peavey's</b> [...] "Vypyr" [...] series of modeling amplifiers utilises analog [...] "TransTube" [...] circuit instead of a digital waveshaper, and Vox Valvetronix amplifiers have throughout their history presented a marriage of semiconductor and vacuum tube -based analog modeling circuitry and digital signal processing circuitry.|$|R
50|$|Neal Moser offers Kahler bridges on many models, and the Jackson and ESP Custom Shops {{currently}} offer Kahlers as {{a custom}} option. ESP and B.C. Rich also offer the Kahler X-TREM on their more affordable signature models for Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King respectively. ESP and B.C. Rich offer the Kahler Hybrid model on their mid-range guitars such as LTD JH-600 and B.C. Rich Wartribe, both with EMG pickups. Gibson has included the Kahler system on limited edition guitars {{such as the}} Gibson Shred-X Explorer and the Gibson Tribal Explorer. <b>Peavey's</b> PXD Void III and Twenty-Three III guitars also feature the Kahler system. Because they are suitable for left handed as well as right handed guitars, Gaskell Guitars offers all Kahler models on their custom left handed guitar builds.|$|R
5000|$|The Grand was {{important}} to the rapid development of West-Central Michigan during the 1850s to 1880s, as logs from Michigan's rich pine and oak forests floated down the Grand River for milling. After the Civil War, many soldiers found jobs as lumberjacks cutting logs and guiding them down the river with pike poles, <b>peaveys,</b> and cant hooks. The men wore bright red flannel, felt clothes, and spiked boots to hold them onto the floating logs; these boots chewed up the wooden sidewalks and flooring of the local bars, leading one hotel owner to supply carpet slippers to all river drivers who entered his hotel. The [...] "jacks" [...] earned $1 to $3 per day and all the [...] "vittles" [...] they could eat, which was usually a considerable amount.|$|R
25|$|As of 2007, Taylor still {{plays the}} Aria, Stingray, Factor, and a <b>Peavey</b> Cirrus 5 and 4 string but {{has also been}} seen playing a 1962 reissue Fender Precision Bass, a Gibson Les Paul bass, and a Warwick Thumb 5.|$|E
25|$|Down at Blandings, Lord Emsworth is dismayed to {{hear from}} Baxter that he is {{expected}} to travel to London to collect the poet Ralston McTodd, invited to the castle by his sister Connie, a keen supporter of the Arts; another poet, Aileen <b>Peavey</b> is already installed at the castle.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the first}} {{standard}} audio mixer incorporating an eight-channel automixer section {{was released by}} <b>Peavey</b> in their Sanctuary Series, and in 2006 the similar HP-W was introduced by Crest. Both mixers were aimed at the House of Worship market, adding functions that ease the process of audio mixing to religious organizations.|$|E
5000|$|The least {{expensive}} practice amps and basic combo amps may {{only have a}} single indicator light: an LED to indicate when the amp's power is on. More expensive amps may also have LEDs to indicate when the preamp has a signal present from the instrument (helpful for troubleshooting during set-up, because if the amp is not producing any bass sound even when the bassist is playing, and the [...] "signal present" [...] light is illuminated, this indicates that a signal is reaching the amp); when a limiter or similar speaker protection feature is activated (e.g., <b>Peavey's</b> DDT system); when clipping is occurring; or when the amp is in standby mode. Amps with a built-in tuner typically have several LEDs to indicate when the note being played is flat, sharp, or in tune.|$|R
5000|$|The Peaveys' machine had {{two pairs}} of {{cylinders}} with an articulation between the pairs to effect steering. At least two prototype vehicles were constructed: one was steam powered the other used a gasoline engine. The prototypes worked well on hard packed snow but failed in soft powder because the flanges had nothing to grip into. The machine was designed to haul logs, but its length and rigid construction meant that it had difficulty with the uneven winter roads {{for which it was}} intended. <b>Peavey's</b> invention could not compete with the Lombard Steam Log Hauler built by Alvin Lombard and it was not produced commercially. (The Lombard vehicle was an early example of a half-track vehicle, it resembled a railway locomotive with a sled or wheels in front for steering and caterpillar tracks for traction.) ...|$|R
60|$|Other bears had {{followed}} him into the camp and found poor pickings. One had thumped open a half barrel of pork and sampled the salty contents, and then had nosed a pile of old moccasins inquisitively. A dozen axes and <b>peaveys</b> had been pulled out of a barrel and thrown on the floor, to see if perchance they had hidden anything good to eat. Every pot and pan in the big cupboard had been taken out and given a lap or two {{to find out what they}} had cooked last; and one bear had stood up on his hind legs and swept off the contents of a high shelf with a sweep of his paw. Altogether the camp had been sacked thoroughly, and it was of little use for any other bear to search the place. The camp seemed to be waiting silently for the lumbermen to come back in the fall and set things to rights.|$|R
25|$|From the mid-1980s, Van Halen {{has used}} a {{real-time}} re-amping or Master/Slave slaving amplifier setup that was originally designed by Bob Bradshaw and {{was published in}} the September 1986 issue of Guitar World Magazine. The first amplifier was a Tube Amplifier, and the second amplifier was an H MOSFET solid state power amplifier. Between 1993 and 2004, Van Halen was sponsored by <b>Peavey</b> Electronics to use their 5150 Amplifiers, which he had a role in designing.|$|E
25|$|One day, a {{stranger}} {{arrives at the}} house claiming to be McTodd, but Psmith turns him politely away. The man, Edward Cootes, runs into Aileen <b>Peavey</b> {{on his way back}} to the station, and we learn they are both crooks, estranged lovers both after the diamonds. Cootes returns to the castle, and forces Psmith to help him get in, which Psmith does, passing him off as his valet. He arranges the use of a small cottage, in case he needs to hide the jewels from Cootes.|$|E
25|$|Welcomed at the castle, {{especially}} by fellow poet <b>Peavey,</b> he is nevertheless suspected by the ever-vigilant Baxter, the real McTodd having telegrammed to cancel his visit. Eve arrives and Psmith begins his wooing with some success, despite her {{belief that he}} is McTodd and has jilted her friend. Freddie, worried {{that one of the}} maids is a detective, is advised by Psmith to kiss her, and judge by her response whether she is a real maid; Psmith and Eve run into him just as he is embracing the girl.|$|E
5000|$|From Stump to Ship is {{an amateur}} {{industrial}} film by Alfred K. Ames, former State Senator {{and owner of}} the Machias Lumber Company, in Machias, Maine as well as by Dr. Howard Kane of Washington, DC. The half-hour 16mm film was shot over the winter of 1930 in the logging woods and shows logging in the forest with hand tools and horses, then moves to the spring log drive, with loggers using <b>peaveys</b> to break up log jams on icy rivers as the logs are moved from the forest to the mill. Detailed views of mill work, changing the bandsaw, and making shingles. Lumber is loaded onto schooners in Machias for transport to New York. The film was originally silent, with a typed script which Ames read aloud when he showed the film. In 1985, with funds from the Maine Humanities Council, the narration was recorded with the film. [...] The film is distributed by Northeast Historic Film, in Bucksport, Maine. Footage was included in the compilation documentary Woodsmen and River Drivers, Another Day, Another Era which also interviewed the surviving woodsmen of the Machias Lumber Company.|$|R
5000|$|To {{ensure that}} logs drifted freely along the river, men called [...] "log drivers" [...] or [...] "river pigs" [...] {{were needed to}} guide the logs. The drivers {{typically}} divided into two groups. The more experienced and nimble men comprised the [...] "jam" [...] crew or [...] "beat" [...] crew. They watched the spots where logs were likely to jam, and when a jam started, tried {{to get to it}} quickly and dislodge the key logs before many logs stacked up. If they didn't, the river would keep piling on more logs, forming a partial dam which could raise the water level. Millions of board feet of lumber could back up for miles upriver, requiring weeks to break up, with some lumber possibly lost if it was shoved far enough into the shallows. [...] So when the jam crew saw a jam start, they rushed to it and tried to break it up, using <b>peaveys</b> and possibly dynamite. This job required some understanding of physics, strong muscles, and extreme agility. The jam crew was an exceedingly dangerous occupation, with the drivers standing on the moving logs and running from one to another. Many drivers lost their lives by falling and being crushed by the logs.Each crew was accompanied by an experienced boss often selected for his fighting skills to control the strong and reckless men of his team. The overall drive was controlled by the [...] "walking boss" [...] who moved from place to place to coordinate the various teams to keep logs moving past problem spots. Stalling a drive near a saloon often created a cascade of drunken personnel problems.|$|R
5000|$|Smaller speaker {{cabinets}} with one, two, or four speakers, {{are more}} commonly used than the 8x10", because while the 8x10" [...] cabinet is able to produce huge volume and powerful bass tone, the cabinets are very heavy and hard to transport. The 2x10" [...] and 4x10" [...] designs are popular for bassists who need less stage volume and an easier-to-transport cabinet to take to rehearsals and gigs. Some bassists own two or more smaller cabinets, such as two 4x10" [...] cabinets. This way, a bassist playing a stadium concert on one day can bring both of her 4x10" [...] cabs, but then if she is playing a nightclub show the next day, or going to rehearsal, she only needs to bring one 4x10" [...] cab. Some single cabinets use mixed speaker sizes, although this is less common. Examples include MESA Engineering's 1x15"/4x10" [...] cabinet, <b>Peavey's</b> PVH 1516, which has 1x15" [...] and 2x8" [...] speakers. and Traynor's TC1510 combo, which has 1x15" [...] and 2x10". Other large single cabinets with speaker sizes other than 10", 12" [...] or 15" [...] are less commonly used, but they do exist. Examples include the 6x8" [...] and 8x8" [...] cab configurations. Users of two cabinets may use two 4x10" [...] cabinets (more easy to transport than a single 8x10" [...] cab), a 15" [...] cab and a 2x10" [...] cab, or other variations (e.g., a 2x15" [...] cab and a 4x10" [...] cab). One reason that some bass players choose to use a [...] "bass stack" [...] rather than a combo is that the separate component approach enables bassists to use different speaker cabinets for different shows or activities. For example, a bassist playing a stadium may use an 8x10" [...] cab for this show, but then bring a 4x10" [...] cab for a nightclub show the next day, or a 1x12" [...] cab for a studio recording.|$|R
