5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in <b>pet</b> slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among <b>pet</b> lorises. <b>Pet</b> owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal <b>pet</b> is awake.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} known to gerontologists for some time that <b>pets,</b> {{particularly}} those such as cats and dogs that exhibit a range of behaviors and emotions, help prevent depression in the elderly.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a brief {{representation}} of <b>pets</b> in American culture. Through fieldwork involving observation and participation at an animal shelter in Radnor, Pennsylvania and interviews with middle class Americans I {{have been able to}} present the views that middle class Americans have of <b>pets,</b> as well as how <b>pets</b> are treated by middle class Americans. My work has focused on ideas of family and hierarchy to determine how <b>pets</b> are viewed and understood by middle class Americans. I am interested if whether the way middle class Americans view <b>pets</b> as family and the way middle class Americans treat <b>pets</b> are or are not contradictory and whether or not <b>pets</b> fit the cultural definition of family. These ideas provide an exploration of <b>pets</b> and the family, and in turn illuminate something greater about the American family and its structure...|$|R

5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the <b>pet</b> trade, and is sold as an exotic <b>pet</b> throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a <b>pet</b> it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the <b>pet</b> trade is inflated by replacements. With a greater purchasing power, the increasing human populations in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E
