5000|$|Ferruccio Busoni <b>prepared</b> <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> {{arrangement}} {{which was}} published in 1897 by Breitkopf & Härtel. Alan Walker, Liszt's biographer, said that it [...] "represents one of the pinnacles of twentieth-century virtuosity." [...] Liszt at least once performed his own piano transcription, of which Walter Bache, his student, made an account in 1862. Liszt never seems to have notated such a version.|$|R

5000|$|A {{rehearsal}} is {{an activity}} in the performing arts that occurs as preparation for a performance in music, theatre, dance and related arts, such as opera, musical theatre and film production.

The term [...] "rehearsal" [...] typically refers to ensemble activities undertaken by a group of people.

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the [...] "prepared piano", per se, is usually traced to John Cage. Cage first <b>prepared</b> <b>a</b> <b>piano</b> when he was commissioned to write music for Bacchanale, a dance by Syvilla Fort in 1938. For some time previously, Cage had been writing exclusively for a percussion ensemble, but the hall where Fort’s dance was to be staged had no room for a percussion group. The only instrument available was <b>a</b> single grand <b>piano.</b> After some consideration, Cage said that {{he realized it was}} possible “to place {{in the hands of a}} single pianist the equivalent of an entire percussion orchestra ... With just one musician, you can really do an unlimited number of things on the inside of the piano if you have at your disposal an exploded keyboard”.|$|R
