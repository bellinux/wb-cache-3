5000|$|The hull {{was divided}} by 13 <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> into 14 <b>watertight</b> compartments.|$|R
50|$|Both El Capitan {{and sister}} ship El Almirante were {{designed}} by the line's engineer, A. S. Hebble, as single screw ships with three complete steel decks on a transverse framing system. <b>Watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> extending to the main deck were fitted at the forepeak, between #1 and #2 holds, aft the engine room and after peak. A <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> extending only to the lower deck was fitted aft the ballast tank.|$|R
50|$|The {{hull and}} {{superstructure}} are constructed of all-welded aluminium alloy. The hull includes 7 <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> forming 8 <b>watertight</b> compartments.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{powerplant}} {{consisted of}} two vertical triple expansion steam engines, with eight cylindrical boilers in two boiler rooms separated by a <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} a {{preliminary}} to a modification concept of the sliding <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> door used on ships and vessels. Hydraulic or electro-hydraulic drives used to move these doors require complicated and extended pressure installations with large amounts of hydraulic fluid. Well-known operational drawbacks of these installations include high level of noise and possibility of various leaks in the hydraulic system. Being {{the first in a}} series, the present article describes and analyses critical states which can take place during evacuation of people through openings in the <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> doors on seagoing ships and vessels...|$|R
2500|$|The {{transverse}} framed, [...] length overall, [...] {{length between perpendiculars}} double bottomed hull {{was divided}} into fourteen watertight compartments by <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> extending up to [...] "A" [...] deck.|$|R
50|$|Its two {{engine rooms}} are {{separated}} by a <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> division. Each engine room has its own fuel, lubricating, cooling and electrical distribution systems and is fully independent of the other.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transverse}} framed, 522 ft length overall, 502 ft {{length between perpendiculars}} double bottomed hull {{was divided}} into fourteen watertight compartments by <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> extending up to [...] "A" [...] deck.|$|R
500|$|Underwater {{protection}} {{was minimal}} {{as there was}} only [...] <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> behind the upwards extension of the double bottom and even this was squeezed out as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets.|$|R
500|$|Five [...] <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> {{divided the}} hull into compartments, {{although}} they only {{reached up to}} the main deck. Friedland {{did not have a}} double bottom. The metacentric height of the ship was low, a little above [...]|$|R
50|$|The Sea Cloud II has {{an overall}} length of 105.90 m. Her maximum beam is 16.0 m and her draught is {{described}} as 5.70 m. Her hull is built of standard shipbuilding steel, and is fitted with eight <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nantucket {{measured}} 190 {{feet long}} with {{a beam of}} 33 feet. It was copper fastened, and its double frame made of oak, hackmatack and cedar. It goes [...] "toot toot". Its hull had three <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> and drew four-and-a-half feet of water.|$|R
50|$|The heroism of Captain Harvey, {{who died}} after having {{ensured that the}} {{passengers}} would be first to abandon the ship, was praised by Victor Hugo, who also recommended that London and South Western Railway equip its ships with <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> sufficient life jackets, and floating lights.|$|R
25|$|Three {{types of}} doors are {{commonly}} used between compartments. A closed watertight door is structurally capable of withstanding the same pressures as the <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> they penetrate, although such doors require frequent maintenance to maintain effective seals, and must, of course, be kept closed to effectively contain flooding.|$|R
50|$|Peacemaker {{has a large}} {{deckhouse}} and spacious cabins {{finished in}} mahogany, modeled after the interior of Cutty Sark. She also has an innovative transom that can be lowered while in port to reveal a <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> with two large doors opening into a cargo area and fully equipped workshop.|$|R
50|$|The {{design for}} Akashi {{was based on}} an all-steel, double-bottomed hull, with an armored deck, divided {{underneath}} by <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> The armor, of the Harvey armor variety, covered only vital areas, such as the boilers, gun magazines and critical machinery, with a thickness of 25 mm on the deck.|$|R

5000|$|When unintentional, {{grounding}} {{may result}} simply in stranding, {{with or without}} damage to the submerged part of the ship’s hull. Breach of the hull may lead to significant flooding, which {{in the absence of}} containment in <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> may substantially compromise the ship's structural integrity, stability, and safety.|$|R

500|$|Mark Thompson, a {{merchant}} seaman {{and author of}} numerous books on Great Lakes shipping, stated that if her cargo holds had watertight subdivisions, [...] "the Fitzgerald could have made it into Whitefish Bay."

50|$|Built {{for hard}} {{service in the}} port the vessel had {{strengthened}} towing bitts and ice guards and a hull with three <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> The deck house contained rooms for the captain and mate with a galley aft. An 8 ft square hatch was located on the foredeck for access below.|$|R

2500|$|Raced {{over four}} legs; Newport, Rhode Island — Cape Town — Sydney — Rio de Janeiro — Newport. [...] Two classes of boat were entered: Class 1, from 50–60feet (15.2–18.3m); and Class 2, 40–50feet (12.2–15.2m). [...] New safety rules were {{introduced}} for this race, including compulsory <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> {{and a simple}} stability check.|$|R
500|$|After Fitzgerald foundered, Great Lakes {{shipping}} companies {{were accused of}} valuing cargo payloads more than human life, since the vessel's cargo hold of [...] had been divided by two non-watertight traverse [...] "screen" [...] bulkheads. The NTSB Fitzgerald investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> in their cargo holds.|$|R

5000|$|The next {{target was}} the British {{refrigerated}} ship Waroonga, carrying much needed butter and cheese from New Zealand for the war-weary British population. She {{was hit with}} 2 torpedoes, but stayed afloat thanks {{to the integrity of}} her <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> However, it wasn’t to last as she too was despatched by [...] the following day.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored {{pilothouse}} was mounted {{on top of}} the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
500|$|Agincourt {{had another}} {{weakness}} {{in that she}} was not subdivided to Royal Navy standards as the Brazilians preferred to eliminate all possible <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> that might limit the size of the compartments and interfere with the crew's comfort. One example was the officer's wardroom, which was [...] in size, much larger than anything in the Grand Fleet.|$|R
500|$|Underwater {{protection}} {{was minimal}} {{as there was}} only a single <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> presumably of high-tensile steel, behind the upwards extension of the double bottom. This was an extension of the splinter bulkhead and was also 3.4meters inboard. A more comprehensive system was considered early in the design process but rejected because it would have cost some [...]|$|R
50|$|Calgarian was 590 ft length on waterline, 570 ft length between perpendiculars, 70 ft molded beam, with a depth molded to {{the bridge}} deck of 54 ft and a mean {{designed}} draft of 28 ft and gross tonnage of 18,000 tons. There were eleven <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> and a double bottom to {{the turn of the}} bilge.|$|R
50|$|The {{damage to}} the ship was considerable: {{virtually}} the entire underside of the vessel had been ripped open by the collision, and seawater rapidly flooded the cargo holds and engine room. The ship had been built in 1878, before <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads</b> came into use, and sank in 287 ft of water only ten minutes after striking the reef.|$|R
