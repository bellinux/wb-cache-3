40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationship}} between causal attribution beliefs of students and their self-esteem. The sample of the study comprised of 3614 students including 1868 male and 1746 female students studying in the 10 th grade from 72 public sector schools across 6 districts (selected on the geographical basis) of Punjab. The data were collected by using two research instruments. A 5 -point rating scale, Causal Attribution Beliefs Scale (CABS) was used to measure causal attributions beliefs of students. Eight attributes were included in the instrument i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence. Another instrument, a 5 -point rating scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to measure self-esteem of the students. According to the nature of the data and to address the research questions, different statistical techniques i. e. inferential statistics like Independent Sample t-Tests, MANOVA, Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were applied. The results of the study revealed that students endorsed all given causes (ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence) as a potential cause of both success and failure. Identical patterns of success were observed in mathematics and English. Both girls and boys ranked teacher. s influence, effort and <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence as their prime causes of success in mathematics. Both male students and female students believe teacher. <b>s</b> influence, effort, <b>parent</b> influence and ability as the primary causes of their success in English. However, there were significant differences in failure attribution patterns. Male students consider lack of effort, lack of interest and wrong use of strategy as the main causes of their failure in mathematics. Whereas, female students considered lack of effort, wrong use of strategy and task difficulty as major causes of their failure in mathematics. In the same way, male students. main causes of failure in English were ranked as lack of interest, lack of effort and wrong use of strategy. While female students ranked failure causes in English as lack of effort, task difficulty and wrong use of strategy. Majority of the students showed high self-esteem levels. Only 14 % of the male students and 10 % of the female students exhibited low self-esteem level. Gender difference was found in self-esteem. Girls showed higher self-esteem level than boys. Similarly, urban students showed higher self-esteem level than rural students and science students showed higher self-esteem level than arts students. Relationship between causal attribution beliefs of students and self-esteem was found at secondary level. A small, negative but significant correlation was found in failure attributions and self-esteem level of the students. The relationship between failure attributions in mathematics and self-esteem was found in three attributions i. e. ability, luck and <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence: whereas the relationship between failure attributions in English and self-esteem was found in five attributions i. e. ability, strategy, luck, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence. A small but positive correlation was found between success attributions and self-esteem level of the students. As far as success attributions in mathematics and self-esteem were concerned, four attributions i. e. ability, effort, interest and <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence were positively correlated. Similarly, relationship between success attributions in English and self-esteem was found in six attributions i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, <b>parent.</b> <b>s</b> influence and teacher. s influence. Attributional patterns are changeable and can be taught to the students. The teachers should encourage their students to the attributions of controllable causes, so that changed self-perception brings academic improvement. The teacher. s feedback is very important in changing students. attributional beliefs. They must be trained in approaching their students, motivating them intrinsically and provision of suitable oral / written feedback to them so that in result students. desire to learn, to discover, to comprehend, to develop etc, can be flourished...|$|R

40|$|In loving {{other humans}} and God do I love them {{for my own}} {{advantage}} or purely for themselves? This dissertation looks at the various answers that have been provided to this question in the Ancient Greek and Roman Period, the Patristic Period, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Four main solutions to this question (pure egoism, enlightened egoism, disinterested theories, and harmonism) are profiled with respect to seven topics (injustice, virtue, self-love, friendship, sacrifice, the love of God, and spiritual consolations). Pure egoism, represented in Thrasymachus, Aristippus, and Carneades, holds that self-love takes priority over all other forms of love and that self-love {{and the love of}} others are incompatible. Thus it holds that virtue and friendship with other people can be dispensed with if this leads to one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> advancement. Enlightened egoists, such as Epicurus, Tertullian, Valerian, and Valla, still hold that one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> good takes priority, however, they think {{that the best way to}} assure one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> happiness is to practice virtue, form close friendships with other humans, and perhaps love God. The disinterested proponents of love, such as Seneca, Clement of Alexandria, Chrysostom, Abelard, and Eckhart, argue that love should only consider the good of others even if this means the loss of one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> happiness. Indeed it was often held that a love of other humans and God which is and unpleasant is best. The harmonists, represented by Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas, held with the egoists that it was justifiable to find happiness in the love of other humans and God. Yet the harmonists also held with the disinterested theorists that one should love others for themselves and not exclusively for one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> sake. Lastly I take up a defense of harmonism and show how love can be both other-directed and self-fulfilling (the problem of love). Hence I construct a metaphysics of love based on the work of von Hildebrand and argue that by apprehending others as full of value we recognize our own fulfillment comes through acts of love which affirm their intrinsic worth...|$|R
