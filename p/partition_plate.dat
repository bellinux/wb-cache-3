This heat transfer enhancing technique was further investigated experimentally in air as ambience by Parishwad et al. (2006). The numerical analysis of this technique is done using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT, for natural convection adjacent to a vertical heated plate in ambient air surrounding. Because of boundary layer development the vertical fins are inapplicable in the heat transfer enhancement. As compared to conventional vertical fins, this V-type <b>Partition</b> <b>Plate</b> works not only as extended surface but also as Flow separators. This V-type <b>Partition</b> <b>Plate</b> is compact and hence highly economical.

The combs are polybutadienes (1, 4 -addition) consisting of an H-skeleton with an additional off-center branch on the backbone. We chose to investigate a solution in order to obtain reliable nonlinear shear data in overlapping dynamic regions with the two different techniques. The transient measurements obtained by cone <b>partitioned</b> <b>plate</b> indicated the appearance of overshoots in both the shear stress and the first normal stress difference during start-up shear flow. Interestingly, the overshoots in the start-up normal stress difference started to occur only at rates above the inverse stretch time of the backbone, when the stretch time of the backbone was estimated in analogy with linear chains including the effects of dynamic dilution of the branches but neglecting the effects of branch point friction, in excellent agreement with the situation for linear polymers. Flow-birefringence measurements were performed in a Couette geometry, and the extracted steady-state shear and first normal stress differences were found to agree well with the mechanical data, but were limited to relatively low rates below the inverse stretch time of the backbone. Finally, the steady-state properties were found to be in good agreement with model predictions based on a nonlinear multimode tube model developed for linear polymers when the branches are treated as solvent...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many practical cases of fracture {{can be considered as}} one-dimensional, that is, propagating in one dimension and characterised by opening (mode I) and shearing (mode II) action only with no tearing (mode III) action. A double cantilever beam (DCB) represents the most fundamental one-dimensional fracture problem. There has however been considerable confusion in calculating its mixed-mode energy release rate (ERR) partition. In this work, new and completely analytical mixed-mode partition theories are developed for one-dimensional fractures in isotropic homogeneous and laminated composite DCBs, based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and using the Euler and Timoshenko beam theories. They are extended to isotropic homogeneous and laminated composite straight beam structures and isotropic homogeneous plates based on the Kirchhoff-Love and Mindlin-Reissner plate theories. They are also extended to non-rigid elastic interfaces for isotropic homogeneous DCBs. A new approach is used, based on orthogonal pure fracture modes. Two sets of orthogonal pairs of pure modes are found. They are distinct from each other in the present Euler beam and Kirchhoff-Love <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories and coincide on the first set in the present Timoshenko beam and Mindlin-Reissner <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories. After the two sets of pure modes are shown to be unique and orthogonal, they are used to partition mixed modes. Interaction is found between the mode I and mode II modes of the first set in the present Euler beam and Kirchhoff-Love <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories. This alters the ERR partition but does not affect the total ERR. There is no interaction in the present Timoshenko beam or Mindlin-Reissner <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories. The theories distinguish between local and global ERR partitions. Local pureness is defined with respect to the crack tip. Global pureness is defined with respect to the entire region mechanically affected by the crack. It is shown that the global ERR partition using any of the present partition theories or two-dimensional elasticity is given by the present Euler beam or Kirchhoff-Love <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories. The present partition theories are extensively validated using the finite element method (FEM). The present beam and <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories are in excellent agreement with results from the corresponding FEM simulations. Approximate 'averaged partition rules' are also established, based on the average of the two present beam or <b>plate</b> <b>partition</b> theories. They give close approximations to the partitions from two-dimensional elasticity. The propagation of mixed-mode interlaminar fractures in laminated composite beams is investigated using experimental results from the literature and various partition theories. The present Euler beam partition theory offers the best and most simple explanation for all the experimental observations. It is in excellent agreement with the linear failure locus and is significantly closer than other partition theories. It is concluded that its excellent performance is either due to the failure of materials generally being based on global partitions or due to the through-thickness shear effect being negligibly small for the specimens tested. The present partition theories provide an excellent tool for studying interfacial fracture and delamination. They are readily applicable to a wide-range of engineering structures and will be a valuable analytical tool for many practical applications...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic lenses have {{traditionally}} been designed by analyzing and combining different electrode configurations. Computational complexity typically limits such systems to a few geometrically simple elements, where the component interactions are neglected and not exploited to combat the various aberrations. Recently, Szilagyi and Szep have demonstrated that an axially symmetric column of circular plates, with the electrode potentials optimized for focusing, can surpass the typical conventional designs by many times in performance. Following the footsteps of pioneers like Burfoot and Hawkes, we <b>partition</b> the <b>plates</b> in order to transcend the limitations set by Scherzer's theorem on the chromatic and spherical aberrations of axially symmetric structures. Two algorithms, one based upon integral asymptotics and one upon the Levinson algorithm. for Toeplitz matrix inversion, are developed to complement the charge-density method in analyzing the new column structures. Various optimization schemes are combined to avoid shallow minima at a reasonable computational cost. With each <b>plate</b> <b>partitioned</b> into four sectors, we show that the interactions between the monopole and the quadrupole components can increase the output current density by more than 400 % over the axially symmetric structure. By adjusting the sector potentials, we can realize systems capable of both focusing and deflecting the beam. In comparison to some existing designs, our systems excel in both performance and compactness, sometimes by many hundred percents. We then further <b>partition</b> the <b>plates</b> to generate the "octupole" deflectors and correctors. We show that the "octupole" deflectors can drastically slow down the beam degradation with deflection distance and that the correctors can further increase the output current density by more than 300 %. Finally, we apply linear system theories {{to the study of}} the first-order properties of optical systems with different symmetries. We showed, without resorting to perturbational mathematics, that the higher multipole components, with more than 2 folds of rotational symmetry, can induce no first-order influences. We also find that there are systems with other symmetries that can replace an axially symmetric structure in the first-order approximation. This latter study is the beginning of our investigation for the optimum system geometry...|$|R

40|$|Oblique {{relative}} plate {{motion is}} ubiquitous at convergent margins, often {{resulting in a}} significant component of motion parallel to the margin. Partitioning of relative plate motion can result in deformation that is accommodated as spatially distinct margin-parallel shear and margin-normal thrusting, and {{lead to the development}} and migration of crustal slivers. These slivers, bounded by thrust faults at the trench and arc-ward by a well-developed margin-parallel strike-slip fault, are observed at about half of all modern convergent boundaries. Some modestly oblique settings have developed fore-arc slivers while other margins, with higher obliquities, have failed to effectively <b>partition</b> <b>plate</b> motion into distinct zones suggesting mechanisms other than obliquity are important in partitioning. Analog modeling has shown that pure frictional wedges always partition deformation but produce sliver like motion and structures at only very high obliquities. The presence of ductile layers at depth in some analog models, however, can localize shear at much lower obliquities. In light of this, we have performed, {{for a wide range of}} obliquities, finite-element numerical simulations of convergent wedges with similar geometries and distributions in strength as layered analog models, with a basal ductile layer. For these models, we solve force-balance equations for Stokes flow using COMSOL Multiphysics in order to quantify the magnitude and style of stress. Our numerical models display a similar distribution of cross-sectional topography and surface velocity fields compared to their counter part oblique analog experiments. The numerical models also demonstrate a progressive localization of margin-parallel shear with the growth of wedge topography. All wedges with a non-zero obliquity eventually show the onset and localization of shear indicative of strike-slip deformation, which we quantify by calculating the principal horizontal stress field, as well as, the margin-normal and margin-parallel components We show that the distribution of the angle 2 ̆ 7 alpha 2 ̆ 7 across the wedge, where alpha is defined as the angle between the greatest stress and the margin normal, is diagnostic of partitioning. The distribution of alpha allows us to constrain the transition between distributed shear and localized partitioning in the evolving wedges. These results suggest, in conjunction with analog models, that viscous behavior at depth, responding to increasing topography during convergence, work to localize margin-parallel shear in obliquely convergent wedges and gives a mechanism for the development of fore-arc slivers in nature at small obliquities. ...|$|E

40|$|Estimating {{the extent}} of interseismic {{coupling}} along subduction zone megathrusts is essential for quantitative assessments of seismic and tsunami hazards. Up to now, quantifying the seismogenic potential of the eastern Makran subduction zone at {{the northern edge of}} the Indian ocean has remained elusive due to a paucity of geodetic observations. Furthermore, non-tectonic processes obscure the signature of accumulating elastic strain. Historical earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 7 have been reported. In particular, the 1945 Mw 8. 1 earthquake resulted in a significant tsunami that swept the shores of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. A quantitative estimate of elastic strain accumulation along the subduction plate boundary in eastern Makran is needed to confront previous indirect and contradictory conclusions about the seismic potential in the region. Here, we infer the distribution of interseismic coupling on the eastern Makran megathrust from time series of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images acquired between 2003 and 2010, applying a consistent series of corrections to extract the low amplitude, long wavelength deformation signal associated with elastic strain on the megathrust. We find high interseismic coupling (i. e. the megathrust does not slip and elastic strain accumulates) in the central section of eastern Makran, where the 1945 earthquake occurred, while lower coupling coincides spatially with the subduction of the Sonne Fault Zone. The inferred accumulation of elastic strain since the 1945 earthquake is consistent with the future occurrence of magnitude 7 + earthquakes and we cannot exclude the possibility of a multi-segment rupture (Mw 8 +).

A unique combination of barcoded primers and a <b>partitioned</b> sequencing <b>plate</b> was employed to designate each sequence read to its original sample. The sequence reads were aligned according to the S. salar mitochondrial reference sequence (NC_ 001960. 1), {{with the objective of}} identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They were validated if they met with the following three stringent criteria: (i) sequence reads were produced from both DNA strands; (ii) SNPs were confirmed in a minimum of 90 % of replicate sequence reads; and (iii) SNPs occurred in more than one individual. Results Pyrosequencing generated a total of 179, 826, 884 bp of data, and 10, 765 of the total 10, 920 S. salar sequences (98. 6 %) were assigned back to their original samples. The approach taken resulted in a total of 216 SNPs and 2 indels, which were validated and mapped onto the S. salar mitochondrial genome, including 107 SNPs and one indel not previously reported. An average of 27. 3 sequence reads {{with a standard deviation of}} 11. 7 supported each SNP per individual. Conclusion The study generated a mitochondrial SNP panel from a large sample group across a broad geographical area, reducing the potential for ascertainment bias, which has hampered previous studies. The SNPs identified here validate those identified in previous studies, and also contribute additional potentially informative loci for the future study of phylogeography and evolution in the Atlantic salmon.

30|$|We thus {{conclude}} that slip partitioning {{occurred during the}} 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. The term “slip partitioning” is used to describe oblique motion along a fault system that is accommodated on two or more faults with different mechanisms (Fitch 1972; McCaffrey 1992; Jones and Wesnousky 1992; Bowman et al. 2003). Slip partitioning is observed {{at a variety of}} scales. For example, Fitch (1972) observed that larger-scale (over 100  km) slip partitioning occurs along subduction systems. As shown in Fig.  1 a, an oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea plate underneath southwest Japan is accommodated not only by the megathrust earthquakes along the Nankai Trough but also by right-lateral slip along the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) active fault system. The separation distance between the Nankai Trough and the MTL is over 100  km, which is comparable with depth of the upper mantle and the thickness of the <b>plate.</b> <b>Partitioned</b> slip separated by several tens of kilometer distance was explained by deeper oblique driving motion in viscous lower crust (Bowman et al. 2003). Slip partitioning could be explained as a result of upward propagation of oblique shear at depth. The authors validated the model by applying it to parts of the San Andreas and Haiyuan faults.|$|R

A unique combination of barcoded primers and a <b>partitioned</b> sequencing <b>plate</b> was employed to designate each sequence read to its original sample. The sequence reads were aligned according to the S. salar mitochondrial reference sequence (NC_ 001960. 1), {{with the objective of}} identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They were validated if they met with the following three stringent criteria: (i) sequence reads were produced from both DNA strands; (ii) SNPs were confirmed in a minimum of 90 % of replicate sequence reads; and (iii) SNPs occurred in more than one individual. Results Pyrosequencing generated a total of 179, 826, 884 bp of data, and 10, 765 of the total 10, 920 S. salar sequences (98. 6 %) were assigned back to their original samples. The approach taken resulted in a total of 216 SNPs and 2 indels, which were validated and mapped onto the S. salar mitochondrial genome, including 107 SNPs and one indel not previously reported. An average of 27. 3 sequence reads {{with a standard deviation of}} 11. 7 supported each SNP per individual. Conclusion The study generated a mitochondrial SNP panel from a large sample group across a broad geographical area, reducing the potential for ascertainment bias, which has hampered previous studies. The SNPs identified here validate those identified in previous studies, and also contribute additional potentially informative loci for the future study of phylogeography and evolution in the Atlantic salmon. The overall success experienced with this novel application of HT sequencing of targeted regions suggests that the same approach could be successfully applied for SNP mining in other species. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Caribbean {{plate and}} its {{boundaries}} with {{north and south}} America, marked by subduction and large intra-arc strike-slip faults, are a natural laboratory {{for the study of}} strain <b>partitioning</b> and interseismic <b>plate</b> coupling in relation to large earthquakes. Here we use most of the available campaign and continuous GPS measurements in the Caribbean to derive a regional velocity field expressed in a consistent reference frame. We use this velocity field as input to a kinematic model where surface velocities results from the rotation of rigid blocks bounded by locked faults accumulating interseismic strain, while allowing for partial locking along the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola subduction. We test various block geometries, guided by previous regional kinematic models and geological information on active faults. Our findings refine a number of previously established results, in particular slip rates on the strike-slip faults systems bounding the Caribbean plate to the north and south, and the kinematics of the Gonave microplate. Our much-improved GPS velocity field in the Lesser Antilles compared to previous studies does not require the existence of a distinct Northern Lesser Antilles block and excludes more than 3 mm/yr of strain accumulation on the Lesser Antilles-Puerto Rico subduction plate interface, which appears essentially uncoupled. The transition from a coupled to an uncoupled subduction coincides with a transition in the long-term geological behavior of the Caribbean plate margin from compressional (Hispaniola) to extensional (Puerto Rico and Lesser Antilles), a characteristics shared with several other subduction systems...|$|R
40|$|A strong (Mw = 8. 1) {{subduction}} earthquake {{occurred on}} July 30, 1995 in Antofagasta (northern Chile). This {{is one of}} the largest events during this century in the region. It ruptured the southernmost portion of a seismic gap between 18 °S and 25 °S. In 1992 we had used GPS to survey a network with about 50 benchmarks covering a region nearly 500 km long (N-S) and 200 km wide (E-W). Part of these marks were re-surveyed with GPS after the 1995 earthquake. Comparison towards the trench reaching 0. 7 m. The inland subsided several decimeters. The Mejillones Peninsula was uplifted by more than 15 cm. Teleseismic body-wave modelling of VBB records gives a subduction focal mechanism and source time function with three distinct episodes of moment release and southward directivity. Modelling the displacement field using a dislocation with uniform slip in elastic half-space suggests a rupture zone with 19 °- 24 ° eastward dip extending to a depth no greater than 50 km with N-S length of 180 km and an average slip of about 5 m. The component of right-lateral slip inferred both from the teleseismic and geodetic data does not require slip <b>partitioning</b> at the <b>plate</b> boundary. That the well-constrained northern end of the 1995 rupture zone lies under the southern part of the Mejillones Peninsula increases the probability for a next rupture in the gap north of it.

40|$|International audienceThe {{subduction}} of bathymetric anomalies at convergent margins can profoundly affect subduction dynamics, magmatism, and {{the structural}} and geomorphic {{evolution of the}} overriding plate. The Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI) is located east of the Chile Triple Junction at ~ 47 °S, where the Chile Rise spreading center collides with South America. This region is characterized by an abrupt increase in summit elevations and relief that has been controversially debated {{in the context of}} geodynamic versus glacial erosion effects on topography. Here we present geomorphic, thermochronological, and structural data that document neotectonic activity along hitherto unrecognized faults along the flanks of the NPI. New apatite (U-Th) /He bedrock cooling ages suggest faulting since 2 – 3 Ma. We infer the northward translation of an ~ 140 km long fore-arc sliver—the NPI block—results from enhanced <b>partitioning</b> of oblique <b>plate</b> convergence due to the closely spaced collision of three successive segments of the Chile Rise. In this model, greater uplift occurs in the hanging wall of the Exploradores thrust at the northern leading edge of the NPI block, whereas the Cachet and Liquiñe-Ofqui dextral faults decouple the NPI block along its eastern and western flanks, respectively. Localized extension possibly occurs at its southern trailing edge along normal faults associated with margin-parallel extension, tectonic subsidence, and lower elevations along the Andean crest line. Our neotectonic model provides a novel explanation for the abrupt topographic variations inland of the Chile Triple Junction and emphasizes the fundamental effects of local tectonics on exhumation and topographic patterns in this glaciated landscape...|$|R
40|$|The Liquiñe-Ofqui {{fault zone}} (LOFZ) {{is a major}} ~ 1000 km long dextral shear zone of {{southern}} Chile, likely related to strain <b>partitioning</b> of Nazca <b>Plate</b> oblique convergence with South America. To understand block rotation pattern along the LOFZ, we paleomagnetically sampled 55 sites (553 samples) between 38 °S and 41 °S. We gathered Oligocene to Pleistocene volcanics and Miocene granites at a maximum distance of 20 km from the LOFZ, and at both sides of it. Rotations with respect to South America, evaluated for 36 successful sites, show that crust around the LOFZ is fragmented in small blocks, ~ 1 to 10 km in size. While some blocks (at both fault edges) undergo very large 150 °– 170 ° rotations, others do not rotate, even adjacent to fault walls. We infer that rotations affected equidimensional blocks, while elongated crust slivers were translated subparallel to the LOFZ, without rotating. Rotation pattern across the LOFZ is markedly asymmetric. East of the fault and adjacent to it, rotations are up to 150 °– 170 ° clockwise, and fade out ~ 10 km east of fault. These data support a quasi-continuous crust kinematics, characterized by small rigid blocks drag by the underlying ductile crust flow, and imply 120 km of total fault offset. Conversely, crust west of the LOFZ is cut by seismically active NW-SE sinistral antithetic faults, and yields counterclockwise rotations up to 170 ° at 8 – 10 km from LOFZ, besides the unrotated blocks. Further data from the Chile fore arc are needed to understand block rotation kinematics and plate dynamics west of the LOFZ...|$|R

In this work, I use the available campaign and continuous GPS measurements in the Caribbean to derive a regional velocity field expressed in a consistent reference frame. I use this velocity field as input to a kinematic model where surface velocities result from the rotation of rigid blocks bounded by locked faults accumulating inter- seismic strain, while allowing for partial locking along the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola subduction. This improved GPS velocity field in the Lesser Antilles excludes more than 3 mm/yr of strain accumulation on the Lesser Antilles-Puerto Rico subduction plate interface, which appears essentially uncoupled. The transition from a coupled to an uncoupled subduction in the northeastern Caribbean coincides with a transition in the long-term geological behavior of the Caribbean plate margin from compressional (Hispaniola) to extensional (Puerto Rico and Lesser Antilles). ^ Also in Haiti, the ∼ 3 M inhabitant capital region that was severely affected by the devastating M 7. 0, 2010 earthquake continues to expand at a fast rate. Accurate characterization of regional earthquake sources is key to inform urban development and construction practices through improved regional seismic hazard estimates. I also use this improved GPS data set and show that seismogenic strain accumulation in southern Haiti involves an overlooked component of shortening on a south-dipping reverse fault along the southern edge of the Cul-de-Sac basin in addition to the well- known component of left-lateral strike-slip motion. This tectonic model implies that ground shaking may be twice that expected if the major fault was purely strike-slip, as assumed in the current seismic hazard map for the region. ...|$|R
