5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects.

Kanter"In 2006, CDC celebrates its 60 th anniversary. From the agency's relatively humble beginnings in 1946 as a malaria-control agency through its rapid growth in mission and expansion of staff and public health partnerships by 2006, science has been the foundation for everything CDC does. Public health science comprises numerous disciplines that, combined, are more than simply the addition of their parts. This synergy is public health's unique scientific strength.
