25|$|The <b>point</b> <b>L</b> on {{the diagram}} {{represents}} the second quadrature of Jupiter, when the angle between Jupiter and the Sun (as seen from Earth) is 90°. Rømer assumes that an observer could see an emergence of Io {{at the second}} quadrature (L), and the emergence which occurs after one orbit of Io around Jupiter (when the Earth is taken to be at pointK, the diagram not being to scale), that is 42½hours later. During those 42½hours, the Earth has moved further away from Jupiter by the distance LK: this, according to Rømer, is 210 times the Earth's diameter. If light travelled at a speed of one Earth-diameter per second, it would take 3½minutes to travel the distance LK. And if the period of Io's orbit around Jupiter were taken as the time difference between the emergence at L and the emergence at K, the value would be 3½minutes longer than the true value.|$|E

5000|$|The CML {{results from}} the {{combination}} of the market portfolio and the risk-free asset (the <b>point</b> <b>L).</b> All points along the CML have superior risk-return profiles to any portfolio on the efficient frontier, {{with the exception of the}} Market Portfolio, the point on the efficient frontier to which the CML is the tangent. From a CML perspective, the portfolio M is composed entirely of the risky asset, the market, and has no holding of the risk free asset, i.e., money is neither invested in, nor borrowed from the money market account.

5000|$|This is the {{standard}} concept.

We say that [...] such a family is universal if any family of algebro-geometric objects T over any base space B is the pullback of U along a unique map B → M. A fine moduli space is a space M which is the base of a universal family.|$|E
