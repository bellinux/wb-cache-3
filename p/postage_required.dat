25|$|On August 13, 1860 the Post Office {{issued the}} Washington 90¢ issue. Washington's {{engraving}} was modeled after a portrait by John Trumbull, titled George Washington before the Battle of Trenton, painted in 1792. It was only issued {{in the year}} 1860 and because of its high denomination only 29,000 copies were made and surviving examples are scarce. There were very few occasions where the amount of <b>postage</b> <b>required</b> to mail an item {{cost as much as}} 90¢ and as a result, genuine postally used examples of this issue are worth about twice as much as unused specimens.|$|E
2500|$|Postal {{cards and}} postcards are small message cards which are sent by mail unenveloped; the {{distinction}} often, though not invariably and reliably, drawn {{between them is}} that [...] "postal cards" [...] are issued by the postal authority or entity with the [...] "postal indicia" [...] (or [...] "stamp") preprinted on them, while postcards are privately issued and require affixing an adhesive stamp (though {{there have been some}} cases of a postal authority's issuing non-stamped postcards). Postcards are often printed to promote tourism, with pictures of resorts, tourist attractions or humorous messages on the front and allowing for a short message from the sender to be written on the back. The <b>postage</b> <b>required</b> for postcards is generally less than <b>postage</b> <b>required</b> for standard letters; however, certain technicalities such as their being oversized or having cut-outs, may result in payment of the first-class rate being required.|$|E
60|$|The main {{principle}} of equivalent {{for the agency}} of the department is secured by the <b>postage</b> <b>required</b> to be paid upon the transmission of the certificates, augmenting adequately the post-office revenue.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand Post started issuing the Kiwistamp in 2009. One stamp {{will always}} be worth the <b>required</b> <b>postage</b> of a Standard Post medium {{domestic}} letter. Customers may use multiple Kiwistamps or mix them with denominated stamps {{to make up the}} <b>required</b> <b>postage</b> for bigger domestic or international mail.|$|R
25|$|Postal tax — a stamp {{indicating}} that a tax above the <b>postage</b> rate <b>required</b> for sending letters has been paid. This is often mandatory on mail issued {{on a particular}} day or for a few days.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In {{addition}} to being returned by mail, ballots may be deposited in special ballot return boxes. Using these boxes does not <b>require</b> <b>postage,</b> and allows citizens to vote until 8:00 pm on election day.|$|R

50|$|Brewer-Giorgio's {{work had}} an impact in {{unintended}} areas. Fans of Elvis had been calling for a stamp bearing his image, but {{the rules of the}} US <b>Postage</b> Primary <b>required</b> a candidate to have been dead for 10 years. Elvis was under consideration in 1988, however given the questions raised by Brewer-Giorgio and the increase in Elvis-sightings following the publication of her book, the fact of his death was in doubt. This delayed publication of an Elvis stamp until 1993.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{currency}} reform, in 1905, new stamps were issued. Values from 5b to 50b had a silhouette of King Christian IX, while 1fr, 2fr, and 5fr depicted the sailing ship Ingolf in St. Thomas harbor. New <b>postage</b> dues were <b>required</b> as well. Additional 5b stamps were produced by surcharging older stamps.|$|R
5000|$|During the Falklands War of 1982, {{occupied}} islands used stamps of Argentina, and postmarks {{with the}} wording [...] "Islas Malvinas". Since that time, a British garrison has been maintained; while forces mail to home is free, mail to other destinations <b>requires</b> <b>postage</b> franked with British stamps, {{and as of}} 2003 was cancelled with two intertwined circles saying [...] "Falkland Islands BFPO 655 Post Office".|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} very {{successful}} and well-received upon release and eventually became a [...] "Player's Choice Million Seller". Prior to May 31, 1994, Super Mario All-Stars was available as a promotion by Nintendo, giving the game away for free if a Super Nintendo Entertainment System was purchased. The proof of purchase and $3.50 USD—to cover <b>postage</b> and handling—was <b>required</b> to be mailed into Nintendo and Super Mario All-Stars was sent out to the buyer.|$|R
5000|$|Canada Post has {{a special}} postal code for letters to Santa Claus, and since 1982 over 13,000 Canadian postal workers have volunteered to write responses. His address is: Santa Claus, North Pole, Canada, H0H 0H0; no <b>postage</b> is <b>required.</b> (see also: Ho ho ho). (This postal code, in which zeroes are used for the letter [...] "O", is {{consistent}} with the alternating letter-number format of all Canadian postal codes.) Sometimes children's charities answer letters in poor communities, or from children's hospitals, and give them presents they would not otherwise receive. From 2002 to 2014, the program replied to approximately [...] "one million letters or more a year, and in total answered more than 24.7 million letters"; as of 2015, it responds to more than 1.5 million letters per year, [...] "in over 30 languages, including Braille … answering them all in the language they are written".|$|R
50|$|From the 1913 to 1930, Commonwealth and State Government {{agencies}} used stamps (perfins) punctured with OS (“Official Service”). In 1931 the puncturing {{system was}} abandoned and stamps for government mail were overprinted OS. In February 1933, {{it was decided}} that government mail would no longer <b>require</b> <b>postage</b> stamps. The exception to OS stamps being restricted for the use of government agencies was the 4 November 1931 6d airmail stamp. The OS overprinted stamp was sold over post office counters to prevent speculation and was valid for all types of mail.|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Designing a <b>postage</b> stamp <b>requires</b> {{positioning of}} graphic security {{elements in a}} limited small format, so the design is made for two states: for the visible spectrum and the infrared spectrum. Individual screening elements are introduced as security elements in the steganography of invisible pictures in the 700 to 1000 nm spectrum. The CMYKIR theory of hiding the infrared message in the picture is extended by mixing process inks with the control of spot twins of the same colour tone in the X 0 and X 40 states. Two pictures are integrated in the security print; a multicolour picture {{visible to the naked}} eye, and another hidden picture visible when illuminated with an IR detecting instrument. The CMYKIR method is joined with the new element’s algorithm used for dispersing of the hidden picture’s ("Z picture’s") fringes. This kind of steganography is applied in the design of postage stamps and it is a new way of securing them...|$|R
50|$|A Free Frank was a mark {{applied by}} means of a hand-stamp to {{parliamentary}} mail in Britain to indicate that the mailed item did not <b>require</b> <b>postage.</b> The privilege of free franking was granted to four different classes: Members of Parliament; peers sitting in the House of Lords; office-holders, largely as stipulated by Acts of Parliament; and to archbishops and bishops sitting in the House of Lords. Requirement for free franking were that the mailed cover (letter or packet) had to be signed by the official sender. As a result, free franks were avidly sought during the first three decades of the nineteenth century for autograph collections. This was accomplished by cutting out the front panels of the envelope which carried the inscriptions which were required under the use of this privilege. These panels are referred to by collectors as free fronts.In 1840 as a result of various abuses and excesses that had plagued the British Post office for many years, Rowland Hill's reforms brought an end to the Free franking privilege in 1840 when he introduced the postage stamp to Britain.|$|R
50|$|Although the Indian Post Office was {{established}} in 1837, Asia's first adhesive stamp, the Scinde Dawk, was introduced in 1852 by Sir Bartle Frere, the British East India Company's administrator of the province of Sind. The Indian postal system developed into an extensive, dependable and robust network providing connectivity to almost all parts of India, Burma, the Straits Settlements and other areas controlled by the British East India Company (EIC). Based on the model postal system introduced in England by the reformer, Rowland Hill, efficient postal services were provided at a low cost and enabled the smooth commercial, military and administrative functioning of the EIC and its successor, the British Raj. The Imperial Posts co-existed with the several postal systems maintained by various Indian states, some of which produced stamps for use within their respective dominions, while British Indian <b>postage</b> stamps were <b>required</b> for sending mail {{beyond the boundaries of}} these states. Telegraphy and telephony made their appearance as part of the Posts before becoming separate departments. After the Independence of India in 1947, the Indian postal service continues to function on a countrywide basis and provides many valuable, low cost services to the public of India.|$|R
