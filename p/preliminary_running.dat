40|$|Horizontally-scalable Internet {{services}} on clusters of commodity computers {{appear to be}} a great fit for automatic control: there is a target output (service-level agreement), observed output (actual latency), and gain controller (adjusting the number of servers). Yet few datacenters are automated this way in practice, due in part to well-founded skepticism about whether the simple models often used in the research literature can capture complex real-life workload/performance relationships and keep up with changing conditions that might invalidate the models. We argue that these shortcomings can be fixed by importing modeling, control, and analysis techniques from statistics and machine learning. In particular, we apply rich statistical models of the application’s performance, simulation-based methods for finding an optimal control policy, and change-point methods to find abrupt changes in performance. <b>Preliminary</b> results <b>running</b> a Web 2. 0 benchmark application driven by real workload traces on Amazon’s EC 2 cloud show that our method can effectively control the number of servers, {{even in the face of}} performance anomalies. ...|$|R
40|$|Placement is an {{important}} step in the overall IC design process in DSM technologies, as it defines the on-chip interconnects, which are the bottleneck in determining circuit performance. The "quadratic placement" methodology is reputedly used in many commercial and in-house tools for placement of standard-cell and gate-array designs. Numerous quadratic placement algorithms have been developed and tested over time. Currently, these methods are capable of placing a few million modules, but are unable to scale beyond that. The legalization step, required of all algorithms, is the step that is expensive to perform and has limited scalability. We have extended and improved an algorithm specifically targeting these extremely large placement problems. Our approach is fundamentally different than existing tools in that we move the placement area as opposed to moving the modules, thereby formulating a problem that is mainly dependent on the placement area, instead of the net list size. As a result, our algorithm is essentially a low dimensional optimization problem that is inherently parallel. <b>Preliminary</b> tests <b>running</b> on big benchmarks show that our algorith...|$|R

40|$|In {{practical}} applications of supervised statistical learning {{the separation of}} the training and test data is often violated through performing one or several analysis steps prior to estimating the prediction error by cross-validation (CV) procedures. We refer to such practices as incomplete CV. For the special case of preliminary variable selection in high-dimensional microarray data the corresponding error estimate is well known to be strongly downwardly biased, resulting in over-optimistic conclusions regarding prediction accuracy of the fitted models. However, while other data preparation steps may also be affected by these types of problems, their impact on error estimation is far less acknowledged in the literature. In this paper we shed light on these issues. We present a new measure quantifying the impact of incomplete CV that is based on the ratio between the errors estimated by incomplete CV and by a formally correct "full CV. " The new measure is illustrated through applications to several low- and high-dimensional biomedical data sets and various data preparation steps including preliminary variable selection, choice of tuning parameters, normalization of gene expression microarray data, and imputation of missing values.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a parallel approximation of an Over-determined Laplacian Partial Differential Equation solver (ODETLAP) {{applied to the}} compression and restoration of terrain data used for Geographical Information Systems (GIS). ODET-LAP {{can be used to}} reconstruct a compressed elevation map, or to generate a dense regular grid from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) point cloud data. With previous methods, the time to execute ODETLAP does not scale well with the size of the input elevation map, resulting in running times that are prohibitively long for large data sets. Our algorithm divides the data set into patches, runs ODET-LAP on each patch, and then merges the patches together. This method gives two distinct speed improvements. First, we provide scalability by reducing the complexity such that the execution time grows almost linearly with the size of the input, even when run on a single processor. Second, we are able to calculate ODETLAP on the patches concurrently in a parallel or distributed environment. Our new patchbased implementation takes 2 seconds to run ODETLAP on an 800 × 800 elevation map using 128 processors, while the original version of ODETLAP takes nearly 10 minutes on a single processor (271 times longer). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm by running it on data sets as large as 16000 × 16000 on a cluster of computers.

MTC {{emphasizes}} running many computational tasks over a short period of time, where tasks can be either dependent or independent of one another. MTC has been well supported on Clouds, Grids, and Supercomputers on traditional computing architectures, but the abundance of hybrid large-scale systems using accelerators has motivated us to explore the support of MTC on the new Intel Xeon Phi accelerators. The Xeon Phi is a PCI-Express based expansion card comprised of 60 cores supporting 240 hardware threads to produce up to 1 teraflop of double- precision performance in a single accelerator. These cards are already being integrated into super-computing clusters such as Stampede, which hosts over 6, 400 Xeon Phi Accelerators totaling in over 7 petaflops of double- precision performance. This work provides an in depth understanding of MTC on the Intel Xeon Phi and presents our <b>preliminary</b> results of <b>running</b> several different workloads on pre-production Intel Xeon Phi hardware.

40|$|Apparel {{industry}} executives {{continue to move}} manufacturing offshore {{in their efforts to}} lower costs. Offshore manufacturing is characterized by long lead times and a significant, up-front, cash investment. On the other hand, corporate headquarters are pressuring subsidiaries to reduce inventories, while retail stores are demanding instant response to their orders (aided by such modern tools as Electronic Data Interchange). Thus, there is a conflict between low cost, offshore manufacturing and the desire to create an agile, responsive corporation. Another victim of the export of manufacturing is product development expertise [...] the intellectual step that converts a designer's prototype into a quality garment that can be sewn efficiently. Without this expertise, markets cannot be developed for new, innovative textiles. We see, therefore, that all of these losses in the apparel industry are severely detrimental to the continued viability of the textile industry in the U. S. The goal of this project is to develop formal business models of apparel products and demonstrate that cooperation and sharing of data between buyers, designers, onshore, and offshore producers can be cost efficient and beneficial for everyone. Manufacturers desire the cost advantages of offshore production. However, capabilities such as such as quick response replenishment are extremely valuable to buyers who are, unfortunately, seldom willing to pay extra for them. Our goal is to demonstrate to both manufacturers and buyers that there are scenarios in which supporting a domestic manufacturer is cost effective.

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate and develop methods of collecting temporal gait data using accelerometry, in recreational distance runners. Furthermore, we wished to apply these methods to investigate SR, as a coaching orientated parameter, and ST variability, as a research orientated parameter. Methods development was undertaken in which accelerometry self-attachment protocols and technical and processing issues which may affect ST calculation in accelerometry data were investigated. A novel method of ST calculation, utilising 2 Hz filtering, was developed which indicated good comparability to previous methods (ICCs > 0. 95 and CV values 0. 05), and small (ES = 0. 35) and medium (ES = 0. 46) effect sizes, were identified between recreational runner’s half marathon and full marathon DFA α values and SR, indicating that recreational runners adopt similar stride parameters when undertaking half and full marathon events, despite extended training periods. This information enhanced our knowledge of DFA during distance running, however due to extended processing times more efficient methods of utilising DFA were required. Therefore, a running analysis system was developed resulting in the output of reoccurring, real-time DFA α values during prolonged <b>running.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> investigation indicated output of DFA α values within 10 s of predetermined running time periods, enabling researchers to give real-time DFA feedback, during a prolonged run.

40|$|Poulakakis, IoannisA {{series of}} quadrupedal robots with {{different}} morphologies {{has been developed}} in the past forty years to explore the enhanced mobility such platforms may offer. The majority of these robots incorporate rigid, non-deformable torsos, a feature that distinguishes them from {{their counterparts in the}} animal world, which owe much of their remarkable locomotion abilities to their flexible bodies. Biological research indicates that torso flexibility may contribute to increased running speed, reduced energy cost and improved gait stability. This thesis proposes a modeling hierarchy that incorporates biological observations within a series of models with increasing complexity, and develops systematic feedback control algorithms for highly dynamic quadrupedal running motions that harness torso flexibility and compliant legs. On a macroscopic level, reduced-order models, or “templates”, can capture the dominant features of an observed locomotion behavior without delving into the fine details of a robot’s (or animal’s) structure and morphology. Templates provide unified, platform-independent descriptions of the desired locomotion task, and they have proved to be indispensable in designing legged robots and in synthesizing controllers for stabilizing highly-agile locomotion behaviors. One representative example is the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), which, despite its very simple structure, captures the evolution of kinetic and potential energy associated with running motions, and has informed controller design of many legged robots. However, because of its simple lumped point-mass structure, the SLIP and its immediate extensions cannot describe some of the common quadrupedal gaits that involve pronounced torso oscillations, such as bounding and galloping. Motivated by the capability as well as the limitations of SLIP-type templates, a number of reduced-order quadrupedal models that incorporate non-point-mass torsos has been proposed in the relevant literature to investigate quadrupedal running. However, partly because of the need to describe the torso morphology of the corresponding hardware platforms, and partly because of the need to simplify running dynamics, most of these quadrupedal templates only consider non-deformable, rigid torsos. Although, a few studies with <b>preliminary</b> results on <b>running</b> with torso compliance {{can be found in the}} relevant literature, studies on the conditions for generating periodic locomotion behaviors are rather limited while the stability properties of these motions are not carefully examined. As a result, feedback controller design in the presence of torso compliance has not been carefully investigated. Beyond stability and control design, the energetic cost of transport of quadrupedal running and, in particular, the contribution of torso flexibility to running efficiency, has not received adequate attention. This thesis aims at proposing a modeling and control hierarchy that enables the systematic evaluation of the role of torso compliance in quadrupedal running. The proposed templates have different modeling complexities and actuation schemes, and can be used to facilitate the investigation of a number of key issues in quadrupedal running, such as motion generation, gait stability, feedback design, gait transitions and energy efficiency. Through careful analysis of the models, a series of useful conclusions can be drawn; these conclusions pave the way toward synthesizing feedback control laws for legged robots with torso and leg compliance, and provide insight into designing robotic platforms that harness elastic elements to realize high-performance, reliable and natural-like quadrupedal running motions.
