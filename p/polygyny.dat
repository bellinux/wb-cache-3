5|$|The oribi is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though some {{activity}} {{may also be}} observed at night. The animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat – polyandry, <b>polygyny</b> and polygynandry; <b>polygyny</b> tends to prevail as the female-to-male ratio increases. A study suggested that <b>polygyny</b> is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti-predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common.|$|E
5|$|Although a large {{majority}} of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select Bombus species (such as Bombus atratus) will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of <b>polygyny).</b>|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} <b>polygyny,</b> polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur. Polygamous breeding systems {{arise when}} females {{are able to}} raise broods {{without the help of}} males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. <b>Polygyny,</b> where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. <b>Polygyny</b> may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E
5|$|While breathing, {{they hold}} just their {{nostrils}} above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so. Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, {{but have been}} known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish. Males typically mate with more than one female (<b>polygyny),</b> and may participate in lek mating. Sirenians are K-selectors, and display parental care.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pinnipeds}} are widespread, {{most species}} prefer the colder {{waters of the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They {{spend most of their}} lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; but a few, like the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (<b>polygyny),</b> although the degree of <b>polygyny</b> varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice- or water-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to <b>polygyny,</b> to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} issues are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include <b>polygyny,</b> divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, <b>polygyny</b> and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of <b>polygyny</b> and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are {{perfectly}} monogamous, {{meaning that they}} mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate’s death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (<b>polygyny),</b> multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs in harems, wherein {{one or a few}} males protect their harem of females from other males who would otherwise mate with the females, as in elephant seals; or males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of <b>polygyny,</b> promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence <b>polygyny</b> tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition <b>polygyny,</b> where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|The size {{difference}} between sexes {{has led to}} the suggestion that the Rodrigues solitaire was not monogamous as stated by Leguat, and that this deeply religious man attributed the trait to the bird for moral reasons. It has been proposed that it was instead polygynous, and the wing-rattling behaviour described for males suggests lek-mating, where males gather for competitive mating display. However, size dimorphism does occur in some monogamous birds; most other pigeons are monogamous as well. A 2015 article proposed that males invited females into their territories as secondary mates, which would result in the resident female acting aggressively towards the newcomer. Similar behaviour is seen in species that practice resource-defence <b>polygyny.</b> The territories probably provided all the food the birds needed in adittion to acting as breeding-areas, and there was probably intense competition for favourable territories. The fact that Rodrigues island shrank by 90% {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene may also have contributed to such competition over territories, and thereby furthered sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting <b>polygyny.</b> In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with <b>polygyny,</b> although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme <b>polygyny</b> to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E
25|$|Turkey was {{the first}} Muslim country to legally ban <b>polygyny</b> in 1926. This {{decision}} was not based on religious reasons, but rather was an entirely secular ban. Tunisia was the next country to ban <b>polygyny</b> through legislation passed in 1956 and restated in 1964. Unlike Turkey, Tunisia banned <b>polygyny</b> on religious grounds, citing two main reasons. First, the Quran limited the practice of <b>polygyny,</b> thus it {{did not support the}} practice and clearly intended for the practice to be eliminated over time. Second, the Quran demands equal treatment of all wives in a polygynous marriage, which is impossible, thus making the practice illegal. Finally, Israel banned <b>polygyny</b> as well by 1978.|$|E
25|$|Although non-Muslim Russian {{populations have}} {{historically}} practiced monogamy, Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky offered to legalize <b>polygyny</b> to encourage {{population growth and}} correct the demographic crisis of Russians. Zhirinovsky first proposed to legalize <b>polygyny</b> in 1993, after Kadyrov's declaration that he would introduce an amendment to legalize <b>polygyny</b> for all Russian citizens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polygyny</b> for Muslims, in {{practice}} and in law, differs greatly throughout the Islamic world. In some Muslim countries, <b>polygyny</b> is relatively common, while in others, it is rare or non-existent. Azerbaijan, Tunisia and Turkey, for example, are predominantly Muslim countries that have not adopted Islamic law for marital regulations, where <b>polygyny</b> is not legal.|$|E
25|$|Two genetic {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed to explain <b>polygyny</b> in Hawaiian colonies. Hamilton’s kin selection theory provides {{an explanation for the}} divergence between <b>polygyny</b> and monogyny. Generally, monogyny should prevail unless polygynous benefits outweigh the costs of shared reproduction. If females are unrelated, the costs would usually outweigh the benefits, and monogyny would result. Using kin selection theory, two possible explanations exist as to why <b>polygyny</b> arises. First, daughter queens remaining in the natal nest possibly create kin associations that provide a mechanism allowing the benefits of <b>polygyny</b> to outweigh the costs. Another genetic mechanism explaining why <b>polygyny</b> arises is due to the bottleneck effect. Because a small number of founders gave rise to the population of V. pensylvanica in Hawaii, the entire population in Hawaii thus has an average degree of relatedness higher than presumed among the North American population. In both cases, genetic relatedness and kin selection could explain why <b>polygyny</b> has emerged in non-native regions.|$|E
25|$|Polygamy in India is, in general, {{prohibited}} and {{the vast}} majority of marriages are legally monogamous. <b>Polygyny</b> among Christians was banned in the late 19th century, while The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 banned <b>polygyny</b> for Hindus. Currently <b>polygyny</b> is only allowed among Muslims, but it is strongly discouraged by public policy. Muslims are subject to the terms of The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937, interpreted by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. Prevalence of <b>polygyny</b> in India is very low: among married women, only 1.68% of Hindus, 2.45% of Muslims, 2.16% of Christians, and 1.16% of other religions live in polygynous marriages.|$|E
25|$|Today, <b>polygyny</b> is more {{widespread}} in Africa {{than in any}} other continent. Some scholars see the slave trade's impact on the male-to-female sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa. Generally in rural areas with growing populations, the higher the incidence of <b>polygyny,</b> the greater the delay of first marriage for young men. The higher the average <b>polygyny</b> rate, the greater the element of gerontocracy and social stratification.|$|E
25|$|Though {{colonies of}} V. pensylvanica are {{generally}} monogynous and annual, <b>polygyny</b> and overwintering {{has been observed}} in non-native regions, specifically in Hawaii. The relaxation of the climate and climate-related constraints {{are believed to have}} contributed to the emergence of <b>polygyny,</b> and <b>polygyny</b> is a prerequisite for successful overwintering. Generally, climate is a constraining factor in the reproductive behavior of V. pensylvanica. When temperatures drop, food availability decreases and colony decline occurs. In Hawaii, however, this does not occur.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the African <b>polygyny</b> belt {{stretching}} from Senegal {{in the west}} to Tanzania in the east, as many as a third to a half of married women are in polygynous unions, and <b>polygyny</b> is found especially in West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Some {{analysts have}} posited {{that a high}} libido may {{be a factor in}} <b>polygyny,</b> {{although}} others have downplayed its significance. The sex drive as a factor in some Asian cultures was sometimes associated with wealthy men and those that were adjunct to an aristocracy, although such libidinal perceptions were at times discarded in favor of seeing <b>polygyny</b> as a factor of traditional life. Other explanations postulate that <b>polygyny</b> is a tool used to ward off inclinations towards infidelity.|$|E
25|$|There is primary <b>polygyny</b> (several queens join {{to found}} a new colony, but after the {{hatching}} of the first workers the queens fight each other until only one queen survives and the colony becomes monogynous) and secondary <b>polygyny</b> (a well-established colony continues to have several queens).|$|E
25|$|Although many {{countries}} have laws restricting or banning <b>polygyny,</b> {{it is still}} practiced illegally. It is difficult to enforce anti-polygyny laws and restrictions in countries with large rural populations. Furthermore, illegal <b>polygyny</b> often occurs in countries with poor social services as women rely on husbands to support them in these situations.|$|E
25|$|Kenya: <b>Polygyny</b> legal under {{legislation}} passed in 2014.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polygyny</b> {{is illegal}} in the United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polygyny</b> is the {{practice}} wherein {{a man has}} more than one wife at the same time. The vast majority of polygamous marriages are polygynous. <b>Polygyny</b> is legally accepted in many Muslim majority countries and some countries with a sizeable Muslim minority; it is also accepted in some secular countries in varying degrees.|$|E
25|$|Several countries, such as Libya, allow <b>polygyny</b> {{with few}} or no restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychologist}} Satoshi Kanazawa {{has argued}} that an important cause of intergroup conflict may be the relative availability of women of reproductive age. He found that <b>polygyny</b> greatly increased the frequency of civil wars but not interstate wars. Gleditsch et al. did not find a relationship between ethnic groups with <b>polygyny</b> and increased frequency of civil wars but nations having legal polygamy may have more civil wars. They argued that misogyny is a better explanation than <b>polygyny.</b> They found that increased women's rights were associated with less civil wars and that legal polygamy had no effect after women’s rights were controlled for.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{that allow}} <b>polygyny</b> {{typically}} also require {{a man to}} obtain permission from his previous wives before marrying another, and require the man {{to prove that he}} can financially support multiple wives. In Malaysia and Morocco, a man must justify taking an additional wife at a court hearing before he is allowed to do so. In Sudan, the government encouraged <b>polygyny</b> in 2001 to increase the population.|$|E
25|$|In Ingushetia in July, 1999 <b>polygyny</b> {{was officially}} {{recognised}} and allowed by edict of president of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev and registration of <b>polygyny</b> marriages had been started. But this edict had been formally suspended soon by edict of President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. One year later this edict of Aushev had been cancelled by the Supreme Court of Ingushetia because of contradiction with Family Code of Russia.|$|E
