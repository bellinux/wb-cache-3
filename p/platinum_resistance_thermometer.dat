50|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors provide {{excellent}} protection of measurement signals against noise corruption. Unfortunately, many conventional sensors produce electrical output {{which must be}} converted into an optical signal for use with fiber. For example, {{in the case of}} a <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer,</b> the temperature changes are translated into resistance changes. The PRT must therefore have an electrical power supply. The modulated voltage level at the output of the PRT can then be injected into the optical fiber via the usual type of transmitter. This complicates the measurement process and means that low-voltage power cables must be routed to the transducer.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the stability of a selection of small industrial <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometers</b> (IPRTs) upon heat treatment and handling. Ninety-four IPRTs, of several models, obtained from five manufacturers were studied. Most of the IPRTs exhibited calibration drifts and also effects due to the presence of moisture or strain. There was no apparent improvement in the stability if the resistance ratio, R(t) /Ro = W(t), instead of resistance were used as the criterion. Comparisons are made of the relative stability of the products of the five companies.

50|$|The Callendar-Van Dusen {{equation}} is an equation {{that describes the}} relationship between resistance (R) and temperature (T) of <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometers</b> (RTD).|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that these equations are listed as the basis for the temperature/resistance tables for idealized <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometers</b> and are not intended to be used for the calibration of an individual thermometer, which would require the experimentally determined parameters to be found.|$|R
50|$|A {{thermometer}} calibrated to a known {{fixed point}} is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. Most thermometers are originally calibrated to a constant-volume gas thermometer. In between fixed calibration points, interpolation is used, usually linear. This may give {{significant differences between}} different types of thermometer at points {{far away from the}} fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer,</b> so these two will disagree slightly at around 50 °C. There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the capillary tube varies in diameter.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{uncertainties}} of the temperature measurement by standard <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer</b> calibrated at the defining fixed points according to ITS- 90 {{is a problem}} that can be solved in different ways. The paper presents a procedure based on the propagation of distributions using the Monte Carlo method. The procedure employs generation of pseudo-random numbers for the input variables of resistances at the defining fixed points, supposing the multivariate Gaussian distribution for input quantities. This allows taking into account the correlations among resistances at the defining fixed points. Assumption of Gaussian probability density function is acceptable, with respect to the several sources {{of uncertainties}} of resistances. In the case of uncorrelated resistances at the defining fixed points, the method is applicable to any probability density function. Validation of the law of propagation of uncertainty using the Monte Carlo method is presented on the example of specific data for 25 Ω standard <b>platinum</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer</b> in the temperature range from 0 to 660 °C.
