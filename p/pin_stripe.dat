5|$|A notable {{atmospheric}} {{release of}} radioactive gas followed the Soviet Chagan test of 15 January 1965 in present-day Kazakhstan. Roughly 20% of the radioactive debris {{produced by the}} 140-kiloton detonation was released into the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan. The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent action was taken. On 25 April 1966, the <b>Pin</b> <b>Stripe</b> underground test in Nevada (part of Operation Flintlock) experienced a venting malfunction and produced a radioactive plume headed towards the Midwestern US; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.|$|E
25|$|Because {{wearing a}} suit conveys a respectable image, many people wear suits during the job {{interview}} process. An interview suit is usually a conservative style, and often made of blue or grey fabric. Interview suits are frequently composed of wool or wool-blend fabric, with a solid or <b>pin</b> <b>stripe</b> pattern. The style of an interview suit, however, {{will depend on the}} organizational culture of the industry in which a person seeks employment.|$|E
25|$|The Talladega {{came only}} in the SportsRoof body style and in three colours: Wimbledon White, Royal Maroon, and Presidential blue. All had a flat black hood and a unique {{beltline}} <b>pin</b> <b>stripe.</b> The Talladega came standard with a 428 CJ (non-Ram Air), C-6 Cruise-O-Matic, staggered rear shocks (normally reserved for 4-speed cars) and 3.25:1 open differential. Talladegas were equipped with a cloth and vinyl bench seat, and interestingly enough used the Fairlane 500 body code like the 1969 Cobra. These cars could not be ordered with additional options, and only 743 Talladega's were produced.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a {{significant}} figure {{in the emergence of}} Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color Field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His Black <b>Pin</b> <b>Stripe</b> paintings of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.|$|E

50|$|Pin {{striping}} (pinstriping) is {{the application}} of a very thin line of paint or other material called a <b>pin</b> <b>stripe,</b> and is generally used for decoration.

Finally we introduce a 2 [...] dimensional mean field theory which for small strength of the <b>pinning</b> <b>stripes</b> and for small capillary length gives an excellent description of the averaged height of the contact line.
