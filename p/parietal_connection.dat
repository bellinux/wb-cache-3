40|$|A frontoparietal {{network of}} brain regions is often implicated in both {{auditory}} and visual information processing. Although {{it is possible}} that the same set of multimodal regions subserves both modalities, there is increasing evidence that there is a differentiation of sensory function within frontoparietal cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans was used to investigate whether different frontoparietal regions showed intrinsic biases in connectivity with visual or auditory modalities. Structural connectivity was assessed with diffusion tractography and functional connectivity was tested using functional MRI. A dorsal–ventral gradient of function was observed, where connectivity with visual cortex dominates dorsal frontal and <b>parietal</b> <b>connections,</b> while connectivity with auditory cortex dominates ventral frontal and parietal regions. A gradient was also observed along the posterior–anterior axis, although in opposite directions in prefrontal and parietal cortices. The results suggest that the location of neural activity within frontoparietal cortex may be influenced by these intrinsic biases toward visual and auditory processing. Thus, the location of activity in frontoparietal cortex may be influenced as much by stimulus modality as the cognitive demands of a task. It was concluded that stimulus modality was spatially encoded throughout frontal and parietal cortices, and was speculated that such an arrangement allows for top–down modulation of modality-specific information to occur within higher-order cortex. This could provide a potentially faster and more efficient pathway by which top–down selection between sensory modalities could occur, by constraining modulations to within frontal and parietal regions, rather than long-range connections to sensory cortices...|$|R
40|$|Anti-retroviral therapies {{have become}} widely available, {{and as a}} result, {{individuals}} infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer, and becoming integrated into the geriatric population. Around half of the HIV+ population show some degree of cognitive impairment, but it is unknown how their neural networks and brain connectivity compare to those of non-infected people. Here we combined magnetic resonance imaging based cortical parcellations with high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging (HARDI) tractography in 55 HIV-seropositive patients and 30 age-matched controls, to map white matter connections between cortical regions. We set out to determine selective virus-associated disruptions in the brain's structural network. All individuals {{in this study were}} aged 60 - 80, with full access to antiretroviral therapy. Frontal and motor connections were compromised in HIV+ individuals. HIV+ people who carried the ApoE 4 genotype - which puts them at even greater risk for neurodegeneration - showed additional network structure deficits in temporal and <b>parietal</b> <b>connections.</b> The ApoE 4 genotype interacted with duration of illness. Carriers showed greater brain network inefficiencies, the longer they were infected. Neural network deficiencies in HIV+ populations exceed those typical of normal aging, and are worse in those genetically predisposed to brain degeneration. This work isolates neuropathological alterations in HIV+ elders, even when treated with anti-retroviral therapy. Network impairments may contribute to the neuropsychological abnormalities in elderly HIV patients, who will soon account for around half of all HIV+ adults...|$|R
40|$|Failures in {{cortical}} {{control of}} fronto-striatal neural circuits may underpin impulsive and compulsive acts. In this narrative review, we explore these behaviors {{from the perspective}} of neural processes and consider how these behaviors and neural processes contribute to mental disorders such as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and impulse-control disorders such as trichotillomania and pathological gambling. We present findings from a broad range of data, comprising translational and human endophenotypes research and clinical treatment trials, focussing on the parallel, functionally segregated, cortico-striatal neural projections, from orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to medial striatum (caudate nucleus), proposed to drive compulsive activity, and from the anterior cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal cortex to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens shell), proposed to drive impulsive activity, and the interaction between them. We suggest that impulsivity and compulsivity each seem to be multidimensional. Impulsive or compulsive behaviors are mediated by overlapping as well as distinct neural substrates. Trichotillomania may stand apart as a disorder of motor-impulse control, whereas pathological gambling involves abnormal ventral reward circuitry that identifies it more closely with substance addiction. OCD shows motor impulsivity and compulsivity, probably mediated through disruption of OFC-caudate circuitry, as well as other frontal, cingulate, and <b>parietal</b> <b>connections.</b> Serotonin and dopamine interact across these circuits to modulate aspects of both impulsive and compulsive responding and as yet unidentified brain-based systems may also have important functions. Targeted application of neurocognitive tasks, receptor-specific neurochemical probes, and brain systems neuroimaging techniques have potential for future research in this field...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{studies have}} implicated frontostriatal {{dysfunction}} in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and described cognitive deficits {{with a focus on}} executive function and memory. Remarkably little is known about visuospatial and number processing in HIV, though these capacities are also supported by frontostriatal circuits and their <b>parietal</b> <b>connections.</b> We investigated the relation of numerical and spatial cognition in asymptomatic individuals with HIV and explored physical and mental number orientation using several modes of presentation and response: mental number line bisection, physical line bisection, and physical number line orientation on visually-presented horizontal and vertical number lines. The asymptomatic HIV+ group was significantly slower and produced more errors on visuospatial and number processing tasks than the HIV− group (n = 37 /group). Both groups showed significant correlations between number processing and visuospatial performance. These findings demonstrate that HIV-related brain damage early in the disease course can alter the spatial representation of numerical distance, providing evidence for disruption of frontostriatal circuits and their parietal projections underlying numerical processing in HIV. Besides disease-related effects, this study demonstrates that the physical number line preserves its numerical and spatial integrity in both the vertical and horizontal physical dimensions, as all participants exhibited underestimation of numerical distance, i. e. leftward bias (for horizontal presentation) and downward bias (for vertical). Our results also revealed a dissociation between the processing components of numerical distance and physical space, suggesting differentiation between the neural networks involved in number lines and physical line orientation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Rolandic {{epilepsy}} (RE) manifests {{during a}} critical phase of brain development, {{and has been}} associated with language impairments. Concordant abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity (SC and FC) have been described before. As SC and FC are under mutual influence, the current study investigates abnormalities in the SC-FC synergy in RE. Methods Twenty-two children with RE (age, mean±SD: 11. 3 ± 2. 0 y) and 22 healthy controls (age 10. 5 ± 1. 6 y) underwent structural, diffusion weighted, and functional MRI at 3 T. The probabilistic anatomical landmarks atlas was used to parcellate the (sub) cortical gray matter. Constrained spherical deconvolution tractography and correlation of time series were used to assess SC and FC, respectively. The SC-FC correlation was assessed as a function of age for the non-zero structural connections over a range of sparsity values (0. 01 - 0. 75). A modularity analysis was performed on the mean SC network of the controls to localize potential global effects to subnetworks. SC and FC were also assessed separately using graph analysis. Results The SC-FC correlation was significantly reduced in children with RE compared to healthy controls, especially for the youngest participants. This effect was most pronounced in a left and a right centro-temporal network, as well as in a medial parietal network. Graph analysis revealed no prominent abnormalities in SC or FC network organization. Conclusion Since SC and FC converge during normal maturation, our finding of reduced SC-FC correlation illustrates impaired synergy between brain structure and function. More specifically, since this effect was most pronounced in the youngest participants, RE may represent a developmental disorder of delayed brain network maturation. The observed effects seem especially attributable to medial <b>parietal</b> <b>connections,</b> which forms an intermediate between bilateral centro-temporal modules of epileptiform activity, and bear relevance for language function...|$|R
40|$|The {{parietal lobe}} {{has a unique}} place in the human brain. Anatomically, {{it is at the}} {{crossroad}} between the frontal, occipital, and temporal lobes, thus providing a middle ground for multimodal sensory integration. Functionally, it supports higher cognitive functions that are characteristic of the human species, such as mathematical cognition, semantic and pragmatic aspects of language, and abstract thinking. Despite its importance, a comprehensive comparison of human and simian intraparietal networks is missing. In this study, we used diffusion imaging tractography to reconstruct the major intralobar parietal tracts in twenty-one datasets acquired inandnbsp;vivo from healthy human subjects and eleven exandnbsp;vivo datasets from five vervet and six macaque monkeys. Three regions of interest (post-central gyrus, superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule) were used to identify the tracts. Surface projections were reconstructed for both species and results compared to identify similarities or differences in tract anatomy (i. e., trajectories and cortical projections). In addition, post-mortem dissections were performed in a human brain. The largest tract identified in both human and monkey brains is a vertical pathway between the superior and inferior parietal lobules. This tract can be divided into an anterior (supramarginal gyrus) and a posterior (angular gyrus) component in both humans and monkey brains. The second prominent intraparietal tract connects the post-central gyrus to both supramarginal and angular gyri of the inferior parietal lobe in humans but only to the supramarginal gyrus in the monkey brain. The third tract connects the post-central gyrus to the anterior region of the superior parietal lobule and is more prominent in monkeys compared to humans. Finally, short U-shaped fibres in medial and lateral aspects of the parietal lobe were identified in both species. A tract connecting the medial parietal cortex to the lateral inferior parietal cortex was observed in the monkey brain only. Our findings suggest a consistent pattern of intralobar <b>parietal</b> <b>connections</b> between humans and monkeys with some differences for those areas that have cytoarchitectonically distinct features in humans. The overall pattern of intraparietal connectivity supports the special role of the inferior parietal lobule in cognitive functions characteristic of humans. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{episode of}} {{complete}} failure to respond during an attentive task accompanied by behavioural signs of sleep {{is called a}} behavioural microsleep. We proposed a combination of high-resolution EEG and an advanced method for time-varying effective connectivity estimation for reconstructing the temporal evolution of the causal relations between cortical regions when microsleeps occur during a continuous visuomotor task. We found connectivity patterns involving left-right frontal, left-right <b>parietal,</b> and left-frontal/right-parietal <b>connections</b> commencing in the interval [- 500; - 250] ms prior to the onset of microsleeps and disappearing {{at the end of}} the microsleeps. Our results from global graph indices derived from effective connectivity analysis have revealed EEG-based biomarkers of all stages of microsleeps (preceding, onset, pre-recovery, recovery). In particular, this raises the possibility of being able to predict microsleeps in real-world tasks and initiate a 'wake-up' intervention to avert the microsleeps and, hence, prevent injurious and even multi-fatality accidents...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRight {{hemisphere}} dominance for visuo-spatial {{attention is}} characteristically observed in most right-handed individuals. This dominance has {{been attributed to}} both an anatomically larger right fronto-parietal network and the existence of asymmetric <b>parietal</b> interhemispheric <b>connections.</b> Previously it has been demonstrated that interhemispheric conflict, which induces left hemisphere inhibition, results in the modulation of both (i) the excitability of the early visual cortex (V 1) and (ii) the brainstem-mediated vestibular–ocular reflex (VOR) via top-down control mechanisms. However to date, it remains unknown whether the degree of an individual’s right hemisphere dominance for visuospatial function can influence, (i) the baseline excitability of the visual cortex and (ii) {{the extent to which the}} right hemisphere can exert top-down modulation. We directly tested this by correlating line bisection error (or pseudoneglect), taken as a measure of right hemisphere dominance, with both (i) visual cortical excitability measured using phosphene perception elicited via single-pulse occipital trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and (ii) the degree of trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) -mediated VOR suppression, following left hemisphere inhibition. We found that those individuals with greater right hemisphere dominance had a less excitable early visual cortex at baseline and demonstrated a greater degree of vestibular nystagmus suppression following left hemisphere cathodal tDCS. To conclude, our results provide the first demonstration that individual differences in right hemisphere dominance can directly predict both the baseline excitability of low-level brain structures and the degree of top-down modulation exerted over them...|$|R
40|$|The {{parietal cortex}} has {{traditionally}} been implicated in spatial attention and eye-movement processes.

In this study, we examined whether the human lateral and medial parietal lobes have differential anatomical and functional connectivity with the temporal lobe. To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to constrain the analysis of anatomical connectivity obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both DTI tractography and functional connectivity analysis showed that the lateral parietal region has anatomical and functional connections with the lateral temporal lobe, and the medial <b>parietal</b> region has <b>connections</b> with the medial temporal lobe.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{behavioural}} and neuroimaging {{studies have reported}} converging data in favour of a cortical network for vestibular function, distributed between the temporo-parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex in the primate. In this review, {{we focus on the}} role of the cerebral cortex in visuo-vestibular integration including the motion sensitive temporo-occipital areas i. e. the middle superior temporal area (MST) and the parietal cortex. Indeed these two neighbouring cortical regions, though they both receive combined vestibular and visual information, have distinct implications in vestibular function. In sum, this review of the literature leads to the idea of two separate cortical vestibular sub-systems forming (1) a velocity pathway including MST and direct descending pathways on vestibular nuclei. As it receives well defined visual and vestibular velocity signals, this pathway is likely involved in heading perception and rapid top-down regulation of eye/head coordination and (2) an inertial processing pathway involving the <b>parietal</b> cortex in <b>connection</b> with the subcortical vestibular nuclei complex responsible for velocity storage integration. This vestibular cortical pathway would be implicated in high order multimodal integration and cognitive functions, including world space and self- referential processing...|$|R

The cortex of the most rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule is preferentially linked with the ventral premotor cortex (ventral area 6) that controls the orofacial musculature. The cortex of the intermediate part of the inferior parietal lobule is linked with both areas 44 and 45. These findings demonstrate the posterior <b>parietal</b> and temporal <b>connections</b> of the ventrolateral frontal areas, which, in the left hemisphere of the human brain, were adapted for various aspects of language production. These precursor circuits that are found in the nonlinguistic, nonhuman, primate brain also exist in the human brain. The possible reasons why these areas were adapted for language use in the human brain are discussed. The results throw new light on the prelinguistic precursor circuitry of Broca's region and help understand functional interactions between Broca's ventrolateral frontal region and posterior parietal and temporal association areas. Author SummaryTwo distinct cortical areas in the frontal lobe of the human brain, known as Broca's region, are involved with language production. This region has also been shown to exist in nonhuman primates. In this study, we explored the precise neural connectivity of Broca's region in macaque monkeys using the autoradiographic method to achieve a level of detail impossible in the human brain. We identified two major streams of connections feeding into Broca's area: a ventral stream from the temporal region, which includes areas processing auditory, multisensory, and visual information and a dorsal stream originating from the inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent superior temporal sulcus. Our detailed connectivity analysis illuminates the pathways via which posterior cortical areas can interact functionally with Broca's region, in addition to contributing {{to an understanding of the}} evolution of language. We suggest that a fundamental function of Broca's region is to retrieve information in a controlled strategic way from posterior cortical regions and to translate this information into action. This fundamental function was adapted during evolution of the left hemisphere of the human brain to serve language. Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP- 14620...|$|R
40|$|El ñandú (Rhea americana) es un ave corredora autóctona de Sudamérica la cual hace ya algunos años ha despertado cierto interés productivo. Sin embargo, la morfología detallada a nivel de las aves domésticas aún se desconoce en muchos aspectos; entre ellos el peritoneo. El objetivo de este trabajo es describir el peritoneo parietal, visceral y de conexión del ñandú acorde con los principios de la Nómina Anatómica Aviar. Se utilizaron 7 animales adultos; 5 machos y 2 hembras de entre 8 y 25 kg. de peso procedentes de un criadero comercial. Fueron eutanasiados por sobredosis de tiopental sódico. La cavidad peritoneal estaba dividida en una parte craneal (equivalente a 1 / 3) y una parte caudal al estómago (equivalente a 2 / 3 del total del abdomen). En la parte caudal se encontraba la totalidad del intestino y el páncreas, mientras que en la parte craneal se observó el hígado y la vesícula biliar. Un omento menor fijaba el estómago al hígado cranealmente hacia la derecha y un omento mayor pequeño con una bolsa omental cerrada lo fijaba caudalmente hacia la izquierda. La raíz del mesenterio fijaba al yeyuno, al íleon y a ambos ciegos entre sus hojas a través de amplios pliegues ileocecales. Desde la raíz del mesenterio un corto mesoduodeno sujetaba al duodeno descendente y ascendente hacia la derecha. El colon estaba sostenido por un amplio {{mesocolon}} desde distal a la desembocadura de los ciegos hasta su terminación en la cloaca. Se concluye que esta especie corredora presenta similitudes con las aves domésticas. Sin embargo, lo relativamente grueso y fuerte del peritoneo de conexión sumado a lo compartimentado de la cavidad peritoneal hacen suponer que se trata de una adaptación para la carrera al permitir una gran sujeción de las vísceras abdominales. The rhea (Rhea americana) is {{a native}} ratite from South America which has woken up since {{a few years ago}} a big productive interest. However the detailed morphology of the rhea at the level at the domestic birds is still unknown in many aspects, on of them is the peritoneum. The aim of this work is to describe the <b>parietal,</b> visceral and <b>connection</b> peritoneum of the rhea according to the anatomical avian nomenclature. Seven specimens of adult rhea were used, five males and two females about 8 and 25 kg of weight. All of them proceeding from a commercial farm. The animals were slaughtered before their study. The peritoneum that cover the abdominal wall and the visceral and connection peritoneum that support the abdominal viscera were observed and described. The peritoneal cavity were divided into two parts, one was craneal to the ventriculum (1 / 3 parts from the total of the abdomen) and the other was caudal (2 / 3). Into the cranial part we founded the liver and the gallbladder while into the caudal part we founded the intestine and the pancreas. The stomach was fixed to the liver cranially to the right by a minor omentus and caudally to the left was fixed by a small major omentus with a close omental bag. The root of the mesentery was fixing the yeyuno, ileum and both caecums between its sheets towards wide ileocecalis creases. From the mesentery root a short mesoduodenum was holding the descending and ascending duodenum towards the right. The colon was supported by a wide mesocolon. We concluded that this ratite has similarities with the domestic birds. Nevertheless, the thickness and strong connection peritoneum and the compartmentalization of the peritoneal cavity make us suppose that it is an adaption to the race since it is a big subjection to the abdominal viscera...|$|R
