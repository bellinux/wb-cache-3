5000|$|The {{properties}} of raw shale oil {{vary depending on}} the composition of the parent oil shale and the extraction technology used. [...] Like conventional oil, shale oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, and it is characterized using bulk {{properties of}} the oil. Shale oil usually contains large quantities of olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Shale oil can also contain significant quantities of heteroatoms. A typical shale oil composition includes 0.5-1% of oxygen, 1.5-2% of nitrogen and 0.15-1% of sulfur, and some deposits contain more heteroatoms. Mineral particles and metals are often present as well.

Guar, specifically, is a gelling agent used for the aqueous portion of the water gel explosives. The primary component of water gels is monomethylamine nitrate. Monomethylamine nitrate is made from monomethyl amine (MMA) and nitric acid. Water gel explosives are also made of ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, aluminum, ethylene glycol and TNT.

50|$|Labdanum is {{produced}} today mainly for the perfume industry. The raw resin is usually extracted by boiling {{the leaves and}} twigs. An absolute is also obtained by solvent extraction. An essential oil {{is produced}} by steam distillation. The raw gum is a black or sometimes dark brown, fragrant mass containing up to 20% or more of water. It is plastic but not <b>pourable,</b> and becomes brittle with age. The absolute is dark amber-green and very thick at room temperature. The fragrance is more refined than the raw resin. The odour is very rich, complex and tenacious. Labdanum is much valued in perfumery because of its resemblance to ambergris, which has been banned from use in many countries because it originates from the sperm whale, which is an endangered species. Labdanum is the main ingredient used when making the scent of amber in perfumery. Labdanum's odour is variously described as amber, animalic, sweet, woody, ambergris, dry musk, or leathery.|$|E

The gas flow (3) is directed {{in such a way that}} its effect is partially against the force of gravity. The ultraviolet energy exhibits a wavelength of less than or equal to 230 nm. The source is arranged within the chamber or is integrated in a chamber wall. The gas is a protective gas, an inert gas, air or a reaction product of undesirable chemical reactions such as carbon dioxide. The gas is sterilizable or germ reducible by a mechanism before entering into the chamber, and is heatable by another mechanism. The chamber comprises a reflector (7) formed as electron target for reflecting the energies. The plant products are processed in continuous- and batch processes by members.

Modifications to needle-like crystalline PETN explosive powders to make them <b>pourable</b> were introduced by the application of about 80 A thick polymeric coatings to the individual crystals, followed by a controlled agglomeration into a spherical prill. Microencapsulation techniques provided the key to achieving the result using less than 0. 5 wt. % coating (an order of magnitude less coating than in usual PBX systems).
