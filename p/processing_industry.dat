Direct visit to 63 the fruit <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> and discussion with key persons were implemented to reach deep information. Most fruit <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> used more than one raw material supplier to reach more alternatives and more guarantees to procure large quantity of raw material. Most of big industries used contract system in raw material procurement to reduce risk because of large amount of raw material requirement for large number of production. Continuity and resource of raw material were identified as very strong and strong factors in raw material procurement of fruit <b>processing</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the effect of <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> on reducing agricultural products’ wastes.   A causal- comparative research method was used for this purpose.   According to experts’ opinions, two villages (with & without <b>processing</b> <b>industries)</b> were selected.   Sample size was determined as 330 ones using Krejcie and Morgan table and stratified sampling with proportional allocation.   A research-made questionnaire was used to collect datawhich itsvalidity was confirmed by experts’ view and its reliability measured by calculating Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The result of the research showed that agricultural products’ wastes in village with <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> are less than it in village without <b>processing</b> <b>industries.</b>   Other results showed that post-harvest wastes have reduced two percent because of <b>processing</b> <b>industries.</b>   Furthermore, storing and preserving wastes have reduced 6. 67 percent due to <b>processing</b> <b>industries.</b>   Moreover, agricultural food processing wastes have diminished 11. 67 percent.   Finally, these industries cut down 23 percent of transiting and distributing agricultural wastes.   According to the results of this study, the most effect of <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> on reducing agricultural products’ wastes was in transiting and distributing stage and the least effect was in post-harvest stage...|$|R

By the 11th century, the fish industry and fertile farmlands were the economic base of a feudal lordship and Varzim was fiercely disputed between the local overlords and the early Portuguese kings, which resulted in the establishment of the present day's municipality in 1308 and being subdued to monastic power some years later. Póvoa de Varzim's importance reemerged with the Age of Discovery due to its shipbuilders and merchants proficiency and wealth, who traded around the globe in complex trade routes.
