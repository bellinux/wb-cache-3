40|$|The phylogenetic {{structure}} of ferns (= monilophytes) is explored here, {{with a special}} focus on the early divergences among leptosporangiate lineages.

40|$|In {{this report}} novel {{materials}} for advanced applications are studied {{by means of}} the latest microscopy technologies and methodologies which have had a dramatic impact on progress of materials science. The aim was to study phenomena such as polytypism, unusual morphologies, polytypic branching, cation ordering, polarity, epitaxial growth and interface, etc, in order to find adequate explanations for the influence of the phenomena on the properties and applications such as thermoelectricity, p-n junction functionality, photovoltaic efficiency, optoelectronic properties, and sensing response. Various semiconducting materials, i. e. complex chalcogenides, metal oxides, and III-V nanostructures were characterized for this purpose. Here, nanoengineered structures of functional materials at nanoscale are studied by means of advanced electron microscopy methods. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the report; the main purpose of the work, state-of-the-art, challenges and possibilities. In chapter 2 the methodology is described. The results are provided in Chapter 3, 4, and 5, and Chapter 6 is the general conclusions and the outlook. Note that Chapters 3 - 5 have their own introduction and conclusion. Therefore, chapter 1 consists of a short introduction to the general idea of the study, its importance and the state-of-the-art, and a preface of the thesis. In Chapter 2, after a brief history and the basic concepts of EM, the TEM methodology is described; the advanced TEM techniques used to study the nanostructured semiconductors at atomic scale. In general, it consists of brief descriptions of basic principles of TEM techniques. As experimental results are corroborated by theoretical studies and simulations, these procedures (image processing, simulations, etc) are also described shortly. Chapter 3 is dedicated to nanoengineering crystal structure and morphology of nanocrystals of complex copper-based chalcogenide, from binaries to complex ternaries and quaternaries. In this chapter it is shown that there is a wide range of possibilities for engineering, as many elements can be substituted with the primary cations and anions. Advanced TEM studies are performed in order to figure out the physics behind the property modifications. Phenomena such as morphology change, polytypism, ordering, polarity, electronic band change, strain, etc are elaborately studied, and correlated to the physical properties such as thermoelectricity. CCTSe <b>polypods</b> are the case of a complete structure study to understand the branching mechanism. Therefore, by means of an aberration-corrected TEM the polarity and cation ordering was determined. Polarity-driven morphology and branching mechanism is explained. Moreover, electronic band structure in this polytypic structure is simulated. Chapter 4 is based on the study of nanojunctions in metal oxide heterostructured NWs, structures that can enhance the functionality of the targeted devices, such as photovoltaic cells, or gas sensors. Production of nanojunctions is a successful approach in the context. In this chapter it is shown how coaxial heterostructuring of NWs, e. g. formation of core-shell structures increase the efficiency of the solar cells or enhance the sensitivity/selectivity of the gas sensors. In chapter 5 almost the same approach was followed, nevertheless, this time with III-V NWs. The importance of axial heterostructures and fully-epitaxial and relaxed structure are emphasized. The optoelectronic properties of the GaN NWs, such promising p-n junctions, are examined. Polarity issue, as a remarkably influencing parameter, is precisely studied experimentally. Its effect on electronic band structure in the heterointerface is also proven by the theoretical simulations. In the end, a general conclusion of the whole work and room for further study and future work is discussed in Chapter 6. The ample freedom of structural nanoengineering in the materials, together with development of novel electron microscopy techniques, opens the way towards the new possibilities for the future work. En este trabajo hemos estudiado materiales avanzados con las últimas tecnologías y metodologías de microscopía electrónica, las que tienen un impacto importante en el desarrollo de la ciencia de materiales. El objetivo principal ha sido estudiar fenómenos como el politipismo, morfologías inusuales, ramificación, ‘ramificación politípica’, manipulación de la estructura de banda, ordenación de los cationes, polaridad, crecimiento e interfase epitaxial, alojamiento de una fase secundaria en una base, etc. para razonar la influencia de aquellos fenómenos en las propiedades y aplicaciones, por ejemplo la termoelectricidad, el funcionamiento de unión p-n, la eficiencia de las celdas solares, las propiedades optoelectrónicas, la respuesta de los sensores, etc. Distintos semiconductores han sido caracterizados: nanopartículas de calcogenuros complejos, nanohilos de óxidos de metales, y nanohilos del grupo III-V. Hemos estudiado los materiales en escala nanométrica por medio de métodos avanzados de microscopía electrónica de transmisión (TEM). El capítulo 1 es una breve introducción a la tesis, en la que se exponen los objetivos principales del trabajo, los últimos avances (state-of-the-art), los retos, y las nuevas posibilidades. En el capítulo 2 se explica la metodología de TEM utilizada para estudiar los semiconductores. Los capítulos 3 a 5 se componen de los resultados. El capítulo 3 está basado en el análisis de las nanopartículas de calcogenuros complejos. La sección de resultados contiene tres partes: monoestructurados, multiestructurados, y heteroestructuradas de tipo core-shell. En caso de nanopartículas cuaternarias de CCTSe, las nanopartículas ramifican y forman polipodes, que es el caso de un estudio elaborado porque el mecanismo de la ramificación es interesante. En capítulo 4 se trabaja con los nanohilos de óxidos de metales que sirven para muchas aplicaciones como celdas solares o sensores de gas. En nuestro caso, con el objetivo de mejorar la funcionalidad de los aparatos, hemos estudiado heteroestructuras. En el capítulo 5 prácticamente la misma aproximación está escogida, pero esta vez con nanohilos del grupo III-V. Aquí hemos enfatizado la importancia del crecimiento epitaxial de heteroestructuras.

40|$|Abstract Background Ferns have {{generally}} been neglected in studies of chloroplast genomics. Before this study, only one <b>polypod</b> and two basal ferns had their complete chloroplast (cp) genome reported. Tree ferns represent an ancient fern lineage that first occurred in the Late Triassic. In recent phylogenetic analyses, tree ferns were shown to be the sister group of polypods, the most diverse group of living ferns. Availability of cp genome sequence from a tree fern will facilitate interpretation of the evolutionary changes of fern cp genomes. Here we have sequenced the complete cp genome of a scaly tree fern Alsophila spinulosa (Cyatheaceae). Results The Alsophila cp genome is 156, 661 base pairs (bp) in size, and has a typical quadripartite structure with the large (LSC, 86, 308 bp) and small single copy (SSC, 21, 623 bp) regions separated by two copies of an inverted repeat (IRs, 24, 365 bp each). This genome contains 117 different genes encoding 85 proteins, 4 rRNAs and 28 tRNAs. Pseudogenes of ycf 66 and trnT-UGU are also detected in this genome. A unique trnR-UCG gene (derived from trnR-CCG) is found between rbcL and accD. The Alsophila cp genome shares some unusual characteristics with the previously sequenced cp genome of the <b>polypod</b> fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, including the absence of 5 tRNA genes that exist in most other cp genomes. The genome shows {{a high degree of}} synteny with that of Adiantum, but differs considerably from two basal ferns (Angiopteris evecta and Psilotum nudum). At one endpoint of an ancient inversion we detected a highly repeated 565 -bp-region that is absent from the Adiantum cp genome. An additional minor inversion of the trnD-GUC, which is possibly shared by all ferns, was identified by comparison between the fern and other land plant cp genomes. Conclusion By comparing four fern cp genome sequences it was confirmed that two major rearrangements distinguish higher leptosporangiate ferns from basal fern lineages. The Alsophila cp genome is very {{similar to that of the}} <b>polypod</b> fern Adiantum in terms of gene content, gene order and GC content. However, there exist some striking differences between them: the trnR-UCG gene represents a putative molecular apomorphy of tree ferns; and the repeats observed at one inversion endpoint may be a vestige of some unknown rearrangement(s). This work provided fresh insights into the fern cp genome evolution as well as useful data for future phylogenetic studies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Süßwassertang, {{a popular}} aquatic plant that is sold {{worldwide}} in aquarium markets, has been long con-sidered a liverwort {{because of its}} ribbon-like thallus. How-ever, its antheridia are remarkably fern-like in morphology. To corroborate the hypothesis that Süßwassertang is a fern gametophyte and to determine its closest relative, we have sequenced five chloroplast regions (rbcL, accD, rps 4 –trnS, trnL intron, and trnL-F intergenic spacer), applying a DNA-based identification approach. The BLAST results on all regions revealed that Süßwassertang is a <b>polypod</b> fern (order: Polypodiales) with strong affinities to the Lomariopsidaceae. Our phylogenetic analyses further showed that Süßwasser-tang is nested within the hemi-epiphytic fern genus Lomariopsis (Lomariopsidaceae) and aligned very close to L. lineata.

In particular, insect dorsal vessel tissue (DVT) {{seems to be}} well suited for a bio-actuator since {{it is capable of}} contracting autonomously and the tissue itself and its cells are more environmentally robust under culturing conditions compared with mammalian tissues and cells. Here we demonstrate an autonomously moving <b>polypod</b> microrobot (PMR) powered by DVT excised from an inchworm. We fabricated a prototype of the PMR by assembling a whole DVT onto an inverted two-row micropillar array. The prototype moved autonomously at a velocity of 3. 5 × 10 (- 2) µm/s, and the contracting force of the whole DVT was calculated as 20 µN. Based on the results obtained by the prototype, we then designed and fabricated an actual PMR. We were able to increase the velocity significantly for the actual PMR which could move autonomously at a velocity of 3. 5 µm/s.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the different {{processes involved in}} spore liberation in the <b>polypod</b> fern Adiantum peruvianum (Pteridaceae). Sporangia are being produced on the undersides of so-called false indusia, which are situated at the abaxial surface of the pinnule margins, and become exposed by a desiccation-induced movement of these pinnule flaps. The complex folding kinematics and functional morphology of false indusia are being described, and we discuss scenarios of movement initiation and passive hydraulic actuation of these struc-tures. High-speed cinematography allowed for analyses of fast sporangium motion and for tracking ejected spores. Separation and liberation of spores from the sporangia are induced by relaxation of the annulus (the ‘throwing arm ’ of the sporangium catapult) and conserva-tion of momentum generated during this process, which leads to sporangium bouncing. The ultra-lightweight spores travel through air with a maximum velocity of ~ 5 m s- 1, and a launch acceleration of ~ 6300 g is measured. In some cases, the whole sporangium, or parts of it, together with contained spores {{break away from the}} false indusium and are shed as a whole. Also, spores can stick together and form spore clumps. Both findings are discussed in the context of wind dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Background: DNA barcoding will {{revolutionize}} {{our understanding}} of fern ecology, most especially because the accurate identification of the independent but cryptic gametophyte phase of the fern’s life history—an endeavor previously impossible—will finally be feasible. In this study, we assess the discriminatory power of the core plant DNA barcode (rbcL and matK), as well as alternatively proposed fern barcodes (trnH-psbA and trnL-F), across all major fern lineages. We also present plastid barcode data for two genera in the hyperdiverse <b>polypod</b> clade—Deparia (Woodsiaceae) and the Cheilanthes marginata group (currently being segregated as a new genus of Pteridaceae) —to further evaluate the resolving power of these loci. Principal Findings: Our results clearly demonstrate the value of matK data, previously unavailable in ferns because of difficulties in amplification due to a major rearrangement of the plastid genome. With its high sequence variation, matK complements rbcL to provide a two-locus barcode with strong resolving power. With sequence variation comparable to matK, trnL-F {{appears to be a}} suitable alternative barcode region in ferns, and perhaps should be added to the core barcode region if universal primer development for matK fails. In contrast, trnH-psbA shows dramatically reduced sequence variation for the majority of ferns. This is likely due to the translocation of this segment of the plastid genome into the inverted repeat regions, which are known to have a highly constrained substitution rate...|$|E
40|$|Cyrtomium falcatum is {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} fern cultivated worldwide. Native to the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and Dokdo Island in the Sea of Japan, {{it is the only}} fern present on Dokdo Island. We isolated and characterized the chloroplast (cp) genome of C. falcatum, and compared it with those of closely related species. The genes trnV-GAC and trnV-GAU were found to be present within the cp genome of C. falcatum, whereas trnP-GGG and rpl 21 were lacking. Moreover, cp genomes of Cyrtomium devexiscapulae and Adiantum capillus-veneris lack trnP-GGG and rpl 21, suggesting these are not conserved among angiosperm cp genomes. The deletion of trnR-UCG, trnR-CCG, and trnSeC in the cp genomes of C. falcatum and other eupolypod ferns indicates these genes are restricted to tree ferns, non-core leptosporangiates, and basal ferns. The C. falcatum cp genome also encoded ndhF and rps 7, with GUG start codons that were only conserved in <b>polypod</b> ferns, and it shares two significant inversions with other ferns, including a minor inversion of the trnD-GUC region and an approximate 3 kb inversion of the trnG-trnT region. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Equisetum was found to be a sister clade to Psilotales-Ophioglossales with a 100 % bootstrap (BS) value. The sister relationship between Pteridaceae and eupolypods was also strongly supported by a 100 % BS, but Bayesian molecular clock analyses suggested that C. falcatum diversified in the mid-Paleogene period (45. 15 ± 4. 93 million years ago) and might have moved from Eurasia to Dokdo Island...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} review of the {{documented}} fungal colonizations of presumably symbiotic nature in lycophytes and ferns (“pteridophytes”). The sampling covers ca. 11 % (1287 spp.) of the estimated global diversity of these taxa (ca. 12, 000 spp.) and shows an average presence of fungal endophytes of 68 %, which is significantly lower than the average presence of mycorrhiza of 80 – 85 % for the remaining tracheophytes. Above-average colonization rates up to 100 % among ferns are mainly found in phylogenetically old lineages, whereas below-average mycorrhization characterizes the <b>Polypod</b> I clade and the Aspleniaceae of the derived leptosporangiate ferns. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) are found in 54 % of the species, to which 6 % of unspecified records of mycorrhizae should probably be added. Dark Septate Endophytes (DSE) are found in 13 % of the species, in about half the cases (6 %) together with AMF. Ectomycorrhizae have not been confirmed for pteridophytes so far, and basidiomycetes are found very rarely in mycoheterotropic gametophytes. Fungal endophytes are unevenly distributed across the life forms and most frequent with 75 % in the terrestrial species, followed with 69 % in saxicolous and with 58 % in epiphytic species. Although AMF have a low dispersal potential and thus are considered unreliable symbiotic partners for epiphytes, they are still present in 27 % of the investigated epiphytic pteridophytes. The occurrence of mycorrhizae across the taxa of pteridophytes bears a phylogenetic signal, as the derived ferns show a notable trend towards a growing independence from AM, in epiphytes more pronouncedly so than in terrestrial taxa...|$|E

The PCR amplification rate was extremely low in all nuclear genes except for IBR 3 _ 2. rbcL had the highest PCR amplification rate (94. 33 %) and sequencing success rate (90. 78 %), while trnH-psbA had the highest species identification rate (75 %). With the consideration of discriminatory power, cost-efficiency and effort, the two-barcode combination of rbcL+ trnH-psbA {{seems to be the}} best choice for barcoding Adiantum, and perhaps basal <b>polypod</b> ferns in general. The nuclear IBR 3 _ 2 showed 100 % PCR amplification success rate in Adiantum, however, it seemed that only diploid species could acquire clean sequences without cloning. With cloning, IBR 3 _ 2 can successfully distinguish cryptic species and hybrid species from their related species. Because hybridization and allopolyploidy are common in ferns, we argue for including a selected group of nuclear loci as barcodes, especially via the next-generation sequencing, as it is much more efficient to obtain single-copy nuclear loci without the cloning procedure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of Quaternary palaeoecology and geoarchaeology studies in the Zerkal'naya Basin, with new insights about sequenced natural shifts during the prehistoric occupation of this marginally explored NE Asian maritime territory. The Basin is part of the continental drainage system and the main physiographic and biotic corridor for peopling of the transitive coastal interior SE Primor'ye Region. The Final Pleistocene and Holocene environmental (biotic and abiotic) proxy records from the Upper/Final Palaeolithic to early historical sites document a dynamic climate change with vegetation cover transformations within riverine and mountain valley ecosystems of the Russian Far East. Most of the archaeological sites located on the low terraces and bedrock promontories along the main river channel and its tributary streams suggest traditional hunter gathered lifestyles based on seasonal salmon-fishing supplemented by pastoral economy. Tundra-forests with larch trees, dwarf birch thickets and <b>polypod</b> ferns from the basal stratigraphic units of the late Last Glacial occupation sites associated with the Upper Palaeolithic micro-blade and bifacial stone tool traditions (14 C-dated to 19, 000 - 12, 000 cal yrs BP) indicate rather pronounced conditions and much lower MAT comparing today. Following a final Pleistocene cooling event, a major climate warming marked the onset of Holocene accompanied by a regional humidity increase promoting the formation of a mixed broadleaved-coniferous oak-dominant taiga, and culminating in the mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. The appearance of mosaic parklands ca. 5, 000 - 4, 000 cal yrs BP. may be partly attributed to the expansion of the Far Eastern Neolithic cultures practicing forest clearance for pastures and dwellings. A progressing landscape opening indicated by the spread of light-demanding thickets and birch-dominated riverine biotopes with Artemisia suggests a further vegetation cover transformation during the late Neolithic and the early Palaeo-Metal (Bronze Age) periods. This trend corroborates the documented climate deterioration between 3, 400 and 2, 600 cal yrs BP, causing a regional aridification with a parkland-steppe broadening in the main SE Primor'ye river valleys. The late Holocene climate development persisted until the Little Ice Age which led to formation of the present settlement ecosystems with mixed (oak/cedar/fir-dominated) temperate maritime woodlands. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. 14 - 18 - 01165, RSF, Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation [14 - 18 - 01165]; Far Eastern Federal University [14 - 08 - 05 - 2 -(sic) ...|$|E
