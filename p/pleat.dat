5|$|In 1995, {{after leaving}} Newfield Secondary School, Humphreys {{became part of}} Sheffield Wednesday's youth squad. For the youth squad Humphreys played as a left winger and was offered a {{professional}} contract. Due to the injuries of strikers David Hirst and Mark Bright, Wednesday manager David <b>Pleat</b> gave Humphreys {{the opportunity to go}} on Wednesday's pre-season tour of the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Milne left in 1986 and was {{replaced}} in 1987 by David <b>Pleat,</b> who was sacked in January 1991 with Leicester in danger of relegation to the Third Division. Gordon Lee {{was put in charge}} of the club {{until the end of the}} season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the football league.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the game}} was shown live on ITV's The Match, which aired a live Division One game most {{weeks of the season}} from 1988 to 1992. Elton Welsby {{presented}} coverage and his guest was the England coach Bobby Robson. The match commentator on the night was Brian Moore, alongside former Tottenham Hotspur manager David <b>Pleat.</b> On radio, the action was summarised by Peter Jones on BBC Radio 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} shown {{simultaneously}} in the United Kingdom by free-to-air channel ITV 1 and subscription channel Sky Sports 1, who in 2005 won {{the rights to}} broadcast UEFA Champions League matches for three seasons from 2006–07 to 2008–09. Sky acted as the host broadcaster for UEFA, providing pictures to all other networks covering the final with around 30 cameras and 100 crew members. The ITV broadcast was led by Steve Rider, with Clive Tyldesley commentating, David <b>Pleat</b> as an analyst, and Andy Townsend and Mark Hughes as in-studio pundits. Sky's team consisted of presenter Richard Keys, joined in the studio by Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp, and Ruud Gullit via phone, with commentary from Martin Tyler and analysis from Andy Gray.|$|E
2500|$|Plissé <b>pleats</b> are narrow <b>pleats</b> set by {{gathering}} fabric with stitches, wetting the fabric, and [...] "setting" [...] the <b>pleats</b> {{by allowing}} the wet fabric to dry under weight or tension. [...] Linen chemises or smocks <b>pleated</b> with this technique {{have been found in}} the 10th century Viking graves in Birka.|$|R
2500|$|Box <b>pleats</b> are knife <b>pleats</b> back-to-back, {{and have}} a {{tendency}} to spring out from the waistline. [...] They have the same 3:1 ratio as knife <b>pleats,</b> and may also be stacked to form [...] "stacked-" [...] or [...] "double-box pleats". [...] These stacked box <b>pleats</b> create more fullness {{and have a}} 5:1 ratio. [...] They also create a bulkier seam. Inverted box <b>pleats</b> have the [...] "box" [...] on the inside rather than the outside.|$|R

5|$|Managers in the Premier League are {{involved}} in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David <b>Pleat</b> at Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Sir Alex Ferguson {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the starting line-up for Paul Scholes, after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension. Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier, with Owen Hargreaves starting {{on the right side of}} midfield in a 4–4–2 formation in place of Park Ji-sung, who did not even make the substitutes bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing, where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right-back Michael Essien. This went against the prediction of The Guardians David <b>Pleat,</b> who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Ashley Cole would be key to the final. Ferguson hoped his substitutes might have a big impact on the match, just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999, when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich. A week before the game, Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in the starting line-up; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Shirts and blouses {{typically}} have pleats {{on the back}} to provide freedom of movement and on the arm where the sleeve tapers to meet the cuff.

25|$|David <b>Pleat</b> {{returned}} {{for his second}} spell as Luton boss during the summer. Elstrup rejoined Odense for £200,000, and Kingsley Black was sold to Nottingham Forest for £1,500,000. Striker Iain Dowie and full back Tim Breacker were both sold to West Ham United for a combined fee of £1,050,000.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pleat</b> {{left for}} a second time in the summer of 1995, moving to Sheffield Wednesday. His {{successor}} Terry Westley was promoted from youth team coach, but was sacked after just six months in charge. Lennie Lawrence was brought in as a replacement, but he was unable to stop Luton from finishing bottom of Division One.|$|E
25|$|The {{next season}} saw Luton finish sixth, before a drop to 13th in 1977–78 {{prompted}} Haslam's departure to Sheffield United. This gave the young assistant manager, David <b>Pleat,</b> his chance. The club {{came close to}} the drop during Pleat's first full season in charge but, following the shrewd acquisition {{of a number of}} key players, the club were soon challenging for promotion once again. Pleat's astute signings, including Mal Donaghy, David Moss and captain Brian Horton, complemented the existing home-grown talent personified by skilful midfielder Ricky Hill and prolific goalscorer Brian Stein. <b>Pleat</b> even dabbled in the overseas market, signing Yugoslav defender Raddy Antić from Spanish club Real Zaragoza in 1980. Luton came sixth, then fifth, and then romped home as champions in 1981–82, spending only one week off of the top spot from October onwards, amassing 88 points and clinching the championship eight points ahead of second placed arch-rivals Watford.|$|E

25|$|Under <b>Pleat,</b> {{the club}} had {{developed}} a cavalier and attacking style of play, which was evident during 1982–83 as Luton finished with the second highest tally of away goals, only one less than champions Liverpool. On {{the last day of}} the season, Luton needed all three points against relegation rivals Manchester City at Maine Road to stay in the division. City, needing only a point to avoid the drop, defended resolutely and few chances came to Luton – but with only seven minutes remaining, substitute Raddy Antić slammed home the winner to secure Luton's top flight status and prompt a manic and now infamous jig across the pitch from <b>Pleat.</b> The next two seasons saw Luton consolidate as the club finished first 16th, then 13th in 1984–85 as they also reached the FA Cup semi-finals. Player sales continued as skilful forward Paul Walsh, the PFA Young Player of the Year, was sold to Liverpool in the summer of 1984.|$|E
25|$|The end of 1985–86 saw <b>Pleat</b> leave Luton, as {{he moved}} on to Tottenham Hotspur. He handed over the reins to coach John Moore, who guided Luton to a seventh-place finish in 1986–87, which remains to this day the club's highest ever finish in the English {{football}} league system, before handing in his resignation and being replaced by his assistant Ray Harford.|$|E

2500|$|A {{vertically}} hanging {{piece of}} fabric {{such as a}} skirt or a drape will often be {{described in terms of}} its [...] "fullness." [...] Fullness represents the thickness/ depth of the <b>pleats</b> in relation to the original width of the fabric: fabric sewn at [...] "zero fullness" [...] would actually be flat and have no pleats; fabric sewn at [...] "100% fullness" [...] is <b>pleated</b> so that it takes up exactly half as much width as it would if it were not <b>pleated</b> at all (i.e., 24 inches would be <b>pleated</b> down to 12 inches); if sewn at [...] "150% fullness," [...] the unpleated fabric would be {{two and a half times}} wider than the final <b>pleated</b> piece (i.e., an unpleated 30 inches would end up as 12 <b>pleated</b> inches of fabric: 12+1.50(12)=30); if fullness were to be [...] "50%", the original fabric would be one and a half times the width of the <b>pleated</b> (i.e., 18 inches of width would end up as 12 <b>pleated</b> inches: 12+0.50(12)=18), etc.|$|R

25|$|In New Zealand, {{knock-down}} kits of the Series II were assembled locally by the New Zealand Motor Corporation (NZMC) {{at their}} Nelson plant.

New Zealand produced models featured speedometers in km/h, and the black vinyl mats sewn onto the carpets in the front footwells featured the British Leyland 'L' logo.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson {{the chance}} to take over from Peter Shreeves as manager, but he {{rejected}} this offer and the job went to Luton Town's David <b>Pleat</b> instead. There was also an offer for Ferguson to replace Don Howe as Arsenal manager, but he rejected this offer as well, and fellow Scot George Graham took the post instead. That summer, there had been speculation {{that he would take}} over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United, who had slumped to fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start had made title glory seem inevitable.|$|E
25|$|Luton laboured {{once again}} in 1994–95, with the side {{struggling}} to score at home. Pleat's Luton side, including young players such as Oakes, Telfer and John Hartson, reacted positively when <b>Pleat</b> turned down the advances of Tottenham Hotspur to return to North London as General Manager, and rocketed up to fifth in the table, and for perhaps {{the first time in}} three seasons of Division One football, promotion was looking a real possibility. Hartson was bought by Arsenal for £2,500,000 soon after – a then-British record for a teenager. The season petered out into obscurity following Hartson's sale, and Luton finished 16th.|$|E
