Results are presented for the VARIANT, DIF 3 D-NODAL, and DIF 3 D-finite difference codes. The VARIANT results indicate that second order expansion of the within-node source and linear representation of the node surface currents are adequate for this problem. The results also demonstrate the improvement in the VARIANT solution when the order of the polynomial expansion of the within-node flux is increased from fourth to sixth order.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{sensitivity}} analysis of the multidimension, multigroup neutron diffusion NODAL 3 code for the NEACRP 3 D LWR core transient benchmarks (PWR). The code input parameters covered in the sensitivity analysis are the radial and axial node sizes (the number of radial node per fuel assembly {{and the number of}} axial layers), heat conduction node size in the fuel pellet and cladding, and the maximum time step. The output parameters considered in this analysis followed the above-mentioned core transient benchmarks, that is, power peak, time of power peak, power, averaged Doppler temperature, maximum fuel centerline temperature, and coolant outlet temperature at the end of simulation (5 [*]s). The sensitivity analysis results showed that the radial node size and maximum time step give a significant effect on the transient parameters, especially the time of power peak, for the HZP and HFP conditions. The number of ring divisions for fuel pellet and cladding gives negligible effect on the transient solutions.

40|$|Conventional {{dry storage}} {{facilities}} for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) were designed to remove decay heat through the natural convection of air, but this method has limited cooling capacity and a possible re-criticality accident in case of flooding. To enhance the safety and capacity of dry storage cask of SNF, hybrid heat pipe-based passive cooling device was suggested. Heat pipe is an excellent passive heat transfer device using the principles of both conduction and phase change of the working fluid. The heat pipe containing neutron absorber material, the so-called hybrid heat pipe, is expected to prevent the re-criticality accidents of SNF and to increase the safety margin during interim and long term storage period. Moreover, a hybrid heat pipe with thermoelectric module, a Stirling engine and a phase change material tank {{can be used for}} utilization of the waste heat as heat-transfer medium. Located at the guide tube or instrumentation tube, hybrid heat pipe can remove decay heat from inside the sealed metal cask to outside, decreasing fuel rod temperature. In this paper, a 2 -step analysis was performed using computational fluid dynamics code to evaluate the heat and fluid flow inside a cask, which consisted of a single spent fuel assembly simulation and a full-scope dry cask simulation. For a normal dry storage cask, the maximum fuel temperature is 290. 0 °C. With hybrid heat pipe cooling, the temperature decreased to 261. 6 °C with application of one hybrid heat pipe <b>per</b> <b>assembly,</b> and to 195. 1 °C with the application of five hybrid heat pipes <b>per</b> <b>assembly.</b> Therefore, a dry storage cask with hybrid heat pipes produces relatively low temperature inside a cask and reduces the possibility of structural failure due to thermal degradation. clos...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{extension}} of the nodal diffusion code ANDES, based on the ACMFD method, to hexagonal geometry is presented, as well as its coupling with the thermal-hydraulic (TH) code COBRA-IIIc/MIT- 2 for such hexagonal problems. In extending the ACMFD method to hexagonal assemblies, triangular-Z nodes are used, taking advantage of the mesh refinement capabilities implicit within that geometry. The existing TH coupling for Cartesian geometry applications has also been extended to hexagonal problems, with the capability to model the core using either assembly wise channels (hexagonal mesh) or a higher refinement with six channels <b>per</b> fuel <b>assembly</b> (triangular mesh). Achieving this level of TH mesh refinement with COBRA-IIIc code provides a better estimation of the in-core 3 D flow distribution. Therefore, the work presented here introduces an improvement in the TH VVER core modelling, where in the best case scenario, just twenty axial layers and one channel <b>per</b> fuel <b>assembly</b> were used. As a result, the neutronic and thermal-hydraulics (N-TH) coupled code, ANDES/COBRA-IIIc, extensively verified in Cartesian geometry cores analysis, can also be applied to full threedimensional VVER core problems. Some verification results are provided, corresponding to 2 nd exercises (HZP and HP steady states) of the OECD/NEA- VVER- 1000 Coolant Transient benchmark and to the HZP and HFP steady states of the V 1000 CT 2 -EXT 2 NURESIM benchmark...|$|R

Here, we present a template-free one-pot synthesis of triply interlocked organic cages. These 20 -component dimers consist of two tetrahedral monomeric cages each built from four nodes and six linkers. The monomers exhibit axial chirality, which is recognized by their partner cage during the template-free interlocking assembly process. The dimeric cages also include two well-defined cavities <b>per</b> <b>assembly,</b> which for one of the systems studied {{led to the formation of}} a supramolecular host–guest chain.

In contrast to synthetic small-molecule catenanes, examples of naturally-occurring catenanes are scarce. Here, we report thermodynamic and enzymatic studies on CS 2 hydrolase, which exists in solution as a mixture of unique hexadecameric catenane and octameric ring forms. A combination of field-flow fractionation coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering (FFF-MALLS) and native mass spectrometric analyses revealed that the catenane form is converted into the ring form at elevated temperatures, whereas the ring does not assemble into the catenane under the same conditions. Measurements of the enzyme kinetics for the conversion of CS 2 into COS and H 2 S showed that the ring form of CS 2 hydrolase possesses higher enzyme efficiency (per monomer) than the catenane form, whereas the catenane form is overall more active (<b>per</b> <b>assembly).</b> © 2014 the Partner Organisations...|$|E

Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) {{was used as}} the patterning tool for making patterned β-cyclodextrin (CD) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and for the confinement of nanoparticles on the substrate. A densely packed and multilayered nanoparticle structure was created by alternating assembly steps of complementary guest- (Fc-SiO 2, 60 nm) and host-functionalized (CD-Au, 3 nm) nanoparticles. The effects induced by the order of the nanoparticle assembly steps, going from large to small and from small to large nanoparticles by using Fc-SiO 2, CD-Au, and CD-SiO 2 (350 nm) nanoparticles, were compared.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{working hypothesis}} of Alzheimer's disease {{is that the}} proximate pathologic agents are oligomers of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ). "Oligomer" is an ill-defined term. Many different types of oligomers have been reported, and they often exist in rapid equilibrium with monomers and higher-order assemblies. This has made formal structure-activity determinations difficult. Recently, Ono et al. [Ono, K., et al. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106, 14745 - 14750] used rapid, zero-length, in situ chemical cross-linking to stabilize the oligomer state, allowing the isolation and study of pure populations of oligomers of a specific order (number of Aβ monomers <b>per</b> <b>assembly).</b> This approach was successful but highly laborious and time-consuming, precluding general application of the method.
