The economic models of cultural transmission borrow the main ideas from the anthropological literature, but endogeneize the efforts parents exert to transmit specific cultural variants or preference parameters. We distinguish between <b>paternalistic</b> <b>models</b> where parents use their own values to evaluate their children’s utility, and non-paternalistic or utilitarian models in which parents choose their children’s preferences to maximize the children’s well-being.

30|$|The doctor-patient {{relationship}} {{shifted from}} the paternalistic to the autonomy model in the 1970 s [14]. According to the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model,</b> the patient is passive and unable to make wise choices. The physician knows best and protects the patient (acting as a guardian) from making mistakes [15]. The patient trusts the doctor, who exercises control, makes all the decisions, and establishes priorities regarding the management plan, usually based on the scientific evidence. The <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model</b> was called into question when studies showed considerable variability in practice patterns within small geographic areas whose populations were similar in terms of health status and resources, {{as well as for}} health conditions whose management is laid out in clinical guidelines [16]. Subsequent studies established that this variability was due to the influence on decision-making of individual factors of such training [17] and cultural and religious values [13]. In addition, when several treatments are available, the best trade-off between benefits and risks depends in large part on the patient's perceptions and consequently cannot be determined by the physician alone. Similarly, whether treatment limitation decisions are appropriate depends in part on whether the quality of life that would be obtained should the patient survive with full-code treatment is acceptable to the patient. Studies establishing the role for subjective factors made a strong case for patients (or their families) playing an active role in choosing which types of healthcare they received. Thus, the autonomy model was developed as the antithesis of the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Shared {{decision making is}} an emerging physician-patient interaction model for clinical practice [1]. Essentially, shared decision making implies that both the physician and the pa-tient contribute to and bear responsibility for the clinical decision to be taken. It offers an alternative for the paternalis-tic model, {{in which it is}} the physician who informs the patient and proposes the decision to bemade. Shared decisionmaking emphasizes patient’s autonomy and recognizes the argumen-tation and preferences of the informed patient as valid ele-ments in the decision process. Thus, it can dramatically influ-ence the physician-patient relationship. E. g., in a given case, the choice for doing nothing as an alternative for pharmaco-therapy could be considered as an acceptable outcome of the shared decision making process, while it could be considered as disobedient behavior of the patient in the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model.</b> Clinical practice guidelines usually define a single best option in a given case [2]. Seen from this perspective, guide-lines leave little freedom for the patient and reinforce the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model</b> rather than shared decision making. More-over, the shared decision making model is not universally preferred; numerous situations can be mentioned in which either patient or physician would prefer the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model</b> [1]. Shared decision making is, however, particularly impor-tant when trade-offs between options strongly depend on individual preferences. This includes recommendations within guidelines for which the evidence is scarce or conflicting or for which {{there is more than one}} relevant treatment option that different individuals may value differently [2]. This explains why more and more recommendations for shared decision making appear in new guidelines. One of these guidelines i...|$|E

Interventions are needed to encourage clients to communicate more openly and more vigorously with providers. Methods: While waiting to see a service provider, 384 family planning clients in Indonesia received individual coaching on their right to speak out and on three basic communication skills: asking questions, expressing concerns, and seeking clarification. An equal number of clients in the control group received an HIV/AIDS booklet to read while waiting. The consultations were audiotaped and analyzed, and both the educators and clients were interviewed. Home visits with clients were made eight months later to measure contraceptive continuation.

40|$|Background: In <b>paternalistic</b> <b>models,</b> {{healthcare}} providers’ {{responsibility is}} to decide {{what is best for}} patients. The main concern is that such models fail to respect patient autonomy and do not promote patient responsibility. Aim: To evaluate mental healthcare team members’ perceptions of their own role in encouraging elderly persons to participate in shared decision-making after implementation of the CCM. The CCM is not an explanatory theory, but an evidence-based guideline and synthesis of best available evidence. Methods: Data were collected from two teams that took part in a focus group interview, and the transcript was analysed by means of qualitative thematic analysis. Results: One overall theme emerged—Preventing the violation of human dignity based on three themes, namely, Changing understanding and attitudes, Increasing depressed elderly persons’ autonomy and Clarifying the mental healthcare team coordinator’s role and responsibility. The results of this study reveal that until recently, paternalism has been the dominant decision- making model within healthcare, without any apparent consideration of the patient perspective. Community mental healthcare can be improved by shared decision-making in which team members initiate a dialogue focusing on patient participation to prevent the violation of human dignity. However, in order to determine how best to empower the patient, team members need expert knowledge and intuition...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} invisibility of servants in {{the novels}} of Henry Fielding, Samuel Richardson, and Jane Austen corresponds to the gradual transition of the master/servant relationship from a paternalistic to a contractual model in mid to late eighteenth-century England. Fielding's Joseph Andrews (1741) and Tom Jones (1749) illustrate the destabilizing effects of capitalism, individualism, {{and the formation of}} the middling class on the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model,</b> a model in which Fielding was deeply invested. In the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model</b> the master's authority to govern and the servant's duty to submit are absolute and unquestioned. Richardson's Pamela (1740) and Clarissa (1747) first critique and then rearm the <b>paternalistic</b> <b>model.</b> Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison (1753), on the other hand, articulates the contractual model of master/servant relations, which recognizes servants as autonomous wage laborers. Grandison also introduces a new paradigm of domesticity. This new paradigm transfers the management of the household to a housekeeper, an arrangement that frees the master to pursue political and economic interests in the public sphere and allows the mistress to engage in leisure and philanthropic service. Grandison thus redefines the roles and responsibilities of the master, mistress, and servants in order to validate emerging bourgeois assumptions about gender roles, family, and class distinctions. Austen adopts Richardson's new domestic paradigm, but she moves even further in the direction of servant as paid commodity rather than as protected member of the household. In Mansfield Park, for example, she revisits Pamela in order to show the dangers of blurring class boundaries. Even more noteworthy, however, is Austen's use of rhetorical strategies that are designed to push servants to the social periphery. Austen exploits servants as visible, class-bound commodities that signal their superiors' social status, but she renders servants invisible as subjects in order to legitimize the emerging and vulnerable middling class as it strives to establish itself as a new source of social and moral order...|$|E

40|$|The British National Health Service (NHS) {{has been}} {{involved}} in profound transformation to keep pace with, and shape, changes in our society. Innovation has been driven by the necessity to transform old hierarchical and <b>paternalistic</b> <b>models</b> into a modern health system, moving care closer to home, mobilizing and tailoring services to individual patients’ and their carers’ needs through the introduction of radically new services. This paper explores a particular element of ongoing NHS reform: Practice Based Commissioning (PBC). Based on first findings of a research project called “Design in Practice. Change and Flexibility within Health Providers” funded by the EPSRC research centre HACIRIC, the authors argue that PBC formally recognizes important forms of grassroots service design, but also introduces additional challenges. The project is based on case studies within the North West Strategic Health Area (UK), and the study of PBC frameworks and everyday PBC practices in this specific context is explored and contrasted with concurrent efforts to bring service design into the public sector, which are focusing on co-design and experience-based design methodologies. It is suggested that these have the potential to help NHS providers address NHS policy demands to use patient feedback in transforming services (DH, 2009), and the authors reflect on possibilities for potentiation through the application of Service Design methods in this context...|$|R

40|$|Strengths-based {{approaches}} generally conceptualize strengths in {{two distinct}} ways. First, assets, resources, and abilities {{that can be}} used to assist in helping an individual to continue to develop. Accordingly, strengths are used as building blocks for service planning and programme development. Second, sorne strengths can be developed or enhanced. Consequently, changes in the availability of various assets, resources, and abilities for an individual can be viewed as a service delivery outcome. In working with oIder persons, the strengths-based approaches can prove to be extremely useful in view of the fact that most elderly have an enormous repertoire of knowledge, practice wisdom and a wide range of skill sets and by and large, helping professionals approach the whole issue of working with the elderly from a perspective of dealing with dependency and burden of care associated with it. Particularly; social work interventions, in order to be effective, need to be offered from the standpoint of strengths-based approach rather than other <b>paternalistic</b> <b>models</b> of care. There is a strong. emphasis of the 'elderly as a resource' perspective in the field of ageing and various international bodies such as the United Nations have been advocating this paradigm shift among all stakeholders including the older persons themselves.

40|$|By 2033 {{the number}} of elderly people in England and Wales is {{expected}} to exceed 16. 4 million. The consequent increase in prevalence of chronic illness and demand on the health and social care services are major causes of concern for healthcare practitioners and policy-makers alike. In response, calls for greater service user autonomy, involvement, and self-care all indicate a shift away from existing <b>paternalistic</b> <b>models</b> of care to a model where service users knowledgably and competently manage their own healthcare and wellbeing. To equip healthcare professionals implement these fundamental changes, this thesis aims to capture, analyse, and articulate the process of healthcare service engagement. To investigate how healthcare services can be better designed to support healthcare engagement for service users with complex needs, this thesis conducts an empirical ethnographic study of a UK-based falls prevention service. Mixed methods were used to collect data {{from a wide range}} of sources, including twenty semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and service users, ninety-two surveys, referral forms, assessments, and healthcare promotional materials. The data were coded, conceptualised, and categorised to produce a grounded theory of healthcare service engagement represented in a specifically designed model. Key findings show that healthcare service engagement in the context of the chronically ill elderly needs to be understood as an interconnected, emergent, nonlinear, and situated process. It recommends that engagement should be supported in a more user-centric and personalised manner, assessing and responding to service users’ engagement needs as they emerge concurrently with the service’s pathway, integrating assessment practices within a wider healthcare context, and simplifying the existing multidisciplinary and multi-phase falls prevention pathway. Resulting from this thesis, healthcare professionals can more accurately, completely, and confidently reflect on the complex process of healthcare service engagement; better equipping the community for challenges it will face in the future...|$|R

[...] He has developed a widely used and translated ‘Interactive Post-Hippocratic Action Guide’ and other models for communication-in-trust and cooperation-in-trust interactions of individual, institutional and corporate persons in risk assessment, research and business ethics. His proposed virtues and principles for cross-cultural health care ethics include for the patient the balance between {{quality of life and}} length of life, individual self-determination and compliance with expert advice, for the expert the balance between professional responsibility and respect for clients’/patients’ autonomy, do-no-harm and do-good; trust, truthfulness and a prudent mix of solidarity and subsidiarity are important for all parties involved in the care for health, quality and happiness of life. He proposes that most ethical issues should be decided by risk-competent and health-literate citizens rather than bureaucracies and legislation, but that governments and institutions have the responsibility to introduce and to support health information and health competence as an essential part of educating risk-competent citizens for the 21st century. [...] As to health care reform and health education he defines in criticizing the WHO approach: Health is not just a status; rather the balanced result of health-literate and risk-competent care of one's own physical, emotional, and social well-being and well-feeling, achieved in competent understanding, modification and enhancement of individual genetic, social and environmental properties, with the support of health care professionals and through equal access health care services, including information, predictive and preventive medicine.

Furthermore, there is a dearth of research exploring service user views and perceptions. This paper aims to contribute to evidence and theory in relation to lay-led models of working with health deprived communities. By adopting an interpretive, longitudinal approach informed by grounded theory, the intention was to provide insight into the users’ experiences and the mechanisms underlying the intervention outcomes. In-depth interviews with service users (n= 26) were conducted at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months, and with LHAs and supervisors (n= 18) at 0 and 12 months. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the constant comparative method. LHAs were found to employ a holistic, asset-based approach that takes into account the context of a person’s life and their access to resources for health. This builds upon the salutogenic theory of health, and is in direct contrast to the <b>paternalistic,</b> deficit <b>model</b> traditionally found in public health medicine. This research is one of few qualitative studies investigating the role of LHAs in the UK.
