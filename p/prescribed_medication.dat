5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the <b>prescribed</b> <b>medication.</b> The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were in his system {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{concern is}} the case of medications, which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe, and may also contain animal ingredients, such as lactose, gelatine, or stearates. There may be no alternatives to <b>prescribed</b> <b>medication</b> or these alternatives may be unsuitable, less effective, or have more adverse side effects.

25|$|Health psychologists {{engage in}} {{research}} and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects.

Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives.

Those charged in the indictment included the crime family's current administration Street Boss Matthew Madonna, Underboss Steven Crea Sr. and Consigliere Joseph DiNapoli. The indictment builds on charges previously filed against Lucchese soldier Christopher Londonio and Lucchese associate Terrence Caldwell who were charged in February 2017 with racketeering offenses, including the murder of Michael Meldish in the Bronx on November 15, 2013; Madonna, Crea and Crea Jr., were charged and suspected of serving as co-conspirators in the Meldish gangland exuection too. Caldwell was indicted while {{in prison for the}} 2013 attempted murder of another Bonanno crime family soldier based in Queens, Caldwell shot him in the chest but the victim survived. The court heard in September 2017, by the FBI information gathered from a prison informer, Londonio was plotting to break out of a Brooklyn federal jail involving dental floss, a hacksaw blade smuggled in by a priest and a rope made out of hoarded sheets. Three attempted murders were also listed among the charges, Crea was alleged to have ordered a murder contract on a Bonanno crime family associate after he disrespected him. The FBI also alleged that Crea gave his approval in October 2016 to 66-year old Lucchese soldier Joseph Datello to drive to New Hampshire and murder an informant. Crea was personally charged with mail and wire fraud in connection of his skimming involvement with the construction of a New York City hospital.

500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior.

Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol.

Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharonâ€™s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I think it makes the most sense considering her history."

500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the <b>prescribed</b> <b>medication</b> for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E

A significant proportion of older people do not follow the recommendations from physicians and refrain from buying <b>prescribed</b> <b>medications.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate associations between self-rated health, somatic complaints and refraining from buying <b>prescribed</b> <b>medications</b> by elderly people. Findings Data was collected in a cross-sectional study in 2009. We received 624 completed questionnaires (response rate â€“ 48. 9 %) from persons aged 60 â€“ 84 years living in Kaunas (Lithuania). Somatic complaints were measured with the 24 item version of the Giessen Complaint List (GBB- 24). Logistic regression (Enter model) was used for evaluation of the associations between refraining from buying medications and somatic complaints. These associations were measured using odds ratio (OR) and calculating the 95 % confidence interval (CI).
