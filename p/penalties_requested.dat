40|$|Cloud Computing {{is a new}} {{emerging}} paradigm {{that aims}} at streamlining the on-demand provisioning of resources as services, providing end-user with flexible and scalable services accessible through the Internet on a pay-per-use basis.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of Cloud technologies is steadily increasing. In such systems, applications {{can benefit from}} nearly infinite virtual resources on a pay-per-use basis. However, being the Cloud massively multi-tenant and characterized by highly variable workloads {{the development of more}} and more effective provisioning policies assumes paramount importance. Boosted by the success of the Cloud, the application of Game Theory models and methodologies has also become popular, since they have been demonstrated to suit perfectly to Cloud social, economic, and strategic structures. This paper aims to study, model and efficiently solve the cost minimization problem associated with the service provisioning of SaaS virtual machines in multiple IaaSs. We propose a game-theoretic approach for the runtime management of resources from multiple IaaS providers to be allocated to multiple competing SaaSs, along with a cost model including revenues and <b>penalties</b> for <b>requests</b> execution failures. A distributed algorithm for identifying Generalized Nash Equilibria has been developed and analysed in detail.

Furthermore, increasing the number of IaaS providers SaaSs can achieve 9 – 15 % cost savings from the workload distribution on multiple IaaSs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In today’s {{enterprise}} {{service oriented}} software architectures, database systems are a crucial component {{for the quality}} of service (QoS) management between customers and service providers. The database workload consists of requests stemming from many different service classes, each of which has a dedicated service level agreement (SLA). We present an adaptive QoS management that is based on an economic model which adaptively penalizes individual requests depending on the SLA and the current degree of SLA conformance that the particular service class exhibits. For deriving the adaptive <b>penalty</b> of individual <b>requests,</b> our model differentiates between opportunity costs for underachieving an SLA threshold and marginal gains for (re-) achieving an SLA threshold. Based on the penalties, we develop a database component which schedules requests depending on their deadline and their associated penalty.

Everyday social interactions can have a similar payoff structure (with emotional rather than legal <b>penalties)</b> whenever a <b>request</b> is implicitly forbidden by the relational model holding between speaker and hearer (e. g., bribing an honest maitre d’, where the reciprocity of the bribe clashes with his authority).

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we examine}} a discrete-time {{stochastic}} control problem {{in which there}} is a number of observation options available to the controller, with varying associated costs.

Moreover we show that the effect of the observation cost is manifested on the estimation strategy as follows: instead of a Kalman filter with gain determined by the algebraic Riccati equation, the optimal estimator includes, in addition, a query strategy which is characterized by a dynamic programming equation. The structure of the optimal query for a one-dimensional system is studied analytically and simulated with numerical examples. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{the file}} caching problem, the input is a {{sequence}} of requests for files out of a slow memory. A file has two attributes, a positive retrieval cost and an integer size. An algorithm is required to maintain a cache of size k such that the total size of files stored in the cache never exceeds k. Given {{a request for a}} file that is not present in the cache at the time of request, the file must be brought from the slow memory into the cache, possibly evicting other files from the cache. This incurs a cost equal to the retrieval cost of the requested file. Well-known special cases include paging (all costs and sizes are equal to 1), the cost model, which is also known as weighted paging, (all sizes are equal to 1), the fault model (all costs are equal to 1), and the bit model (the cost of a file is equal to its size). If bypassing is allowed, a miss for a file still results in an access to this file in the slow memory, but its subsequent insertion into the cache is optional. We study a new online variant of caching, called caching with rejection. In this variant, each request for a file has a rejection penalty associated with the <b>request.</b> The <b>penalty</b> of a <b>request</b> is given to the algorithm together with the request. When a file that is not present in the cache is requested, the algorithm must either bring the file into the cache, paying the retrieval cost of the file, or reject the file, paying the rejection <b>penalty</b> of the <b>request.</b> The objective function is the sum of total rejection penalty and the total retrieval cost. This problem generalizes both caching and caching with bypassing. We design deterministic and randomized algorithms for this problem. The competitive ratio of the randomized algorithm is O(log k), and this is optimal up to a constant factor. In the deterministic case, a k-competitive algorithm for caching, and a (k+ 1) -competitive algorithm for caching with bypassing are known. Moreover, these are the best possible competitive ratios. In contrast, we present a lower bound of 2 k+ 1 on the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm for the variant with rejection. The lower bound is valid already for paging. We design a (2 k+ 2) -competitive algorithm for caching with rejection. We also design a different (2 k+ 1) -competitive algorithm, {{that can be used for}} paging and for caching in the bit and fault models. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|The world’s {{population}} and citizen’s lives are meanly concentrated in cities, so also the criminality is located there. Mass media influence {{this type of}} crimes and built a reality of urban delinquency. Legislators, the executive power and politicians reply not to real events, but to news as described by mass media, {{because this is what}} the public opinion is. The punitive power is characterized by the victim’s exploitation (expropriation, depersonalization). To resolve this situation, the central State has tried to care for victims’ psychic damages and so it has extended the concept of “victim” to all his family. All the guidelines shoot for the victim’s psychic health and his or her recovery, in particular the process of recovering from a loss. When this processing ends, the risk of tension’s amassing increases and it may turns into a psychic pathology. The mass media shows only a few victims, whereas the other one goes ignored (they became invisible). This victims become heroes. Journalists and performers instigate this victims to talk about their emotions and feelings like a criminologists or a criminal lawyer. These opinions are understood (and perceived) like a scientific truth by mass media’s insiders. The audience may identify itself with the victims if they have distinctive features (for example language, culture,…). Traumatized victims blame the government and their preventive and repressive ineffectiveness. Politics try to search for a solution about the reality “built” by mass media and victim/hero’s opinions, in fact this reality doesn’t coincide with the urban delinquency. The victim/hero ruin the legislation in South America, where in some countries (like Argentina and Brazil) there isn’t a criminal jurisdiction, but only inconsistent and contradictory lows. The concept of victim/hero needs more research, also by comparing different national experiences. This article speaks about the comparison between two different crimes (kidnapping) which happened in Argentina; they are similar because the crime’s feature and mass media manipulation, but they differ in stretch and political context. These two kidnappings caused the hostages’ death: the first, the Ayerza case, happened in 1932 - 1933, the second happened in 2004. The two episodes are similar because: 1) the victim was a young University student; 2) he comes from a family that had an high social position; 3) Right Wing political ideals; 4) mass media presence during the time; 5) the general demand for more authority repression; 6) a plan about a criminal jurisdiction reform; 7) the crimes’ perpetrators were punished; 8) the coincidence between crimes and economic crisis. The first crime, Ayerza, is about a kidnapping which happened on the 25 of October 1933. The body was found on the 21 of February 1933. In Argentina at the time there was a complex economic crisis and also a military dictatorship. The victim was a young University student, his family had an high social position and {{he was a member of}} the local fascist movement (Legión Cívica). The Conservative Government was accused of complicity, the people asked for more severe punishment, Legión Cívica’s militants asserted their selves, revenge was promised and the death <b>penalty</b> was <b>requested.</b> Two months later, criminals, that belonged to an Italian gang (Galiffi’s Gang), were arrested. The kidnappers’ political identity was known, so the victim’s political organization exalted nationalism and delivered speeches about foreign criminals. The executive power reacted by suggesting repressive reforms in Penal Code, but it never passed on because the Senate did not approved it. In 2004, the social and historical context and the consequences were different because of the “victim/hero phenomenon”. Besides, the political situation was dissimilar because there were free and fair elections. Mass media attention shifted when the body was found from the victim to his father who assumed the major role of the new victim. Father and son did not belong to a political party, this is an important difference in comparison with the other event. The father surrounded himself with consultants linked to the dictatorship in 1976 - 1983, or to the corrupt political control in 1989 - 1999. At the beginning, the victim/hero had an ample support, but little by little the attention stopped because mass media’s directors refused to help him; the victim/hero, also, made a lot of political mistakes. The political power did not present any reforms in Penal Code. The victim’s father suggested reforms to the Congress worked out by his collaborators. He received proposals by politicians to become a candidate, but during the time he disappeared. So, the victim/hero “construction” may destabilize democratic state institutions by introducing values contrary to solidarity, equality, freedom, democracy. The democratic institutions have lost their faculties of reaction and defence and they resigned their self to victim/hero’s threats. It is a new phenomenon that cause problems in criminal jurisdiction and in criminal policy, but it sacrifices victim’s mental health. Summarizing:- an handling made by victims through their role of heroes is increasing;- this handling could put in danger the State;- the communication causes a momentary relief for the victim, but it could provoke a new victimization...|$|R
