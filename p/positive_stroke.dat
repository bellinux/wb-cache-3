40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the effect of the Human Relations Training Using Sports Activity. Subjects were 91 male college {{students}} of the first grade (experimental group = 36, control group = 55). They were required to complete the questionnaire which was consisted of scales measuring sending and receiving quantity of <b>positive</b> <b>stroke.</b> The tests were executed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the human relations training. The human relations training had following 5 learning contents: 1) communication, 2) shared leadership, 3) <b>positive</b> <b>stroke,</b> 4) feedback, 5) social support. And the human relations training was practiced based on the theory and method of Experiential Learning as laboratory method. First, the results of t tests (independent variable: measurement period; dependent variables: sending and receiving quantity of <b>positive</b> <b>stroke)</b> showed that the score of post-test was higher than the pre-test's in the both groups. Second, the results of t tests (independent variable: group; dependent variables: sending and receiving quantity of <b>positive</b> <b>stroke)</b> showed that there was no significant difference according to group in the pre-test, but the score of experimental group was higher than the control group's in the post-test. These results represented the effect of human relations training to increase the learner's sending and receiving quantity of <b>positive</b> <b>stroke.</b> Finally, it was discussed the significance that human relations training using sports activity was hoped to contribute toward preventing students' failure adaptation, and from this study we could propose what physical education should be in the future...|$|E

40|$|High-speed video {{records of}} two bipolar cloud-to-ground flashes were {{analyzed}} in detail. They both {{began with a}} single positive return stroke {{that was followed by}} more than one subsequent weak negative stroke. Due to the elevated cloud base height of its parent thunderstorm, the preparatory processes of each subsequent negative stroke were documented optically below cloud base. In the first event (Case 1) it was observed that all four subsequent negative strokes were initiated by recoil leaders that retraced one horizontal channel segment previously ionized by the positive leader. Those recoil leaders connected to the original vertical channel segment and propagated toward ground, producing four subsequent strokes that had the same ground contact point as the original positive discharge. The second event (Case 2), in contrast, presented 15 subsequent strokes that were initiated by recoil leaders that did not reach the original channel of the <b>positive</b> <b>stroke.</b> They diverged vertically toward ground, making contact approximately 11 km away from the original positive strike point. These results constitute the first optical evidence that both single- and multiple-channel bipolar flashes occur as a consequence of recoil leader activity in the branches of the initial positive return stroke.

40|$|Background and purpose: Recent {{innovations}} such as CT-installation in ambulances {{may lead}} to earlier start of stroke specific treatments. However, such technically complex mobile facilities require effective methods of correctly identifying patients before deployment. We aimed to develop and validate a new dispatcher identification algorithm for stroke emergencies (DIASE). Methods: DIASE was informed by systematic qualitative analysis {{of the content of}} emergency calls to ambulance dispatchers for patients with stroke or TIA (N= 117), other neurological (N= 39) and non-neurological (N= 51) diseases (Part A). After training of dispatchers, sensitivity and predictive values were determined prospectively in patients admitted to Charité hospitals by using the discharge diagnosis as reference standard (Part B). Results: Part A: Dysphasic/dysarthric symptoms (33 %), unilateral symptoms (22 %) and explicitly stated suspicion of stroke (47 %) were typically identified in stroke patients but infrequently in non-stroke cases (all < 10 %). Convulsive symptoms (41 %) were frequent in other neurological diseases but not strokes (3 %). Pain (26 %) and breathlessness (31 %) were often expressed in non-neurological emergencies (6 % and 7 % in strokes). Part B: Between Oct 15 and Dec 16, 2010, 5, 774 patients were admitted via ambulance with 246 coded with final stroke diagnoses. Sensitivity of DIASE for detecting stroke was 53. 3 % and positive predictive value was 47. 8 % for stroke and 59. 1 % for stroke and TIA.

In this work we used the Israeli Lightning Location System ground strokes data set, between October 2004 and December 2010, for studying the properties of lightning strokes and their link to the thermodynamic conditions in each synoptic system. It is shown that lightning activity dominates over sea during WCL and FCL systems (with maximum values of 1. 5 in WCL, and 2. 2 km − 2 day − 1 in FCL) and have a dominant component over land during the RST and RST-CL days. The stronger instability (high Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 762 ± 457 J kg − 1) during RST-CL days together with the higher altitude of the clouds' mixed-phase region (3. 6 ± 0. 3 km), result in a slightly higher density of ground strokes during this system but a lower fraction of <b>positive</b> ground <b>strokes</b> (3 ± 0. 5 %). In general the fraction of <b>positive</b> <b>strokes</b> was found to be inversely correlated with the sea surface temperature: it increases from 1. 2 % in early fall to 17. 7 % in late winter, during FCL and WCL days. This change could be linked to the variation in the charge center's vertical location during those months. The diurnal cycle in the lightning activity was examined for each synoptic system. During WCL conditions, no preferred times were found through the day, {{as it relates to the}} random passage timing of the frontal systems over the study region. During the fall systems (FCL and RST-CL) there is a peak in lightning activity during the morning hours, probably related to the enhanced convection driven by the convergence between the eastern land breeze and the western synoptic winds. The distributions of peak currents in FCL and WCL systems also change from fall to winter and include more strong negative and <b>positive</b> <b>strokes</b> toward the end of the winter...|$|R

This is consistent with other studies in the contiguous US (Orville and Huffines 1999). Brook et al. (1982) attributed the increase in positive strikes to wind shear during winter thunderstorms where positive leaders from the horizontally separated upper positive charge region are not intercepted by the lower negative charge. Because negative lightning strikes are 14 times as numerous as positive strikes and up to 40 % of them have long continuing currents, the distribution of negative strikes has a disproportional effect on fire ignitions. The {{proportion of}} <b>positive</b> <b>strokes</b> was less in the Southeastern Deserts bioregion, probably because most of the lightning there comes from summer thunderstorms.

The average number of ground contacts for CG flashes is 1. 7 and for +CG flahes is only 1. 1. Although all subsequent <b>positive</b> <b>strokes</b> in multiple-stroke flashes created a new termination on ground in negative this occurs only in 50 % of the cases. Although positive and negative leaders have the same average speed when travelling towards ground, the positive leaders accelerate.

Recoil leaders are selfpropagating, negative leaders that move along previously developed paths of the positively charged portions of bidirectional leaders.

They usually occur inside the cloud during CG flashes but may be observed during the propagation of positive leaders that come to ground in +CG flashes. Continuing current (CC), the continuous mode of charge transfer to ground in a cloud-to-ground lightning, are apparently responsible for most serious heating damage, mainly if they have long duration. Long continuing current (duration greater than 40 ms) are present in aproximately 70 % of the +CG flashes but only in about 30 % of the negative flashes...|$|R
40|$|Lightning strokes {{are known}} to cause direct heating and {{ionization}} of the D region, {{some of which are}} detected via scattering of VLF transmitter signals and are known as Early VLF events. The disturbed ionosphere typically recovers in many tens of seconds. New experimental evidence is presented demonstrating that the scattering pattern and onset amplitude of Early VLF events are strongly related to both the magnitude and polarity of causative lightning peak current. Observations of Early VLF events at nine Stanford VLF receiver sites across the continental United States are combined with lightning geolocation data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). During January and March 2011, NLDN recorded 7769 intense lightning discharges with high peak currents (> 100 kA) generating 1250 detected Early VLF events. We show that the size of the scattered field due to the ionospheric disturbance increases with the peak current intensity of the causative lightning discharge. The most intense peak currents of >+ 200 and <− 250 kA disturb VLF transmitter signals as far as ∼ 400 km away from the lightning stroke. Early VLF event detection probability also increases rapidly with peak current intensity. On the other hand, the observed VLF amplitude change is not significantly dependent on the peak current intensity. Stroke polarity is also important, with <b>positive</b> <b>strokes</b> being ∼ 5 times more likely to generate Early VLF disturbances than negative strokes of the same intensity.

Successfully pulling a stroke is often seen in a <b>positive</b> light and <b>stroke</b> pullers are often commended or thought of highly, even if the act involved illegal activities or serious rule-bending, and are sometimes seen as loveable rogues.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the CS/LAB project was to obtain images of cloud to {{stratosphere}} lightning discharges from aboard NASA's DC- 8 Airborne Laboratory while flying {{in the vicinity of}} thunderstorms over the Amazon Basin. We devised a low light level imaging package as an add-on experiment to an airborne Laboratory deployment to South America during May-June, 1993. We were not successful in obtaining the desired images during the South American deployment. However, in a follow up flight over the American Midwest during the night of July 8 - 9, 1993 we recorded nineteen examples of the events over intense thunderstorms. From the observations were estimated absolute brightness, terminal altitudes, flash duration, horizontal extents, emission volumes, and frequencies relative to negative and <b>positive</b> ground <b>strokes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper explores US {{entrepreneurial}} {{history and}} public budgets from President Eisenhower’s election in 1952 until {{the beginning of}} the Obama administration 2008. A mix of market forces, structural changes and a tendency toward unfettered capitalism [1] challenge diagnosis. This analysis examines these complexities with 216 business quarters of economic history. It also pro-vides a mathematical model to characterize in broad <b>strokes</b> <b>positive</b> governance modeling for business. This work is important as economic growth ensures a nation’s ability to protect its citi-zens...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{recognized}} that a specialized multidisciplinary team, {{focusing on the}} care of stroke patients, leads to lower mortality and better outcomes. The <b>positive</b> effect of <b>stroke</b> units {{in regard to the}} outcome of stroke patients seems {{to be related to the}} careful monitoring of clinical parameters and clinical emergencies. The monitoring of physiological parameters in the acute phase of stroke can be considered an important management tool that can improve significantly the quality of care provided. It allows timely detection and correction of complications and consequently has a beneficial effect on outcome...|$|R
50|$|The largest scale sparks {{are those}} {{produced}} naturally by lightning. An average bolt of negative lightning carries a current of 30 to 50 kiloamperes, transfers {{a charge of}} 5 coulombs, and dissipates 500 megajoules of energy (120 kg TNT equivalent, or enough to light a 100-watt light bulb for approximately 2 months). However, an average bolt of positive lightning (from {{the top of a}} thunderstorm) may carry a current of 300 to 500 kiloamperes, transfer a charge of up to 300 coulombs, have a potential difference up to 1 gigavolt (a billion volts), and may dissipate 300 GJ of energy (72 tons TNT, or enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb for up to 95 years). A negative lightning strike typically lasts for only tens of microseconds, but multiple strikes are common. A <b>positive</b> lightning <b>stroke</b> is typically a single event. However, the larger peak current may flow for hundreds of milliseconds, making it considerably hotter and more dangerous than negative lightning.|$|R
50|$|Gujarat won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. But Gujarat saw a {{collapse}} in the top order as Pankaj Singh and Siddarth Kaul packed off the top three run getters of 2016-17 Ranji Trophy in the first session. Pankaj hassled Samit Gohel in the first over of the match with a scrambled sequence of inswingers and outswingers. Priyank Panchal, the highest run-scorer in the Ranji Trophy, and Dhruv Raval (39) restored calm with some <b>positive</b> <b>strokes</b> {{during the course of}} their 55-run partnership. It took a fine delivery from Pankaj to dislodge Panchal - the ball pitched on middle and off and seamed away and the outside edge was caught by Karun Nair at first slip. In the penultimate over before lunch, Parthiv attempted to punch Kaul off the back foot, but the ball was closer to his body than he anticipated and the resultant inside-edge found the stumps. In the first over of the second session, Raval, who had played a few attacking shots in the morning, dangled his bat at an away-going delivery from Kaul and was caught behind. Things looked dire for Gujarat at 82 for 4, but Juneja and Gandhi stood strong to post a partnership. The run-rate, too, trickled past three as they completed their 50-run partnership in 67 balls. But Gujarat lost momentum once again, as Pujara introduced part-time offspinner Akhil Herwadkar to bowl the last over before tea, and he struck with his second delivery. Juneja went back to a short ball and punched uppishly off the backfoot but picked out Pujara at short cover. Rest of India made a few fielding lapses in the final session, as Kaul and Karun dropped straightforward chances offered by Karan Patel and Mohit Thadani respectively. Kaul, who hurt his ring finger on his right hand while attempting the catch and went off the field, returned to make amends by dismissing Thadani. Gandhi eventually got to his hundred off 125 balls in the company of the tail. An over earlier, though, Chintan Gaja was caught off a deflection off the keepers pads and held by Manoj Tiwary at first slip, but umpire Virender Sharma turned it down. Pankaj returned to have Gaja trapped in front.|$|R
