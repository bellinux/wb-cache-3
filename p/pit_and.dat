5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below. The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E
5|$|Old Gotham, {{the section}} of Gotham City which will become the Arkham City prison, is not yet walled off and has slums, low buildings, a {{shopping}} mall and docks (where Penguin's ship, the Final Offer, is moored). On the Final Offer, Penguin has added a casino, a fighting <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> a sales floor with weapons and ammunition.

5|$|The BBC {{were also}} {{pleased with the}} success of The Quatermass Experiment and in 1955 a sequel, Quatermass II, was broadcast, with John Robinson in the title role {{following}} Tate's death.

The character returned to television in a 1979 serial, simply titled Quatermass, for Thames Television.|$|E
40|$|Sealing of <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> {{fissures}} {{depends on}} patient- and tooth factors. Prevention of occlusal carious is indicated {{for children with}} a high caries risk and especially when the morphology makes teeth more susceptible for developing caries (deep <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> fissures). Good occlusal caries diagnosis is difficult and a golden standard does not exist. When sealing of <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> fissures is indicated a preventive or a therapeutic approach can be chosen. A generally accepted guideline for sealing is still missing. Every approach has its advantages and disadvantages and depends on the individual operator...|$|R

40|$|Extracting {{drainage}} networks from raster DEMs is {{a necessary}} requirement in almost all hydrological and environmental analyses and determining surface water flow direction is a fundamental problem. In a raster environment, surface water flow direction of each cell can be directed to the neighboring cell with the steepest downslope drop (The basic D 8, deterministic eight-neighbour method), which is inadequate for routing flow over <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> flats. Several improved algorithms are proposed to find the outlet of <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> flats, which typically use entirely different procedures for processing <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> flats. Being different from others, this paper presents a new method to route flow through the <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> flats by searching for the outlet using the heuristic information to compensate inadequate searching information of other methods. Heuristic information can reveal the general trend of the DEM and help the proposed algorithm find the outlet of <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> flats accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can handle <b>pits</b> <b>and</b> flats effectively in one procedure. This new algorithm is implemented in Pascal and experiments are carried out on actual DEM data. It {{can be seen from}} the comparison of the drainage networks generated by the proposed algorithm and ArcGIS 9. 2, the proposed algorithm with heuristic information can get a closer match result with existing river networks and avoid the generation of the unrealistic parallel drainage lines, unreal drainage lines and spurious terrain features...|$|R
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} about a sequel being developed to Uprising, Sakurai confirmed {{that there was}} no sequel planned for the game. Uprising was the only game Project Sora ever produced; just four months after the game's release, it was announced that the studio had closed down with no explanation was given for the closure, while Sakurai and Sora Ltd. were working on the next entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. Pit returned from Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, while fellow Kid Icarus characters Dark <b>Pit</b> <b>and</b> Palutena were also introduced as playable characters. The games' Classic Mode also incorporate a difficulty slider similar to the Fiend's Cauldron in Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Later, Kate {{appears as}} part of Batman and Robin: Blackest Knight. Batwoman is kidnapped by cultists and taken to London in order for her to once again be sacrificed. She is sealed within a coffin and taken {{underground}} to the last remaining Lazarus Pit {{in order for the}} ritual to begin. She is saved by the timely intervention of Dick Grayson and British superheroes Knight and Squire. After learning that Grayson plans on placing Bruce Wayne's corpse into the pit in order to revive him, Kate strongly protests, but he simply ignores her. True to Kate's warnings, Bruce (in reality an insane clone created by Darkseid) emerges from the <b>Pit</b> <b>and</b> attacks the heroes. As the battle takes place, the cultists who kidnapped Kate detonate explosives surrounding the Pit, causing a massive cave-in. Grayson discovers Kate, buried alive and with extensive injury to her spine and legs, and tries to help her. Kate is healed after being placed inside the <b>Pit,</b> <b>and</b> she returns to Gotham with the others. Before leaving to return to her home, Grayson flirts with Kate by telling her that he has a thing for red-haired crime-fighters (a reference to his previous love interests, Barbara Gordon and Starfire), apparently unaware of Kate's sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Several {{changes were}} made during the renovation. The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the orchestra <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, state, or local funds.|$|E
5|$|The Corsica and Elba mines {{remained}} the chief {{source of employment}} until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted into an open <b>pit,</b> <b>and</b> {{the future of the}} town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again.|$|E

The Astley area encompasses smaller, suburban and semi-outlying areas, including Blackmoor, Astley Green, Gin <b>Pit</b> <b>and</b> Cross Hillock. The isolated hamlet of terraced houses at Gin Pit was built by the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company. Peace Street, Lord Street and Maden Street were named after directors of the company.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} sports and {{recreational}} grounds {{located on the}} river course or gravel <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> artificial lakes adjacent to the Sava. Tacen Whitewater Course, located on the right bank of the Sava in Tacen suburb of Ljubljana, was built as a permanent kayaking course in 1948. It hosts a major international competition almost every year, examples being the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in 1955, 1991, and 2010. In Zagreb, Jarun complex of lakes along the river course offers a range of facilities for swimming, water sports and cycling. The island of Ada Ciganlija in Belgrade is the major recreational zone of the city, gathering as much as 100,000 visitors daily in summer months.|$|E
5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the <b>pit</b> <b>and</b> eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E
