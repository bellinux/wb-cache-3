5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E

40|$|This study {{intends to}} {{provide insight into}} {{pedestrian}} accidents by uncovering their patterns in order to design preventive measures and to allocate resources for identified problems. Kohonen neural networks are applied to a database of pedestrian fatal accidents occurred during the four-year period between 2003 and 2006. Results show the existence of five pedestrian accident patterns: (i) elderly <b>pedestrians</b> <b>crossing</b> on crosswalks mostly far from intersections in metropolitan areas; (ii) <b>pedestrians</b> <b>crossing</b> suddenly or from hidden places and colliding with two-wheel vehicles on urban road sections; (iii) male <b>pedestrians</b> <b>crossing</b> at night and being hit by four-wheel vehicles on rural road sections; (iv) young male <b>pedestrians</b> <b>crossing</b> at night wide road sections in both urban and rural areas; (v) children and teenagers crossing road sections in small rural communities.

25|$|As part of {{a project}} to {{regenerate}} Bletchley as a whole, Milton Keynes Council has proposed {{the creation of a}} new eastern pedestrian access to the station by extending the existing platform overbridge across the tracks to reach Saxon Street. The proposed eastern entrance is to open out into a new station square and a transport interchange where an at-grade <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing</b> across Saxon Street would give access to the town centre and bus station. In the longer term it is planned to construct an underground concourse to link the eastern and western station entrances.|$|E

25|$|The traffic light, {{also known}} as traffic signal, is a {{signaling}} device positioned at a road intersection, <b>pedestrian</b> <b>crossing,</b> or other location. Its purpose is to indicate, using a series of colors, the correct moment to stop, drive, ride or walk, using a universal color code. The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing right of way, where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right. In Salt Lake City, Utah, policeman Lester Wire invented the first red-green electric traffic lights.|$|E
