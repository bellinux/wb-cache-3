The NMR signal amplitude is proportional to the quantity of hydrogen nuclei present in a formation and can be calibrated to give a value for porosity that is free from lithology effects. Uniquely, a <b>petrophysicist</b> can also analyse the rate of decay of the NMR signal amplitude to obtain information on the permeability of the formation - a crucial quantity in hydrocarbon exploration.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} mechanism affecting NMR relaxation is grain-surface relaxation. [...] Molecules in fluids are in constant Brownian motion, diffusing about the pore space and {{bouncing off the}} grain surfaces. Upon interaction with the grain surface, hydrogen protons can transfer some nuclear spin energy to the grain (contributing to T1 relaxation) or irreversibley dephase (contributing to T2 relaxation). Therefore the speed of relaxation most significantly depends on how often the hydrogen nuclei collide with the grain surface and this {{is controlled by the}} surface-to-volume ratio of the pore in which the nuclei are located. Collisions are less frequent in larger pores, resulting in a slower decay of the NMR signal amplitude and allowing a <b>petrophysicist</b> to understand the distribution of pore sizes.|$|E

The property of porous media {{is closely related to}} its mineralogy, texture and granulometry. These in turn are the functions of the depositional environment and the postdepositional activities like cementation, digenesis, fracturing and dissolution which might have effect on the rock after formation (Fitch et al. 2013; Zett et al. 2010).

30|$|Shale is type of clastic {{sedimentary}} rock comprised dominantly of clay minerals and other clay size fragments contains some silt-sized grains of quartz and feldspar, but other minerals may contain organic frags of source rock. Shale is a fissile rock that splits along bedding planes but claystone has a massive appearance and not fissile. Shales can cause complications for the <b>petrophysicist</b> {{because they are}} generally conductive and may therefore mask the high-resistance characteristic of hydrocarbons (Toby 2005).

40|$|About 10 % of the {{drilling}} costs (which {{are in the}} order of 107 – 108 $ per well) can be ascribed to mechanical instability of the rock surrounding the borehole. Losses {{in the order of}} similar amounts may be encountered if solids production becomes a problem. In fact, lack of mechanical stability of the rocks that makes up the hydrocarbon reservoirs and the formations above may effectually prohibit hydrocarbon production in some cases. Rock mechanics is also a key issue for reservoir compaction, which may have a strong impact {{on the development of the}} reservoir pressure and permeability during depletion. In some cases, surface subsidence is also a problem. Rock mechanics is also an important element in the planning of stimulation and IOR operations. For the <b>petrophysicist,</b> rock mechanics plays an important role in two ways: 1. Petrophysical measurements are affected by the mechanical state of the rock in which the measurements are done. 2. Prediction of sanding problems, borehole instabilities, reservoir compaction etc. require geomechanical data, which to some extent may be derived from petrophysical measurements, or obtained by similar methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Volcanic {{lithology}} and lithofacies {{are important}} factors {{to control the}} formation of volcanic reservoir. It is a challenge for geologists and <b>petrophysicist</b> to identify lithofacies in the borehole by using well logs. According to the reservoir characters of Daqing volcanic reservoir in Songliao basin, five lithofacies and fifteen sub-facies have been recognized through the drilled core analysis of lithology, texture and structure. The relationship between conventional well logs and volcanic lithology can be established by calibrating with core analysis {{which can be used}} to identify the rock composition by the established cross-plots. From the FMI measurement, the differences of resistivity values caused by volcanic rock texture and structure can be showed in the image clearly. It shows that four kinds of textures and five kinds of structure can be identified with FMI image. As the volcanic lithofacies marks, specific volcanics lithology, texture and structure corresponds to the specific lithofacies and sub-facies. So lithofacies distribution can be evaluated effectively with the model of volcanics texture and structure combined with rock composition. The results of study indicate that the composition, texture and structure characteristics of the volcanics can be identified by conventional log with FMI measurement, which is important to the further volcanic reservoir exploration and production. ...|$|E

[...] Some of the key properties studied in petrophysics are lithology, porosity, water saturation, permeability and density. A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring well log measurements - in which a string of measurement tools are inserted in the borehole, core measurements - in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface, and seismic measurements. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.|$|R

30|$|<b>Petrophysicists</b> {{normally}} use well logs data {{in oil and}} {{gas industry}} to identify pore fluids and mark fluid contacts at reservoir level, which {{is an essential part of}} reserves estimation and economics. During hydrocarbon exploration, explorers look for a subsurface structure with high porosity because the hydrocarbon tends to accumulate in these structures. Normally spots, where hydrocarbon accumulates, have relatively low acoustic velocity, density, and AI. These are good indicators of the presence of hydrocarbon. This study investigates the effects of pore fluids on seismic data in order to characterize the pore fluid. Characterization of fluids at reservoir level by using seismic data in the absence of well logs data could be a very helpful tool in the development of new oil and gas fields. It could also help in reserves estimation before drilling new wells and will increase the chances of success.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due {{to limited}} {{understanding}} of many diagenetic processes which contributes to petroleum quality determination, mathematical models {{become a very}} useful tool to improve understanding of these processes and to improve reservoir quality predictions prior drilling. Especially for reservoir engineers and <b>petrophysicists</b> the distribution of porosity and permeability are very important in the formation evaluation and definition of recovery strategies and evaluation of reservoir quality. In this context, we have developed an artificial neural network based model to predict macroporosity of sandstones reservoir systems. We have used a score to quantify the importance of each feature in prediction process. This score allows creating progressive enhancement neural models, which are simpler and more accurate than conventional neural network models and multiple regressions. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the building of a reduced model just with the most relevant features to macroporosity prediction. A dataset, containing petrographic and petrophysical characteristics, containing samples of the same formation sandstone reservoir was investigated. Study results show that progressive enhancement neural network is able to predict macroporosity with accuracy near 90 %, suggesting that this technique is a valuable tool for reservoir quality prediction...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is an effort to}} help <b>petrophysicists</b> and reservoir engineers in improving reservoir characterization. Magnetic susceptibility techniques were used for prediction of important reservoir parameters in hydrocarbon sedimentary sequences. For the first time ever I have shown that the grain lining hematite cement surrounding quartz grains has significant control on permeability in hydrocarbon bearing reservoir rock samples. This work also shows that {{it is not only the}} dispersed hematite and clay minerals in a reservoir rock matrix that control permeability, but also that the grain lining hematite has additional and dominant control on permeability. In addition, for the first time ever, magnetic susceptibility techniques have been applied on core samples from relatively tight gas sandstone reservoirs. Such techniques were previously known to have been used in only conventional clastic reservoirs. Magnetic hysteresis measurements were used to show that the permeability is dependent on hematite content and independent of hematite particle size. Identifying and Evaluating faults and fluid contact in hydrocarbon bearing reservoir rocks are challenging tasks. The work {{presented in}} this thesis has shown for the first time that raw magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on drill cuttings can be used to detect faults and fluid contacts in sedimentary sequences. Such measurements can be performed at well site, thereby enabling companies to make important field development decisions quickly. Additionally, a series of novel crossplots have been developed between magnetic susceptibility and various wireline log data for determination of mineralogy, mixture porosity and mineral quantification. These crossplots are similar in format to standard industry charts, which provide a further tool for improved petrophysical characterization using rapid, non-destructive magnetic susceptibility measurement...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of {{electrical}} resistivity logs in organic-rich source rocks has been challenging for <b>petrophysicists.</b> Conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models (e. g., Archie?s, Dual-Water, and Waxman-Smits equations) assume that saline {{water is the}} only conductive part of the formation. However, this assumption is not reliable in organic-rich source rocks {{in the presence of}} highly mature organic matter, clay, and pyrite. Previous experimental studies indicate that aromaticity of kerogen increases with an increase in thermal maturity, which might lead to conductive behavior of kerogen. In this thesis, I investigated and quantified the effect of conductive kerogen on electrical resistivity of organic-rich source rocks. First, I investigated the reliability of conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models in the assessment of fluid saturations in organic-rich source rocks using well logs and core measurements in the Haynesville shale-gas formation. Next, I numerically simulated electric field, electric currents, and electrical resistivity of pore-scale images of organic-rich source rocks. I quantified the effect of (a) volumetric concentration of kerogen, (b) kerogen conductivity, and (c) spatial connectivity of kerogen-water network on electrical resistivity of rocks using pore-scale numerical simulations. Well-log interpretation of the Haynesville shale-gas formation showed conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models underestimate hydrocarbon saturation by 20 % - 40 % in the zones with high volumetric concentration of kerogen. In this thesis, I showed that the error in estimates of hydrocarbon saturation could be due to the impact of kerogen on electrical resistivity measurements. Pore-scale numerical simulations confirmed that conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models could lead to 10 % - 23 % improvement in estimates of hydrocarbon saturation if the impact of conductive kerogen is taken into account. Results of this thesis act as the first step towards improving conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models for estimation of fluid saturations in organic-rich source rocks...|$|R

On the other hand, reservoir quality as well as reservoir classification could be performed based on these data correlation. The Szolnok Formation is composed mainly of turbidity elastic deposits while siltstones are intercalated by sandstone beds and streaks of marls. In the present study, 213 core samples are obtained from the Szolnok Formation of the Great Hungarian plain, Hungary. Both horizontal and vertical permeability are measured. The Szolnok Formation has two main lithologic groups: 1. clean sandstone (141 samples) and 2. siltstone – marl (72 samples), it can easily differentiate between good, intermediate or even bad reservoirs. Acoustic laboratory measurements have been carried out for only 30 sandstone rock samples parallel to the bedding plane (horizontal). This paper aims to evaluate some petrophysical relationships. On the other hand, both Wyllie and Raymer models were applied for porosity estimation from seismic velocity. It is worthy to mention that reservoir diagnosis of the Szolnok Formation was our target as well. Both the porosity and permeability variation range characterizing the detected lithologic facies of the Szolnok Formation are useful for reservoir zonation. The relationship between helium and mercury porosity for whole studied samples and sandstone samples as well, are supported by a high correlation coefficient and allow its application for prediction of porosity while it reduces costs and time of laboratory measurements. The evaluation of different calculated equations for porosity from compressional wave velocity data of the Szolnok Formation are studied and the relationship between velocity and porosity displays a clear inverse trend. The comparison between laboratory porosity and sonic derived porosity shows that the values determined by Wyllie and Raymer equations are not applicable to predict it from velocity data...|$|R

However, the NMR responses in complex formations, such as fractured carbonate and organicrich mudrocks, have not been thoroughly investigated. NMR pore-scale simulations using a random-walk algorithm enable us to model the NMR relaxometry in porous rock samples, and to improve interpretation of NMR relaxometry in complex formations. Based on pore-scale simulations and theoretical analysis of NMR relaxometry, this research estimated petrophysical properties that have been challenging when using conventional NMR interpretation, including micro-fracture volumetric concentration, directional pore connectivity and directional permeability, and the impact of wettability alteration. This dissertation (a) quantified the impacts of micro-fractures on NMR relaxation times by pore-scale simulations and developed an analytical model for fracture-pore diffusional coupling in multiple-pore-type systems (i. e. composed of intra-/inter-granular pores and micro-fractures); (b) investigated the viability of using the NMR analytical model to estimate the volumetric concentrations and apertures of micro-fractures in fractured formations; (c) developed an innovative NMR-based directional permeability model to estimate anisotropic permeability of rock samples with complex pore structure; (d) investigated the impacts of fracturepore diffusional coupling on NMR permeability assessment and evaluated reliability of NMR permeability models in fractured formations; and (e) developed a two-phase NMR pore-scale simulation method to model the NMR responses in organicrich mudrocks, as well as investigated the impact of wettability alteration on NMR relaxometry in organic-rich mudrocks. The methods used in this research include pore-scale image processing, single-phase and two-phase NMR simulations in porous media, fluid flow simulations in porous media, and theoretical analysis of NMR relaxation mechanisms in porous media.

40|$|DOI: 10. 17014 /ijog. v 1 i 2. 181 The {{carbonate}} on Fika Field has {{a special}} character, because it grew above a basement high with the thickness and internal character variation. To develop the field, a proper geological model {{which can be used}} in reservoir simulation was needed. This model has to represent the complexity of the rock type and the variety of oil types among the clusters. Creating this model was challenging due to the heterogeneity of the Baturaja Formation (BRF) : Early Miocene reef, carbonate platform, and breccia conglomerate grew up above the basement with a variety of thickness and quality distributions. The reservoir thickness varies between 23 - 600 ft and 3 D seismic frequency ranges from 1 - 80 Hz with 25 Hz dominant frequency. Structurally, the Fika Field has a high basement slope, which has an impact on the flow unit layering slope. Based on production data, each area shows different characteristics and performance: some areas have high water cut and low cumulative production. Oil properties from several clusters also vary in wax content. The wax content can potentially build up a deposit inside tubing and flow-line, resulted in a possible disturbance to the operation. Five well cores were analyzed, including thin section and XRD. Seven check-shot data and 3 D seismic Pre-Stack Time Migration (PSTM) were available with limited seismic resolution. A seismic analysis was done after well seismic tie was completed. This analysis included paleogeography, depth structure map, and distribution of reservoir and basement. Core and log data generated facies carbonate distribution and rock typing, defining properties for log analysis and permeability prediction for each zone. An Sw prediction for each well was created by J-function analysis. This elaborates capillary pressure from core data, so it is very similar to the real conditions. Different stages of the initial model were done i. e. scale-up properties, data analysis, variogram modeling, and then the properties were distributed using the geostatistic method. Finally, after G&G collaborated with <b>petrophysicists</b> and reservoir engineers to complete their integrated analysis, a geological model was finally created. After that, material balance was needed to confirm reserve calculations. The result of OOIP (Original Oil in Place) and OGIP (Original Gas in Place) were confirmed, because it was similar to the production data and reservoir pressure. The model was then ready to be used in reservoir simulation.  </p...|$|R
