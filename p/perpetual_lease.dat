25|$|As {{discussed}} above, the Meiji {{government was}} unwilling to allow foreigners to own land, and instead lent it to them on a <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease.</b> These leases continued even after {{the return of the}} settlement to Japan, but Japan began a policy of taxing the buildings on the land. The foreigners were opposed to this {{on the grounds that they}} were already being taxed on the land itself, and so were being subjected to double taxation, and in 1902 the Japanese government presented the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In 1905, Japan's plea was discarded, and Japan was disallowed from levying any taxes on buildings on the land under <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although Labour {{had split}} with its more militant faction, (who {{went on to}} form various socialist parties) it {{maintained}} what were at the time radical socialist policies. Labour's 'Usehold' policy on land was in essence the replacement of freehold tenure by a system of <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease</b> from the state, with all land transfer conducted through the state (the full nationalisation of farmland). This policy was unpopular with voters and was dropped by Labour, along with other more radical policies, throughout the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|From the Taishō era {{until the}} early Shōwa era, many Japanese firms and banks {{advanced}} into the former foreign settlement, which developed as a business district. Meanwhile, foreign trading companies declined {{around the time of}} the First World War. Real estate owned by Germans in particular, whose country opposed Japan in the war, was forcibly sold to Japanese, and German firms within the former settlement were succeeded by Japanese ones. By 1931, only 47 of 126 lots in the former foreign settlement were still under <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease</b> to foreigners.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{legislation}} was enacted {{to grant the}} National Association <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease</b> of the grounds, at that time comprising just under 20 acres.

Also erected in 1928 were show pavilions for General Motors Pty Ltd, Brisbane Cars & Tractors Ltd, the Vacuum Oil Co.

25|$|By June 1846 {{the company}} had {{negotiated}} an alternative arrangement with the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. Under the terms of this agreement, the railway company took out a <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease</b> of the canal at an annual rent of £6,605, which amounted to £2.50 per share, and was broadly equivalent to the dividend paid by the canal company prior to 1840. They also made a payment of £60,000, to cover all outstanding debts of the canal company. A bill to authorise the takeover of both the Macclesfield Canal and the Peak Forest Canal was sought and obtained in late 1846. The final meeting of the canal company took place on 15 July 1847, although it remained as a legal entity until 1883, to manage the rents. The railway company began selling water from the canal {{as soon as it}} took over.|$|E

500|$|Land tenure {{has been}} an issue since first {{settlement}} as island residents repeatedly requested freehold title or an absolute gift of cultivated land. Original settlers were squatters. The granting of a [...] lease to Richard Armstrong in 1878 drew complaints and a few short-term leases ("permissive occupancies") were granted. In 1913, with {{the appointment of a}} Board of Control, permissive occupancies were revoked and the Board itself given permissive occupancy of the island. Then the Lord Howe Island Act 1953 made all land the property of the Crown. Direct descendants of islanders with permissive occupancies in 1913 were granted <b>perpetual</b> <b>leases</b> on blocks of up to [...] for residential purposes. Short-term special leases were granted for larger areas used for agriculture, so in 1955, fifty-five <b>perpetual</b> <b>leases</b> and 43 special leases were granted. The 1981 amendment to the act extended political and land rights to all residents of 10 years or more. There remains an active debate concerning the proportion of residents with tenure and the degree of influence on the Board of resident islanders in relation to long-term planning for visitors, and issues relating to the environment, amenity and global heritage.|$|R
25|$|The Opium War was ostensibly {{fought to}} liberalise trade with China. With {{a base in}} Hong Kong, British traders, opium dealers, and merchants {{including}} Jardine Matheson & Co. and Dent & Co. launched the city which would become the 'free trade' nexus of the East. American opium traders and merchant bankers such as the Russell, Perkins and Forbes families would soon join the trade. On signature of the 1860 Convention of Beijing, which {{marked the end of}} formal ended hostilities in the Second Opium War (1856–1858), Britain acquired the area south of Boundary Street on the Kowloon Peninsula rent-free under a <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease.</b> Later, in 1898, the Qing government reluctantly agreed to the Convention between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory (also known as the Second Convention of Peking) that compelled China to cede a further area north of Boundary Street to the Sham Chun River along with more than two hundred nearby islands. Seen by the British government as vital to safeguard the defensive capabilities of Hong Kong, these areas became collectively known as the New Territories. The 99-year lease would expire at midnight on 30June, 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Ellesmere Canal and Chester Canal {{companies}} had amalgamated {{to become the}} Ellesmere and Chester Canal company in 1813, and on 8 May 1845, an Act of Parliament authorised amalgamation with the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal. The Ellesmere and Chester name was retained for the joint company, but plans were already being made {{for the idea of}} the Shropshire Union Canal. By July, these plans had crystallised. The Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal network would become part of the new company. A number of new railways were proposed, and parts of the canal network would be converted to railways, but the canal link from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge was to be retained as a waterway. The company became the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, and Acts to authorise three of the new railways were passed in 1846. The new company was independent for less than a year, as the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) offered them a <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease</b> in 1846, which was formalised by Act of Parliament in June 1847, although it was not fully implemented until March 1857.|$|E
2500|$|The Meiji government, {{which was}} unwilling to allow foreigners to own land, {{classified}} the area instead as under <b>perpetual</b> <b>lease,</b> and the leaseholders were decided by auction.

About half of the profits from the auction were absorbed by the government, while the remainder was accumulated for operating expenses by the , which the government acknowledged as the highest deciding body in the settlement's government. The self-government of the settlement by its residents continued [...] until the foreign settlement was abolished. The settlement enjoyed 30 years of smooth operation, and relations were generally good between the foreign and Japanese sides. However, it was forbidden for Japanese to live within the foreign settlement, and their entrance to it was also restricted.|$|E

He divided the estate into parcels and granted tenants <b>perpetual</b> <b>leases</b> at moderate rates of about {{one percent of the}} land's output. Eventually, about 900 farms of 150 acres were established. The solution greatly increased the productivity for the land and generated large economic benefit for the entire Albany area.|$|R
