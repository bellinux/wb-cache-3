Well, I wrote her a letter. Not just an {{ordinary}} letter; dear me, no. I took a whole day to write it, and you should have seen the <b>postmistress's</b> eyes stick out when I mailed it. I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away. I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could.

40|$|My thesis {{deals with}} the {{experience}} of <b>postmistresses,</b> female telegraphists and unpaid female &# 147;assistants&# 148; in the New South Wales (N. S. W.) postal and telegraph utilities from 1838, and in the Commonwealth Postmaster-General&# 146;s Department from 1901 to 1938. In the work I examine the system of patronage that provided for women in financial distress, as well as the &# 147;sedentary&# 148; nature of postal work. In addition, I attempt to explain how female official employees in N. S. W. came to be granted equal pay with males. My research includes an analysis of the reasons why they failed to take an active part in the Victorian-led campaign from 1900 for wage equality under the federal government, and an investigation of the decline in employment prospects from the early 20 th century. Lastly, I discuss the changing status of women who managed allowance/non-official postal outlets in the name of male office-holders, and plot the evolution of the female-run postal facility over time. Over the course of 100 years, the fortunes of female post and telegraph employees in N. S. W. waxed and waned episodically. From the late 1830 s, the system of influence furnished needy, &# 147;respectable&# 148; women with a socially acceptable vocation. Thanks to their &# 147;immobility&# 148;, they gained a foothold in the postal service at a time when working men were largely unsuited to sedentary occupations because of their migratory habits. Equal pay from the early 1860 s set female official employees in N. S. W. apart from their peers elsewhere in Australia. The N. S. W. women were arguably incapable of proving themselves the equal of their male co-workers and their female colleagues in Victoria, preventing them from fully participating in the merit-base quest for wage parity under the Commonwealth. By the 1930 s equal pay had taken a toll on employee numbers. Even so, women continued to find positions in allowance/non-official post offices, regardless of veteran preference provisions. Gradually, the postal bureaucracy began to treat allowance <b>postmistresses</b> and unpaid female &# 147;assistants&# 148; as workers in their own right, given their enhanced financial and social standing. The character of female-operated post offices changed over the century. Initially private or &# 145;domestic&# 146; domains, many outlets became public or wholly commercial spaces in response to shifting economic and social circumstances...|$|R
25|$|Montgomery taught {{agriculture}} at Haughton High School in Haughton in Bossier Parish east of Shreveport. At {{that time}} he met Azalee Wilson (1902-1985), the <b>postmistress</b> at Haughton. After three years in Haughton, Montgomery moved to Ruston, the seat of Lincoln Parish, where he taught vocational agriculture at Ruston High School. He received many honors for his teaching abilities and his love and dedication for his students. He was also known to paddle recalcitrant boys. In 1955, Montgomery attended the White House Conference on Education.|$|E

25|$|Mosby had {{to leave}} his {{children}} {{in the care of}} relatives, but this proved to be {{the first in a series}} of other federal government jobs and postings, many fighting rampant fraud in politically volatile situations. President McKinley appointed Mosby's daughter May the <b>postmistress</b> in Warrenton, which became very important after her husband Robert Campbell died in August 1889, leaving her to raise her young children alone (although her sons John Mosby Campbell and Alexander Spottswood Campbell received many letters and some money from their overseas grandfather, as to a lesser extent did Jack Russell, son of his late sister Lucie).|$|E
5000|$|The {{stories are}} set {{mainly in the}} Berkshire countryside, at the {{farmhouse}} home of the children's grandmother, a Scottish-born woman named Mrs Hawthorne. The farm is called Smockfarthing, and is near to an imaginary village called Smockfarthing Wick, {{which in turn is}} close to a town called Riverton. Although these places are not real, James uses names of real places such as Oxford and Drayton, so {{it is possible that the}} area could be somewhere around Abingdon. John and Mary's parents live in Rome, as their father is Italian and works there apparently as a diplomat (his work is described in John and Mary Revisit Rome as [...] "involving a great deal of travelling about to far-off places"). His wife is Mrs. Hawthorne's daughter, and her sister is named Push, who also lives at Smockfarthing. John and Mary are educated at home by a governess called Miss Rose Brown, although they spend about half their time in Rome, and indeed are bilingual in English and Italian. Smockfarthing carries a full complement of servants, including Mrs. Dyer the cook, Ellen the parlourmaid, Lizzie (whom the children call Lisetta) the maid, and Edie Kittiwake, the nurse. Edie's father Kittiwake looks after the farm with his son Reggie, and they and Mrs. Kittiwake live in a house on the farm called the Round House. Other characters, such as schoolmasters, vicars, <b>postmistresses</b> and so on, crop up in the books from time to time as well.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} day, Poirot is {{contacted by}} Maude Williams, who had approached {{him a few}} days earlier, telling him that she had known Bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents. She told Poirot that she liked Bentley and did not believe he was guilty or even capable of murdering Mrs McGinty. She now offers to help Poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid {{in the house of}} Mrs Wetherby, a resident in the village for whom Mrs McGinty worked as housekeeper, and whose daughter, Deirdre, Poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding Mrs McGinty's murder. During the maid's night off, Mrs Upward's son Robin, a somewhat flamboyant theatre director, and Ariadne Oliver, a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with Robin, leave for an evening at the theatre, leaving Mrs Upward alone at the house. When they return, they find Mrs Upward strangled to death. She has evidently had coffee with her murderer, and the lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime. Mrs Upward had invited three people to her house that night: Eve Carpenter, Deirdre Henderson and Shelagh Rendell. Any of the three women could be someone from the photographs. Additionally, the <b>postmistress's</b> assistant, Edna, saw someone with blonde hair enter the house, which points to either Carpenter or Rendell, as Henderson is not blonde. Confusing matters even further is the fact that a book is discovered in the Upward house with Evelyn Hope's signature written on the flyleaf, suggesting Mrs Upward was actually Eva Kane. Poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo Mrs McGinty saw at Maureen Summerhayes' house. It is of Eva Kane and has the inscription “my mother” on the back. Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer – Robin Upward.|$|R
25|$|It {{was during}} this {{timeframe}} that he built the large barn on the property, to store approximately 40 tons of alfalfa to use as feed for his livestock during the winter. He also built a bunkhouse for his growing number of ranch hands, {{as well as a}} commissary where they could purchase any necessities. The commissary was also open for any residents of the nearby ranches. In May 1913, Colter applied for and was granted a post office to be run out of his homestead, which would serve also the local ranches. Named the Colter Post Office, Duge became its first only <b>postmistress,</b> and remained open until 1922.|$|E
25|$|The first Barosaurus {{remains were}} {{discovered}} in the Morrison Formation of South Dakota by Ms. E. R. Ellerman, <b>postmistress</b> of Pottsville, and excavated by Othniel Charles Marsh and John Bell Hatcher of Yale University in 1889. Only six tail vertebrae were recovered at that time, forming the type specimen (YPM 429) of a new species, which Marsh named Barosaurus lentus, from the Classical Greek words βαρυς/barys ("heavy") and σαυρος/sauros ("lizard"), and the Latin word lentus ("slow"). The rest of the type specimen {{was left in the}} ground under the protection of the landowner, Ms Rachel Hatch, until it was collected nine years later, in 1898, by Marsh's assistant, George Rieber Wieland. These new remains consisted of vertebrae, ribs and limb bones. In 1896 Marsh had placed Barosaurus in the Atlantosauridae; in 1898 it was by him classified as a diplodocid for the first time. In his last published paper before his death, Marsh named two smaller metatarsals found by Wieland as a second species, Barosaurus affinis, but this has long been considered a junior synonym of B. lentus.|$|E
25|$|After a {{protracted}} friendship, a broken engagement and cancelled wedding plans, Wedge married Prudence Olive Tracy (born March 1872 in Ohio; died May 1928 in Freeport, Illinois), the <b>postmistress</b> of Florence, Nebraska, a northern suburb of Omaha, since 1895, {{a graduate of}} the University of Nebraska, choir singer and concert musician, and the third of the five children of Sarah E. Smalley (born October 1846 in Ohio; died September 2, 1889 in Ohio) and Jonathan Franklin Tracy (born about 1845 in Otway, Ohio), a Wisconsin physician. on December 18, 1910 in Florence, Nebraska. Prudence had previously been engaged, but broke off her engagement to the other man who had decided to migrate to Canada. Wedge and Prudence were soon engaged, and had announced their wedding date, but Prudence cancelled the wedding after a family friend brought to her mother's attention rumors that Wedge had not really reformed but was rather living an immoral life. In 1909 Wedge resigned from the pastorate and relocated to San Francisco to work as a missionary on the Barbary Coast. After their marriage, the Wedges moved to San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Further {{settlement}} {{took place}} after Goodna was proclaimed {{a village in}} 1856. In the following year Joseph and Ellen (née Thompson) Broad built a store on the site, and sold the store later to Edwin Pitt, son of Charles and Mary Pitt. Edwin and his wife Cecilia (née Thompson sister of Ellen Broad) ran the store as a mixed business and Cecilia was the <b>postmistress</b> (see Aldines). They survived the 1893 Brisbane flood but a little later built Pitt's Hotel Cecil on the store site. It was later burnt down and the RSL is now on that site. Edwin and Cecilia's daughter Zora Brenda Pitt grew up and learnt to ride in Goodna and she became Royal National Show champion woman rider in the early 1900s, and the cemetery opened in 1859. By 1863 {{there was a small}} run to Holmes Inn, where Harriet Holmes was postmistress.The Congregational Church was also opened in 1863. It was built by Mr ES Thomas who was also the lay preacher. Mr Thomas was an Ipswich Councillor and the local JP. As a JP he also filled the role of acting magistrate on occasions. He built the now heritage listed house at 43 William Street and owned the adjacent general store and bakery. Mr Thomas originally operated a general store in Brisbane Road but this was flooded in 1893. They had to move their best things into {{the top floor of the}} nearby hotel. There was one acting police sergeant and a constable by 1868. W. Law established himself as a blacksmith in 1870, the year in which the Goodna State School opened.|$|E

2500|$|At Easter, Sir Henry himself {{dies and}} his wife's grave is opened for his burial. A body is found {{hidden in the}} grave, {{mutilated}} beyond recognition. It is first {{thought to be the}} body of a tramp labourer calling himself [...] "Driver" [...] who had arrived and then vanished just after the New Year. Acting on a hunch, Lord Peter enquires at the Post Office for any uncollected letters addressed to [...] "Driver". Bunter, Wimsey's valet, inveigles a <b>postmistress</b> into handing over a letter posted in France, which confirms a link with the body, which was wearing French underclothes. The letter is addressed not to [...] "Driver" [...] but to [...] "Paul Taylor", a reference to [...] "Tailor Paul", the tenor (largest) bell in the ring at Fenchurch St. Paul. When the writer of the letter is traced, the dead man is assumed to be Arthur Cobbleigh, a British soldier listed as missing in action in 1918, but who evidently deserted and stayed in France after the war. Cobbleigh appears to have known where the emeralds were hidden, and to have plotted to recover them, probably with [...] "Driver". [...] "Driver" [...] is discovered to be an alias of Cranton, the accomplice in the original theft.

2500|$|The two-light {{window at}} {{the east end of}} the north aisle {{represents}} Mary and Martha of Bethany, mentioned in Luke 38–42. In that story, Mary is interested in spiritual matters, whereas Martha prefers to do practical work. Thus Martha has a housekeeper's attributes of a spinning wheel and a purse at her waist, while Mary is praying and reading the Scriptures. This window is dedicated to Ann Mitchell, the village <b>postmistress,</b> by her husband. The three-light window on the north aisle carries the theme of evangelism and music. It shows King David in the centre light, playing music. The left-hand light carries the words, [...] "Their sound is gone out unto all lands," [...] and the right-hand light says [...] "and their words into the ends of the world." [...] This is a translation of the 4th and 5th lines of Psalm 19, as it appears in the Book of Common Prayer: day 4, morning prayer. The men on either side of David are both saints with halos, and churchmen, wearing mitres. The dedication for this window is missing, but it was said by a local newspaper to have been given by William Clapham Cautley, and that it is dedicated to George Thomas Woods of the Order of Saint John.
