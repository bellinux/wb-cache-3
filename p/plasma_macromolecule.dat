40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} in sensitized rats that the immediate response to endointestinal challenge with allergen (10 (- 6) M ovalbumin) {{is characterized by}} mucosal exudation of plasma {{with little or no}} concomitant change in the mucosal absorption capacity. The luminal entry of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> also leaves the light microscopic structure and the ultrastructure of the mucosa unaffected. It is possible that the plasticity of epithelial zonulae occludens allows a noninjurious and unidirectional paracellular flux of extravasated plasma into the gut lumen. We propose that inflammatory-stimulus-induced mucosal exudation of plasma belongs to the first-line defense mechanisms of the intact lining of the intestine...|$|R
40|$|Caveolae are flask-shaped plasma {{membrane}} invaginations that mediate endocytosis and transcytosis of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> such as albumin, insulin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), {{as well as}} certain viruses, bacteria and bacterial toxins. Caveolae-mediated transcytosis of macromolecules is critical for main-taining vascular homeostasis by regulating the oncotic pressure gradient and tissue delivery of drugs, vita-mins, lipids and ions. Entrapment of cargo within caveolae induces activation of signalling cascades leading to caveolae fission and internalization. Activation of Src tyrosine kinase is an early and essential step that triggers detachment of loaded caveolae from the {{plasma membrane}}. In this review, we examine how Src-mediated phosphorylation regulates caveolae-mediated transport by orchestrating the localization and activ-ity of essential proteins of the endocytic machinery to regulate caveolae formation and fission...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSynovial fluid (SF) {{is capable}} of {{reflecting}} infectious, immunological, or inflammatory joint conditions in horses by altering its composition and appearance. Although plasma and SF compositions are quantitatively different, this latter compartment reflects changes in <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Therefore, changes in serum immunoglobulin protein concentrations tend also to alter intracapsular levels. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} know the physiological concentrations of proteins present in SF. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the levels of total protein, albumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, α 1 -acid glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin, and immunoglobulins A and G in SF of six healthy horses. The synovial proteinogram was obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

40|$|Heparan sulfate (HS) {{within the}} glomerular {{basement}} membrane (GBM) is thought {{to play a major role}} in the charge-selective properties of the glomerular capillary wall. Recent data, however, raise questions regarding the direct role of HS in glomerular filtration. For example, in situ studies suggest that HS may prevent <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> from clogging the GBM, keeping it in an "open" state. We evaluated this potential role of HS in vivo by studying the passage of protein through the glomerular capillary wall in the presence and absence of HS. Intravenous administration of neuraminidase removed neuraminic acid [...] but not HS [...] from the GBM, and this led to albuminuria. Concomitant removal of HS with heparinase III, confirmed by ultrastructural imaging, prevented the development of albuminuria in response to neuraminidase treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that HS keeps the GBM in an open state, facilitating passage of proteins through the glomerular capillary wall...|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} {{charges of}} the sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the {{glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) were differentially neutralized by perfusin with high molarity buffers in order {{to determine whether or not}} these charges protect the GBM from being clogged by circulating <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Progressive elimination of the negative charges resulted in clogging of the GBM by perfused native ferritin (NF) and bovine serum albumin as evidenced ultrastructurally by the increase in accumulation of NF in the GBM. In addition, the permeability of the GBM to 125 I-insulin, a macromolecule which is normally freely permeable, and the glomerular filtration rate (as determined by [3 H]inulin clearance) were markedly reduced after the GBM had been clogged with NF in the presence of high molarity buffer, thereby indicating that clogging severely reduces the ability of the GMB to act as a selective filter. These findings are consistent with the idea that the sulfated GAGs of the GBM serve as anticlogging agents...|$|R
40|$|Endothelial {{properties}} {{are affected by}} mechanical stresses. Several {{studies have shown that}} an acute application of shear stress increases the permeability of endothelial monolayers in culture. We investigated whether more prolonged application of shear has the opposite effect. Porcine aortic endothelial cells were cultured on Transwell filters to assess monolayer permeability to albumin. The medium above the cells was swirled using an orbital shaker; resultant shears were computed to lie within the physiological range. Acute application of shear increased permeability, but chronic application reduced it. The effect of chronic but not acute shear was reversed by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. The effect of chronic shear was also reversed by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3 -OH kinase (PI 3 K) and soluble guanylyl cyclase. None of these interventions affected permeability under static conditions, and inhibition of cyclooxygenase was without effect. Chronic shear decreased mitosis rates by a fraction comparable to the reduction in permeability, but this effect was not reversed by inhibiting NO synthesis. We conclude that chronic application of shear stress reduces endothelial permeability to macromolecules by a PI 3 K-NO-cGMP-dependent mechanism. Since atherosclerosis can be triggered by excessive entry of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> into the arterial wall, the phenomenon may help explain the atheroprotective effects of shear and NO...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the first NMR metabolomics study of maternal plasma during pregnancy, including correlation between plasma and urine metabolites. The expected decrease in circulating amino acids early in pregnancy was confirmed with six amino acids being identified {{as required by}} the fetus in larger extents. Newly observed changes in citrate, lactate, and dimethyl sulfone suggested early adjustments in energy and gut microflora metabolisms. Alterations in creatine levels were also noted, in addition to creatinine variations reflecting alterations in glomerular filtration rate. Regarding <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> HDL and LDL+VLDL levels were confirmed to increase throughout pregnancy, although at different rates and accompanied by increases in fatty acid chain length and degree of unsaturation. Correlation studies suggested (a) an inverse relationship between lipoproteins (HDL and LDL+VLDL) and albumin, with a possible direct correlation to excreted (unassigned) pregnancy markers resonating at d 0. 55 and d 0. 63, (b) a direct link between LDL+VLDL and N-acetyl-glycoproteins, together with excreted marker at d 0. 55, and (c) correlation of plasma albumin with particular circulating and excreted metabolites. These results have unveiled specific lipoprotein/protein metabolic aspects of pregnancy with impact on the excreted metabolome and, therefore, provide an interesting lead for the further understanding of pregnancy metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis may be {{triggered}} by an elevated net transport of lipid-carrying <b>macromolecules</b> from <b>plasma</b> into the arterial wall. We hypothesised that whether lesions are of the thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) type or are less fatty and more fibrous depends {{on the degree of}} elevation of transport, with greater uptake leading to the former. We further hypothesised that the degree of elevation can depend on haemodynamic wall shear stress characteristics and nitric oxide synthesis. Placing a tapered cuff around the carotid artery of apolipoprotein E -/- mice modifies patterns of shear stress and eNOS expression, and triggers lesion development at the upstream and downstream cuff margins; upstream but not downstream lesions resemble the TCFA. We measured wall uptake of a macromolecular tracer in the carotid artery of C 57 bl/ 6 mice after cuff placement. Uptake was elevated in the regions that develop lesions in hyperlipidaemic mice and was significantly more elevated where plaques of the TCFA type develop. Computational simulations and effects of reversing the cuff orientation indicated a role for solid as well as fluid mechanical stresses. Inhibiting NO synthesis abolished the difference in uptake between the upstream and downstream sites. The data support the hypothesis that excessively elevated wall uptake of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> initiates the development of the TCFA, suggest that such uptake can result from solid and fluid mechanical stresses, and are consistent with a role for NO synthesis. Modification of wall transport properties might form the basis of novel methods for reducing plaque rupture...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{exudation}} {{has been}} suggested {{to be an important}} component of the inflammatory response in asthma. Bradykinin elicits many of the features of asthma, including bronchoconstriction, cough, plasma exudation and mucus secretion. In an attempt to quantify local plasma exudation, we have employed a novel low-trauma technique with the aim of challenging and lavaging a central part of the bronchial tree, by selecting a medium sized bronchus. A fibreoptic bronchoscopy was performed in non-smoking healthy volunteers. The instrument was placed proximally in the right upper lobe bronchus. A plastic catheter, equipped with an inflatable latex balloon, was inflated with air (2 - 4 cmH 2 O). A solution (100 microl of either two different concentrations of bradykinin: 0. 09 and 0. 9 mg ml(- 1) or normal saline) was instilled through the catheter and distal to the balloon. Eight minutes later a lavage procedure with 10 ml of saline was performed through the catheter. The procedure was then repeated twice, with the other solutions, but from the lingular and middle lobe bronchi. All solutions were given in a blinded fashion, and two different studies were performed. Lavage concentrations of albumin and IgG were quantified as measurements of plasma exudation. In our first study we found that bradykinin challenge significantly increased concentrations of albumin and IgG. In study two, there was no numeric increase in plasma proteins after local bradykinin challenge, but the concentration of thromboxane was significantly increased in lavages from bradykinin-challenged bronchi. Thus, local bronchial administration of bradykinin has the capacity to induce exudation of large <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> into the bronchial lumen, as well as local thromboxane production...|$|R

We {{quantified}} the plasma levels and peritoneal loss of lipids and lipoproteins, and studied the composition of plasma and effluent lipoproteins in 16 patients on CAPD (5 females and 11 males, 18 to 76 years old). Five patients were studied prospectively (at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months) and 11 patients at 6 to 58 months on CAPD (N = 30). Elevated levels of plasma VLDL and reduced levels of plasma HDL were maintained in these patients throughout 58 months of CAPD, whereas the initially increased LDL levels showed a tendency towards normalization. All plasma lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL) were present in the peritoneal effluent. The lipoproteins isolated from plasma and peritoneal fluid shared a similar lipid and apolipoprotein composition. The peritoneal transport characteristics of plasma lipoproteins were similar to other <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Their clearance correlated with their molecular mass, plasma concentration and dwell time, but was not affected by duration of CAPD treatment. The plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were unaffected by the rate of glucose absorption. The peritoneal protein clearance correlated positively with plasma levels of triglyceride and LDL, and negatively with plasma HDL. An inverse correlation was observed also between plasma levels of HDL and its peritoneal clearance (r = - 0. 393, P < 0. 025, N = 30). The continuous peritoneal loss of HDL and the hypertriglyceridemia were found to contribute most to the persistent low plasma levels of HDL in CAPD patients, and thus may lead to the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in these patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{inflammatory}} {{response of the}} airway microcirculation in rhinitis and asthma may be recorded as luminal entry of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> (mucosal exudation). This study examines the exudative responsiveness of the subepithelial microvessels in subjects with and without common cold after inoculation with coronavirus. METHODS [...] The airway mucosa was exposed to exudative concentrations of histamine (40 and 400 micrograms/ml) before and six days after inoculation. To assess whether mucosal penetration of a topically applied agent was altered, nasal absorption of chromium- 51 labelled ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (51 Cr-EDTA, MW 372) was also examined. A nasal pool technique kept the challenge and tracer solutes {{in contact with the}} same ipsilateral mucosal surface. Concentrations of albumin in lavage fluids were measured as an index of mucosal exudation of plasma. Nasal absorption of 51 Cr-EDTA was determined by the cumulated 24 hour urinary excretion of radioactivity. RESULTS [...] Nine subjects developed common cold after coronavirus inoculation and 10 remained healthy. Histamine produced concentration dependent mucosal exudation of plasma in all subjects before and after coronavirus inoculation. In subjects with common cold, however, the histamine-induced mucosal exudation was significantly augmented compared with the group without common cold. This exudative hyperresponsiveness is not explained by an increased baseline exudation because the lavage regimen used produced comparably low baseline exudation in both groups of subjects, nor is it explained by an increased penetration of topical histamine because the ability of the nasal mucosa to absorb 51 Cr-EDTA was not significantly increased in the subjects with common cold. CONCLUSIONS [...] An increased proclivity of the airway subepithelial microcirculation to respond with plasma exudation develops during coronavirus-induced common cold. This specific exudative hyperresponsiveness may be a feature of inflammatory airway diseases...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a complex}} {{inflammatory}} disease which may be triggered by an elevated transport of lipid-carrying macromolecules from the blood into the arterial wall. Its non-uniform distribution {{has been attributed to}} local variations in wall shear stress. Intramural stresses and strains are regularly overlooked, despite their heterogeneous distribution and direct effect on vascular cell morphology and function. Stenotic flow models of atherosclerosis inadvertently alter both fluid and solid stresses. Using a tapered flow modifying cuff, wall uptake of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> was investigated in the murine carotid artery. The greatest uptake occurred just upstream, the site which has previously been observed to later develop vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. Uptake was also elevated, but to a significantly lesser extent, just downstream. Flow simulations and the effects of reversing cuff orientation on wall permeability, indicated a role for solid, as well as fluid stresses. Structural simulations revealed that steep spatial and cyclic stress/strain gradients occur at the cuff margins. When fluid-structure interaction effects are included, transmural pressure and circumferential stress and strain are reduced downstream. Arterial branch sites exhibit large variations in biomechanical factors and a predilection for atherosclerotic lesions. Motivated by the need to accurately map strains around branch openings, a novel method was developed to determine in vivo strain in animal models using vascular corrosion casts. A study focused on the descending thoracic rabbit aorta demonstrated its efficacy. Assessing the anatomical correlation of atherosclerosis with biomechanical localising factors is hindered by spatial autocorrelation, which tends to exaggerate significance, and by the use of aggregate data, which artificially inflates correlation coefficients. A comparison of four statistical tests for assessing spatial correlations highlighted substantial differences in obtained significance when applied to maps of wall shear stress and three putatively related arterial properties. A fifth test specific to aggregate data was proposed and applied. Appropriate application of these techniques will help to establish the relative importance of fluid and solid mechanics in atherogenesis. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> in the arterial intima {{is a critical}} step in atherogenesis. It depends on the balance between influx across the endothelium and efflux across the media. The work presented in this thesis investigated these phenomena. The distribution of 'hotspots' of high endothelial permeability around aortic branches was mapped in immature and mature rabbits; the pattern of disease at such sites changes with age. The pattern of hotspots of Evan's Blue dye-labelled albumin uptake was found to change with age. Using statistical techniques that account for spatial autocorrelation and non-linear relations between variables, a significant correlation with the pattern of cholesterol deposition was obtained at both ages. The hotspot patterns did not correlate with patterns of mitosis. The data also showed that the division of transendothelial transport pathways into 'small' and 'large' pores may represent an arbitrary division of a continuum of pore sizes. Albumin is smaller than the lipoproteins thought to trigger atherosclerosis. The study was therefore repeated using rhodamine-labelled 2 MDa dextran. In immature animals, the pattern of hotspots for this larger tracer {{was similar to the}} pattern for albumin. The mature pattern of dextran uptake differed from the immature one, but it was not the same as that observed for albumin. Further studies investigated transport through the media. As the transport of large molecules occurs predominantly by advection, characterising transmural water flux is important. Ex vivo experimental studies investigated effects of pressure and muscle contraction on hydraulic resistance. Numerical studies based on structural data from the ex vivo experiments were used to characterise the resistance of the media, and the intimal resistance was obtained by subtraction. Intimal and medial resistances in the order 1011 kg s− 1 m− 2 were found to change in opposite directions with increasing pressure or muscle contraction. The results may assist in understanding and preventing the development of atherosclerosis. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Glomerular kidney {{diseases}} {{are a major}} health care burden. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of three layers: the slit diaphragm that bridges the interlocking foot pro- cesses of the podocytes, {{the glomerular basement membrane}} and fenestrated endothelial cells. The filtration barrier is permselective to <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> based on size, shape, and charge. The molecular makeup of the filtration barrier determines its permselectivity. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the glomerular filtration barrier has been gained with the study of genes mutated in humans and animal models of glomerular kidney disease. In the thesis work, we performed a proteome analysis of healthy glomeruli in mice using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. A total of 232 unique proteins were identified from 414 gel spots. This study provided a snapshot of the glomerular proteome that can serve as reference for future glomerular protein biomarker studies. We describe the expression and physiological function of the gene Glcci 1 in zebrafish. His- tological analysis of Glcci 1 showed expression in podocytes and mesangial cells. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that Glcci 1 expression is induced by glucocorticoids. Depletion of Glcci 1 by morpholino knockdown resulted in the development of pericardial edema and defects in glomerular filtration. Our results suggest a role for Glcci 1 in glomerular injury and proteinuria. Knockdown experiments of the paralogs Plekhh 1 and Plekhh 2 in zebrafish resulted in gross morphological changes in the glomerulus, including thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and disorganization of the podocyte foot processes associated with a defective filtration barrier. These results suggest a role for Plekhh 1 and Plekhh 2 in regulating podocyte foot process morphology in zebrafish. We further characterized Plekhh 1 and Plekhh 2 in knockout mouse models. Single knockouts of Plekhh 1 and Plekhh 2 do not develop any apparent phenotype. Plekhh 1 and Plekhh 2 deficient mice were intercrossed to produce mice lacking both genes. This yielded fewer than expected number of double knockout offspring, suggesting functional redundancy. Ultrastructural analysis of surviving double knockout mice did not reveal changes in glomerular morphology suggesting that Plekhh 1 and Plekhh 2 are largely redundant for kidney function in mice. These results give insight into glomerular biology and pathomechanisms of kidney disease that might provide a basis for translational research in the future...|$|R
40|$|Vascular {{endothelium}} {{is covered}} with an extensive mesh of glycocalyx constituents, which acts like an effective barrier up to several micrometers thick that shields the luminal surface of the vasculature from direct exposure to flowing blood. Many studies report that various enzymatic and pharmaceutical challenges are able to increase glycocalyx porosity, resulting in farther permeation of <b>plasma</b> <b>macromolecules</b> and greater access of red blood cells into glycocalyx domain. Attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties therefore potentially increases the amount of blood that effectively occupies available microvascular volume. We tested {{in the present study}} whether attenuation of coronary glycocalyx barrier properties actually increases coronary blood volume and whether such changes would be noticeable during measurements of coronary flow reserve using adenosine. In anesthetized goats (n = 6) with cannulated left main coronary artery that were perfused under controlled pressure, coronary blood volume was measured via the indicator-dilution technique using high-molecular-weight (2, 000 kDa) dextrans as plasma tracer and labeled red blood cells as red blood cell tracer. Coronary blood volume was determined at baseline and during intracoronary infusion of adenosine causing maximal vasodilation (0. 2 - 0. 6 mg. kg(- 1). h(- 1)) before and after intracoronary hyaluronidase treatment (170, 000 units) of the glycocalyx. With an intact glycocalyx, coronary blood volume was 18. 9 +/- 1. 1 ml/ 100 g heart tissue at baseline, which increased to 26. 3 +/- 2. 7 ml/ 100 g after hyaluronidase treatment of the coronary glycocalyx. Maximal vasodilation by administration of adenosine further increased coronary blood volume to 33. 9 +/- 6. 8 ml/ 100 g, a value not different from the maximal coronary blood volume of 33. 2 +/- 5. 3 ml/ 100 g obtained by administration of adenosine in the absence of hyaluronidase treatment. Adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance were not affected by hyaluronidase treatment. We conclude that acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume by approximately 40 %, which is of similar magnitude as additional changes in coronary blood volume during subsequent maximal vasodilation with adenosine. Furthermore, maximal coronary blood volume following administration of adenosine was similar with and without prior hyaluronidase degradation of the glycocalyx, suggesting that adenosine and hyaluronidase potentially increase glycocalyx porosity to a similar extent. Hyaluronidase-mediated changes in coronary blood volume did not affect baseline and adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance, demonstrating that measurements of coronary flow reserve are insufficient to detect impairment of coronary blood volume recruitment in conditions of damaged glycocaly...|$|R

As the in vitro cellular system of the neoplastic cell line SGS/ 4 A and syngeneic normal fibroblasts (FG) represents {{a useful tool for}} studies on molecular mechanisms regulating cell adhesion, neoplastic transformation and cellular ageing, we studied the changes of glycosphingolipid and of the enzymes involved in their metabolism in both cultured cells at different subculture stages. The FG subculture progression induces a drastic decrease of total glycosphingolipid content with consistent alterations in the molecular composition. In particular, a significant decrease of GM 3, a slight increase of GD 1 a, the disappearance of ‘b’-series gangliosides and the drastic reduction of triosylceramides were observed. On the contrary, the increasing number of SGS/ 4 A subcultures, characterized by a specific and different glycosphingolipid composition as compared with FG cells, does not cause modifications. Although glycosyltransferase activity levels quite well parallel the glycosphingolipid patterns and can account for the noted variations, the mRNA expression analysis of two glycosyltransferases suggests that the in vitro cell ageing of normal rat fibroblasts causes drastic changes in the glycosphingolipid profile through the regulation, at either the transcriptional or post-translational level, of some biosynthetic enzymes...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{increasing}} interest in bio-mathematical modelling and scientific computing, resulting in new applications to relevant physiological phenomena {{and to a}} better understanding of the origin of various diseases. A topic of great interest to several degenerative diseases is filtration across microvessel walls. The role of the microvessel wall is to let oxygen and nutrients contained in the blood stream to reach the interstitium, and ultimately the surrounding cells, while blocking macromolecules. An understanding of these processes is important in preventing and curing neuro-degenerative diseases, as well as for exploring possible mechanisms to make drug delivery more efficient. This work presents a one-dimensional, time dependent mathematical model describing transport of blood <b>plasma</b> and <b>macromolecules</b> across blood vessel walls. The model takes into account the heterogeneous microvessel wall composition, in order to accurately describe trans-vascular flow. This results in a multi-layered domain, accounting for variable physical properties across the layers forming the micro-vascular wall. In particular, the glycocalyx and endothelium, accounted for in many biological studies, are represented in our model. This micro-structural, yet simplified description of the vascular wall, allows us to simulate the effect of glycocalyx damage and of other pathologies, such as hypertension, hemorrhage and hypovolemia, both in steady and time-dependent states. Due to the simplicity, and thus efficiency of the proposed model, simulations are fast and provide results which are in line with published experimental studies. Furthermore, the simulation tool may be useful for practical applications in physiological and medical studies, by evaluating the possible consequences of pathological conditions...|$|R

40|$|Synaptic vesicles dock at active zones on the {{presynaptic}} {{plasma membrane}} of a neuron's axon terminals as {{a precondition for}} fusing with the membrane and releasing their neurotransmitter to mediate synaptic impulse transmission. Typically, docked vesicles are next to aggregates of <b>plasma</b> membrane-bound <b>macromolecules</b> called active zone material (AZM). Electron tomography on tissue sections from fixed and stained axon terminals of active and resting frog neuromuscular junctions {{has led to the}} conclusion that undocked vesicles are directed to and held at the docking sites by the successive formation of stable connections between vesicle membrane proteins and proteins in different classes of AZM macromolecules. Using the same nanometer scale 3 D imaging technology on appropriately stained frog neuromuscular junctions, we found that ∼ 10 % of a vesicle's luminal volume is occupied by a radial assembly of elongate macromolecules attached by narrow projections, nubs, to the vesicle membrane at ∼ 25 sites. The assembly's chiral, bilateral shape is nearly the same vesicle to vesicle, and nubs, at their sites of connection to the vesicle membrane, are linked to macromolecules that span the membrane. For docked vesicles, the orientation of the assembly's shape relative to the AZM and the presynaptic membrane is the same vesicle to vesicle, whereas for undocked vesicles it is not. The connection sites of most nubs on the membrane of docked vesicles are paired with the connection sites of the different classes of AZM macromolecules that regulate docking, and the membrane spanning macromolecules linked to these nubs are also attached to the AZM macromolecules. We conclude that the luminal assembly of macromolecules anchors in a particular arrangement vesicle membrane macromolecules, which contain the proteins that connect the vesicles to AZM macromolecules during docking. Undocked vesicles must move in a way that aligns this arrangement with the AZM macromolecules for docking to proceed...|$|R

Fourteen male elite Brazilian handball athletes were recruited in the present study. Blood samples were taken before, immediately, and 24 hours after the game. Results. After the game and during 24 hours of recovery, the concentration of all oxidative stress indices changed significantly in a way indicating increased oxidative stress in the blood (thiol groups and reduced glutathione decreased, whereas TBARS and plasma antioxidant capacity was increased) {{as well as in}} erythrocyte (increased levels of TBARS and protein carbonyls).

However, {{the dynamics of}} ICG in the acute phase of photoacoustic have not been elucidated. In this study, in the vascular space, the target agent may shuffle and pass quickly out through the observation window, {{making it difficult to}} obtain the signal. The photoacoustic signal of ICG was higher in tumours than in other organs, such as the liver and kidney. ICG rapidly binds to albumin (molecular weight[*]~[*] 60 kDa) in <b>plasma</b> [20]. Such <b>macromolecules</b> with a molecular weight[*]>[*] 20 kDa are not able to permeate the endothelium of normal organs. In contrast, tumour microvessels with discontinuous endothelium enable larger molecules (>[*] 50 kDa) to extravasate into the interstitial space [21, 22]. The photoacoustic signal of ICG reflects extravasation of ICG-bound albumin accumulation into the extravascular space, followed by vascular hyperpermeability in tumours. To directly confirm ICG extravasation into the interstitial space, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of tumour sections. Immunofluorescence staining of tumour microvessels with anti-CD 31 antibodies revealed that ICG accumulated not only in the interstitial space but also in tumour cells. Consistent with our observations, Onda et al.

Treatment of MDCK cells with a mitochondrial uncoupler and a Ca 2 + ionophore led to ATP depletion, necrotic morphology, and progressive fragmentation of DNA in an internucleosomal or ladder pattern. DNA breakdown was immediately preceded by increased permeability of the <b>plasma</b> membrane to <b>macromolecules.</b> Provision of glycine along with the noxious agents did not modify the extent of ATP depletion, but prevented plasma membrane damage. This was accompanied by complete inhibition of DNA fragmentation. Internucleosomal DNA cleavage was observed also during necrosis after rapid permeabilization of plasma membranes by detergents or streptolysin-O in hepatocytes, thymocytes, and P 19, Jurkat, and MDCK cells. DNA fragmentation associated with necrosis was Ca 2 +/Mg 2 + dependent, was suppressed by endonuclease inhibitors, and was abolished by serine protease inhibitors but not by inhibitors of interleukin- 1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) -related proteases or caspases. Moreover, unlike apoptosis, it was not accompanied by caspase-mediated proteolysis. On the other hand, the cleavage-site-directed chymotryptic inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl-chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) suppressed DNA fragmentation not only in necrotic cells but also during Fas-mediated apoptosis, without inhibiting caspase-related proteolysis. The results suggest a novel pathway of endonuclease activation during necrosis not involving the participation of caspases. In addition, they indicate that techniques based on double-strand DNA breaks may not reliably differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis...|$|R
