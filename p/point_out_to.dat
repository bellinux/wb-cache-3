5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E

25|$|The major overt {{purpose of}} the account of Solomon's reign, to which the Judgment of Solomon belongs as stated above, is to glorify King Solomon, and his wisdom {{is one of the}} account's {{dominant}} themes. The exceptions are: The first two chapters (1 Kings 1–2), which according to many scholars portray a dubious image of Solomon, and as stated above, are sometimes ascribed to a separate work; And the last chapter in the account (11), which describes Solomon's sins in his old age. Nevertheless, many scholars <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> elements in the account that criticize Solomon, anticipating his downfall in chapter 11.|$|E

500|$|In April 1994, Professor Elizabeth Newson {{published}} Video Violence and the Protection of Children (the [...] "Newson Report") which attracted huge media {{interest due}} to its claims that it had [...] "definitively established the long sought-for link between screen violence and the real-life variety," [...] and which cited the Capper murder as an example. Despite its support by the press, however, the report failed to demonstrate any definitive link, [...] "merely drawing inferences from... often highly speculative accounts in the press rather than independent first-hand research." [...] Newson was called {{to give oral evidence}} to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on Video Violence, where she asserted: [...] "The Suzanne Capper case is another example of very explicit imitation of video and the use of video and that was Child's Play 3." [...] The chairman of the committee, Sir Ivan Lawrence had to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Newson that this was incorrect, and that both the police and the British Board of Film Classification had ruled out any connection between the movie and the murder.|$|E
500|$|Efforts to {{purchase}} or have built ironclad warships were unsuccessful despite Bulloch's best efforts. Buying them was never seriously considered, as the Royal Navy would {{not care to}} give any of its best ships to a foreign power, no matter how favorably disposed. Contracts were made with private shipyards in both Britain and France to build rams to Confederate naval specifications, but their ultimate purpose could not be disguised. They therefore directly violated the neutrality laws, and American (that is, Union) officials immediately informed the governments of their existence. For a while, Her Majesty's Government chose to {{turn a blind eye}} on developments, but the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg caused them to reconsider. On September 5, 1863, Ambassador Charles Francis Adams sent a message to Foreign Minister Lord John Russell informing him that the first of the ironclads was about to leave, and that [...] "it would be superfluous in me to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> your Lordship that this means war." [...] The ship was not permitted to leave and was later seized for the Royal Navy. As the French government had implicitly agreed to follow Britain's lead concerning North America, all the contracts were voided.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E
