To the east, it extends across the Mad River (including the Great Eddy bridge, Vermont's oldest active covered bridge) to a point where the road crosses a dry branch of the river. Most of the buildings are wood frame structures; there are six brick buildings. The most significant 20th-century building is the Joslin Library, prominently located at the central junction.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to determine the absolute/convective nature of the secondary instability experienced by finite-amplitude streaks in the flat-plate boundary layer. A family of parallel streaky base flows is defined by extracting velocity profiles from direct numerical simulations of nonlinearly saturated optimal streaks. The computed impulse response of the streaky base flows is then determined as a function of streak amplitude and streamwise station. Both the temporal and spatio-temporal instability properties are directly retrieved from the impulse response wave packet, without solving the dispersion relation or applying the <b>pinching</b> <b>point</b> criterion in the complex wavenumber plane. The instability of optimal streaks is found to be unambiguously convective for all streak amplitudes and streamwise stations. It is more convective than the Blasius boundary layer in the absence of streaks; the trailing edge-velocity of a Tollmien-Schlichting wave packet in the Blasius boundary layer is around 35 % of the free-stream velocity, while that of the wave packet riding on the streaky base flow is around 70 %. This is because the streak instability is primarily induced by the spanwise shear and the associated Reynolds stress production term is located further away from the wall, in a larger velocity region, than for the Tollmien-Schlichting instability. The streak impulse response consists of the sinuous mode of instability triggered by the spanwise wake-like profile, as confirmed by comparing the numerical results with the absolute/convective instability properties of the family of two-dimensional wakes introduced by Monkewitz (1988). The convective nature of the secondary streak instability implies that the type of bypass transition studied here involves streaks that behave as amplifiers of external noise...|$|E

Team 26 was tasked with designing a portable sleeping environment, improving upon the commonly used Graco Pack ‘n’ Play collapsible crib design. In {{order to avoid the}} dangers associated with the central “V”-shape collapsing frame design used by Graco, they designed their portable sleeping environment to include sides that fold up, outward, and down to avoid contact with a child inside of the crib. Even if the crib were to become unlocked while in use, no portion of the frame would create a <b>pinching</b> <b>point</b> or suffocation point for the infant occupant. Additionally, the frame was designed to fold up to be smaller, and at least 10 pounds lighter than the Pack n Play.  The four locking joints on the frame have two possible positions, fully assembled and fully disassembled. A fabric insert has been created using the fabric materials extracted from a Graco Pack ‘n’ Play and modified to fit onto the designed frame, covering any exposed metal from the inside. Instead of being suspended, the thin mattress is placed on top of the fabric insert, and is supported by the ground.  All hardware and fasteners have fabric coverings and must have anti loosening devices to avoid occupant laceration, tearing of the mesh walls, or potential choking hazards. The most important design features of this frame prototype are the locking system that also allows for easy and intuitive setup, and the collapsing method and direction that ensures no hardware could fall onto the child occupant during an unexpected collapse. An obvious warning label system and setup instructions must also be provided to avoid incorrect setup and user error. The frame was tested and confirmed to abide by the ASTM 406 standard for collapsible crib strength requirements...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (S-CO 2) cycles are {{recently}} very perspective and are researched {{all around the}} world. Research of the S-CO 2 cycles is ongoing at the Czech Technical University (CTU) as well. Research on CTU {{is focused on the}} <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> analysis. This point affects the entire loop and causes problems during the design of individual components. Therefore it is necessary to find the location of this point during the cycle design, for specific conditions (temperature, pressure). For known pressures and temperatures the <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> can be found in several ways by using heat capacity profiles. If this point occurs in the heat exchanger, it causes complications in designs. Due to the <b>pinch</b> <b>point,</b> heat exchangers have a large size and a low efficiency.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} we {{construct}} strange attractors {{in a class}} of skew product dynamical systems. A dynamical system of the class is a bundle map of a trivial bundle whose base is a compact metric space and the fiber is the non-negative half real line. The map on the base is a homeomorphism preserving an ergodic measure. The fiber maps either are strictly monotone and strictly concave or collapse at zero (<b>pinching</b> condition). The <b>points</b> on the base space whose fibers collapse are the <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> of the skew product. We also assume that the set of <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> has zero measure, {{and that there is a}} <b>pinched</b> <b>point</b> whose orbit is dense in the base space. Moreover, we assume that the zero-section is a super-repeller, in the sense that it is invariant and its Lyapunov exponent is +∞. For such a skew product dynamical system, we prove the existence of a measurable but non-continuous invariant graph, whose Lyapunov exponent is negative. We will refer to such an object as a strange attractor. Since the dynamics on the strange attractor is the one given by the base homeomorphism, we will say that it is a strange chaotic attractor or a strange non-chaotic attractor depending on the fact that the dynamics on the base is chaotic or non-chaotic. 1...|$|R
40|$|In synthesizing optimal heat {{recovery}} networks, Composite Curve (CC) plots and Problem Table Algorithms (PTAs) {{have been the}} most popular tools for determining the minimum energy targets, whereas Grid Diagrams (GDs) have been widely utilized for heat exchanger network (HEN) design. However, CCs are cumbersome to construct. Additionally, PTAs offer numerical advantages but little insight into the impact of process streams on <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> and {{heat recovery}} bottlenecks.

40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} {{resonant}} modes is extended to finite length systems containing <b>pinch</b> <b>points</b> of complex axial wavenumber k 0 and frequency ω 0 with arbitrary ω 0 kk=∂ 2 ω/∂k 2. The quantity ω 0 kk {{is shown to}} be an important indicator of how streamwise boundary conditions modify the local absolute mode at (k 0,ω 0). In particular, when Im(ω 0 kk) > 0, the <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> is twisted, and resonant modes owing to streamwise boundary conditions may then have growth rates greater than that of the unbounded absolute mode. In this case, global instability may occur while the flow is only convectively unstable. The premixing zone between the nozzle and a lifted flame on a variable-density jet {{is an example of a}} streamwise-confined system containing a twisted <b>pinch</b> <b>point.</b> For this system, linear stability analysis is employed to locate resonant modes along a solution curve in the complex k and ω planes. The orientation of the solution curve predicts destabilization owing to streamwise confinement as well as increasing global frequency with decreasing lift-off height as observed in previous direct numerical simulations. The theory also suggests that low-frequency fluctuations observed in the simulations may be explained by beating between two resonant modes of slightly differing frequencies. © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

At the <b>pinch</b> <b>point,</b> where the hot and cold streams are the most constrained, large heat exchangers are required to transfer heat between the hot and cold streams.
