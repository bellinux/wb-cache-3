5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, <b>Potassium,</b> <b>Sulphates</b> and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
40|$|Salt {{crystallization}} in {{porous materials}} constitutes {{one of the}} major causes of decay of buildings and archeological sites. Depending on the environmental conditions, salts can crystallize inside the porous network (subflorescence or cryptoefflorescence) on the material surface (efflorescence or compact crust). Generally speaking, the salt deposits may comprise different inorganic ions (i. e. sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphates,</b> nitrates or chlorides), and they cause several damages, i. e. flaking, alveolar weathering, crumbling, loss of material or dissolution. In order to determine the nature and the concentration of salts, ionic chromatography (IC) is generally used. Although valuable, the IC analytical method presents a number of drawbacks, i. e. requires long sample preparation times, different sample dilutions, and the determined values are referred only to the ionic species (cations or anions). For a quick quantitative identification, the Raman spectroscopy appears more suitable, but a calibration of such analytical method is necessary. The present paper deals with the application of Fourier transform (FT) -Raman spectroscopy to the study of soluble salts constituting the most diffuse efflorescences in monuments and archeological sites. The FT-Raman calibration was set up by measuring the band integration area of each standard salt solution at the more intense and/or well-resolved band. Twelve control mixtures were tested, and the calibration curve fitting was evaluated. The obtained results were compared with IC determinations performed on the same salt mixtures. The FT-Raman spectroscopy demonstrated to be an easy approach to salt quantitative analyses, that in addition enables the direct identification {{of the nature of the}} analyzed samples.

40|$|This {{research}} project mainly focused on {{two parts of}} studies which are the general geology geology of Kadok area which located at {{the lower part of}} the Kota Bharu and the study of groundwater flow by silica geothermometry as well as the water quality. The data were obtained when the geological mapping is done and the water sample as well as soil sample is collected in order to be analyzed. All the changes within the soil in the study area are collected and the grain size of the soil is analyzed and recorded. The geological map is done by analyzing the grain size of the soil whether it is sand, silt or clay. Hence, a new updated geological map is produced based on the changes type of soil. Groundwater is major source of fresh water in Kadok and it is used for domestic purpose among the villagers in the study area. Hence, a research of silica geothermometry is done in other to study the groundwater ﬂow and the interaction of the water with the bedrock in study area. The silica concentration and the temperature chalcedony are very low and this shows that the water is very young as it is newly recharged by the surface water which is Sungai Kelantan. Besides, the water quality analysis is also done in order to study the major ions which are sodium, magnesium, calcium, <b>potassium,</b> <b>sulphates,</b> chloride and bicarbonates. Many methods have been conducted to determine the major ions concentration in the groundwater samples which are Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometiy (ICP-OES), gravimetric method, titration method, spectrophotometry method and colorimetric method. From the results, interpretation is done with the help of the graphs, charts, Piper Trilinear diagram, and Surfer 8 diagram. From the interpretation of groundwater quality, the groundwater is safe for daily uses such as drinking purpose. None of the ions are exceeding the standard permissible limit...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Citrus {{are one of}} the {{important}} orchard fruit production that after banana is second in production at the world level and every year, Chemical fertilizers having most important role in increasing crops productions, but in long application of fertilizers cause soil destructions and polluting underground water. Also soils of dry regions are very poor in organic matter level. Nowadays in most countries, climatically condition and poor management cause poor organic matter content of soils. In Iran more than 60 percent of cultivated lands having less than 0. 5 up to 1 percent organic matter. This may be due to intensive cultivation and poor managements For this reason if we have combine applications of manure and chemical fertilizers, the results would be much better. The aim of this research was to evaluate suitable ratio of manure and chemical fertilizer {{in order to reduce the}} chemical fertilizer use in citrus orchard in north of Iran. Materials and Methods: This experiment was conducted in one of the orchard at Sari district with low organic C. This research carried out on five years old citrus threes. This experiment carried out as factorial experiment on the base of complete randomized block design with 9 treatments and three replications. Treatments included three manure levels (0, 6 and 12 kg per tree) and three levels of macro fertilizer including <b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> ammonium sulphate and super phosphate triple (o, 30 and 60 percent on the bases of soil test). Total treatment were 27 plots, (each plots were includes two threes). all treatments were applied at March. All analysis was done with standard methods. This experiment was done as factorial on the bases of complete randomized block design with 9 treatments and three replications. The treatments were as follows: T 1 : Zero percent chemical fertilizer and zero kg manure T 2 : 30 percent chemical fertilizer (<b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 50 kgha- 1, ammonium sulphate 30 kg ha- 1 and super phosphate triple 45 kg ha- 1) and zero kg manure. T 3 : 60 percent chemical fertilizer (<b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 100 kgha- 1, ammonium sulphate 60 kg ha- 1 and super phosphate triple 90 kg ha- 1) and zero kg manure. T 4 : Zero percent chemical fertilizer and 6 kg manure T 5 : 30 percent chemical fertilizer (<b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 50 kgha- 1, ammonium sulphate 30 kg ha- 1 and super phosphate triple 45 kg ha- 1) and 6 kg manure. T 6 : 60 percent chemical fertilizer (<b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 100 kgha- 1, ammonium sulphate 60 kg ha- 1 and super phosphate triple 90 kg ha- 1) and 6 kg manure. T 7 : Zero percent chemical fertilizer and 12 kg manure T 8 : 30 percent chemical fertilizer (<b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 50 kgha- 1, ammonium sulphate 30 kg ha- 1 and super phosphate triple 45 kg ha- 1) and 12 kg manure. T 9 : 60 percent chemical fertilizer (<b>potassium</b> <b>sulphate</b> 100 kgha- 1, ammonium sulphate 60 kg ha- 1 and super phosphate triple 90 kg ha- 1) and 12 kg manure. All data analysis was done with MSTATC software and mean data comparison done with Duncan test levels at 1 or 5 percent levels. Results and Discussion: The results of analysis of variance showed that simple effect of manure and fertilizers and their interactions had no significant effect on TSS, but simple effect of fertilizer and their interactions between them had significant effect. The simple effect of chemical fertilizer and its interaction with manure were significant at 1 percent level on titration able pH of fruit juice and the simple effect of manure effect on fruit juice pH were significant at 5 percent level. The simple chemical fertilizer effect on C vitamin was not significant but simple effect of manure and its interaction effect with chemical fertilizer were significant at 5 percent level. The analysis of variance showed that simple effect of chemical fertilizer on fruit juice potassium were not significant, but simple effect of manure and its interaction with chemical fertilizer were significant at 5 percent level. Analysis of variance showed that simple effect of manure and fertilizer on the fruit juice calcium was significant at 1 percent level but their interactions were significant at 5 percent level. Simple effect of manure and fertilizer and their interactions on the fruit magnesium, iron manganese, zinc and copper were significant at 1 percent level. Analysis of variance showed that simple effect of manure and fertilizer and their interactions on the fruit juice magnesium, manganese, iron and copper was significant at 1 percent level, but simple effect of manure on fruit juice zinc were significant at 5 percent level.
