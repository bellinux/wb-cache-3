40|$|A common {{logistics}} {{problem in}} the petroleum industry is the scheduling of the pipeline transfer of petroleum fuels from oil refineries to distribution terminals. With a fixed set of pipelines, {{each with its own}} restrictions and constraints, the scheduler must organize the products and timing of transfers through each pipeline so as to deliver the required quantity of each product to the appropriate terminals {{to meet the demands of}} the market. Of the many possible approaches to the scheduling problem which are reviewed in this thesis one basic approach was chosen for future research.

The software and hardware controlling this shoe sole <b>trimming</b> <b>machine</b> were originally designed over thirteen years ago to run under the MS-DOS operating sys-tem with limited memory, display capabil-ities, and processing power. The software was modified to run under the GNU/Linux operating system with a new touch screen interface.

30|$|Wettability {{evaluations}} {{were conducted}} on carbonate rock samples provided by the Masjed Soleyman oil reservoir (Iran). The carbonate samples were first cut into small substrates, 15  mm[*]×[*] 15  mm, using a <b>trimming</b> <b>machine</b> and then were polished with an end-face grinder to achieve a flat and smooth surface. They were cleaned in a Dean–Stark apparatus for 7  days in contact with toluene vapour at ambient pressure. All samples were then aged in crude oil for 1  week at 80  °C and atmospheric pressure to alter the wetting tendency of the surface to nearly oil-wet. After cooling, the samples were washed with n-heptane and distilled water and dried at 40  °C for 24  h (Karimi et al. 2012). The dried samples were submerged in different PEG/SDS solutions at different temperatures for different aging times. To determine the contact angle, an n-decane droplet was released and captured below the rock substrate which was initially submerged in distilled water. Then, images of the droplets were taken using a microscopic camera and used as input for the image analysis to determine the contact angle.|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a sawmill fl ow simulation model to identify production bottlenecks and determine where productivity improvements could be made. Sawmills often {{invest in a}} new machine center and then fi nd out that the processing bottleneck just moves somewhere else. Our approach was specifi cally designed to investigate the effects of such changes on the entire system. We determined that the trim-mer was the system bottleneck when both the small log and large log lines were running concomitantly. Under base case conditions, the model predicted an average board output of 13, 147 boards. An increase in the processing capability of the trimmer resulted in a shift of the bottleneck from the small log line to the large log line (at the edger). This bottleneck shift was further investigated and, by allowing the simulation model to manipulate machine settings for the trimmer and edger, {{it was able to}} maximize the modeled average board output to 17, 996 boards per shift (when edger set up times were not considered) and 16, 708 boards per shift (with edger setup times included).

40|$|Superconducting rf (SRF) {{cavities}} {{are traditionally}} fabricated from superconducting material sheets or made of copper coated with superconducting material, followed by <b>trim</b> <b>machining</b> and electron-beam welding. An alternative technique to traditional shaping methods, such as deep-drawing and spinning, is electrohydraulic forming (EHF). In EHF, half-cells are obtained through ultrahigh-speed deformation of blank sheets, using shockwaves induced in water by a pulsed electrical discharge. With respect to traditional methods, such a highly dynamic process can yield interesting results {{in terms of}} effectiveness, repeatability, final shape precision, higher formability, and reduced springback. In this paper, the first results of EHF on high purity niobium are presented and discussed. The simulations performed in order to master the multiphysics phenomena of EHF and to adjust its process parameters are presented. The microstructures of niobium half-cells produced by EHF and by spinning have been compared in terms of damage created in the material during the forming operation. The damage was assessed through hardness measurements, residual resistivity ratio (RRR) measurements, and electron backscattered diffraction analyses. It was found that EHF does not worsen the damage of the material during forming and instead, {{some areas of the}} half-cell have shown lower damage compared to spinning. Moreover, EHF is particularly advantageous to reduce the forming time, preserve roughness, and to meet the final required shape accuracy...|$|R
