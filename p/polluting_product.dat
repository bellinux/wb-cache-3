This effect is increasing with the amount of permits allocated to the leader. Moreover, the changes for price manipulation increase with those changes that tend to undermine the leader's advantage in output production or to reduce the leader's abatement cost...|$|E

China has already had the foundation to reform the current tax system to construct a separate environmental tax (SET) which is parallel to other taxes such as resources tax. Based on rich experiences in OECD countries, the challenges of environmental protection and socioeconomic conditions of China, a SET for China was designed, mainly including the systematic framework, function setting, four tax items, tax bases and rates, pollution charge reform, tax collecting model, potential tax income and influences of SET. Under the SET four tax items and bases are designed as emission tax item, <b>polluting</b> <b>product</b> tax item, ecological conservation tax item and carbon tax item It is expected that the revenue of SET amount to 233 billion RMB 1 yuan and is about 6 % of national fiscal income and 1. 1 % of GDP based on the tax base in 2006.

Using a revised cost allocation – referred to in this paper as environmental cost allocation – the paper contrasts overhead allocation between traditional cost allocation and environmental cost allocation. In addition, production cost derived from the traditional allocation of waste cost is compared with the revised environmental cost allocation. Findings indicate that a revised environmental cost allocation discloses more accurate overhead cost and hence production cost; and that management is motivated to make informed environmental management decisions if a product related environmental cost is made to reflect in the production cost of the <b>polluting</b> <b>product.</b> The paper highlights the practical significance of objective environmental cost allocation on corporate waste management, which thus creates a valuable awareness {{on the part of}} the management and accountants of firms in developing countries for the need to fine-tune the dominant traditional costing system.

40|$|Policy makers, {{industrialists}} {{and environmentalists}} express {{concern that the}} imposition of tough environmental policies in some countries displaces production, and hence pollution, to countries which impose less tough environmental policies. Yet empirical studies of such impacts suggest they are small. However, these findings are derived from models in which international trade is modelled as being perfectly competitive. In this paper I model trade as imperfectly competitive with scope for strategic behavior by producers, in this case investment in capital. I show that the choice of environmental policy instrument can have a marked impact on the incentives for producers to act strategically, with environmental standards significantly reducing the incentives for strategic overinvestment relative to environmental taxes or no environmental policy at all. Whether welfare is higher using standards or taxes depends on whether producing countries are also significant consumers of the <b>polluting</b> <b>product,</b> and on whether all producing governments act to reduce emissions or only some subset of governments. To assess the quantitative significance of these theoretical results I conduct policy simulations on a calibrated model of the world fertilizer industry. These simulations show {{that the impact of}} environmental policy on strategic behaviour can be large.

40|$|This review uses a {{multidisciplinary}} approach to investigate legal issues concerning the oceans and human health. It firstly seeks {{to define the}} boundaries of oceans and human health research. We use three case studies as examples: biomedical research, marine litter and human well-being. Biomedical research raises complex issues relating to coastal states’ sovereign rights to exploit their marine resources and the patenting processes. Coastal states have differing degrees of control over research at sea. There are differences in EU and US law over the status of genetic discoveries, with the US having stricter criteria to qualify for patent protection. International law sets the standard for bioprospecting in developing countries under the Nagoya Protocol. The cost and complexity of marine biomedical research mean that it cannot be left to commercial exploration and needs some public funding. The second case study highlights the rise in marine plastics pollution using Marine Conservation Society beachwatch data. It details the need to alter product design to avoid marine pollution and records an unsuccessful attempt by academics and an NGO {{to make contact with}} the manufacturers of one <b>polluting</b> <b>product.</b> It also introduces the concept that faulty design could amount to a public nuisance.

40|$|The recent {{revitalization}} {{of concern for}} environmental quality has generated many questions about the interaction between trade and the environment. Most of these questions {{have to do with}} the impact of environmental regulation on trade patterns and gains from trade. If a tradeoff is perceived, it is often argued that some intervention becomes appropriate: either a specific trade policy or the establishment of an international environmental standard. Present GATT policy then becomes an issue of debate. Should GATT revise its rules to accommodate the specific trade measures suggested? How can GATT ensure that the environmental objective is not a disguise for a trade barrier? Should GATT establish some international environmental standard with procedures to ensure compliance? The importance given to trade liberalization and exchange rate policy reform as part of adjustment for development has raised another set of questions: Is there a direct link between the removal of trade barriers and environmental degradation? If so, how should liberalization strategies incorporate this cost? Should trade policy be used to meet environmental objectives? The author surveys the literature on the main questions being debated in both of these areas. Among her conclusions: (1) More stringent regulations in one country are thought to result in reduced competitiveness and perhaps industrial flight and the development of pollution havens. The many empirical studies that have tried to test these hypotheses have shown no evidence to support them. (2) Countervailing duties or an international environmental standard have no place here. Both concepts ignore the reallocation of resources that must occur if externalities are to be efficiently incorporated into costs. They also ignore the fact that standards should be based on local calculations of marginal costs and benefits. Only if an exporter's standards are below what is locally optimal would a countervailing duty be justified. (3) Subsidies are likely to be trade barriers in disguise and should generally not be accommodated. They are not usually an efficient means of achieving an environmental objective and may hinder the efficient allocation of resources away from pollution-intensive industries. (4) Imposing a tariff when pollution spills over national boundaries can be no more than a second-best policy. If the tariff is based on damage to the victim country alone, it will not reduce trade in the <b>polluting</b> <b>product</b> enough; if it maximizes the welfare of the victim, it may reduce trade in the product too much. (5) There seems to be a case for establishing some international code of product standards, to prevent the use of such standards as nontariff barriers.

40|$|After fossil fuels, {{agricultural}} production and fisheries are industries {{with the largest}} {{impact on the environment}} in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the production of ruminant meats such as beef, veal or lamb. In order to reduce this environmental impact, consumers can change their food consumption habits to utilize less <b>polluting</b> <b>products</b> such as white meats or vegetable food products. We analyze whether or not a CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq) tax policy can change consumer habits with respect to meat and marine purchases, and using different indicators, we examine the effect of such a tax policy on the environment. We also infer the implications of such a tax on nutritional indicators as well as on consumer welfare. First, to evaluate the impact of a variation in the price of meat and marine products on consumption, we estimate a random coeficients logit demand model using purchase data from the French household panel Kantar Worldpanel. We define 28 meat and marine products, and divide them into eight meat and marine product categories. This model allows us to estimate flexible own- and cross-price elasticities of meat and marine products' demand. Results on the consumer purchase behavior model suggest that the demands for these products are fairly inelastic, and substitutions occur both within and between categories for all products. Moreover, using two levels of a CO 2 -eq tax (€ 56 and € 200 per tonne of CO 2 -eq per kilogram of product) applied to either all meat and marine products, only ruminant meats, or only beef, we show that a tax of € 56 leads to a very small change in GHG emissions, even if all meat and marine products are taxed. The most efficient scenario would be to tax only the beef category at a high level since it would allow a 70 % reduction in the total variation of GHG emissions, and would be responsible for only 20 % of the consumer welfare damages generated when all products are taxed...|$|R
