5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, {{primarily}} in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> their numbers. To fill the void left by {{the demise of}} the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. They lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> their numbers. The Iroquois and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that the Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there, though they did use the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it.|$|E
5|$|In 629, B'alaj Chan K'awiil, {{a son of}} the Tikal king K'inich Muwaan Jol II, {{was sent}} to found a new city at Dos Pilas, in the Petexbatún region, {{apparently}} as an outpost to extend Tikal's <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> the reach of Calakmul. For {{the next two decades}} he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal. In 648, king Yuknoom Ch'eenII of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan K'awiil. Yuknoom Ch'eenII then reinstated Balaj Chan K'awiil upon the throne of DosPilas as his vassal. He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul.|$|E

5|$|In a {{radio address}} on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve to stay in <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E

5|$|Rosas faced many {{threats to}} his power {{during the late}} 1830s and early 1840s. He fought a war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, endured a {{blockade}} by France, faced a revolt in his own province and battled a major rebellion that lasted for years and spread to several Argentine provinces. Rosas persevered and extended his influence in the provinces, exercising effective control over them through direct and indirect means. By 1848, he had extended his <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> the borders of Buenos Aires and was ruler of all of Argentina. Rosas also attempted to annex the neighbouring nations of Uruguay and Paraguay. France and Great Britain jointly retaliated against Argentine expansionism, blockading Buenos Aires {{for most of the}} late 1840s, but were unable to halt Rosas, whose prestige was greatly enhanced by his string of successes.|$|E

5|$|The Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks {{were the}} {{earliest}} recorded {{inhabitants of the}} West Branch Susquehanna River basin, which includes Quehanna Wild Area. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses. The Susquehannocks' numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the Iroquois exercised nominal control of the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. They also lived in long houses, primarily {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> their numbers. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged such displaced eastern tribes as the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware) to settle in the West Branch watershed.|$|E

25|$|Majapahit was {{the largest}} empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.

25|$|A {{constitutional}} convention, {{which had}} been called for in 1970 to replace the Commonwealth era 1935 Constitution, continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution {{went into effect in}} early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to parliamentary and allowing Marcos to stay in <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> 1973. The constitution was approved by 95% of the voters in the Philippine constitutional plebiscite.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-existing}} communes, which periodically redistributed land, {{did little}} to encourage improvement in technique, and formed a source of <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the control of the}} Soviet government. Although the income gap between wealthy and poor farmers did grow under the NEP, it remained quite small, but the Bolsheviks began to take aim at the wealthy kulaks. Clearly identifying this group was difficult, though, since only about 1% of the peasantry employed laborers (the basic Marxist definition of a capitalist), and 82% of the country's population were peasants.|$|E

25|$|Feeling {{threatened}} by Ottokar's growing regional <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> the Leitha River, his cousin King Béla IV of Hungary challenged the young king.

25|$|The first {{reference}} to an endowment by Joseph Smith, {{the founder of}} the Latter Day Saint movement, was in early 1831, some days after Smith was joined in his ministry by Sidney Rigdon, a newly converted Campbellite minister from Ohio. Rigdon's congregation also was converted to Smith's Church of Christ. Rigdon had apparently disagreed with the Campbellites in that he believed in a Pentecostal endowment of <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit endowed upon confirmation. While Rigdon believed the teachings of the early Mormon missionaries who converted him, he thought the missionaries were lacking in heavenly power.|$|E
25|$|In {{less than}} two years after his election, Somoza Garcia, defying the Conservative Party, {{declared}} his intention to stay in <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> his presidential term. Thus, in 1938, Somoza Garcia named a Constituent Assembly that gave the president extensive power and elected him for another eight-year term. A Constituent Assembly, extension of the presidential term from four years to six years, and clauses empowering the president to decree laws relating to the National Guard without consulting Congress, ensured Somoza's absolute control over the state and military. Control over electoral and legislative machinery provided the basis for a permanent dictatorship.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Burmese Army was {{organized}} into three general tiers: the Palace Guards, the Capital Defense Corps, {{and the field}} levies. Only the first two were the standing military.

The third, the field levies or conscripts, were usually raised just prior to or during wartime, and provided manpower to resist attacks and project <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> the boundaries of the empire. Most of the field levy served in the infantry but the men for the elephantry, cavalry, artillery and naval corps were drawn from specific hereditary villages that specialized in respective military skills.|$|E
25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to <b>power,</b> <b>beyond</b> all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence.

In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E
25|$|Taschereau {{introduced}} a measure in 1930 {{to create a}} Jewish board that would have provided for Jewish participation on the highest decision-making educational body in Quebec, the Quebec Council of Public Instruction.

As a result of the opposition, the Jewish leadership did not push the issue when Taschereau was forced to repeal the Act and submit a compromise which he had the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church examine and approve beforehand. In the resulting bill, Jews were sent back into the Protestant system, and the Jewish board had no <b>power</b> <b>beyond</b> the right to negotiate a deal with the Protestant School board.|$|E
