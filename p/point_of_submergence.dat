Beach, {{the executive}} officer—and later commander of Triton (SSRN-586) during the submarine's submerged circumnavigation of the globe—received the Navy Cross. The ship, herself, {{was awarded the}} Presidential Unit Citation.His medal of citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk of}} his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as commanding officer of the U.S.S. Tirante during the first war patrol of that vessel against enemy Japanese surface forces in the harbor of Cheju, Quelpart Island, off the coast of Korea, on 14 April 1945. With the crew at surface battle stations, Comdr. (then Lt. Comdr.) Street approached the hostile anchorage from the south within 1,200 yards m of the coast to complete a reconnoitering circuit of the island. Leaving the 10-fathom m curve far behind he penetrated the mined and shoal-obstructed waters of the restricted harbor despite numerous patrolling vessels and in defiance of 5 shore-based radar stations and menacing aircraft. Prepared to fight it out on the surface if attacked, Comdr. Street went into action, sending 2 torpedoes with deadly accuracy into a large Japanese ammunition ship and exploding the target in a mountainous and blinding glare of white flames. With the Tirante instantly spotted by the enemy as she stood out plainly in the flare of light, he ordered the torpedo data computer set up while retiring and fired his last 2 torpedoes to disintegrate in quick succession the leading frigate and a similar flanking vessel. Clearing the gutted harbor at emergency full speed ahead, he slipped undetected along the shoreline, diving deep as a pursuing patrol dropped a pattern of depth charges at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>submergence.</b> His illustrious record of combat achievement during the first war patrol of the Tirante characterizes Comdr. Street as a daring and skilled leader and reflects the highest credit upon himself, his valiant command, and the U.S. Naval Service.|$|E

The values developed typically ranges from about 0. 6 to 0. 85. However, specific discharge coefficient values for a particular configuration often appear contradictory. This is probably a result of variations in testing methods and operating conditions. The effect <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> is also not specifically identified as a parameter for determining the discharge coefficient. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} confidently select a discharge coefficient value from the available literature for an orifice operating under different levels <b>of</b> <b>submergence.</b> For this reason, a physical model was constructed at the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research to determine the effect <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> on a rectangular orifice with partially suppressed contractions.

30|$|Chlorophyll {{contents}} decreased due to submergence in rice even in tolerant cultivars (Sarkar et al. [1996]; Sarkar and Panda [2009]). The {{decline in}} the values of Fv/Fm ratio reflects {{a reduction in the}} ability of PS II to reduce the primary acceptor QA (Panda et al. [2006]). The cultivars tolerant to longer period <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> maintained the PS II functional and structural integrity better compared to SUB 1 introgression cultivars which showed less survival after 20 [*]days <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> (Table 1). Therefore, fluorescence characteristics hold the information of survival chance of a plant under long term submergence even within the SUB 1 rice cultivars (Figure 3, Table 2). The plant’s ability to survive for longer duration under extremely high water is, however, related to the storage organs (Crawford [1996]).

40|$|Adipocere is a late stage postmortem {{decomposition}} product that forms from the lipids present in soft tissue. Its formation in aquatic environments is typically {{related to the}} presence of a moist, warm, anaerobic environment, and the effect of decomposer microorganisms. The ideal temperature range for adipocere formation is considered to be 21 - 45 C and is correlated to the optimal conditions for bacterial growth and enzymatic release. However, adipocere formation has been reported in cooler aquatic environments at considerable depths. This study aimed to investigate the chemical process of adipocere formation in a cold freshwater environment in Lake Ontario, Canada. Porcine tissue was used as a human tissue analogue and submerged at two depths (i. e. 10 and 30 feet) in the trophogenic zone of the lake. Samples were collected at monthly postmortem submersion intervals and analysed using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy to provide a qualitative profile of the lipid degradation and adipocere formation process. Early stage adipocere formation occurred rapidly in the cold water environment and proceeded to intermediate stage adipocere formation by the second month of submersion. However, further adipocere formation was inhibited in the third month of the study when temperatures approached the freezing <b>point.</b> The depth <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> did not influence the chemical conversion process as similar stages of adipocere formation occurred at both depths investigated.

Our results showed that the relative growth rate (RGR) of C. brevicuspis significantly declined with increasing submergence time, and was higher in R 3 and R 5 than in R 1 plants under both submergence and post-submergence conditions. The concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs) was highest in R 3, intermediate in R 5, and the lowest in R 1 plants during the first two months <b>of</b> <b>submergence,</b> indicating an optimal trade-off between energy investment and vegetative growth (i. e., buds and ramets production) in C. brevicuspis. WSCs were significantly reduced with increasing submergence time, while the starch content was significantly reduced only during the third month <b>of</b> <b>submergence,</b> implying that WSCs were a direct energy source for C. brevicuspis during <b>submergence.</b> The number <b>of</b> buds was higher in R 5 than in R 3 and R 1 plants after two and three months <b>of</b> <b>submergence,</b> which directly resulted in a significantly higher post-submergence ramet production in R 5 plants. These results indicated that plants with relatively larger clone sizes display better tolerance to submergence stress and post-submergence growth recovery. Therefore, we speculate that the large clone size in C brevicuspis might be an effective adaptive mechanism to survive under submergence stress in floodplain wetlands. </p...|$|R

Methods We divided the water-level-fluctuation zone into nine elevational zones according to the Wusong Elevation criterion. We then observed seed submergence tolerance and the effects <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> on seed germination in a “water impoundment-water recession” cycle after seeds of the four species were sown in the nine elevational zones. Seed germination was divided into seeds with and without sand sediment on surface. Important findings Ripe seeds (or fruits) of the four species kept their vitality after submergence. The starting time for seed germination after the end <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> and seed germination duration both gradually decreased with decreasing elevation (p < 0. 01), and the starting time for seed germination was significantly reduced below 169 m (p < 0. 01).

40|$|The submergence-tolerant species Rumex palustris (Sm.) {{responds}} to complete submergence {{by an increase}} in petiole angle with the horizontal. This hyponastic growth, in combination with stimulated elongation of the petiole, can bring the leaf tips above the water surface, thus restoring gas exchange and enabling survival. Using a computerized digital camera set-up the kinetics of this hyponastic petiole movement and stimulated petiole elongation were studied. The hyponastic growth is a relatively rapid process that starts after a lag phase of 1. 5 to 3 h and is completed after 6 to 7 h. The kinetics of hyponastic growth depend on the initial angle of the petiole at the time <b>of</b> <b>submergence,</b> a factor showing considerable seasonal variation. For example, lower petiole angles at the time <b>of</b> <b>submergence</b> result in a shorter lag phase for hyponastic growth. This dependency of the hyponastic growth kinetics can be mimicked by experimentally manipulating the petiole angle at the time <b>of</b> <b>submergence.</b> Stimulated petiole elongation in response to complete submergence also shows kinetics that are dependent on the petiole angle at the time <b>of</b> <b>submergence,</b> with lower initial petiole angles resulting in a longer lag phase for petiole elongation. Angle manipulation experiments show that stimulated petiole elongation can only start when the petiole has reached an angle of 40 ° to 50 °.
