Starting in 1873 however, the government began to issue their own post cards measuring 130 x 75 mm. This lasted until May 19, 1898, when Congress passed the Private Mailing Card Act.|$|E

Governments have sometimes combined the functions of postage and revenue stamps. In the former British Empire, such stamps were often inscribed [...] "Postage and Revenue" [...] to reflect their dual function. Other countries have simply allowed revenue stamps to be used for postage or vice versa. A revenue stamp authorized subsequently for postal use is known as a postal fiscal. Bhutan, for instance, authorized the use of revenue stamps for postal purposes from 1955 until the first <b>proper</b> <b>postage</b> stamps of the country were issued in 1962. In the Stanley Gibbons catalog, this type of stamp has an F prefix.|$|E
