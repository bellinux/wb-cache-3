In addition, Jayden is dressed similar to the street urchin Gavroche in Les Misérables because the young boy <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> role on Broadway was also providing the voice of Control in Starlight.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{development}} of Pentangle, Jansch played a number of instruments: banjo, Appalachian dulcimer, recorder and concertina—on rare occasions he has even been known to play electric guitar. However, it is his acoustic guitar <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> was most notable.|$|E
5|$|An {{invitation}} {{was sent}} to the Launceston Cricket Club in February with a view to <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> March. The invitation was accepted but the match was delayed when the acceptance letter was not posted in time to reach the steamer transporting mail. The MCC repeated their invitation later in 1850. While the match was being arranged, legislation passed in the United Kingdom to separate the Port Phillip District, which was to be renamed as Victoria, from the colony of New South Wales. When news of this much anticipated decision reached the colony late in 1850, two weeks of celebrations were arranged in Melbourne to mark independence. The delayed cricket match, now scheduled for February 1851, became part of the general festivities, although formal independence did not come about until later in 1851. Furthermore, the fixture was to be the first Australian intercolonial match and was later considered the first first-class cricket match in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Now in her forties, Crosman was {{starting}} {{to move away from}} the strenuous sword-carrying, heavy costume adventures that she was popular in.

25|$|After {{the move}} to New York, Sun Ra and company plunged headlong into the experimentalism that they had only hinted at in Chicago. The music was often {{extremely}} loud and the Arkestra grew to include multiple drummers and percussionists. In recordings of this era, Ra began to use new technologies—such as extensive use of tape delay—to assemble spatial sound pieces that were far removed from earlier compositions such as Saturn. Recordings and live performances often featured passages for unusual instrumental combinations, and passages of collective <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> incorporated free improvisation. It {{is often difficult to}} tell where compositions end and improvisations begin.|$|E

25|$|Paganini was in {{possession}} of a number of fine string instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in Livorno, a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier Giuseppe Guarneri, for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> he refused to take it back. This particular violin {{came to be known as}} Il Cannone Guarnerius. On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{match of}} the 1903 season saw Cities defeat Stars 7-1 at the 'Pineapple-paddock'.

Other teams <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> season included Eskgroves (Brisbane), Milton, Wellingtons and Reliance (Ipswich). However, the game was still unsettled - the following year (1904) saw some of those teams not re-entering competition (the competition comprised eight teams: Blackstone Rovers A, Blackstone Rovers B, Bush Rats, Market, Milton, Norman Park, Rangers and Reliance).|$|E

25|$|In the Romantic era, Leipzig {{became a}} centre of {{trombone}} pedagogy. The trombone {{began to be}} taught at the new Musikhochschule founded by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Later, the Paris Conservatory and its yearly concours would also contribute to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, Karl Traugott Queisser, {{was the first in}} a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers penned works for Quiesser, including Ferdinand David (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra, Ernst Sachse and Friedrich August Belcke, whose solo works all remain popular today in Germany. Queisser almost single-handedly helped to reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany and began a tradition in trombone <b>playing</b> <b>that</b> is still practised there today. He championed and popularised Christian Friedrich Sattler's new tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.|$|E
