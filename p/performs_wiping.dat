40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementa-tion of a behavior that allows a robot with a compliant arm to <b>perform</b> <b>wiping</b> motions {{that are involved in}} bed baths. A laser-based operator-selection interface enables an operator to select an area to clean, and the robot autonomously <b>performs</b> a <b>wiping</b> motion using equilibrium point control. We evaluated the performance of the system by measuring the ability of the robot to remove an area of debris on human skin. We tested the performance of the behavior algorithm by commanding the robot to wipe off a 1 -inch square area of debris placed {{on the surface of the}} upper arm, forearm, thigh, and shank of a human subject. Using image processing, we determined the hue content of the debris and used this representation to determine the percentage of debris that remained on the arm after the robot completed the task. In our experiments, the robot removed most of the debris (> 96 %) on four parts of the limbs. In addition, the robot <b>performed</b> the <b>wiping</b> task using relatively low force (< 3 N).

5000|$|September {{explains}} that after helping Fringe {{division in the}} past, the Observers had stripped him of his Observer implant and performed a [...] "biological reversion" [...] to make him human. He and Walter had spent time together following this, taking the name Donald from Donald O'Connor from Singin' in the Rain. September further {{explains that}} in 2167, an experiment in developing human genes and sacrificing human emotion for intelligence, would eventually give birth to the emotionless Observers. The Observers developed asexual procreation techniques; {{in the case of}} Michael, he was born from September's genes but came out as an abnormality having both emotions and great intelligence. Michael normally would have been destroyed, but September decided to hide him in the past. September now suggests that by sending Michael forward in time to 2167, September would hope {{they would be able to}} prevent the experiment from being <b>performed,</b> <b>wiping</b> out the Observers from existence. Should this happen, time would possibly be reset from the point of the Observer's first interference with the past; Olivia (Anna Torv) takes this as a chance for them to see Etta again. Walter identifies that he was given the hologram of the plans for the device from Etta (as seen in [...] "Letters of Transit") that would be able to send Michael forward in time, which will be constructed from all of the components collected by following the tapes. The group, with September, take leave to recover an item in a nearby storage locker that is another component of the device.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{healthcare}} facilities, Clostridium difficile infections {{spread by}} transmission of bacterial spores. Appropriate sporicidal disinfectants {{are needed to}} prevent development of clusters and outbreaks. In this study different cleaning/disinfecting wipes and sprays were tested for their efficacy against spores of distinctive C. difficile PCR ribotypes. Methods Four different products were tested; 1) hydrogen peroxide 1. 5 %; 2) glucoprotamin 1. 5 %; 3) a mixture of ethanol, propane and N-alkyl amino propyl glycine; and 4) a mixture of didecyldimonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, polyaminopropyl, biguanide and dimenthicone as active ingredients. Tiles were contaminated with a test solution containing a concentration of 5 x 106 CFU/ml spores of C. difficile strains belonging to PCR ribotypes 010, 014 or 027. The tiles were left to dry {{for an hour and}} then wiped or sprayed with one of the sprays or wipes as intended by the manufacturers. When products neutralized after 5  min, microbiological cultures and ATP measures were performed. Results Irrespective of the disinfection method, the microbial count log 10 reduction of C. difficile PCR ribotype 010 was highest, followed by the reduction of C. difficile 014 and C. difficile 027. Overall, the <b>wipes</b> <b>performed</b> better than the sprays with the same active ingredient. On average, although not significantly, a difference in relative light units (RLU) reduction between the wipes and sprays was found. The wipes had a higher RLU log 10 reduction, but no significant difference for RLU reduction was observed between the different C. difficile strains (p =  0. 16). Conclusion C. difficile spores of PCR ribotypes 014 and 027 strains are more difficult to eradicate than non-toxigenic PCR ribotype 010. In general, impregnated cleaning/disinfection <b>wipes</b> <b>performed</b> better than ready-to-use sprays. Wipes with hydrogen peroxide (1. 5 %) showed the highest bactericidal activity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{modelling}} of {{the parameters}} {{that influence the}} continuous evaporation of an alcoholic extract was considered using Doehlert matrices. The work was <b>performed</b> with a <b>wiped</b> falling film evaporator that allowed us to study {{the influence of the}} pressure, temperature, feed flow and dry matter of the feed solution on the dry matter contents of the resulting concentrate, and the productivity of the process. The Doehlert shells were used to model the influential parameters. The pattern obtained from the experimental results was checked allowing for some dysfunction in the unit. The evaporator was modified and a new model applied; the experimental results were then in agreement with the equations. The model was finally determined and successfully checked in order to obtain an 8 % dry matter concentrate with the best productivity; the results fit in with the industrial constraints of subsequent processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} constrained motion for a manipulator performing a task while {{in contact with the}} environment, and proposes a solution based on projected operational space dynamics. The main advantages of this control technique are: it exploits the environment contact constraint itself, so as to minimise the joint torques needed to perform the task; it enables full decoupling of motion and force control; force feedback from a force sensor mounted at the end effector or other contact points is not needed. This work is a step towards a robot control strategy which mimics the human behaviour of exploiting contacts with the environment to help perform tasks. We present an experimental implementation of the control method in which a KUKA LWR IV manipulator uses an eraser to wipe a whiteboard, and we show that this controller can effectively exploit contact with the whiteboard in order to reduce joint torques while still <b>performing</b> the desired <b>wiping</b> motion...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Possible {{contamination}} in nuclear medicine centers, {{in addition to}} health problems, affect the tests and much effort and cost is required for decontamination. Given the effects of ionizing radiation on human health, rules and regulations have been enacted to avoid contamination, that in working with radioactive materials should be followed to minimize them.. Material and Method: After mapping of nuclear medicine centers in the province, areas that should be studied for measuring the amount of radioactive contamination were determined. The site selection for the tests {{were based on the}} area in which the possibility of further contamination were existance. After measuring the background count rate the radioactive {{contamination in}} studied areas were <b>performed</b> using <b>Wipe</b> Test.. Result: The mean level of background contamination in centers 1, 2 and 3 were 1. 75 ± 0. 150 μCi, 4. 43 ± 0. 615 μCi and 2. 47 ± 0. 055 μCi, respectively. In center 1, only region of Hood pollution was much higher than the permissible limit. In center 2, radioactive contamination of the waiting room, patient rooms, warehouse radiotracer, control room, hood, desk and floor center was exceeded. Also, in center 3, contamination of the doorway, hallway patients, control room, hood, desk, sink, cabinets, room and floor imaging injection (control), respectively, were higher than the permissible limits.. Conclusion: In centers 1 and 2, most of the radioactive contamination occurred under the hood due to labeling of radiopharmaceuticals activity. Also, in center 3, the highest contamination rate belonged to patients’ corridor that could be due to frequent the area. According to this subject, necessary measures in this regard should be considered by the department responsible for health physics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObject: Environmental {{monitoring}} {{is usually}} conducted by surface sampling {{to detect and}} quantify the presence of cytotoxic drugs after their reconstitution and administration. This technique reveals the origins of residual contamination and {{is an important component}} in order to protect healthcare workers from the potential risk of occupational exposure. The aim of this work is to compare various techniques and results of surface sampling for cytotoxics. Materials and methods: For each technique, sample processing methods and their analysis were compared from literature data. Sampling is often <b>performed</b> by the <b>wiping</b> technique. After treatment, various single or multi-compound technical analyses are used, in particular liquid or gas chromatography involving different detection methods: ultraviolet, mass spectrometry, plasma torch, voltammetry. Some methods are validated to ensure reliability. Results: Despite published guidelines and the use of isolator technology for the preparation of cytotoxic drugs, workplace contamination persists, leading to chemotherapeutic agents’ exposure of healthcare workers. Efforts need to be maintained with particular emphasis on harmonization and on determining alert level for cytotoxic contamination...|$|R
