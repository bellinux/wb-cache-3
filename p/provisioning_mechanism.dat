40|$|Mobility {{management}} in heterogeneous networks {{is an important}} area since the mobile network may be moving between multiple types of access networks which involve several service providers such as 802. 11 b WLAN, 802. 16 WiMAX and UMTS Networks. In crowded environments, the bottleneck is often between the access link and the mobile network. Being able to prioritize the traffic and allocate a minimum bandwidth guarantee for each user is crucial in this environment. This study presents a novel dynamic QoS <b>provisioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> for network mobility in heterogeneous networks integrated with IEEE 802. 21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol.

Thereby, fault tolerance in clouds receives {{a great deal of}} attention in both industry and academia, especially for real-time applications due to their safety critical nature. Large amounts of researches have been conducted to realize fault tolerance in distributed systems, among which fault-tolerant scheduling plays a significant role. However, few researches on the fault-tolerant scheduling study the virtualization and the elasticity, two key features of clouds, sufficiently. To address this issue, this paper presents a fault-tolerant mechanism which extends the primary-backup model to incorporate the features of clouds. Meanwhile, for the first time, we propose an elastic resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the fault-tolerant context to improve the resource utilization. On the basis of the fault-tolerant mechanism and the elastic resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>mechanism,</b> we design novel fault-tolerant elastic scheduling algorithms for real-time tasks in clouds named FESTAL, aiming at achieving both fault tolerance and high resource utilization in clouds. Extensive experiments injecting with random synthetic workloads as well as the workload from the latest version of the Google cloud tracelogs are conducted by CloudSim to compare FESTAL with three baseline algorithms, i. e., Non-M igration-FESTAL (NMFESTAL), Non-Overlapping-FESTAL (NOFESTAL), and Elastic First Fit (EFF).

In the second phase, a heuristic algorithm, namely Most Cost Effective Providers’ Resources First (MCEPRF), is presented that the CMB needs to execute to minimize users' usage cost and also minimizes the cost of provisioning of on-demand instances for cloud resource providers.
