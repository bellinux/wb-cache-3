25|$|On 24 October 1411 the king's council issued {{orders for}} the Constable of the Tower or his {{lieutenant}} to receive Cokayne into custody, together with several other Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire knights. Cokayne's imprisonment coincided with apparent triumph of the faction headed by the Beauforts and the Prince and their <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> in the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. Only two days earlier an English expedition had accompanied John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy, in taking Paris. However, it is unlikely Cokayne {{was the victim of}} a political purge, as Leche was included with him in the round-up. Neither headed the list: rather it was Thomas Chaworth, who had been involved in a violent feud with Sir Walter Tailboys. Then came Richard Stanhope and John Zouche, who had a bitter property dispute of their own, which also involved John Leek, who completed the list. John Finderne was added by a separate letter. The imprisoned knights may all {{have been involved in the}} quarrel between Cokayne and Leche or the internecine Lancastrian rivalries but the principle of selection may simply have been one of removing gentry miscreants temporarily from the region. On 6 November the constable was informed of arrangements for the trial of the imprisoned men and not until 30 November, after they had been kept out of circulation for more than five weeks, was their release ordered.|$|E

2500|$|His <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> with North Korea {{has been}} termed the Sunshine Policy. He moved to begin détente with the {{communist}} government in North Korea, which {{culminated in a}} historic summit meeting in 2000 in Pyongyang with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. This marked a critical juncture in inter-Korean relations, and the two Koreas have had direct {{contact with each other}} since. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts. However, the historic event was tainted significantly by allegations that at least several hundred million dollars had been paid to Pyongyang. His Chief of Staff, Park Ji-Won, was sentenced to twelve years in prison in 2003 for, among other charges, his role in the Hyundai payment to North Korea for the North–South summit. Also in order to persuade North Korea to attend the summit, several [...] "unconverted long-term prisoners" [...] kept by South Korea were released and returned to North Korea.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, {{work was}} banned on Sunday (forcing Jews to either work on Shabbat or lose income), posters in foreign {{languages}} were prohibited, {{and the authority}} of rabbinical courts to rule on commercial cases was taken away. As {{in countries such as}} Hungary and Romania, a significant current of antisemitism grew in inner Salonica, but [...] "never reached the level of violence in these two countries". It was very much driven by Greek arrivals from Asia Minor, mostly poor and in direct competition with Jews for housing and work. This current of sentiment was, nevertheless, relayed by the Makedonia daily, which was close to Venizelos' Liberal Party, and the National Union of Greece (Ethniki Enosis Ellados, EEE) ultra-nationalist organization accusing the Jewish population of not wanting to blend in with the Greek nation, and viewing the development of Communism and Zionism in the community with suspicion.

40|$|The {{first half}} of 2001 saw {{traditional}} issues dominating the foreign policy agenda, with both Australia 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with the United States and the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> Asian <b>engagement</b> still holding centre stage. But those old issues generated fresh anxieties. In the United States, the incoming Bush administration displayed a genuine radicalism in its approach to foreign policy, and that raised concerns in many Western capitals — including Canberra — about a new mood of unilateralism in Washington. At the same time, {{the emergence of the}} thesis that Australia was becoming a "branch office economy", where key decisions were taken in the capital markets of New York and London, made the government noticeably more cautious and selective in its endorsement of globalisation. Further, the issue <b>of</b> Asian <b>engagement</b> grew steadily more complex: Australian policy-makers searched unsuccessfully for a new focus for the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> Asian <b>engagement,</b> as Japan 2 ̆ 7 s economy wallowed and Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s democratic government tottered...|$|R

Mongolia also provided assistance to the North during the Korean War. The two countries signed their first friendship and cooperation treaty in 1986. Kim Il-sung also {{paid a visit to}} the country in 1988. However, relations became strained {{after the collapse of the}} Communist government in Mongolia between 1989 and 1991. The two countries nullified their earlier friendship and cooperation treaty in 1995, and in 1999, the DPRK closed its embassy in Ulaanbaatar during an official visit by Kim Dae-jung, the first-ever such visit by a South Korean president.

5000|$|Once the Republic of Texas was {{declared}} and had secured some sovereignty in their war with Mexico, the Texas government under President Sam Houston pursued a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> with the Comanches and Kiowa. Ironically, since Houston {{had lived with}} the Cherokee, the republic faced a conflict called the Cordova Rebellion, in which Cherokees appear to have joined with Mexican forces to fight the fledgling country. Houston resolved the conflict without resorting to arms, refusing {{to believe that the}} Cherokee would take up arms against his government. [...] The Lamar administration, which followed Houston, took a very different policy towards the Indians. Under Lamar Texas removed the Cherokee to the west. With that policy in place, the Texas government sought to deport the Comanches and Kiowa. This led to a series of battles, including the Council House Fight, in which, at a peace parley, the Texas militia killed a number of Comanche chiefs and the resulting Great Raid of 1840 and the Battle of Plum Creek.|$|E
50|$|On {{the heels}} of his 'Cross of Iron' speech in April 1953, President Eisenhower was {{increasingly}} concerned about the trajectory of US foreign policy, in as much as it leaned heavily toward militancy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. One component of Eisenhower's campaign platform was harsh criticism of unsustainable military expenditures, given the risk such expenditures posed to the stability and long term growth potential of the US economy. Senior figures in his administration were at odds over the nature of the United States' <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> towards the Soviet Union, with much of the disagreement drawn between two camps in his administration: a group of senior officials who asserted that the only viable means of defending the United States against Soviet expansionism was to actively combat and 'roll back' the sphere of Soviet influence lest it be allowed to threaten United States' sovereignty, and those who supported the 'strategy of containment' as espoused by George F. Kennan, the author of the Long Telegram and director of the Policy Planning staff at the US Department of State.|$|E

According to his own statements, he {{became a member of the}} North's ruling party, the Workers' Party of Korea, at that time; he claimed that this was a requirement for entering North Korea in those days. He would visit North Korea 18 more times in the following years. Though he did not travel to the South at all during this time, he continued to pay attention to political events in his homeland; he organised large-scale protests in Berlin in 1980 over the violent suppression of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, which culminated in a 1500-person march down the Kurfürstendamm, a main avenue in Berlin. In 1982, he began teaching at the University of Münster. He met Kim Il-sung personally in 1991; in 1994, he was the only South Korean to attend Kim's funeral (though he had already taken up German citizenship the previous year).|$|E

In reading the explicit policies that dictate the political system, there are examples of both direct election and promotions from within. The election rules show the principles of organization that have developed to organize the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest country into local and administrative areas. Looking at specific examples of individual politicians demonstrates a trend towards appointing wealthy economic players to positions reserved previously for Communist Party bureaucrats.
