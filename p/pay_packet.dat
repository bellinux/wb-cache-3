The room included a private bar, and a red light outside the door warned when Rose {{was not to be}} disturbed. Rose carried the sole key to this room around her neck, and Fred installed a separate doorbell to the household which Rose's clients were instructed to ring whenever they wished to engage in sex with her. Much of the money earned from Rose's prostitution was spent on home improvements.|$|R

It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' <b>pay</b> <b>packets.</b> In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|R

40|$|Income and {{economic}} equality {{have been on}} the rise in recent decades – but has this trend been fuelled only by increasing <b>pay</b> <b>packets</b> for the richest, or has wealth inequality risen as well? Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman find that {{over the past three decades}} the share of household wealth owned by the top 0. 1 percent has increased from 7 to 22 percent. They write that the growing indebtedness of most Americans through mortgage and credit card obligations, combined with the collapse in the value of their assets during the Great Recession, and stagnant real wages have led to the erosion of the wealth share of the bottom 90 percent of families. They warn that without policies to reduce the concentration of wealth, such as estate taxes, within two decades the gains in wealth democratization which occurred in the New Deal and after World War II may well be lost...|$|R

50|$|The first dispute {{involving}} nurses {{took place}} when student nurses opened their first NHS <b>pay</b> <b>packets</b> in July 1948. Despite having received a modest pay rise, {{an increase in}} National Insurance contributions meant their take home pay had gone down. Outraged students at St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow, organised a protest rally and a march, threatening to resign en masse if their demands for better pay, shorter hours and general improvements in conditions weren't met. The march made headlines but won few concessions from the Ministry of Health. Complaints from student nurses about poor conditions, long hours and low pay were common {{for much of the}} post-war period. Up to the 1970s student nurses were responsible for as much as 75% of the physical labour on hospital wards and were often subject to intense disciplinary regimes both on the wards and in their private lives, with many student nurses living in strictly-supervised hospital nurses' accommodation.|$|R

Little himself was injured during the match, and did not play again that season. Cartilage problems in both knees restricted him to just seven appearances in four seasons - the Derby Daily Telegraph described him as [...] "well known in the South {{as one of the}} unluckiest men who ever received a <b>pay</b> <b>packet</b> from the Plymouth Argyle club" [...] - and he was made available on a free transfer in 1924.|$|E

5000|$|New signings for the 2008-09 season {{started in}} earnest in March with the {{official}} announcements of Simon Colosimo from Perth, Mark Bridge and Stuart Musialik from Jets and a new marquee player in John Aloisi from the Mariners reportedly with a <b>pay</b> <b>packet</b> of up to A$1.4m a season. [...] With Aloisi joining as the marquee and other signings being under the salary cap, Sydney were unable to retain Brazilian Juninho at the club and he was unceremoniously released during the off-season. Ruben Zadkovich was snatched up by Newcastle but ended up heading over to England on a reported 2-year contract with relegated Premier League team Derby County. Manly United young gun Chris Payne caught Kosmina's eye during a pre-season trial and signed the youngster on a 2-year youth contract.

5000|$|Taylor {{achieved}} notoriety outside academe in 2009 with an NYT {{op-ed piece}} entitled [...] "End the University As We Know It" [...] (Apr. 27), {{in which he}} advocated the end of tenure and academic departments. He followed it up quickly with a book in which he expanded on his reform, Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities (Knopf, 2010). Critics accused Taylor of hypocrisy, writing as a tenured Columbia professor drawing annual salary and benefits estimated at over $200,000, and charged him, after a career spent in elite private colleges, of being {{out of touch with}} the work loads and <b>pay</b> <b>packets</b> of faculty at non-elite institutions. Reviewer David Bell wrote of Taylor's book, [...] "Its logic is fragile and its evidence is thin," [...] and called it [...] "unbelievably misguided," [...] mocking Taylor's [...] "enraptured" [...] invocation of interdisciplinarity and conflation of [...] "forms of communication and forms of knowledge." ...|$|R
500|$|The Coinage Act of 1873 ended {{production}} of the standard silver dollar and authorized creation of the Trade dollar, thus concluding the Seated Liberty dollar series. [...] The Trade dollar was slightly heavier than the standard dollar and was intended for use in payments in silver to merchants in China. [...] Although not meant {{for use in the}} United States, a last-minute rider gave it legal tender status there up to $5. When silver prices plummeted in the mid-1870s, millions appeared in circulation, at first in the West and then throughout the United States, causing problems in commerce when banks insisted on the $5 legal tender limit. [...] Other abuses followed, such as purchase by companies for bullion value (by then about $0.80) for use in <b>pay</b> <b>packets.</b> Workers had little option but to accept them as dollars. [...] In response to complaints, Congress ended any status as legal tender in 1876, halted {{production of}} the Trade dollar (except for collectors) in 1878, and agreed to redeem any which had not been chopmarked in 1887.|$|R
500|$|The {{abolition}} of the half dime, still circulating in the Far West, led to shortages of small change there. Congress tried to address this with the unpopular twenty-cent piece, which was struck for circulation only in 1875 and 1876 and {{was rejected by the}} public for its similarity to the quarter dollar. The Western United States was not fully supplied with small change until the Mint began striking cents there in 1908 and five-cent nickels in 1912. The Trade dollar, struck principally to compete with Mexican dollars in the Far East trade, failed to gain full acceptance in the Orient. [...] Many were returned to (or never left) the United States. As they could be purchased at a discount, they were popular among employers, who placed them in workers' <b>pay</b> <b>packets.</b> In 1876, Congress revoked even the limited legal tender status they enjoyed; in 1878, the Mint stopped striking them except for collectors, and even that limited issue ceased after 1885. [...] In 1887, Congress allowed a six-month window during which they could be redeemed for other currency, provided they had not been chopmarked by Asian merchants.|$|R
