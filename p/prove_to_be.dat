40|$|Abstract. A {{constructive}} {{proof of}} the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem [9] has been completed using the Coq proof assistant. Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primitive recursive. The weak axiom system <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essentially incomplete. In particular, Peano arithmetic <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R
