40|$|ABSTRACT: The current CMS silicon pixel {{detector}} as {{the innermost}} {{component of the}} CMS ex-periment is performing well at LHC design luminosity, but {{would be subject to}} severe inefficiencies at LHC peak luminosities of 2 × 1034 cm− 2 s− 1. Therefore, an upgrade of the CMS pixel detector is planned, including a new readout chip. The chip design comprises additional on-chip buffer cells as well as high-speed data links and low-threshold comparators in the <b>pixel</b> <b>cells.</b> With these changes the upgraded pixel detector will be able to maintain or even improve the efficiency of the current detector at the increased requirements imposed by high luminosities and pile-up. The effects of these design changes on e. g. position resolution and charge collection efficiency were studied in detail using a precision tracking telescope at the DESY test beam facilities. The high telescope track resolution enables precise studies of tracking efficiency, charge sharing and collection even within single <b>pixel</b> <b>cells</b> of the device under test.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a new method {{to reduce the}} impact of circuit from the FPN. The FPN will {{decrease}} the signal clarity of fingerprint output for a capacitive fingerprint sensor.

However, there still exist some variations for each circuit of <b>pixel</b> <b>cell</b> although the structure of each circuit is logical same. For example,the threshold voltage (Vt) might be different for each transistor versus the variation of process. Thus, the design of reducing FPN with a minimum effort will be the main goal in our research. 第一章	緒論	 1 1. 1 	研究動機	 1 1. 2 	研究方法	 3 1. 3 	內容大綱	 4 第二章	背景知識與相關研究	 5 2. 1 	指紋特性	 6 2. 2 	感測器種類斷	 7 2. 2. 1 光學式感測	 7 2. 2. 2 壓力式感測	 9 2. 2. 3 熱感式感測 10 2. 2. 4 超音波感測 11 2. 2. 5 電容式感測 12 2. 3 	各樣式感測器比較	 13 2. 4 	像素陣列讀取方式	 14 2. 5 	相關文獻探討	 16 2. 5. 1 電路回顧	 16 2. 5. 2 固定圖像雜訊(Fixed-Pattern Noise, FPN) 	 20 第三章	研究內容	 23 3. 1 	電路架構簡介	 24 3. 2 	感測電路(Sense Circuit) 	 25 3. 3 	增益放大(Gain Amp) 	 28 3. 4 	取樣與保持電路(Sample/Hold Circuit) 	 32 3. 5 單一像素電路圖	 35 第四章	實驗結果	 39 4. 1 蒙地卡羅分析模擬	 39 4. 2 單一像素全圖電路模擬	 44 4. 3 電源變異對電路之影響模擬	 46 4. 4 電容Cs變異對電路輸出之影響模擬	 47 4. 5 晶片設計流程	 48 4. 6 電路佈局與模擬	 49 4. 7 電路規格	 51 第五章	結論與未來工作	 52 參考文獻	 5...|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the high}} {{luminosity}} phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) to start operation around 2026, a major upgrade of the tracker system for the ATLAS experiment is in preparation. The expected neutron equivalent fluence of up to 2. 4 * 1 e 16 1 MeV neq. /cm 2 at the innermost layer of the pixel detector poses the most severe challenge. Thanks to their low material budget and high charge collection efficiency after irradiation, modules made of thin planar pixel sensors are promising candidates to instrument these layers. To optimise the sensor layout for the decreased <b>pixel</b> <b>cell</b> size of 50 * 50 μm 2, TCAD device simulations are being performed to investigate the charge collection efficiency before and after irradiation. In addition, sensors of 100 - 150 μm thickness, interconnected to FE-I 4 read-out chips featuring the previous generation <b>pixel</b> <b>cell</b> size of 50 * 250 μm 2, are characterised with testbeams at the CERN-SPS and DESY facilities. The performance of sensors with various designs, irradiated up to a fluence of 1 * 1 e 16 neq. /cm 2, is compared in terms of charge collection and hit efficiency. A replacement of the two innermost pixel layers is foreseen during the lifetime of HL-LHC. The replacement will require several months of intervention, during which the remaining detector modules cannot be cooled. They are kept at room temperature, thus inducing an annealing. The performance of irradiated modules will be investigated with testbeam campaigns and the method of accelerated annealing at higher temperatures.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} new 3 D and planar silicon pixel sensors designed for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Phase- 2 Upgrade at High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The project is funded by INFN and sensors are produced in collaboration with the FBK foundry. The HL-LHC will operate at an instantaneous luminosity approximately 5 times larger than the original LHC design, significantly increasing the number of concurrent collisions per bunch crossing, the integrated luminosity delivered to the experiments and, as a consequence, the radiation dose that the detectors will have to sustain. In order to cope with these future conditions, upgrades to the detectors are required. This is necessary for the pixel tracker that is the closest to the interaction point and will be replaced. In this paper, the results, from beam tests performed at Fermilab Test Beam Facility, of thin (100 μm and 130 μm thick) n-in-p type sensors, assembled into hybrid single chip modules bump bonded to the PSI 46 dig readout chip, will be presented.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 73). This study investigates experimentally the photovoltaic {{behavior and}} performance of a new pixilated architecture of large organic photovoltaic panels made of a large array of high-aspect ratio three-dimensional pillars surrounded by a matrix of polymer photoactive material. A least addressed problem in organic and thin-film solar cells is the high bulk resistance of cathodic and anodic layers that result in drastic reduction of currents and power conversion efficiency (PCE). For such panels to be practical and commercially competitive, this huge bulk-resistance has to be minimized as much as possible. In this study, therefore, we introduce a new novel architecture that essentially compartmentalizes large panels into smaller modules that are connected {{to each other in}} a parallel fashion. In this architecture, the metal cathode layer is applied on the top as a series of lines whereas the anodic layer is independently connected to the pixilated cells at the bottom. As a result, these modules act like independent <b>pixel</b> <b>cells</b> wherein the damage from process and operation is limited individual <b>pixel</b> <b>cells.</b> The factors considered in validating the pixilated architecture presented here consisted of effect of number of pixels on efficiency and bulk electrical resistance.
