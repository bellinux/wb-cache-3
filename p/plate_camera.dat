25|$|His style {{combined}} {{traditional and}} modern motifs. Alonge took portraits outdoors {{with a large}} format, glass <b>plate</b> <b>camera</b> and a locally made studio backdrop. Using kerosene lanterns, he developed the glass plate negatives at night and contact printed the images on gaslight paper. Reading instruction booklets from Kodak and Ilford, he taught himself to mix his own chemicals and use sunlight to develop his prints. In 1940, Alonge began to retouch, sepia tone, and hand-color his photographs. When electricity came to Benin in 1945, {{he was able to}} take studio portraits and develop his photos indoors. Alonge's first camera was a Kodak Brownie; later, he used a Rolleiflex and other 35 mm cameras, and finally high-speed film.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} the Crimean War in the mid-19th century, photographers were using the novel {{technology}} of the [...] glass <b>plate</b> <b>camera</b> to record images of British soldiers in the field. As a result, they {{had to deal with}} not only war conditions, but their pictures often required long shutter speeds, and they had to prepare each plate before taking the shot and develop it immediately after. This led to, for example, Roger Fenton traveling around in a transportable dark room, which at times made him a target of the enemy. These technological barriers are why he was unable to obtain any direct images of the action.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{advances}} in low-cost photography {{made possible by}} Eastman, <b>plate</b> <b>cameras</b> still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered {{a larger number of}} exposures per loading, many inexpensive <b>plate</b> <b>cameras</b> from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for <b>plate</b> <b>cameras</b> allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm <b>cameras</b> to use <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of films enabled the existing designs for <b>plate</b> <b>cameras</b> {{to be made}} much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged {{so that it could}} be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed vest pocket cameras. Folding rollfilm cameras were preceded by folding <b>plate</b> <b>cameras,</b> more compact than other designs.|$|R

50|$|All lenses can {{be focused}} {{by moving the}} lens {{assembly}} towards or away from the film ("unit focusing"), and the Tessar is no exception.

50|$|After {{several years}} of camera {{production}} in New York City, the Semmendinger & Sons business moved across the river to Fort Lee, NJ.

50|$|Glass {{plates were}} later {{replaced}} by sheet film {{in a dark}} slide for sheet film; adaptor sleeves were made to allow sheet film {{to be used in}} plate holders. In addition to the ground glass, a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted. Cameras which take single exposures on sheet film and are functionally identical to <b>plate</b> <b>cameras</b> were used for static, high-image-quality work; much longer in 20th century, see Large-format camera, below.|$|R
50|$|Vivex was a {{wash-off}} relief process {{using three}} negatives on waxed cellophane, one for each primary colour. It was a subtractive process, using cyan, magenta, and yellow primaries. The three negative plates could be exposed in sequence using a special automated camera back (designed for <b>plate</b> <b>cameras)</b> or simultaneously via the company's own VIVEX Tri-Colour Camera. After processing, the three negatives were printed {{on top of one}} another by hand to obtain the final print.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} cameras {{produced in}} significant numbers used sensitised glass <b>plates</b> were <b>plate</b> <b>cameras.</b> Light entered a lens {{mounted on a}} lens board which was separated from the plate by an extendible bellows.There were simple box <b>cameras</b> for glass <b>plates</b> but also single-lens reflex cameras with interchangeable lenses and even for color photography (Autochrome Lumière).

50|$|DB {{dropped out}} of school at age 16 and began {{pursuing}} aspirations of being a photographer. He attempted this with little success. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he worked as an assistant to multiple photographers, one of whom specialized in photographing works of art using large <b>plate</b> <b>cameras.</b> Another was Peter (Kodik) Gravelle, the punk rock photographer responsible for many of the Stiff Records sleeves. Some photos taken by DB did make it to print, including sessions he did for the Flying Lizards.|$|R

50|$|After leaving {{school in}} 1894, Sutermeister took up {{photography}} using a glass <b>plate</b> <b>camera</b> to document {{everyday life in}} Milton and the surrounding area.

Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during WWII.|$|E
50|$|License plate capture is {{typically}} performed by specialized cameras {{designed specifically for}} the task, although new software techniques are being implemented that support any I.P.-based surveillance camera and increase the utility of ANPR for perimeter security applications. Factors which pose difficulty for license <b>plate</b> imaging <b>cameras</b> include {{the speed of the}} vehicles being recorded, varying level of ambient light, headlight glare and harsh environmental conditions. Most dedicated license <b>plate</b> capture <b>cameras</b> will incorporate infrared illumination in order to solve the problems of lighting and plate reflectivity.|$|R
