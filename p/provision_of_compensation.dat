50|$|James Hardie {{had been}} {{structured}} {{as a parent}} company operating through subsidiaries since the 1930s. All asbestos operations, including the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation,</b> were undertaken by James Hardie's subsidiaries, principally James Hardie and Coy and Hardie-Ferodo (later known as Jsekarb). Between 1995 and 2000, James Hardie (the parent company) began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries (since renamed Amaca and Amaba respectively), whilst leaving them {{with most of the}} asbestos liabilities of the James Hardie group. In 2001 these two companies were separated from James Hardie and acquired by the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation (MRCF) which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for Hardie's asbestos liabilities. Then CEO of James Hardie, Peter McDonald, made public announcements emphasising that the MRCF had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that James Hardie would not give it any further substantial funds. Indeed, the net assets of the MRCF were A$293 million, mostly in real estate and loans, and exceeded the 'best estimate' of $286 million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by James Hardie. The Jackson Report found that this 'best estimate' was 'wildly optimistic' and the estimates of future liabilities was 'far too low'. After this separation, James Hardie moved offshore to the Netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders. To make this move, the company had to assure Australian courts (as it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange) that the MRCF would be able to meet future liabilities. The courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its Australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to MRCF obliging the new Dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed. The value of the call at the time was $1.9 billion. The move to the Netherlands therefore proceeded. However, the tax benefits which James Hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the United States in 2001 and later with the United States signing a new trade agreement with the Netherlands in 2006. While the move to the Netherlands resulted in tax savings of $US85.5 million over seven years, in 2009 James Hardie had to pay the Australian Taxation Office $AU153 million after an audit of the 2001 move showed James Hardie had violated the Income Tax Assessment Act. Also in 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service alleged that James Hardie had not been in compliance with the US-Dutch treaty since it had been implemented in 2006 and claimed $US37 million in unpaid taxes plus $US10 million in interest and penalties.|$|E

Results showed that offers of compensation by group representatives resulted in more favorable evaluations of the group and higher identification than when no compensation was offered, but only when the compensation was construed as a benevolent gesture and only when the injustice was identity relevant. Even unsuccessful attempts to compensate the victim resulted in positive reactions towards the group.

For example, 12 out of 24 households questioned in the village migrated to Chukumuchu and established homesteads in 1995 and 1996.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature has}} pointed out several stylized facts about Executive Compensation Schemes. In particular, {{with respect to the}} sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to shareholder wealth, three findings stand out. First, the short-run response <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to performance is lower than the one implied by static agency models. Second, the cumulative response is considerably higher. Finally, the sensitivity is inversely proportional to firm size. In this paper, building on work by Wang (1997), we model the relationship between shareholders and their CEO as a repeated principal-agent relationship with hidden action. We introduce two innovations with respect to the existing literture. First, the scale of operations (level of capital stock) is determined optimally by the CEO, conditionally on the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> contract and on the evolution of the technology's productivity. Second, and most importantly, in our setup the action of the CEO has an impact on both current and future levels of firm's productivity. We are able to show by means of numerical simulation that the optimal compensation scheme in this environment displays features that are qualitatively in line with the empirical evidence on pay-performance sensitivity. ...|$|R
