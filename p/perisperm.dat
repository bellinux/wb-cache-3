2500|$|Originally, {{by analogy}} with the animal ovum, the outer {{nucellus}} layer (<b>perisperm)</b> {{was referred to}} as albumen, and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as [...] "albuminous". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with starch, as for instance cereal grains, or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as [...] "fleshy" [...] or [...] "cartilaginous" [...] with thicker soft cells such as coconut, but may also be oily as in Ricinus (castor oil), Croton and Poppy. The endosperm is called [...] "horny" [...] when the cell walls are thicker such as date and coffee, or [...] "ruminated" [...] if mottled, as in nutmeg, palms and Annonaceae.|$|E
