Here we find 6 families of Galois coverings, all with (Formula <b>presented.)</b> <b>and</b> (Formula <b>presented.)</b> <b>and</b> we show that these are the only families with (Formula presented.) satisfying this sufficient condition. We show that among these examples two families yield new Shimura subvarieties of (Formula presented.), while the other examples arise from certain Shimura subvarieties of (Formula presented.) already obtained as families of Galois coverings of (Formula presented.) in Frediani et al.
