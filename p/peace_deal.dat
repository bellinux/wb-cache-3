5|$|Under American protection, Iraqi Kurdistan {{had evolved}} into a {{successful}} semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped lead to a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> in 1999 between the major Iraqi Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in northern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising {{erupted in}} central Vietnam, {{in which some}} Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest against the war, hoping to end foreign {{involvement}} in Vietnam and end the conflict through a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> with the communists. The VNQDD remained implacably opposed to any coexistence with the communists. Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics, collected arms, and engaged in pro-war street clashes with the Buddhists, forcing elements of the ARVN to intervene to stop them.|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh <b>peace</b> <b>deal,</b> but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E
40|$|The {{regularity}} {{with which}} <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> {{break down and}} civil wars resume is well established. This briefing looks at the factors that drive violent conflicts, and the factors that may undermine <b>peace</b> <b>deals,</b> including those brokered and supported by international third parties. For peace to last, agreements must be viable, credible and enforceable, and the commitment of donors must not be in doubt. For these conditions to be in place, conflict resolution must be in donors' interests. Civil war, Social Contract, Aid for Peace...|$|R
5000|$|Phase III (2004-2005): second {{international}} conference; {{permanent status}} agreement {{and end of}} conflict; agreement on final borders, clarification of the highly controversial question of the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and settlements; Arab state to agree to <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> with Israel.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} conflict, Aurakzai {{received}} an honourable {{discharge from the}} Army. Soon after his retirement, Prime minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali appointed him as the Governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. According to the BBC, as governor, his assignment was to bring stability and security to the FATA region. To complete this task, he sought many <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> with the local tribal leaders. However, the deals were violated and the violence began in the FATA region. Soon, a bloody tribal conflict between the Pakistan Armed Forces ended the <b>peace</b> <b>deals.</b> A new war in tribal areas ensued. As the conflict grew momentarily, he resigned as the governor. He was replaced by Owais Ahmed Ghani, a former Governor of Balochistan Province.|$|R
5|$|Walsingham {{advocated}} {{direct intervention}} in the Netherlands {{in support of the}} Protestant revolt against Spain, on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of religious liberty and freedom were not. Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy of mediation, a policy that Elizabeth endorsed. Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578, to sound out a potential <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> and gather military intelligence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, joined Matilda's faction. Hoping to seize East Anglia, he {{established}} his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Nigel faced a rapid response from Stephen, who made a surprise attack on the isle, forcing the Bishop to flee to Gloucester. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, at which Matilda was represented by Robert. The conference collapsed after Henry and the clergy insisted that they should set the terms of any <b>peace</b> <b>deal,</b> which Stephen's representatives found unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately {{bring an end to the}} civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153.|$|E
5000|$|On February 4, U.S. General Dan K. McNeill {{replaced}} British General David Richards {{as commander}} of ISAF. Analysts {{reported that he}} planned to place a heavier emphasis on fighting than on <b>peace</b> <b>deals.</b> Meanwhile, observers and commanders were expecting a new Taliban [...] "spring offensive," [...] and NATO commanders asked for more troops.|$|R
50|$|Very soon, {{the missionaries}} started {{migrating}} north through the barren and inhospitable south-western Africa. Here they encountered various local tribes {{such as the}} Herero, Nama and Damara, and were frequently {{in the middle of}} wars between them. The missionaries tried to broker <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> between the tribes, and for this reason was later seen as political assets by the tribes.|$|R
50|$|They have, at times, {{proposed}} {{two main}} <b>peace</b> <b>deals.</b> The first one would divide Georgia into seven autonomous entities, each {{with power over}} police and economic issues, but relinquishing power over defence and foreign affairs to the federal government. In a later proposal, {{it was suggested that}} Georgia and Abkhazia could form one federal Georgian republic, somewhat along the lines of Serbia and Montenegro.|$|R
5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were {{brought to the attention of}} some senior American officials.|$|E
5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September, {{however, the}} Indonesians {{proposed}} a way out: an alternative route through the Lombok Strait. The British took {{them up on}} this offer, to the relief of both parties, and the Victorious made a peaceful return through Indonesian territory. War was averted, and the climax of tensions during the Confrontation had been passed. Never again was the threat of all-out war a realistic possibility, despite some large land battles in northern Borneo the following spring, and the Confrontation wound down by late fall of 1965. It had never escalated into a major conflict, and a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> was signed the following year.|$|E
25|$|The Islamabad's {{decision}} {{to launch the}} offensive against Mehsud signaled a deepening of Pakistani resolve against the militants. The military had targeted the TTP leader on three separate occasions – in 2004, 2005 and 2008 – but walked away each time after signing <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> with Mehsud. This time, the military also enjoyed the public support as a wave of terrorist attacks had swayed public sentiment against the Taliban.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the National Liberation Forces {{rejected}} the <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> of the United Nations {{that led to}} democratic elections in Burundi notwithstanding its later tentative endorsement of them on 18 June 2006.

50|$|Peace {{negotiations}} {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1676, but nothing was agreed to and signed before 1678. These treaties {{did not result in}} a lasting peace. Some of the countries involved signed <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> elsewhere, such as the Treaty of Celle (Sweden made peace with Brunswick and Lunenburg-Celle), Treaty of Saint-Germain (France and Sweden made peace with Brandenburg) and Treaty of Fontainebleau (France dictated peace between Sweden and Denmark-Norway).|$|R
5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were convinced {{they were dealing}} with a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|The papacy intervened {{once again}} to try to produce a last-minute <b>peace</b> <b>deal,</b> {{resulting}} in a fresh conference at La Ferté-Bernard in 1189. By now Henry was suffering from a bleeding ulcer that would ultimately prove fatal. The discussions achieved little, although Henry {{is alleged to have}} offered Philip that John, rather than Richard, could marry Alice, reflecting the rumours circulating over the summer that Henry was considering openly disinheriting Richard. The conference broke up with war appearing likely, but Philip and Richard launched a surprise attack immediately afterwards during what was conventionally a period of truce.|$|E
5|$|As in World War I, Scapa Flow in Orkney {{served as}} an {{important}} Royal Navy base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and Rosyth gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the Firth of Forth and East Lothian. The shipyards and heavy engineering factories in Glasgow and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the Luftwaffe, enduring great destruction and loss of life. As transatlantic voyages involved negotiating north-west Britain, Scotland played a key part {{in the battle of}} the North Atlantic. Shetland's relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the Shetland Bus by which fishing boats helped Norwegians fled the Nazis, and expeditions across the North Sea to assist resistance. Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when Rudolf Hess flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> through the Duke of Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the {{previous}} year, rebelled against Stephen as well. Nigel hoped to seize East Anglia and established his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats lashed {{together to form a}} causeway that allowed him to make a surprise attack on the isle. Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, to which Stephen sent his wife. The conference collapsed over the insistence by Henry and the clergy that they should set the terms of any <b>peace</b> <b>deal,</b> which Stephen found unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Ba Cụt was surrounded, {{and sought}} to make a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> with the Diệm {{government}} to avoid being taken prisoner. Ba Cụt {{sent a message to}} Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, the public official who oversaw the civilian side of the campaign against the Hòa Hảo, asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba Cụt's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba Cụt was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
5|$|However, one Hòa Hảo commander, Ba Cụt, {{continued}} to fight, {{having had a}} personal history of bad blood with Thơ's own family. The orphaned, illiterate Cụt's adopted father's rice paddies were confiscated by Thơ's father, which purportedly imbued Cụt with a permanent hatred towards the landowning class. Cụt was eventually surrounded and sought to make a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> so he {{sent a message to}} Thơ asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed.

Cụt was captured on 13 April 1956 and guillotined after a brief trial and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
50|$|By mid-1997 the {{government}} signed <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> with FARF and the MDD leadership and succeeded in {{cutting off the}} groups from their rear bases in the Central African Republic and Cameroon. Agreements also were struck with rebels from the National Front of Chad (FNT) and Movement for Social Justice and Democracy in October 1997. However, peace was short-lived, as FARF rebels clashed with government soldiers, finally surrendering to government forces in May 1998. Barde {{was killed in the}} fighting, as were hundreds of other southerners, most civilians.|$|R
50|$|Dzu {{claimed that}} he had been meeting with the Buddhist activist leader Thích Trí Quang, but later denied this. He also claimed that the Vietcong called on {{communist}} sympathisers to vote for him, but later reneged on this. While others also advocated <b>peace</b> <b>deals,</b> Dzu was the most vigorous in disseminating his message, making competitors such as the aged Phan Khắc Sửu and Trần Văn Hương, who had briefly served as president and prime minister respectively under the junta's supervision in 1964 - 65, appear lethargic.|$|R

5|$|Philip's offer {{coincided with}} {{a crisis in the}} Levant. In 1187 Jerusalem {{surrendered}} to Saladin and calls for a new crusade swept Europe. Richard was enthusiastic and announced his intention to join the crusade, and Henry and Philip Augustus announced their similar intent at the start of 1188. Taxes began to be raised and plans made for supplies and transport. Richard was keen to start his crusade, but was forced to wait for Henry to make his arrangements. In the meantime, Richard set about crushing some of his enemies in Aquitaine in 1188, before once again attacking the Count of Toulouse. Richard's campaign undermined the truce between Henry and Philip and both sides again mobilised large forces in anticipation of war. This time Henry rejected Philip's offers of a short-term truce in the hope of convincing the French king to agree to a long-term <b>peace</b> <b>deal,</b> but Philip refused to consider Henry's proposals. A furious Richard, however, believed that Henry was stalling for time and delaying the departure of the crusade.|$|E
5|$|Đính's {{political}} stay was brief, as General Nguyễn Khánh, who was disgruntled at {{not receiving}} a high position after Diệm's removal, deposed the MRC {{with the support}} of Khiệm on 30 January 1964, without firing a shot. Khánh used the coup to exact retribution against Generals Đôn, Đính, Xuan and Lê Văn Kim. Khánh had them arrested, claiming that {{they were part of a}} neutralist plot with the French government of President Charles de Gaulle to make a <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> with North Vietnam that would not end communism. Khánh noted they had all served in the French-backed VNA prior to 1955, although he had as well. He also accused the four generals of discussing such a plan with some visiting politicians from de Gaulle's party during a dinner, although Đính and his accused colleagues denied that the meeting was anything more than social. The generals were flown to Mỹ Khe beach, near Đà Nẵng.|$|E
5|$|During his vice-presidency, Kagame {{controlled}} the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these, or was powerless to stop them. It {{is important to}} note that Kagame says he did not support these killings and failed to stop them. These soldiers however, were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries, which were controlled by the genocidaires (participants in the genocide) and threatened Rwanda's security. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a continent-wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 <b>peace</b> <b>deal</b> and ceasefire.|$|E

He made <b>peace</b> <b>deals</b> with Croat (14 September 1993) and Serb leaders (22 October 1993) who were pleased to weaken the Bosnian government {{in the light of the}} Karađorđevo and Graz agreements which aimed to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia.|$|R
5000|$|Lean Bear (Cheyenne name Awoninahku, 1813-1864), {{alternatively}} {{translated as}} Starving Bear, was a Cheyenne peace chief.

40|$|In Congo {{over the}} past decade, demands for justice have been largely unmet in peace negotiations: {{impunity}} for the worst crimes is entrenched, and {{the root causes of}} the conflict remain unaddressed.
