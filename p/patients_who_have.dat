5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. <b>Patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E

Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 394 mCRC patients, in whom 169 KRAS mutant and 225 KRAS wild-type, were enrolled. In KRAS mutant <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 131), the OS was significantly longer than that in KRAS mutant <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 38).

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

Methods: Chart review of 53 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> TLH and 47 <b>who</b> <b>had</b> VH and were seen postoperatively by an acute pain management service {{in order to assess}} postoperative analgesic requirements. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) was part of the standard protocol for postoperative pain management. Analgesic requirement was recorded as the mean doses of morphine and number of days that patients used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oxycodone and tramadol. Results: The requirement for total morphine was approximately half the dose in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a TLH (10. 8 +/- 12. 6 mg) compared with <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a VH (19. 4 +/- 21. 9 mg) (P 0. 017).

METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental design in which the results of intervention for <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had a stroke and healthy adults were compared. The subjects were 20 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had a stroke with consequent sensory impairment and 20 healthy adults. RESULTS: Before the footbath, the skin temperature of the dorsum of the foot on the affected side of the <b>patient</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had a stroke was lower than that of the foot on the unaffected side. Five minutes after the start of the footbath, however, the relationship reversed, with the skin temperature on the affected side increasing in parallel with the water temperature. After the footbath, the dorsum skin temperature on the affected side was again lower than that on the unaffected side. In healthy adults, a difference was found in dorsum skin temperature between the left and right feet. In contrast with <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had a stroke, no reversal of the sides was found with the lower and higher temperature. CONCLUSION: Unlike in the healthy adults, the skin temperature of the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had a stroke with consequent sensory impairment was susceptible to changes in the external environment.
