50|$|Flowers of Arcytophyllum are distylous, {{meaning that}} two morphs exist differing in the {{vertical}} orientation of anthers and stigmas. Pin morphs have stigmas positioned above the anthers, while thrum morphs have stigmas positioned below the anthers. A study of 11 species showed significantly higher seed production in thrum than pin morphs of A. aristatum, A. lavarum, and A. vernicosum, {{and a similar}} tendency in all other sampled species. In contrast, pin morphs of A. lavarum cross pollinate more efficiently than thrum morphs, thus transmitting more of their genes {{to the next generation}} via pollen than seed. As better exporters of pollen to flowers of the opposite morph, long-styled A. lavarum give rise to disassortative <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> and a division in reproductive functions between the morphs. If pollinators promote the condition of distyly and asymmetric <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> over evolutionary time, it is plausible that gender specialization will evolve into dioecy.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} comparing nuclear and organelle population differentiation (F(ST)) in seed plants {{to test the hypothesis}} that pollen and seed gene flow rates are equal. Wright's infinite island model is used, with arbitrary levels of self-fertilization and biparental organelle inheritance. The comparison can also be applied to gene flow in animals. Since effective population sizes are smaller for organelle genomes than for nuclear genomes and organelles are often uniparentally inherited, organelle F(ST) is expected to be higher at equilibrium than nuclear F(ST) even if pollen and seed gene flow rates are equal. To reject the null hypothesis of equal seed and <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> rates, nuclear and organelle F(ST) 's must differ significantly from their expected values under this hypothesis. Finite island model simulations indicate that infinite island model expectations are not greatly biased by finite numbers of populations (>/= 100 subpopulations). The power to distinguish dissimilar rates of pollen and seed gene flow depends on confidence intervals for fixation index estimates, which shrink as more subpopulations and loci are sampled. Using data from the tropical tree Corythophora alta, we rejected the null hypothesis that seed and <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> rates are equal but cannot reject the alternative hypothesis that <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> is 200 times greater than seed gene flow...|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{seed and}} <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> in plants {{on the basis}} of samples of {{naturally}} regenerated seedlings can provide much needed information about “realized gene flow,” but seems {{to be one of the}} greatest challenges in plant population biology. Traditional parentage methods, because of their inability to discriminate between male and female parentage of seedlings, unless supported by uniparentally inherited markers, are not capable of precisely describing seed and pollen aspects of gene flow realized in seedlings. Here, we describe a maximum-likelihood method for modeling female and male parentage in a local plant population {{on the basis of}} genotypic data from naturally established seedlings and when the location and genotypes of all potential parents within the population are known. The method models female and male reproductive success of individuals as a function of factors likely to influence reproductive success (e. g., distance of seed dispersal, distance between mates, and relative fecundity–i. e., female and male selection gradients). The method is designed to account for levels of seed and <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> into the local population from unsampled adults; therefore, it is well suited to isolated, but also wide-spread natural populations, where extensive seed and pollen dispersal complicates traditional parentage analyses. Computer simulations were performed to evaluate the utility and robustness of the model and estimation procedure and to assess how the exclusion power of genetic markers (isozymes or microsatellites) affects the accuracy of the parameter estimation. In addition, the method was applied to genotypic data collected in Scots pine (isozymes) and oak (microsatellites) populations to obtain preliminary estimates of long-distance seed and <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> and the patterns of local seed and pollen dispersal in these species...|$|R

5000|$|To limit mixing in {{the first}} stages of production, {{researchers}} and politicians are developing codes of good agricultural practice for GM crops. In addition to the thorough cleaning of machinery, recommended measures include the establishment of [...] "isolation distances" [...] and [...] "pollen barriers". Isolation distances are the minimum distances required between GM and non-GM cultivations {{for most of the}} GM pollen to fall to the ground before reaching non-GM plants. Pollen barriers attempt actively catch pollen, and can consist of hedges and trees which physically hinder pollen movement. Pollen barriers consisting of conventional crops of the same species as the GM crop have a special advantage, as the conventional plants not only physically limit the GM <b>pollen</b> <b>flow,</b> but also produce competitive, conventional pollen. During harvest, the buffer strip of conventional crops is considered part of the GM crop yield.|$|E
50|$|B. terrestris has an {{impressive}} homing range, where bees displaced from their nests can relocate the colony from up to 9.8 km away. However, the return often takes several days, indicating B. terrestris might be utilizing familiar foliage and natural landmarks {{to find the}} nest. This may be a tedious process if an individual is outside the conventional foraging range of the nest. Another study indicated that these bees can navigate {{their way back to}} the nest from a distance as far away as 13 km, although most forage within 5 km of their nest. One mark and recapture study found their average foraging distance to be approximately 663 m. Male bees have also been found to have longer flight ranges than worker bees, likely because they move farther away from the nest to find mates. Males have flight distances of anywhere from 2.6-9.9 km. If males also contribute to pollination, this might increase previously predicted <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> ranges based on worker flight behavior.|$|E
40|$|Pollen-mediated {{gene flow}} (PMGF) {{is the main}} mode of {{transgene}} flow in flowering plants. The study of <b>pollen</b> and gene <b>flow</b> of transgenic wheat can help to establish the corresponding strategy for preventing transgene escape and contamination between compatible genotypes in wheat. To investigate the pollen dispersal and gene flow frequency in various directions and distances around the pollen source and detect the association between frequency of transgene <b>flow</b> and <b>pollen</b> density from transgenic wheat, a concentric circle design was adopted to conduct a field experiment using transgenic wheat with resistance to wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) as the pollen donor and dwarf male-sterile wheat as the pollen receptor. The {{results showed that the}} <b>pollen</b> and gene <b>flow</b> of transgenic wheat varied significantly among the different compass sectors. A higher pollen density and gene flow frequency was observed in the downwind SW and W sectors, with average frequencies of transgene flow of 26. 37 and 23. 69 % respectively. The <b>pollen</b> and gene <b>flow</b> of transgenic wheat declined dramatically with increasing distance from its source. Most of the pollen grains concentrated within 5 m and only a few pollen grains were detected beyond 30 m. The percentage of transgene flow was the highest where adjacent to the pollen source, with an average of 48. 24 % for all eight compass directions at 0 m distance. Transgene flow was reduced to 50 % and 95 % between 1. 61 to 3. 15 m, and 10. 71 to 20. 93 m, respectively. Our results suggest that climate conditions, especially wind direction, may significantly affect pollen dispersal and gene flow of wheat. The isolation-by-distance model {{is one of the most}} effective methods for achieving stringent transgene confinement in wheat. The frequency of transgene flow is directly correlated with the relative density of GM pollen grains in air currents, and pollen competition may be a major factor influencing transgene flow...|$|R
40|$|We {{continue}} our {{study of the}} effects of pollen and seed migration on the cytonuclear structure of mixed-mating plant populations by analyzing two deterministic continent-island models under the critical assumption of paternal cytoplasmic inheritance. The major results of this study that contrast with our previous conclusions based on maternal cytoplasmic inheritance are (i) <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> can significantly affect the cytonuclear structure of the island population, and in particular can help to generate cytonuclear disequilibria that greatly exceed the magnitude of those that would be produced by seed migration or mixed mating alone; (ii) with simultaneous pollen and seed migration, nonzero cytonuclear disequilibria will be maintained not only when there is disequilibrium in the immigrant pollen or seeds, but also through a variety of intermigrant admixture effects when the two pools of immigrants differ appropriately in their cytonuclear compositions; (iii) either immigrant pollen or immigrant seeds can generate disequilibria de novo in populations with initially random cytonuclear associations, but pollen migration alone generally produces lower levels of disequilibrium than does comparable seed migration, especially at high levels of self-fertilization when the overall fraction of immigrant pollen is low; (iv) the equilibrium state of the island population will be influenced by the rate of <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> whenever there is either allelic disequilibrium in the immigrant pollen or simultaneous seed migration coupled with different cytoplasmic or nuclear allele frequencies in immigrant pollen and seeds or nonzero allelic disequilibrium in either immigrant pool. The estimation of pollen migration should therefore be facilitated with paternal cytoplasmic inheritance relative to the case of maternal cytoplasmic inheritance. These basic conclusions hold whether the population is censused as seeds or as adults, but with simultaneous pollen and seed migration, the relationship between census time and the ability to detect nonrandom cytonuclear associations is complex. When migration is through pollen alone, however, the cytonuclear structure of the island population is independent of the life stage censused...|$|R
40|$|A new maximum-likelihood {{method is}} {{developed}} for estimating unidirectional <b>pollen</b> and seed <b>flow</b> in mixed-mating plant populations from counts of joint nuclear-cytoplasmic genotypes. Data may include multiple unlinked nuclear markers {{with a single}} maternally or paternally inherited cytoplasmic marker, or with two cytoplasmic markers inherited through opposite parents, as in many conifer species. Migration rate estimates are based on fitting the equilibrium genotype frequencies under continent-island models of plant gene flow to the data. Detailed analysis of their equilibrium structures indicates when {{each of the three}} nuclear-cytoplasmic systems allows gene flow estimation and shows that, in general, it is easier to estimate seed than pollen migration. Three-locus nuclear-dicytoplasmic data only increase the conditions allowing seed migration estimates; however, the additional dicytonuclear disequilibria allow more accurate estimates of both forms of gene flow. Estimates and their confidence limits for simulated data sets confirm that two-locus data with paternal cytoplasmic inheritance provide better estimates than those with maternal inheritance, while three-locus dicytonuclear data with three modes of inheritance generally provide the most reliable estimates for both types of gene flow. Similar results are obtained for hybrid zones receiving <b>pollen</b> and seed <b>flow</b> from two source populations. An estimation program is available upon request...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} floral-nectar robbing on plant fitness depends on several issues. Firstly, nectar robbers such as {{carpenter}} bees, bumble bees and some birds can pollinate flowers. Pollination may take place {{when the body}} of the robber contacts the reproductive parts of the plant while it robs, or during pollen collection which some bees practice in concert with nectar robbing. The impact of Trigona bees (e.g. Trigona ferricauda) on a plant is almost always negative, probably because their aggressive territorial behaviour effectively evicts legitimate pollinators. Nectar robbers may change the behaviour of legitimate pollinators in other ways, such as by reducing the amount of nectar available. This may force pollinators to visit more flowers in their nectar foraging. The increased number of flowers visited and longer flight distances increase <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> and outcrossing, which is beneficial for the plant because it lessens inbreeding depression. This requires a robber's not completely consuming all of a flower's nectar. When a robber consumes all of a flower's nectar, legitimate pollinators may avoid the flower, resulting in a negative effect on plant fitness.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} flowering phenology on <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> distance and spatial genetic structure in a population of a bumblebee-pollinated herb, Primula sieboldii, we investigated the flowering phenology of 1712 flowers of 97 genets in a population in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, and constructed a mating model based on the observed mating pattern, which was revealed by paternity analysis using 11 microsatellite markers. The effects of flowering phenology were inferred by comparing estimated <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> distance {{and the level of}} heterozygosity in the next generation between two scenarios. In the first scenario, both the intergenet distance and flowering phenology influenced mating opportunity, while in the second scenario only intergenet distance influenced mating opportunity. Although the frequency distribution of <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> distance at the population level did not differ significantly between the two scenarios, the mean <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> distance of several flowers increased by more than 10 m as a result of variation in flowering phenology. Furthermore, accounting for flowering phenology predicted change in heterozygosity in the next generation from 20. 04 to 0. 07.

40|$|Background and Aims Genetic {{connectivity}} between plant populations {{allows for}} exchange and dispersal of adaptive genes, which can facilitate plant population persistence particularly in rapidly changing environments. Methods Patterns of historic gene flow, flowering phenology and contemporary <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> were investigated in two common herbs, Ranunculus bulbosus and Trifolium montanum, along an altitudinal gradient of 1200 - 1800 m a. s. l. over {{a distance of}} 1 km among five alpine meadows in Switzerland. Key Results Historic gene flow was extensive, as revealed by Fst values of 0 · 01 and 0 · 007 in R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively, by similar levels of allelic richness among meadows and by the grouping of all individuals into one genetic cluster. Our data suggest contemporary <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> is not limited across altitudes in either species but is more pronounced in T. montanum, {{as indicated by the}} differential decay of among-sibships correlated paternity with increasing spatial distance. Flowering phenology among meadows was not a barrier to <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> in T. montanum, as the large overlap between meadow pairs was consistent with the extensive <b>pollen</b> <b>flow.</b> The smaller flowering overlap among R. bulbosus meadows might explain the slightly more limited <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> detected.

Low cpDNA gene flow in bal-sam fir may relate to low pollen production due to the inherent biology of the species and populations being decimated by recurrent spruce budworm epidemics, and/or to low dis-persal of pollen grains due to their peculiar structural properties.

The economic impacts of AGMP could be severe and could prevent the practical application of GM coexistence measures. To date, research has concentrated on the contribution of <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> as the major source of AGMP, while other sources have not been investigated. We have examined the potential for AGMP from the use of shared farm equipment and transport, which has previously been assumed to have a low contribution. Oilseed rape (OSR) was examined in a typical UK production regime including tillage, sowing, spraying, harvesting and grain drying. At each stage in the process, OSR in the machinery was measured and its potential for AGMP calculated. In sowing and grain drying, mustard grain was used as a proxy for GM grain and was measured during the processes by real-time PCR quantification to give estimates of GM dilution rates during the processes. The effects of cleaning and other mitigation methods were examined. Total potential AGMP was estimated at 1. 47 % when no mitigation was performed, and 0. 08 % when machinery was cleaned.

The objectives were to investigate whether <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> and consequent gene flow reflected bee patch constancy and how <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> varied with distance and vegetation between donor and recipient plants.

Remnants maintain high levels of genetic diversity, comparable with those reported for continuous populations in southeastern Europe, and show low interpopulation differentiation (Theta = 0. 080), indicating that historical gene exchange has not been limited (Nm = 3. 48). We estimated from seeds collected from all trees producing fruits in three of five remnants that F. excelsior is predominantly outcrossing (t(m). = 0. 971 +/- 0. 028). Use of a neighborhood model approach to describe the relative contribution of local and long-distance pollen dispersal indicates that <b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow</b> into {{each of the three}} remnants is extensive (46 - 95 %) and pollen dispersal has two components.

I studied the applicability of SSR markers for measuring pollen-mediated gene flow (i. e., <b>pollen</b> <b>flow)</b> in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. ] Franco). I developed SSR markers, tested alternative approaches for measuring <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> using SSR markers, then measured pollen contamination and characterized within-block mating patterns in one block of a seed orchard complex. Useful markers were developed from 4. 1 % of the SSR sequences screened. The 22 markers obtained are among the most informative genetic markers available for Douglas-fir. The observed heterozygosity and the number of alleles per marker averaged 0. 855 (SE= 0. 020) and 23 (SE= 1. 6), respectively. Mistyping (i. e., false identification of genotypes) results in overestimating <b>pollen</b> <b>flow.</b> Requiring multiple mismatches for paternity exclusion, while assuring that the probability of detecting immigrant genotypes is high, results in accurate estimates of <b>pollen</b> <b>flow.</b> I developed and made available the <b>Pollen</b> <b>Flow</b> (PFL) computer program, which performs paternity exclusion and measures <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> based on multiple fatheroffspring mismatches. Pollen contamination was consistently high in all three years in which seed crops were sampled from the orchard block (mean = 35. 3 %). Levels of pollen contamination varied substantially among clones, and were significantly higher in clones with early female receptivity (mean = 55. 5 %) than in those with intermediate (mean = 36. 4 %) or late (mean = 28. 3 %) female receptivity. Seeds resulting from self-fertilization were rare (mean = 1. 8 %). Differences in the relative paternal contributions of the clones in the block were greater than ten-fold, and there was preferential mating among parents with similar floral phenology. Information from analyses of SSR data can be used to minimize pollen contamination and improve within-orchard mating patterns. Furthermore, SSRs can be used to advance knowledge of gene flow in natural populations. The availability of large sets of highly variable SSRs makes it possible to perform landscape-scale studies of gene flow and better understand the interactions between gene flow and adaptation.

Many transgenic cultivars of maize have been developed over the years from this species, producing cultivars resistant to herbicides and insects, among other things. However, {{little is known about}} the gene flow processes that affect maize fields in Colombia, which is near the center of diversity for cultivated maize. We analyzed the gene flow phenomenon of 60 randomly chosen plots of maize, including farmer field landraces or other conventional varieties such as non-transgenic hybrids in Valle de San Juan (Colombia) using Inmunostrip®, PCR and ELISA tests on leaves (seed gene <b>flow)</b> and seeds (<b>pollen</b> gene <b>flow).</b> More than 88 % of the plots were positive with the Inmunostrip® and PCR tests (35 S promoter, Nos terminator and cry 1 F gene), using the leaves, while the remaining seven plots (12 %) were positive for transgenic sequences in the seeds. The results indicated a significant level of overall transgene existence, which is consistent with gene flow from transgenic events. All of the field types (conventional maize, buffer zones, refuge, and Colombian landraces) showed evidence of a transgene presence. There are many problems that could increase the gene flow potential in Valle de San Juan, such as little respect for regulations (Colombian Decree 4525 on transgenic crops and biosafety), distance between transgenic and non-transgenic maize or use of refuge and/or buffer zones, high seed reuse and exchange and low technical assistance. Every policy decision must be made in light of scientific standards of judgment...|$|R
40|$|Pollen {{dispersal}} varies substantially {{during the}} flowering period. When {{can we expect}} the largest distances of <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> or the best period for outcrossing? Several aspects determining <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> are measured during the flowering season of the rare plant species Phyteuma nigrum. This self-incompatible species flowers during three weeks in May and June and is mainly pollinated by bumblebees, queens and workers. Visitation rate decreased from early flowering {{till the end of}} flowering. <b>Pollen</b> <b>flow</b> is estimated from pollinator foraging distances, measured as inter-inflorescence distance and the overall distance between the first and eleventh inflorescence visited. Special attention is paid to the amount of large distances, the tail of the dispersal graph and the amount of intra-plant movements. Flown distances followed the mean inter-inflorescence distances. However, maximum distances of inter inflorescence movements and of overall distances were larger during early flowering than during peak flowering; during late flowering distances were even smaller than during peak flowering. Observations on individually marked bumblebees appeared to be useful in the explanation of these differences. The best period for outcrossing is estimated...|$|E
40|$|No {{data are}} {{available}} on <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> distances for wind-pollinated canopy trees in broad-leaf, closed, evergreen forests. Nevertheless, major biogeographic patterns, such as the relative absence of anemophilic tree species in lowland tropical forests {{and the rise of}} the angiosperms, have been explained in terms of the supposed relative inefficiency of anemophily compared to zoophily. In this study, fruits were found below females of the dioecious anemophilous tree species Podocarpus falcatus in the Knysna Forest, which were up to 70 m from male trees. This <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> is over more than twice the distance previously suggested as a maximum and indicates that wind-pollinated species could produce out-crossed progeny in species-rich communities...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePollen {{dispersal}} {{was characterized}} within {{a population of}} the narrowly endemic perennial herb, Centaurea corymbosa, using exclusion-based and likelihood-based paternity analyses carried out on microsatellite data. Data were used to fit a model of pollen dispersal and to estimate the rates of <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> and mutation/genotyping error, by developing a new method. Selfing was rare (1. 6 %). Pollen dispersed isotropically around each flowering plant following a leptokurtic distribution, with 50 % of mating pairs separated by less than 11 m, but 22 % by more than 40 m. Estimates of <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> lacked precision (0 - 25 %), partially because mutations and/or genotyping errors (0. 03 - 1 %) could also explain the occurrence of offspring without a compatible candidate father. However, the pollen pool that fertilized these offspring was little differentiated from the adults of the population whereas strongly differentiated from the other populations, suggesting that <b>pollen</b> <b>flow</b> rate among populations was low. Our results suggest that pollen dispersal is too extended to allow differentiation by local adaptation within a population. However, among populations, gene flow might be low enough for such processes to occur...|$|E

In 2009, 4088 {{hectares}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) cotton were planted in Tolima (Colombia), however there is some uncertainty about containment measures needed to prevent the <b>flow</b> of <b>pollen</b> and seed from regulated GM fields into adjacent fields. In this study, the gene flow from GM cotton varieties to conventional or feral cotton plants via seed and pollen was evaluated. ImmunostripTM, PCR and ELISA assays were used to detect gene flow. Fifty six refuges, 27 fields with conventional cotton and four feral individuals of the enterprise “Remolinos Inc. ” located in El Espinal (Tolima) were analyzed {{in the first half}} of 2010. The results indicated seed mediated gene flow in 45 refuges (80. 4 %) and 26 fields with conventional cotton (96 %), besides <b>pollen</b> mediated gene <b>flow</b> in one field with conventional cotton and nine refuges. All fields cultivated with conventional cotton showed gene flow from GM cotton. Two refuges and two feral individuals did not reveal gene flow from GM cotton...|$|R
40|$|Mn/Model, a GIS-based {{model for}} site {{prediction}} in Minnesota, performed adequately for northeastern Minnesota; {{but the more}} numerous Woodland tradition sites used to derive the models overwhelmed the older Paleoindian/Archiac sites. This project was designed to enhance the Mn/Model databases to better represent the landscapes of northeastern Minnesota with respect to these early sites. Researchers conducted a logistic regression analysis of 108 known sites for common environmental parameters with four variables: Distance to water, stream <b>flow,</b> <b>pollen</b> average, and height above mean elevation within 90 m. Field survey by shovel testing was restricted to 50 random points. Although locations of high, middle, and low probability for archaeological resources were tested, none of the locations had such resources. The lack of new sites in this survey is not considered {{an indication that the}} model is invalid, but more a result of the use of only randomly chosen points. The non-site data generated are useful for enhancing Mn/Model but the logistic regression model developed from the known sites still requires testing. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{island and}} one-dimensional stepping-stone models of population genetic structure developed for animal populations are extended to hermaphrodite plant populations {{to study the}} behavior of biparentally inherited nuclear genes and organelle genes with paternal and maternal inheritance. By substituting appropriate values for effective population sizes and migration rates of the genes concerned into the classical models, expressions for genetic differentiation and correlation in gene frequency between populations can be derived. For both models, differentiation for maternally inherited genes at migration-drift equilibrium is greater than that for paternally inherited genes, {{which in turn is}} greater than that for biparentally inherited nuclear genes. In the stepping-stone model, the change of genetic correlation with distance is influenced by the mode of inheritance of the gene and the relative values of long- and short-distance migration by seed and pollen. In situations where it is possible to measure simultaneously Fst for genes with all three types of inheritance, estimates of the relative rates of <b>pollen</b> to seed <b>flow</b> can be made for both the short- and long-distance components of migration in the stepping-stone model...|$|R
