40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the market-driven {{economic}} philosophies of successive New Zealand governments have transformed {{the structure of the}} economy. These changes have established favourable market conditions for the success of a particular type of anticompetitive organisational behaviour, <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> From the mid 1950 s to the early 1980 s, economic analyses of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> theories frequently concluded that this behaviour constituted economically irrational behaviour. This conclusion generated a widespread scepticism among antitrust commentators, policymakers and judges towards the prevalence of such behaviour. Recently, however, the basis for this conclusion has been undermined by the application of Game Theory to <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> Game-theoretic analysis has proven that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is rational under a range of market conditions and consequently, issues regarding the need for prohibition and the optimal method of proscription have again become relevant. This research investigates the contemporary developments in economic and judicial analysis of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> in order to evaluate the efficacy of section 36 of the Commerce Act 1986 in prohibiting this behaviour. A comprehensive survey of the game-theoretic <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> models concludes that these models refute a number of well-known irrationality arguments and that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cannot be regarded as irrational organisational behaviour. Prominent standards proposed in the literature for the existence of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> are then shown to be deficient in light of the insights provided by the application of game theory. A critique of the most recent <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Justice of the European Economic Community and the Australian Full Federal Court is then conducted and it is found that the form and content of the standard for any jurisdiction must be dictated by the specific objectives of the competition law legislation. Finally, the research concludes that, in all but one respect, the current drafting and judicial interpretation of section 36 enables the section to be effective in proscribing those types of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> which are inimical to the attainment of the objectives of the Commerce Act...|$|R

40|$|<b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> [...] a {{deliberate}} strategy of pricing aggressively {{in order to}} eliminate competitors [...] {{is one of the}} more contentious areas of antitrust policy and its existence and efficacy are widely debated. The purpose of this paper is to formally characterize <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> in a modern industry dynamics framework. We endogenize competitive advantage and industry structure through learning-by-doing. We first show that predation-like behavior arises routinely in our model. Equilibria involving predation-like behavior typically coexist with equilibria involving much less aggressive <b>pricing.</b> To disentangle <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> from mere competition for efficiency on a learning curve we next decompose the equilibrium pricing condition. Our decomposition provides us with a coherent and flexible way to develop alternative characterizations of a firm’s <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives, some of which are motivated by the existing literature while others are novel. We finally measure the impact of the <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives on industry structure, conduct, and performance. We show that forcing a firm to ignore these incentives in setting its price can have a large impact and that this impact stems from eliminating equilibria with predation-like behavior. Along with the predation-like behavior, however, a fair amount of competition for the market is eliminated. Overall, the distinction between <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> and pricing aggressively to pursue efficiency is closely related to the distinction between the advantage-building and advantage-denying motives that our decomposition of the equilibrium pricing condition isolates and measures. competition policy; industry dynamics; <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Price squeeze abuses {{lie at the}} {{crossroad}} {{between different}} forms of potentially anticompetitive conduct, {{as well as between}} antitrust law and regulation. The main question that has arisen in the academic debate and actual practice is whether a combination of a lawful wholesale price and a non-predatory retail price can be characterized as exclusionary conduct based on the analysis of the margin between the two prices. In the paper, we argue that {{there is no need for}} a separate price squeeze theory under antitrust law. Assuming that the costs of supplying an input to rivals and to internal downstream divisions do not differ, a price squeeze capable of excluding equally efficient competitors may arise only from upstream discrimination (discriminatory price squeeze) or downstream predation (<b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> squeeze). However, when the downstream division of the dominant firm is not a separate legal entity, distinguishing discriminatory and <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> squeezes may turn out to be impossible, as internal transfer charges are absent in many concrete settings of vertical integration. In these cases, an analytical framework for the assessment of price squeeze cases can be useful, provided that it is intended as an operational tool aimed at detecting anticompetitive conduct of a discriminatory or predatory nature, which is not directly observable. Instead of mimicking regulatory tools and criteria, the analytical framework for the assessment of price squeeze cases should be construed in accordance with basic principles of competition law and traditional doctrines of antitrust liability. This approach strongly supports the application of principles on refusal to deal to price squeeze cases and the use of the equally efficient competitor test to ascertain whether a given pricing policy is anticompetitive...|$|E

Third, what is the impact of predatory incentives on industry structure, conduct, and performance?

40|$|<b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is a two-step {{strategy}} for securing monopoly profits. During {{the first step}} [...] the predation stage [...] a firm charges a price below its costs {{in the hope of}} driving its competitors out of the market by forcing them to sell at a loss as well. If it succeeds, the firm can proceed to the second step [...] the recoupment stage. After it has the market to itself, the now-dominant firm charges a monopoly price in an effort to recoup the losses it sustained in the predation stage and to earn a steady stream of monopoly profits into the future. <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> violates section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits the use of anticompetitive conduct to acquire or maintain monopoly power. <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is one form of anticompetitive conduct. Many judges and scholars, however, believe that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> does not occur because the two-step strategy combines significant up-front costs with a low probability of success. This skepticism has led courts to impose a recoupment element for section 2 <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> claims. The recoupment element requires an antitrust plaintiff bringing a <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> claim to prove that the defendant will be able to acquire monopoly power and to charge a monopoly price for long enough to make the whole scheme profitable. Antitrust liability becomes a function of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s profitability. This Article discusses the evolution of and rationale for the recoupment requirement. It shows how recoupment analysis by courts is often flawed, largely because judges incorrectly assume that market entry, which can prevent recoupment, is easy. This Article then illustrates the many ways in which recoupment can occur, including recoupment in other markets and recoupment through cartel or oligopoly pricing. Despite these various modes of recoupment, federal courts have sometimes structured the recoupment requirement {{in a way that is}} literally impossible to satisfy.

After exploring the judicial misapplication of the recoupment requirement, this Article challenges the underlying premises of the element by showing how <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> can hurt consumers and competition even if a firm engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is unable to eventually recoup its losses.

On 2 April, 2009, the ECJ dismissed an appeal brought by France Télécom against the judgment of the Court of First Instance in the Wanadoo predatory pricing case. The CFI judgment upheld the European Commission's finding that Wanadoo Interactive SA, a subsidiary of France Télécom, had abused its dominant position on the French market for high-speed internet access between March 2001 and October 2002. Notwithstanding the Advocate General Mazák's call, in his Opinion of 25 September 2008, for introducing a requirement of recoupment of losses under Article 82 EC in order to inaugurate a more economic approach to predatory pricing, the ECJ decided not to incorporate this additional requirement to the actual <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> test. This outcome is reflected in the Commission's Guidance on Article 82 EC enforcement priorities published in February 2009 and confirms the European idea according to which to protect consumer welfare requires the protection the structure of the market and its competitors.

40|$|Politicians, {{regulators}} and antitrust analysts have often used {{the presence of}} price discrimination {{as an indicator of}} market power. They are often motivated by political pressure from buyers facing the higher of the discriminatory prices to regulate or to pursue antitrust remedies in pricediscriminating industries. Their justification for doing so is provided by economic models that equate deviation from marginal cost with market power. In the unusual case where costs are completely separable, this position may have validity. But most commonly, real-world goods and services are produced under conditions where costs (sunk or not) like R 2 ̆ 6 D, advertising or production or distribution costs like common facilities, are shared with other products. Under these common conditions, firms constrained by competition from earning monopoly rents will adopt price discrimination as the optimum strategy to allocate common costs among buyers. Not only is this very often welfare-enhancing (as Ramsey pricing suggests it is for certain monopolists), it is not evidence of the unilateral or collusive power to affect industry output, which {{is at the heart of}} the 2 ̆ 2 monopoly power 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 market power 2 ̆ 2 concepts. A version of price discrimination also can be used to recover sunk costs in a competitive environment, thus providing a solution to the 2 ̆ 2 destructive competition 2 ̆ 2 problem that has plagued regulatory economics from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth. This view of price discrimination also helps to explain and justify network pricing behavior that has been accused of being <b>predatory.</b> <b>Price</b> discrimination can, of course, be used to facilitate and preserve the exercise of market power.

40|$|Bundling {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a highly ambiguous method for price discrimination or vertical control. Barry Nalebuff has recently proposed an alternative model of bundling as a highly suspect exclusionary tactic. A virtue of the model is that its exclusionary implications do not appeal to strategic considerations, e. g., threatening to charge a <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> for the bundle now and recoup losses later. It involves two goods, A and B, each initially supplied by monopolies. If the A-monopolist sells an A-B bundle at the sum of those monopoly prices, the B-monopolist loses half of its profits and consumer welfare falls. Because those prices are not an equilibrium, we focus on three possibilities: sequential pricing, simultaneous pricing, both of which involve the B-monopolist remaining, and monopoly, i. e., where the bundler is the only seller of A or B. In all cases, including B's departure followed by a monopoly price, total welfare and consumer welfare are greater after bundling than before. We cannot guarantee that bundling always increases welfare, but the results have intuitive support. By bundling, the A-monopolist provides previously non-existent competition with the B-monopolist in the latter's market. The B-monopolist's exclusion comes from the lost profits due to the A-monopolist's entry. Bundling is an entry barrier because competition reduces profits. Were bundling harmful, the per se proscription against market allocation should be lifted. It would presumably be beneficial for an erstwhile bundler and a single product firm {{to cut a deal}} in which the former stops bundling in order to preserve a monopoly for the latter. Our findings suggest, however, that the present antitrust rules promote welfare and, thus, that generic opposition to bundling remains unwarranted. Technology and Industry...|$|E

40|$|The Standard Oil case {{continues}} to inform {{many aspects of}} current antitrust policy. Part of Standard Oil’s significance, however, has been lost over time. The Supreme Court condemned a range of conduct by the Standard Oil Company as anticompetitive, including predatory pricing. Predatory pricing occurs when a firm prices its product below cost in order to drive its competitors from the market. Once enough rivals have exited the market, the predator raises price and earns stream of monopoly profits. In the decades following the opinion, the conventional wisdom held that Standard Oil had engaged in predatory pricing. The Standard Oil opinion stood for the proposition that using predatory pricing to acquire or maintain a monopoly violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The opinion did not define the contours of predatory pricing, neither explicitly saying that a <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> is a price below cost nor specifying what measure of cost courts should use. Nevertheless, the opinion {{laid the groundwork for}} future federal courts to address these questions and to provide more structure to the predatory pricing cause of action. Based on a revisionist history of Standard Oil written by John McGee in 1958 article, the new conventional wisdom now holds that the Standard Oil Company never engaged in predatory pricing and that the case stands for the proposition that monopolists do not use below-cost pricing as a mechanism to acquire or maintain monopoly power. The article challenges McGee’s thesis. After exploring how McGee’s work has affected antitrust jurisprudence, this article challenges McGee’s interpretation of the trial record in Standard Oil, showing several instances where the data shows the Standard Oil Company charging a price below its costs. McGee often ignored or misinterpreted evidence inconsistent with his thesis that the Standard Oil Company never engaged in predatory pricing. Finally, despite claims that McGee’s work is empirical proof of the irrationality and nonexistence of predatory pricing, this article shows that McGee’s work is theoretical, not empirical, and has had undue influence...|$|E
