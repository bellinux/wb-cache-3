40|$|Faced with an {{economic}} slowdown, the Austria federal government implemented two economic stimulus packages in 2001 and 2002 respectively. These packages provide for additional public expenditure, {{most of which}} has been advanced by one or two years, particularly with regard to public transportation infrastructure as well as the construction sector. Moreover, various tax incentives aiming to improve the supply-side conditions were introduced or expanded. A survey conducted by WIFO found a remarkably high number of enterprises indicating that they were adequately informed of the most important tax incentives (tax allowance and <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> R&D, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> apprentices, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> external and internal training measures, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> incremental investment). The extent to which tax allowances and premiums are actually claimed varies, however; the rate is highest <b>for</b> the <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> apprentices.
