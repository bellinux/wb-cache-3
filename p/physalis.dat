500|$|Aside from sponges, hawksbills feed on algae, cnidarians, [...] comb jellies {{and other}} jellyfish, and sea anemones.

The man o' war's stinging cells cannot penetrate the turtles' armored heads.|$|E
500|$|In Systema Naturae, the {{unwieldy}} names mostly {{used at the}} time, such as [...] "", were {{supplemented with}} concise and now familiar [...] "binomials", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet – in the case given, <b>Physalis</b> angulata. These binomials {{could serve as a}} label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin) almost 200 years earlier, Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, {{fresh fruit}} may be eaten after a meal as a dessert. Fresh {{sugarcane}} {{may also be}} chewed as a treat. A great variety of temperate and tropical fruits are grown locally and may be enjoyed fresh or sprinkled with sugar. Temperate fruits found in Madagascar include {{but are not limited}} to apples, lemons, pumpkins, watermelon, oranges, cherries and strawberries. Among the many tropical fruits commonly eaten in Madagascar are coconut, tamarind, mango, pineapple, avocado, passion fruit, and loquats, locally called pibasy (...) [...] Guava, longans, lychees, persimmon and [...] "pok-pok" [...] (also called voanantsindrana [...] ), a fruit similar to a <b>physalis,</b> are common, while on the west coast the fruit of the baobab tree is eaten during the brief period when it becomes available near the end of the rainy season.|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese man o' war (Physalia <b>physalis)</b> {{lives at}} {{the surface of the}} ocean. The {{gas-filled}} bladder, or pneumatophore (sometimes called a [...] "sail"), remains at the surface, while the remainder is submerged. Because the Portuguese man o' war has no means of propulsion, it is moved by a combination of winds, currents, and tides. [...] The sail is equipped with a siphon. In the event of a surface attack, the sail can be deflated, allowing the organism to briefly submerge.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} various types of mostly deciduous forest, with leaves fully or partially fall {{during the dry season}} and the very cold weeks in December and January. Forests of pine, red and white cedar and sweetgum are prominent in the higher elevations. In the hot and dry areas, various cactus and other arid area plants such as cats claw, biznaga cactus, maguey, organ cactus, and nopals can be found. Landa has one of the few mesophile forests in the state of Querétaro, which is mostly found in steep canyon areas between 800 and 2000 masl. Between 600 and 800 meters, the mesophile forest blends with tropical rainforest such as {{in the bottom of the}} Tancuilin Canyon. A study of flora in {{the municipality}} counted 774 species of vascular plants, with the most diversity found in old growth areas where the thick tree canopy traps moisture. These areas have trees that measure thirty to forty meters in height. Most of the plant species are classified as herbs, followed by bushes, then trees, reeds, epiphyte and parasitic plants. Ninety one percent are classified as tropical vegetation. The variety of species here represents about 25% of the plant diversity in Mexico. A recently discovered species, named <b>Physalis</b> queretaroensis, is a rare plant restricted to the municipality. It is related to P. volubilis, [...] which is restricted to Jalisco and Michoacán, but differs in form and insertion of the leaves and vestiture. It is an herb that grows about seventy cm in height in the forest areas of oak, pine and mesophile forests in altitudes between 1700 and 1850 masl.|$|E

Another possibility they gave was that the hybrid plants may be better suited for certain environments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Physalis</b> {{species are}} now studied for their {{potential}} health benefits. One study done specifically on <b>Physalis</b> virginiana {{was intended to}} investigate the antibacterial potential of <b>Physalis</b> virginiana. The overall {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the chemical compounds of <b>Physalis</b> virginiana that could be used to make antibiotics. The researchers introduced extracts from the plant to twelve different bacteria cultures. They found that extracts from the plant inhibited the growth of eight out of the twelve strains of bacteria. The identified the chemical compound in the plant that inhibits bacteria growth to be withanolide. The whole plant showed bacteria inhibiting properties but extracts from the shoots of the plants had the most effect, and extracts from the roots of the plant showed the least effect.|$|E
