It was known that the <b>phosphates</b> <b>of</b> many heavy metals were insoluble in an acid solutions.

Bismuth phosphate was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate and this became known as the bismuth phosphate process. Cooper and Burris B. Cunningham were able to replicate Thompson's results and the bismuth phosphate process was adopted as a fallback in case lanthanum fluoride could not be made to work. The processes were similar and the equipment used for lanthanum fluoride could be adapted for use with Thompson's bismuth phosphate process. In May 1943, the DuPont engineers decided to adopt the bismuth phosphate process for use in the Clinton semiworks and the Hanford production site.|$|R
