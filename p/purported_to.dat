5|$|Former College Librarian William Woodward hid {{the seal}} from Dartmouth's {{officers}} {{along with the}} charter and four account books after the state of New Hampshire <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> take over the operation of Dartmouth College (and <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> make Woodward Treasurer of Dartmouth University). The Dartmouth College Case named Woodward as the defendant and technically sought to recover the items that he had hidden. The College's success in the Supreme Court returned the seal to its possession and extinguished the University.|$|E

5|$|Other 19th century {{experiments}} were <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> show that frogs {{did not attempt}} to escape gradually heated water. An 1872 experiment by Heinzmann was said to show that a normal frog would not attempt to escape if the water was heated slowly enough, which was corroborated in 1875 by Fratscher.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previously}} favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's {{wars and}} religious policies during the 1670s.

5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Ljótólfr {{is a minor}} {{character}} in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga, who is <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> have flourished in the mid-12th century. The Orkneyinga saga was compiled in about 1200, and documents the reigns of the earls of Orkney. It depicts Ljótólfr as a nobleman {{who lived on the}} Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. During the 12th century, the Hebrides formed part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Numerous globes <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} owned by Hitler exist {{throughout}} the world, although {{the authenticity of}} many of them is doubtful. There are {{a total of three}} in Berlin, one at a geographical institute, another at the Marcher Museum, and the third at the German Historical Museum. Another two reside in public collections in Munich. Many of the globes show Germany with a bullet hole or simply wiped out, an act committed out of contempt by either Soviet or American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Rumours also {{surfaced}} in 1900, after Albert Victor's death, of {{his association with}} another former Gaiety girl, Maude Richardson (birth name: Louisa Lancey), and that the royal family had attempted to pay her off. In 2002, letters <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> have been sent by Albert Victor to his solicitor referring to a payoff made to Richardson of £200 were sold at Bonhams auction house in London. Owing to discrepancies in the dates and spelling of the letters, one historian has suggested they could be forgeries.|$|E

5|$|Some TLPs may {{be caused}} by gas {{escaping}} from underground cavities. These gaseous events are <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> display a distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze. The majority of TLPs appear to be associated with floor-fractured craters, the edges of lunar maria, or in other locations linked by geologists with volcanic activity. However, {{these are some of the}} most common targets when viewing the Moon, and this correlation could be an observational bias.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} that <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> {{show that}} bumblebees cannot fly {{are based upon}} a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
