5|$|Aspect weavers' {{performance}}, {{as well as}} {{the performance}} of the code that they produce, has been a subject of analysis. It is preferable that the improvement in modularity supplied by aspect weaving does not impact run-time performance. Aspect weavers are able to perform aspect-specific optimizations. While traditional optimizations such as the elimination of unused special variables from aspect code can be done at compile-time, some optimizations can only be performed by the aspect weaver. For example, AspectJ contains two similar but distinct keywords, thisJoinPoint, which contains information about this particular instance of woven code, and thisJoinPointStaticPart, which contains information common to all instances of code relevant to that set of advice. The optimization of replacing thisJoinPoint with the more efficient and static keyword thisJoinPointStaticPart can only be done by the aspect weaver. By performing this replacement, the woven program avoids the creation of a join point object on every execution. Studies have shown that the unnecessary creation of join point objects in AspectJ can lead to a performance overhead of 5% at run-time, while <b>performance</b> <b>degradation</b> is only approximately 1% when this object is not created.|$|E

25|$|When {{surfaces}} in contact move relative to each other, the {{friction between the}} two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (that is, it converts work to heat). This property can have dramatic consequences, {{as illustrated by the}} use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to <b>performance</b> <b>degradation</b> or damage to components.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust strategy for online fault detection and optimal control of condenser cooling water systems. The optimal control strategy is formulated using a model-based approach, in which simplified models and a hybrid quick search (HQS) method {{are used to}} optimize {{the performance of the}} overall system by changing the settings of the local process controllers. A system level online fault detection scheme is embedded into the control system and used to monitor whether the system operates in a healthy condition. The faults considered are mainly the component <b>performance</b> <b>degradations.</b> When a fault is detected, the control system will be reconstructed to regain the control through using robust schemes. The performance of the proposed strategy is tested and evaluated against on a simulated virtual system representing the actual condenser cooling water system in a super high-rise building. The results show that the fault detection scheme is effective in identifying system <b>performance</b> <b>degradations</b> and the fault-tolerant control strategy with online fault detection and optimal control can enhance the overall system performance significantly when the operation of condenser cooling water systems suffers from <b>performance</b> <b>degradations,</b> as compared to that using optimal control only.

Fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE datalink, J-75 {{afterburning}} turbojet, enlarged intake, variable-geometry inlet ramps and shortened intake ducts, refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin; tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at high thrust settings including afterburner. Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least 57,000ft. Many were fitted with a conically-cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft's range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant <b>performance</b> <b>degradation</b> they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay.|$|E
25|$|Reliable {{projections}} for CNS risks from space radiation exposure cannot {{be made at}} this time due to a paucity of data on the subject. Existing animal and cellular data do suggest that space radiation can produce neurological and behavioral effects; therefore, {{it is possible that}} mission operations will be impacted. The significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated, however. It is to be noted that studies, to date, have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); this means that testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) has not yet been carried out to a sufficient extent. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is typically used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach has not been discovered to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, <b>performance</b> <b>degradation,</b> or late CNS effects in astronauts. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the data and knowledge that will be necessary to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. A vigorous research program, which will be required to solve these problems, must rely on new approaches to risk assessment and countermeasure validation because of the absence of useful human radio-epidemiology data in this area.|$|E
