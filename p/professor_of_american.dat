25|$|In the United States, a labiaplasty surgeon {{can earn}} up to $250,000 a month. Simone Weil Davis, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> studies, told Shameless {{magazine}} in 2005 that surgeons are perpetuating {{the idea that}} there is a right way for women's genitalia to look; because most women see only their own vaginas or pornographic images, it is easy to make them doubt themselves. The feminist organization, the New View Campaign, has spoken out against the existence of unregulated cosmetic surgery clinics as business enterprises, which it says trade on women's sexuality by appealing to their low self-esteem, thereby creating health risks.|$|E

25|$|A <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> {{history at}} Harvard University {{specializing in the}} history of gender and {{sexuality}} has researched gender roles and marriage trends for decades. Dr. Cott has testified for the plaintiffs in both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. Cott offered several examples of discriminatory practices involving marriages over the years which are no longer accepted, among them interracial marriages once being banned, American women who married foreigners once lost their citizenship and property, and the U.S. government at times not acknowledging Native American and Japanese marriages. Cott testified on February 28, 2014 that “The trend is moving toward same-sex gender neutrality/gender equality marriages; and the trend is moving toward same-sex marriages.” She also testified that “The Michigan Marriage Amendment obstructs that trend from continuing.” In explaining how marriage has evolved, Cott cited the 300-year ban on interracial marriage, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. Cott said marriage is a “civil contract” that only be legally sanctioned by legislatures and the courts. In addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage, she said religious authorities have no legal standing over marriages even though they are allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies. Cott testified that there have been no laws in U.S. history that made procreation a requirement for marriage, an argument used by opponents of same-sex marriage. Under cross-examination by state attorney Michelle Brya, Cott admitted the state of Michigan does have an interest in marriage {{between a man and a}} woman for population purposes and sometimes economic reasons but did not believe those two issues should stand in the way of same-sex couples legally marrying.|$|E

500|$|Janet Floyd, the <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Literature, {{identifies}} that David [...] "showed {{little interest}} in appealing to or engaging with an audience outside a social elite"; Cooper addresses the same point, although points to a positive review of French Provincial Cooking in The Daily Worker—a newspaper that represented the Communist Party of Great Britain—as evidence that David had a broader readership than some give credit for.|$|E
500|$|David's writing had {{an impact}} on the {{cultural}} approach of the British towards food. According to the food journalist Joanna Blythman, she [...] "performed both a cultural and gastronomic miracle in post-war Britain by introducing the nation to a vision of fresh Continental food", while the writer Rose Prince considers that David [...] "changed for ever the way British people cook". Janet Floyd, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Literature at King's College London, considers that David was not a driver of change, but came to epitomise that change. The literary historian Nicola Humble observes that [...] "the food revolution of the post-war years would probably have happened without Elizabeth David, though in her absence it would have happened very differently".|$|E

500|$|From 1958 to 1959, {{he was a}} Fulbright <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> Economics at the University of Genoa in Italy. After {{returning}} from Italy, Arrington arranged for donations from patrons to fund the writing of Mormon biographies. Much of these biographies were researched and written by graduate students and other assistants, but published under Arrington's name with acknowledgements of the student work. Also in 1959, Arrington wrote an article featured in {{the first issue of}} BYU Studies entitled [...] "An Economic Interpretation of 'The Word of Wisdom.'" [...] The article argued that Brigham Young's enforcement of the Word of Wisdom as a commandment was motivated by a desire to keep cash inside Utah (and not spent on luxury imports). BYU Studies was suspended for a year, which Ernest L. Wilkinson told Arrington was because of his revisionist history paper.|$|E
500|$|According to Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic, Cal's {{narration}} {{evokes the}} style of the picaresque novel, retelling events that have already occurred and foreshadowing the future through [...] "portentous glimpses". Francisco Collado-Rodríguez, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> literature, classified the beginning of Middlesex as a historiographical and metafictional chronicle for its discussion of events such as the Greco-Turkish war and the Great Fire of Smyrna. He also considered the first section of the novel as a tragicomedy about the Stephanides' migration from Greece and assimilation into America. Soar posited Desdemona and Lefty's passage as a romantic comedy: the lovers, brother and sister, pretend to be strangers who meet for the first time, attempting [...] "to unknow themselves, to remythologise themselves by developing a past they could live with, unfamiliar and therefore permissible". As the story progresses, Middlesex becomes a social novel about Detroit, discussing the seclusion of living in a 1970s suburb. At the end of the novel, the story adopts the tone of the detective genre.|$|E
500|$|He {{characterized}} the song as [...] "advanced rhythm and blues", while its theremin and cello {{has been called}} the song's [...] "psychedelic ingredient". In his book discussing music of the counterculture era, James Perrone stated that the song represented a type of impressionistic psychedelia, in particular for its cello playing repeated bass notes and its theremin. <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> history John Robert Greene named [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] among examples of psychedelic or acid rock. Stebbins wrote that the song was [...] "replete with sunshine [...] psychedelia". Uncut wrote that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was [...] "three minutes and thirty-six seconds of avant-garde pop". Mixdown described it as a [...] "masterpiece of avant-pop". Steve Valdez says that, like Pet Sounds, Brian was attempting a more experimental rock style. It has since been marketed as pop music, [...] "possibly because it comes across relatively innocent compared with the hard-edged rock we have since come to know", according to historian Lorenzo Candelaria. Sound on Sound argues that the song [...] "has as many dramatic changes in mood as a piece of serious classical music lasting more than half an hour". Tom Roland of American Songwriter described the piece as being [...] "with its interlocking segments—a sort of pop version of the classical sonata, consisting of a series of musical movements". New York Magazine compared it to [...] "a fugue with a rhythmic beat". John Bush compared the track's fragmented cut-and-paste style to 1960s experimentalists such as William S. Burroughs.|$|E
