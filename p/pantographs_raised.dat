50|$|Trains {{bound for}} Moorgate {{approach}} Drayton Park on a falling gradient, drawing power via the pantograph until a trackside Automatic Power Control (APC) magnet opens the Vacuum Circuit Breaker (VCB) {{on the roof}} of the train, cutting off power. This prevents the driver from powering into the tunnel with the <b>pantograph</b> <b>raised.</b> After coasting to a stand the driver lowers the pantograph and changes over to DC. On journeys from Moorgate traction power is maintained into Drayton Park for the rising gradient, since if the driver forgets to change to AC no damage will occur to the train. Once the train is at a stand the driver selects AC traction and <b>raises</b> the <b>pantograph.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electronically, {{the train}} is {{actually}} two identical half-trains of four coaches each, each with an independent power system, apart from the active pantograph (only a single <b>pantograph</b> is <b>raised</b> on AC-fed rail lines) and a high voltage line along {{the entire length of}} the 8-car train.|$|R

40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} is a convenient and {{efficient way to}} operate railway rolling stock, but the influence between the pantographs makes the system more sensitive and vulnerable than a single-pantograph system. When a train passes through special sections or in an emergency condition, {{it is necessary to}} lower one or all of the <b>pantographs</b> and then <b>raise</b> them up again. In these circumstances, the motion of the pantographs can introduce a sudden impact to the catenary that may change the pantograph configuration, then disrupting the dynamic stability. To address the dynamic performance during <b>pantograph</b> <b>raising</b> and lowering, a numerical study on multi-pantograph {{operation is}} carried out with help of a 3 D pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model under the conditions: up to three pantographs, various pantograph raising/lowering orders and different operating positions in a span. The results show that the leading pantograph is little influenced by the raising and lowering movement of any pantograph behind it. However, any trailing pantograph is significantly affected by any operation taking place ahead of it. The dynamic performance of the system depends on the pantograph spacing distance and the operational speed, but is little affected by the operating position in a span. To study auxiliary-pantograph operation where the leading pantograph works as an auxiliary pantograph, this paper shows how an optimal setting of the leading pantograph benefits the trailing pantograph and suggests specifying the speed where the leading pantograph gets into or out of service to avoid disruption.

25|$|L class {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two pantographs. The VR issued instructions for both <b>pantographs</b> to be <b>raised</b> in winter months, {{with the first}} pantograph serving to knock ice off the overhead catenary and ensure good contact for the second pantograph.|$|R
50|$|To protect {{maintenance}} {{workers from}} electrocution, all high-voltage cabinets have safety switches which automatically lower the pantograph if the cabinet is opened while the power car is energized. Late-model ER2s also feature a ladder blocking relay which prevents {{the extension of}} maintenance ladders when the <b>pantograph</b> is <b>raised,</b> thus preventing workers and bystanders from climbing onto the roof. For passenger safety, all doors are equipped with position sensors which notify the engineer whether all doors are shut (however, in practice it is standard operating procedure for the fireman to step out onto the platform and check the doors visually).|$|R
50|$|LGVs are all {{electrified}} at 25 kV 50 Hz AC. Catenary wires {{are kept}} at a greater mechanical tension than normal lines because the pantograph causes oscillations in the wire, and the wave must travel {{faster than the}} train to avoid producing standing waves that would cause the wires to break. This was a problem when rail speed record attempts were made in 1990; tension had to be increased further still to accommodate train speeds of over 500 km/h. On LGVs only the rear <b>pantograph</b> is <b>raised,</b> avoiding amplification of the oscillations created by a front pantograph. The front power car is supplied by a cable along {{the roof of the}} train. Eurostar trains are long enough that oscillations are damped sufficiently between the front and rear power cars (British designers were wary of running a high-power line through passenger carriages, thus the centrally located power cars in the ill-fated Advanced Passenger Train), so the two power cars could be connected without a high voltage cable through passenger vehicles. The same applies when two TGVs run in multiple. On lignes classiques, slower maximum speeds prevent oscillation problems, and on DC lines both <b>pantographs</b> must be <b>raised</b> to draw sufficient current.|$|R
500|$|The frames, {{running gear}} and riveted {{body for the}} {{prototype}} GG1 were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. The partially built locomotive was then shipped to the General Electric factory in Erie, Pennsylvania for the installation of its electrical components. Twelve traction motors, two {{on each of the}} GG1's six powered axles, produced [...] that was transmitted to the [...] driving wheels by a quill drive. Unlike other GG1s, access steps were installed {{at each end of the}} locomotive to ease maintenance of the pantographs; the pantographs were mechanically linked to a safety plate that blocked access to the steps when the <b>pantographs</b> were <b>raised.</b> The finished locomotive was [...] long and [...] tall, with both of its pantographs lowered.|$|R
50|$|When {{there was}} no {{compressed}} air in the unit's system to <b>raise</b> a <b>pantograph</b> to start up, a pantograph hook stick was used to manually <b>raise</b> the <b>pantograph.</b> This started the high voltage motor which drove the auxiliary alternator to supply 110V power to start the compressor and power other control circuits. Once there was enough main air pressure to keep the <b>pantograph</b> in the <b>raised</b> position, the <b>pantograph</b> hook stick could be removed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Dresden-Schöna section was electrified. The {{electric}} train service began on 29 May 1976. In 1987, electric overhead line was {{installed on the}} section of the line within Czechoslovakia between Děčín hl. n. (Bodenbach) and Děčín vychod (Tetschen). Nevertheless, scheduled electric trains did not begin operating across the border until 1992. The problem was the different electrical systems in use. The German section is electrified at the German standard of 15 kV AC at 16.7 Hz. In the north of the Czech Republic, lines are electrified with the 3000-volt DC system. In order to operate the route continuously using electrical traction, a dual-system locomotive (class 180) was developed. 50 m of the contact wire between Schöna and Dolní Žleb carries no current. In this section of the line the driver lowers the pantograph and coasts through the neutral section while changing the locomotive's electrical setting. Afterwards, the <b>pantograph</b> is <b>raised</b> again.|$|R
50|$|Opening {{day for the}} Aldene Plan was {{announced}} for Monday, May 1, 1967 but a full-service rehearsal occurred the day prior (a Sunday to avoid the commuter rush). The CNJ operated push-pull consists with a cab car leading eastbound. Until 2014, operations remained the same: passengers for New York would disembark at Newark and change to a Northeast Corridor or North Jersey Coast Line train operated by New Jersey Transit to New York Penn Station or PATH trains to the World Trade Center. However, in 2014 NJ Transit began offering a one-seat ride to New York making use of their recently purchased dual mode locomotives, which can change between diesel power and electric power. The trains operate under diesel power on the Raritan Valley Line which has never been electrified. At Newark, the diesel motors are shut down and a <b>pantograph</b> is <b>raised,</b> since only electric trains can operate into New York Penn Station. Currently the dual-mode service is only run during off-peak hours as Penn Station cannot accommodate any more trains during rush hours.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pantographs</b> are <b>raised</b> using {{compressed}} air, {{which is}} provided at 5 bar (...) to the lifting cylinder. <b>Raising</b> the <b>pantograph</b> takes 5 seconds, while retraction takes 4 seconds. The contact shoe pushes against the contact wire with adjustable pressure of between 70 and 120 N. The driver controls the pantograph via a push {{button on the}} driver's desk (Up, Down, and Down + Sanding for emergency cases are the settings). The choice of which pantograph to use can be left up to the locomotive by the driver, which would automatically use the back pantograph {{in the direction of}} travel, or, in double heading, where two locomotives are coupled, it would be the front pantograph on the front locomotive, and the back pantograph on the back locomotive. Otherwise the driver, using a switch located on the battery control table in driver's cab 1, may raise one or the other, or both together. This is primarily an advantage during shunting/switching operation, where otherwise the change from one driver's cab to the other would mean the automatic switching from one pantograph to the other. In cases where the pantograph is being switched, the unit that was in the down position is lifted first, and once it is successfully pushed up against the contact wire, the pantograph that was in service is lowered.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe winds gusts {{with high}} speed can {{negative}} affect {{the operation of}} railway electric vehicles. These vehicles can achieve high performances, {{as long as the}} power supply is ensured, without discontinuities or interruptions in the process. This article is an analysis of how the wind gusts affect variation drag resistance to advancing caused by the pantograph and how they affect the supply of electricity required for vehicle movement. To this end, in a first step, we modeled geometrically in 3 D EP 3 <b>pantograph,</b> which was <b>raised</b> to maximum working height. For simulation of air flow among the components of the collector (pantograph active) we considered how it is used and placed on the vehicle body. For analyze the effects caused by gusts of wind, we considered point values for angles within the range [0 °, 180 °] and speeds, a range of from 0 m/s to 30 m/s. This article is developed in programs postdoctoral studies at the University Politehnica of Bucharest...|$|R

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{has been}} funding {{university}} research into flexible, six-legged walking machines capable of exploring alien terrain. This research {{has led to}} a progressive new look at standard four bar mechanisms. Four bar mechanisms, by definition, consist of a crank link, coupler link, rocker link and fixed (ground) link. The passive role of the coupler link, in traditional four bar mechanisms, can be reversed so that the coupler becomes the transmission link. This is achieved by replacing the coupler with an oblique triangular link. The internal angles of the modified coupler can be varied to create an array of continuous, ovoid paths at the disjointed vertex of the triangle. Attaching a pantograph mechanism to the modified coupler's trace point amplifiers and translates the ovoid path. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a stable, one degree of freedom walking path which emulates that of humans. This mechanism can therefore be used as a robotic leg. A second degree of freedom is obtained by attaching an adjacent link to the <b>pantograph</b> mechanism which <b>raises</b> or lowers the walking path without effecting its shape or magnitude. This is used for climbing and maneuvering amidst rugged terrain...|$|R
