In Germany, for example, by integrating photovoltaics in buildings up to 50 % of the electricity demand can be covered. The political support of BIPV would contribute to the development and installation of BIPV components and therefore also promote the development of new business areas for industries dealing with components used in building envelopes and <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generators.</b> BIPV can be separated into three different integration types: “technical”, “formal” and “technical & formal”.

40|$|<b>Photovoltaic</b> <b>generator</b> is {{a device}} that {{converts}} solar radiation originated from the Sun into electrical energy. Power electronics are used to feed this electrical energy into the grid. In {{the design of a}} converter that is connected to the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator,</b> {{it is important to know}} the maximum values of the generator output: Maximum output power, short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage, which are dependent on the amount of incident radiation and the value of ambient temperature. Maximum value for short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage were found based on the year-round irradiation and temperature measurement data. In this thesis, two boost-power-stage converters were designed. Design of the first converter was based on the conventional method that was introduced in the literature. In that method, the inductor and semiconductors were sized by using current that was derived by dividing input power of the converter by input voltage. Value of the converter input power was calculated by multiplying the standard test condition output power of the selected <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator</b> by conventional sizing factor, which is the ratio of the converter nominal input power to the nominal output power of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator.</b> The second converter was designed by using the information about the real maximum output current of the selected <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator,</b> which is the short-circuit current. The converters were designed in such a way that both have the same amount of switching frequency input voltage ripple and equal ability to prevent the low frequency output voltage ripple from affecting the input voltage. Even if the converters are electrically similar, the conventional design method leads to higher input capacitance, larger inductor core size and more uneven temperature distribution of the power semiconductors at the maximum power point than the new design method. Thus, the conventional design method leads to unnecessary oversizing. Significant cost savings can be achieved by applying the new design method, which is presented in this thesis for the first time. The results were verified by experimental measurements...|$|E

Although this software was devised to be used mainly in in-household installations, it could also be implemented in commercial and industrial installations.

40|$|A <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator</b> {{converts}} {{solar radiation}} into electrical energy. Power electronic converters are of prime importance {{in managing the}} produced energy e. g. between source and grid. Design of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator</b> interfacing converter {{is based on the}} electrical characteristics of the generator. Characteristics such as: maximum output power, short circuit current and open circuit voltage, which are dependent on the amount of insolation and the value of ambient temperature, are important to know when the converter is designed. Also, the dynamic resistance of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator</b> has a signiﬁcant effect especially on the control design. Measurement data of the electrical characteristics of a Raloss SR 30 - 36 solar panel measured in certain climate conditions was used in the design in this thesis. In this thesis, a boost-power-stage converter with a cascaded inner inductor-current and outer input-voltage control was designed for <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>generator</b> interfacing. The main focus of this work is in obtaining a correct dynamic model for such a system, as well as, to evaluate the effect of the dynamic resistance on control. A prototype converter was built based on the design, and the control was implemented digitally. Every closed-loop frequency response of the converter and the responses to a voltage reference step-change were measured in order to verify the theoretical ﬁndings. The idea for testing this type of control was obtained from recent publications. The measurement results conﬁrmed that the obtained system model was correct, however, if the control is implemented digitally, the sampling delay should be taken into account in the design. Two PI-controllers were sufficient for providing a stable system. Control performance was signiﬁcantly affected by the dynamic resistance. The control was much slower when the operation point was in the constant voltage region. The dynamic resistance had no effect on the system output impedance.

But consuming the non-renewable resources to generate the electric power, the carbon emissions have made a serious call to global warming so, during the last decade, the electric power systems have seen the penetration of renewable energy resources.
