5|$|In 1960, Norway {{entered a}} {{cooperation}} with the United States, {{which resulted in the}} construction of the Norwegian Space Centre at Andøya. In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to the rapidly developing Soviet and American space programs. Norway chose to only join as an observer, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of the close {{cooperation with the}} US and <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of the cost. However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.|$|E
5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after the Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.|$|E
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of his wife's spendthrift {{habits and}} <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> he {{strongly}} suspected {{she was being}} unfaithful to him. He spoke to his parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed to give him a divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E

5|$|Dual Destinies {{was given}} a digital-only release in the West. This was <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of the game's tight {{development}} schedule: by releasing it digitally, Capcom was able to release the English version close to the Japanese release date. Although Ace Attorney Investigations 2 has not been officially localized, it has received a full fan translation.|$|E
5|$|Issued loans {{accounted}} for roughly 21% {{of the finance}} of Confederate war expenditure. In fact, initially the South was more successful in selling debt than the North, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> New Orleans was a major financial center, whose financiers bought up two-fifths of a 15 million dollar loan in early 1861.|$|E
5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an active part in policy decisions in this period, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of his disagreements with Maugham and <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that he got on with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E

50|$|The county {{population}} collapsed {{after the}} Comstock Lode was fully mined {{and hit a}} minimum of 568 in the 1960 U.S. Census. Since then, its population has <b>partially</b> recovered <b>because</b> of its relative proximity to Reno.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of the special definition of trustee used and <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> he is controlled by the player, and <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the NATO attacks, the Pakistani {{government}} refused to attend the Bonn conference scheduled on 5 December 2011. The event in Bonn, Germany is an important international conference on Afghanistan. International pressure over Pakistan amounted as it refused to attend the Bonn conference. Secretary Hillary Clinton contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister but her plea was rejected because Pakistani public opinion prohibited attendance. The conference was generally regarded as a disappointment, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of Pakistan's absence.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the coup, Prince Paul was in Zagreb en route to a planned holiday in Brdo. On the morning of 27 March, Deputy Prime Minister Maček was {{informed}} of the coup and met Prince Paul at Zagreb's railway station to discuss the situation. Maček suggested that Paul stay in Zagreb, with the possibility of mobilizing army units in the Banovina of Croatia in his support. Prince Paul declined this offer, at least <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> his wife Princess Olga and children remained in Belgrade. He reached the capital by train that evening and was immediately ordered to sign papers abolishing the regency. He was subsequently exiled to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was helped by {{the construction of the}} Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E

2500|$|As secret, or hidden, as {{her name}} implies, {{there are only}} a few facts known about Niguma's life. This may <b>partially</b> be <b>because</b> of genuine lack of sources from both India and Tibet as well as the nature of the dakini. One author offers this explanation: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Partially</b> <b>because</b> of the Crewkerne incident, {{and due to}} {{the incessant}} {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partially</b> <b>because</b> of this fact, {{ticket sales}} were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly {{as the game}} day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E
25|$|A {{competent}} draftsman could attach {{some form}} of post-solution activity to almost any mathematical formula; the Pythagorean theorem {{would not have been}} patentable, or <b>partially</b> patentable, <b>because</b> a patent application contained a final step indicating that the formula, when solved, could be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques.|$|R

5|$|The trend had {{substantial}} {{implications for}} many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail {{was removed from}} the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities. Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as upmarket housing, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Thompson still {{wished to}} leave Alaska, however, and in 1915, he sold a {{majority}} share of News-Miner stock on option to O.P. Gaustad, a Republican Party booster. Scandal erupted {{when it was}} revealed that Gaustad was merely a stand-in for James Wickersham, who was Alaska's delegate to Congress. <b>Partially</b> <b>because</b> of the scandal, Gaustad was unable to sell the shares he held an option for, and Thompson returned to Alaska in spring 1916 to reassume his role as publisher. Later that year, Republican interests took over the Fairbanks Times, which had leaned toward the Democratic Party. The new owners of the Times were unable to come up with financing for new equipment, however, and the Times went out of business in October 1916.|$|E
5|$|After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the earls of Lancaster and Warwick {{saw their}} {{political}} influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311. Lancaster became {{the head of}} the royal council in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, <b>partially</b> <b>because</b> of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the Treaty of Leake in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.|$|E
