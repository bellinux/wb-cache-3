5|$|The {{sultan of}} Darfur Ali Dinar had been reïnstated by the British after their {{victory in the}} Mahdist War but during the First World War he grew restive, refusing his {{customary}} tribute to the Sudanese government and showing <b>partiality</b> to the Ottoman Empire in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, {{to the dismay of}} Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's <b>partiality</b> towards them.|$|E
5|$|Two large famines {{occurred}} in Madras during this period, the Great Famine of 1876–78 and the Indian famine of 1896–97. As a result, {{the population of}} the Presidency fell for the first time from 31.2 million in 1871 to 30.8 million in 1881. These famines and alleged <b>partiality</b> shown by the government in handling the Chingleput Ryots' Case and the Salem riots trial caused discontent among the population.|$|E
6000|$|Emily {{smiled at}} the strong <b>partialities</b> of her aunt, and replied, [...] "Your {{handsome}} chaise and attendants will draw respect from most men in his situation, dear aunt, be their masters who they may." ...|$|R
50|$|His {{views on}} poetry are {{documented}} in essays collected in Plummets and Other <b>Partialities</b> (1986), and in letters to W.W.E. Ross published as A Literary Friendship in 1984. He also was {{in contact with}} John Sutherland.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are not stark mad?' said Nixon, who now saw he had miscalculated in supposing Nanty's wild {{ideas of}} honour and {{fidelity}} could be shaken even by resentment, or by his Protestant <b>partialities.</b> 'You shall not go back--it {{is all a}} joke.' ...|$|R
5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without <b>partiality.</b> In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of <b>partiality</b> (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{regarded}} {{himself as}} overlord of Cyprus as his father, Henry VI, {{had sent the}} royal crown to Aimery of Lusignan, the first king of Cyprus. On Philip of Ibelin's initiative, the High Court of Cyprus arranged the coronation of the eight-year-old Henry without the emperor's consent in 1225, drawing the ire of the emperor. The marriage of Frederick and Isabella II, Queen of Jerusalem, daughter and successor of Alice's half-sister, Mary, had been decided in 1223. Alice attended the coronation of Isabella II in Tyre before the queen departed for Italy to meet Frederick in 1225. Frederick persuaded the dying Pope Honorius to delegate two new judges (the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the Bishop of Acre) to investigate the marriage of Alice and Bohemond, accusing Eustorgius of <b>partiality.</b> Honorius' successor, Pope Gregory IX confirmed Honorius' decision. Alice and her husband came to Limassol in summer 1227 to meet Frederick, but a disease prevented Frederick from departing Italy. Pope Gregory declared that Frederick did not fulfill his crusader oath and excommunicated him. Alice and Bohemond's marriage was subsequently annulled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{national}} <b>partialities</b> {{have made}} you an unjust judge towards others, Mr. Powis." [...] Eve interrupted him by saying, though the earnestness and passion {{with which the}} young man uttered his feelings, made music to her ears: [...] "what had a young, frightened, half-educated American girl to boast of, when put in competition with the finished women of Austria?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can see it}} has {{disturbed}} him, as did the Battle of Bunker's Hill. But he {{will reflect}} a few days, and decide now, as he did then, in favour of the Americans. He has English <b>partialities,</b> Bob, as is natural to one born in that country; but, on this point, his mind is very strongly American." ...|$|R
40|$|Relational {{theories}} of refinement using simulations exist based on total and on partial relations, modelling partial and total correctness. In order to model <b>partialities</b> such as non-termination and deadlock, domains of relations are often extended with, or assumed to include, a ``bottom'' value bot. This paper explores {{a number of}} such theories, all providing sound and jointly complete notions of simulations, concentrating {{on the role of}} bot...|$|R
5|$|Kom {{gives birth}} to twins and applies for a {{government}} job. However, she refuses {{the position of a}} police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent <b>partiality</b> of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Jack {{displayed}} a continued <b>partiality</b> towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used {{a number of}} effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.|$|E
25|$|Before Nero's consulship in 55, Nero forbade the {{persecution}} of a Julius Densus, an equestrian whose <b>partiality</b> for Britannicus had been construed as a crime.|$|E
60|$|The {{most memorable}} example {{in modern times}} {{of a man who}} united the spirit of {{philosophy}} with the pursuits of active life, and kept wholly clear from the <b>partialities</b> and prejudices both of the student and of the practical statesman, was Turgot; the wonder not only of his age, but of history, for his astonishing combination of the most opposite, and, judging from common experience, almost incompatible excellences.|$|R
40|$|This topic {{will respond}} the {{following}} fundamental problems: First, theoretical one, concerning the theoretical {{basis of the}} legal-interpretation method. Its questions would be: (a) Why are there many differences and <b>partialities</b> in interpreting the same legal text? (b) Can any of all existing methods of legal interpretation provide us a comprehensive legal-interpretation? Following the fundamental problems, the research then aims firstly at finding the advantage and the weakness of each method of legal interpretation...|$|R
60|$|I {{have only}} to add, that I have {{selected}} the above from many anecdotes of Rob Roy which were, and may still be, current among the mountains where he flourished; but I am far from warranting their exact authenticity. Clannish <b>partialities</b> were very apt to guide the tongue and pen, {{as well as the}} pistol and claymore, and the features of an anecdote are wonderfully softened or exaggerated as the story is told by a MacGregor or a Campbell.|$|R
25|$|Agrippa {{expended}} {{large sums}} in beautifying Jerusalem and other cities, especially Berytus (ancient Beirut), a Hellenised city in Phoenicia. His <b>partiality</b> {{for the latter}} rendered him unpopular amongst his own subjects, and the capricious manner in which he appointed and deposed the high priests made him disliked by his coreligionists.|$|E
25|$|As {{the result}} of {{numerous}} complaints concerning venality and <b>partiality,</b> Viceroy Carrillo de Mendoza began {{an investigation of the}} archbishop of Mexico, Juan Pérez de la Serna. The viceroy instructed the archbishop not to grant divorces so readily, not to accept gifts, and not to charge high prices in the butcher shop the archbishop owned.|$|E
25|$|Swami Sivananda {{also notes}} that God is free from charges of <b>partiality</b> and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and {{universal}} suffering in the world. According to the Brahma Sutras, individual souls are {{responsible for their own}} fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{felt much}} {{relieved}} at this candid confession {{by such a}} bronzed veteran, and, the chords of sympathy having been struck, he opened up his heart at once, to the evident delight of Henri, who, among other curious <b>partialities,</b> was extremely fond of listening to and taking part in conversations that bordered on the metaphysical, and were hard to be understood. Most conversations that were not connected with eating and hunting were of this nature to Henri.|$|R
60|$|It was Dairyman Crick's rule {{to insist}} on {{breaking}} down these <b>partialities</b> and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise, {{in the event of}} a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he was placed in a difficulty. The maids' private aims, however, were the reverse of the dairyman's rule, the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.|$|R
40|$|Two-person {{bargaining}} {{problem is}} considered as to allocate {{a number of}} goods between two players. This paper suggests that any non-trivial division of goods cause a non-zero change on the solution of bargaining. So, a axiom of sharing division is presented, as an alternative axiom to Nash axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives and Kalai-Smorodinsky axiom of monotonicity. This solution is targeted at the <b>partialities</b> of Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky solution on some specific issues, but not {{to say it is}} better than others...|$|R
25|$|The {{justice system}} of the Papal States was subject to {{numerous}} accusations, not unlike the justice systems {{in the rest of}} Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards and accusations of <b>partiality</b> of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.|$|E
25|$|Swami Tapasyananda further {{explains}} the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: {{the power in}} a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (jivas) move in a direction {{in which they are}} set. Thus he concludes that no charge of <b>partiality</b> and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.|$|E
25|$|Actual bias is the {{influence}} of <b>partiality</b> and prejudice in decision-making, and actual prejudice against or in favour of a party. It must be proved on a balance of probabilities. However, it is understandably difficult to obtain evidence of actual bias. In any case, the common law protects litigants who can discharge the lesser burden of showing a real danger of bias without requiring them to show that such bias actually exists.|$|E
5000|$|In The Kingdom of Christ Maurice {{viewed the}} true {{church as a}} united body that transcended the [...] "diversities and <b>partialities</b> of its {{individual}} members, factions, and sects". The true church had six signs: [...] "baptism, creeds, set forms of worship, the eucharist, an ordained ministry, and the Bible." [...] Maurice’s ideas were reflected a half-century later by William Reed Huntington and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. [...] The modern ecumenical movement also incorporated Maurice’s ideas contained in his The Kingdom of Christ.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{far from}} the truth, perhaps, as any other. I {{perceive}} there exist some doubts as {{to the place of}} my nativity," [...] he added, after a pause that denoted a hesitation, which all hoped was to end in his setting the matter at rest, by a simple statement of the fact; [...] "and I believe I shall profit by the circumstance, to praise and condemn at pleasure, since no one can impeach my candour, or impute either to <b>partialities</b> or prejudices." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{period of}} the rebellion, 1715, {{approached}} soon after Rob Roy had attained celebrity. His Jacobite <b>partialities</b> were now placed in opposition to his sense of the obligations which he owed to the indirect protection of the Duke of Argyle. But the desire of [...] "drowning his sounding steps amid the din of general war" [...] induced him to join {{the forces of the}} Earl of Mar, although his patron the Duke of Argyle was {{at the head of the}} army opposed to the Highland insurgents.|$|R
25|$|Nel Noddings' {{ethics of}} care has been criticised by both feminists {{and those who}} favour more traditional, and {{allegedly}} masculine, approaches to ethics. In brief, feminists object that the one caring is, in effect, carrying out the traditional female role in life of giving while receiving little in return. Those who accept more traditional approaches to ethics argue that the <b>partiality</b> shown to those closest to us in Noddings' theory is inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{conduct of}} W. Telfer Campbell, the {{resident}} {{commissioner of the}} Gilberts of 1896 to 1908, was criticised as to his legislative, judicial and administrative management (including allegations of forced labour exacted from islanders) and {{became the subject of}} the 1909 report by Arthur Mahaffy. In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal described the mis-administration of W. Telfer Campbell and questioned the <b>partiality</b> of Arthur Mahaffy as he was a former colonial official in the Gilberts. The anonymous correspondent also criticised the operations of the Pacific Phosphate Company on Ocean Island.|$|E
25|$|But by {{your hard}} and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for {{yourself}} {{on the day of}} wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no <b>partiality.</b>|$|E
50|$|I {{would rather}} choose {{to wear a}} crown of thorns with my Saviour, than to {{exchange}} that of gold, {{which is due to}} me, for one of lead, whose embased flexibleness shall be forced to bend and comply to the various and oft contrary dictates of any factions, when instead of reason and public concernments they obtrude nothing but what makes for the interest of parties, and flows from the <b>partialities</b> of private wills and passions. I know no resolutions more worthy a Christian king, than to prefer his conscience before his kingdoms.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt whether}} your relative, my Lord Castlewood, is as staunch a {{supporter}} of the king over the water," [...] said Colonel Lambert, smiling: [...] "or your aunt, the Baroness of Bernstein, who left you in our charge. Whatever her old <b>partialities</b> may have been, she has repented of them; she has rallied to our side, landed her nephews in the Household, and looks to find a suitable match for her nieces. If you have Tory opinions, Mr. Warrington, take an old soldier's advice, and keep them to yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{final chapter}} of The Evolving Self, titled [...] "Natural Therapy," [...] is a {{meditation}} on the philosophical and ethical fundamentals of the helping professions. Kegan argues, similarly to later theorists of asset-based community development, that professional helpers should base their practice on people's existing strengths and [...] "natural" [...] capabilities. The careful practice of [...] "unnatural" [...] (self-conscious) professional intervention may be important and valuable, says Kegan; nevertheless [...] "rather than being the panacea for modern maladies, it is actually a second-best means of support, and arguably {{a sign that the}} natural facilitation of development has somehow and for some reason broken down." [...] Helping professionals need a way of evaluating the quality of people's evolving cultures of embeddedness so as to provide opportunities for problem-solving and growth, while acknowledging that the evaluator too has his or her own evolving culture of embeddedness. Kegan warns that professional helpers should not delude themselves into thinking that their conceptions of health and development are unbiased by their particular circumstances or <b>partialities.</b> He acknowledges the importance of Thomas Szasz's [...] "suggestion that mental illness is a kind of myth," [...] and he says that we need a way to address what Szasz calls [...] "problems in living" [...] while protecting clients as much as possible from the helping professional's <b>partialities</b> and limitations.|$|R
