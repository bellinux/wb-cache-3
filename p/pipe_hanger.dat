5000|$|A {{pipe clamp}} {{is a type}} of clamp often {{employed}} in woodworking, piping or cabinet shops. When referring to woodwork or cabinet shops, pipe clamps are usually composed of commercially manufactured clamp heads or [...] "jaws" [...] and a length of common threaded pipe. The capacity of the clamp is determined by the length of the pipe used. When referring to piping, pipe clamps are used to connect the pipe to the <b>pipe</b> <b>hanger</b> assembly.|$|E
50|$|A {{pipe support}} or <b>pipe</b> <b>hanger</b> is a {{designed}} element that transfer the load from a pipe to the supporting structures. The load includes {{the weight of}} the pipe proper, the content that the pipe carries, all the pipe fittings attached to pipe, and the pipe covering such as insulation. The four main functions of a pipe support are to anchor, guide, absorb shock, and support a specified load. Pipe supports used in high or low temperature applications may contain insulation materials. The overall design configuration of a pipe support assembly is dependent on the loading and operating conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Pipes {{are usually}} either {{supported}} from below or hung from above (but {{may also be}} supported from the side), using devices called pipe supports. Supports may {{be as simple as}} a pipe [...] "shoe" [...] which is akin to a half of an I-beam welded {{to the bottom of the}} pipe; they may be [...] "hung" [...] using a clevis, or with trapeze type of devices called <b>pipe</b> <b>hangers.</b> <b>Pipe</b> supports of any kind may incorporate springs, snubbers, dampers, or combinations of these devices to compensate for thermal expansion, or to provide vibration isolation, shock control, or reduced vibration excitation of the pipe due to earthquake motion. Some dampers are simply fluid dashpots, but other dampers may be active hydraulic devices that have sophisticated systems that act to dampen peak displacements due to externally imposed vibrations or mechanical shocks. The undesired motions may be process derived (such as in a fluidized bed reactor) or from a natural phenomenon such as an earthquake (design basis event or DBE).|$|R
40|$|This senior {{design project}} is {{sponsored}} by Newport News Shipbuilding. The objective of this project is to design a <b>pipe</b> <b>hanger</b> system that could be installed during initial fabrication while still allowing adjustment when the pipe path deviates from the initial drawings. The design must be cheap and utilize already existing parts. One key constraint is to hold a load of 250 pounds and withstand a velocity between 100 - 120 inches per second. The original design created utilizes a C-channel track attached to the ceiling and a spring locking mechanism to provide flexibility. This final design eliminated the spring device with a nut and rod locking mechanism and a threaded rod between the C-channel track and the marine style <b>pipe</b> <b>hanger.</b> This design was tested against the constraints given by NNS, using the program ANSYs workbench. The design {{was found to be}} able to withstand 100 - 120 inches per second velocity without faltering. The design was found to be able to withstand up to 6014 psi. Once the computer testing was complete, the total cost was calculated. This was estimated originally at a range of $ 50 - $ 60. The end price was calculated at $ 90, this was without the track. For the constraint of a cheap product to be achieved, the design will need to be altered to use either cheaper materials, cheaper tools, or cheaper components. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} remote {{inspection}} of pipework in the processing cells of nuclear plant provides significant challenges of access, navigation, inspection technique and data communication. Such processing cells typically contain several kilometres of densely packed pipework whose actual physical layout may be poorly documented. Access to these pipes is typically afforded through the radiation shield via a small removable concrete plug {{which may be}} several meters from the actual inspection site, thus considerably complicating practical inspection. The current research focuses on the robotic deployment of multiple NDE payloads for weld inspection along non-ferritic steel pipework (thus precluding use of magnetic traction options). A fully wireless robotic inspection platform has been developed {{that is capable of}} travelling along the outside of a pipe at any orientation, while avoiding obstacles such as <b>pipe</b> <b>hangers</b> and delivering a variety of NDE payloads. An eddy current array system provides rapid imaging capabilities for surface breaking defects while an on-board camera, in addition to assisting with navigation tasks, also allows real time image processing to identify potential defects. All sensor data can be processed by the embedded microcontroller or transmitted wirelessly back to the point of access for post-processing analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of water hammer in stagnant hot fluid systems has been manifested by the fracture {{of a number}} of cast iron valves and other components in power station low pressure feed water systems and other similar systems. A comprehensive investigation proved necessary into all aspects of this phenomenon. The investigation involved a survey of water hammer events. experimental work, data acquisition, pressure testing, calculation of forces and the determination of the strength of individual components. From this work has sprung a clear understanding of the sequence of events occurring when pressure is reduced on hot feed water and flash steam is produced which subsequently escapes or condenses and fluid columns recombine at speed nd produce pressure pulses. Experi k ental and theoretical work has revealed the magnitude of such pressure pulses and also revealed that steel pressure parts will not fail when subjected to the forces arising from thermodynamically induced water hammer, because steel pipes limit transient hydraulic pressures by dilating and steel valves are sufficiently strong. The dynamic response of complex pipework system to stimulation by water hammer events requires further investigation, but practical experience indicates that failure of steel system components is unlikely from dynamic movements, although damage may be suffered by <b>pipe</b> <b>hangers,</b> seismic restraints etc. ...|$|R
40|$|The H-Canyon at Savannah River Site {{is a large}} {{concrete}} structure designed for chemical separation processes of radioactive material. The facility requires a large ventilation system to maintain negative pressure in process areas for radioactive contamination control and personnel protection. The ventilation exhaust is directed through a concrete tunnel under the facility which is approximately five feet wide and 8 feet tall {{that leads to a}} sand filter and stack. Acidic vapors in the exhaust have had a degrading effect {{on the surface of the}} concrete tunnels. Some areas have been inspected; however, the condition of other areas is unknown. Experience from historical inspections with remote controlled vehicles will be discussed along with the current challenge of inspecting levels below available access points. The area of interest in the exhaust tunnel must be accessed through a 14 X 14 inch concrete plug in the floor of the hot gang valve corridor. The purpose for the inspection is to determine the condition of the inside of the air tunnel and establish if there are any structural concerns. Various landmarks, <b>pipe</b> <b>hangers</b> and exposed rebar are used as reference points for the structural engineers when evaluating the current integrity of the air tunnel...|$|R
40|$|The Reactor Recirculation System {{has been}} {{designed}} to perform the following functions: a. To provide forced circulation of reactor water through the core to overcome the power density limitation of the fuel. b. To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, <b>pipe</b> support <b>hangers,</b> piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant. To control reactor power level, the system makes use of the boiling water reactor large negative power coefficient. A power level increase is achieved b...|$|R
