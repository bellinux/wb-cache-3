30|$|For mobile robot, the {{integration}} design concept {{is a good}} choice. Since the embedding of pneumatic elements, the implementation of 5 -TET calls for the <b>pneumatic</b> power <b>supply,</b> which is a dominant bottleneck in practical of pneumatic mobile applications. Many researchers have been studied on this problem, and new advances in portable pneumatic power source are presented [27 – 29]. For example, a portable <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> called Dry Ice Power Cell, which could provide sustaining 0.42 MPa gas for about 218 NL with portable size [29]. The achievements from these researches can be used directly to equip 5 -TET to realize mobile function, so do other elements.|$|R
40|$|Shutoff valve and {{actuation}} system concepts {{that are most}} suitable for the Orbital Maneuvering Systems engine application were determined. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} ten year and 100 mission life requirement, propellant and propellant residue compatibility and weight. It was found that poppet or ball valves utilizing electric or electropneumatic actuation were most applicable. Preliminary design layouts of a number of valve and actuation concepts were prepared and analyzed to make the optimum concept selection. Pneumatic {{actuation system}}s were required to feature their own <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> so that for the quad redundant valve, it was necessary to include two <b>pneumatic</b> <b>supply</b> systems, one for each of the series legs of the quad redundant package. The requirement for the pneumatic package placed heavy reliability, weight, and maintenance penalties upon electropneumatic actuation systems. The two valve and actuation systems concepts selected featured electric torque motor operation and a poppet as well as a ball valve concept with a retractable seal...|$|R

40|$|Transactions of AIJ. Journal of {{environmental}} engineeringIn {{order to the}} evaluate heat loss from hot water <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> in a residential building, hot water demand {{in a house in}} Chiba prefecture was measured and analyzed. The following results were obtained. 1. The heat loss of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> was about 132 kJ for the shower and 110 kJ for the bathtub in winter. Since the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> is small, the measured heat loss from the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> sometimes becomes negative. 2. In order to estimate the heat loss under various conditions, a thermal model was proposed. 3. The calculated daily heat loss of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> was 122 kJ for the shower and 689 kJ for the bathtub in winter. The average daily heat loss from the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> during use and after use was 1774. 7 KJ in winter. This heat loss amounts to 4. 7 % of the total daily energy use for hot water supply. 4. For reducing the heat loss, thermal insulation of the hot water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> and the use of thinner pipes are effective...|$|R

50|$|If, for example, someone flushes {{a toilet}} while the shower is in use, the fixture {{suddenly}} draws {{a significant amount}} of cold water from the common <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> causing a pressure drop.

Conversely, if someone opens a hot water faucet elsewhere, the relatively higher pressure in the cold water <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> will cause the shower temperature to drop suddenly.|$|R

These nuts can fail in service, causing water leaks that result in significant property and financial losses. This study examines three possible failure modes of acetal plastic toilet water supply nuts. The three failure modes tested were all due to over load failure of the acetal nut and are as follows: (1) Overtightening of the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> acetal nut, (2) <b>Supply</b> <b>line</b> lateral pull and, (3) Embrittled <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> lateral pull.

50|$|The pressure-balanced {{shower valve}} {{compensates}} {{for changes in}} water pressure. It has a diaphragm or piston inside that reacts to relative changes in either hot or cold water pressure to maintain balanced pressure. As water pressure drops on one <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> the valve reduces the pressure in the other <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to match. A side effect {{of this is that}} the pressure and flow at the shower head or tub spigot will drop twice as much as if only one <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> had been affected, but without a large temperature change.
