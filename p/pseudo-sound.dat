40|$|Compressible mixing layers are {{analyzed}} using a dilatational covariances model {{based on a}} <b>pseudo-sound</b> constitutive relation. The calculations are {{used to evaluate the}} different physical phenomena affecting compressible mixing layers. The rate of growth of the mixing layer is retarded by both the compressible dissipation and the pressure-dilatational covariances. The pressure-dilatational, essentially a nonequilibrium effect, reduces the amount of excess production over dissipation available for the turbulence energy growth. The <b>pseudo-sound</b> model also includes a history dependent portion: this is also investigated. All constants in the model and used in these computations are predicted by the theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of approximations {{employed in the}} Lighthill theory in current aerodynamic noise research is critically evaluated. Based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions, the full Navier-Stokes equations are expanded for small Mach numbers. To the first order, the near-field is generally nonisentropic. The pressure field (<b>pseudo-sound)</b> is generated by the incompressible Reynolds stresses in the turbulent flow and the velocity, pressure perturbation, and their derivatives on the boundaries. In the far-field, the first-order pressure (acoustic) field satisfying a linear wave equation is obtained by matching with the <b>pseudo-sound</b> field. A uniformly valid solution for the pressure field in a stationary or uniformly moving medium is obtained. The solution shows that the generation of the first-order aerodynamic noise {{does not depend on}} the viscous, thermal, or entropy effects in the adiabatic flow nor on the shear stress on a smooth rigid boundary...|$|E
40|$|The {{aircraft}} noise {{is one of}} the main problems that affect the diffusion of the air transport near the downtown. For this reason in the past 50 years even more studies were performed for the comprehension and reduction of the noise generation phenomena. The jet noise has well-known characteristics; many acoustic models exist and well predict the jet far-field noise but actually not all the noise causes are known. Some theories assign the noise production to the large scale structures, other to the fine scales, to the pressure fluctuations or to the turbulent interactions; the main topic of the aeroacoustics research is the identification of the main phenomena that produce noise. An experimental study of the pressure field generated by a subsonic, single stream, round jet is presented. This work is focalized on the near-field characterization; in fact the near-field is not well described as the far-field but studying the near-field is important to obtain information on the noise sources. Near-field measurements are affected by some pressure fluctuations that, measuring with a microphone, seems sound; these fluctuations are usually defined as <b>pseudo-sound.</b> The <b>pseudo-sound</b> was defined in the past as undistinguishable by the sound and it hides the similarities between near-field and far-field jet noise characteristics. The main aim of this work is the understanding of the near-field noise properties separating the sound from the <b>pseudo-sound</b> contribution for a compressible round jet. The filtering algorithm proposed is based on wavelets and it is a novel approach in aero-acoustics studies. The wavelet filtering capture the intermittent events of a signal, these events are, in the pressure fluctuations, related to the coherent structures convected by the fluid. This approach gives also the capability of splitting the pressure signal in two components and to correlate them with velocity information to locate phenomena that contribute to the sound generation. In this work a nozzle is designed to generate a standard compressible jet with the capability to work between Mach 0. 3 and Mach 1. The nozzle is installed in a semi-anechoic chamber and experimental studies were performed for qualifying the flow characteristics and the far-field noise. Near-field pressure fluctuations are studied using two synchronized microphones and the signals are filtered using the wavelet approach. The sound and <b>pseudo-sound</b> are studied to compare the near-field and the far-field jet characteristics. Hot-wire measurements are performed in synch with sound measurements to locate the jet zones where the maximum noise production is located. Acoustic hot-wire perturbations are evaluated as negligible and the velocity-noise correlations give interesting results. The analysis shows that there are common characteristics between near and far-field noise. The sound in the near-field has clear directivity that depends on the wave-lengths magnitude. The shape of the sound spectra has also strong directional dependence and has similarities with the far-field; <b>pseudo-sound</b> instead has no directional dependence of the spectra that only depend on the distance from the jet. Both sound and <b>pseudo-sound</b> source zones are identified and match with previous works...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between pressure fluctuations and density gradients in the near-field of a jet at M= 0. 9 is studied in this paper. For this purpose, an experiment was performed where the density gradients were acquired with the Background Oriented Schlieren technique. This optical technique measures the virtual displacements of a background pattern when {{seen through the}} compressible flow. Simultaneously, the pressure fluctuations were measured with two microphones at 2 D away from the shear layer. This signal was decomposed in sound and <b>pseudo-sound</b> using a wavelet based separation technique. The objective is to study the degree of cor{{relation between}} these three quantities: density gradient, sound and <b>pseudo-sound.</b> Moreover, a cross-conditional analysis is done in order to relate intermittency events in the pressure signal with variations in the density gradient field. The results of the cross-correlation indicate that only the hydrodynamic component is correlated with the density gradients. Furthermore, the correlation {{is located at the}} end of the potential core. In addition, the results of the cross-condtional analysis show that fluctuations of the density gradient related with intermittent events in the pressure signal are mainly {{at the end of the}} potential core...|$|E
40|$|Time-periodic CFD {{simulations}} {{are widely}} used to investigate turbomachinery components. The triple-plane pressure mode matching method (TPP) developed by Ovenden and Rienstra extracts the acoustic part in such simulations. Experience shows that this method is subject to significant errors when the amplitude of <b>pseudo-sound</b> is high compared to sound. <b>Pseudo-sound</b> are unsteady pressure fluctuations with a convective character. The presented extension to the TPP improves the splitting between acoustics {{and the rest of}} the unsteady flow field. The method is simple: i) the acoustic eigenmodes are analytically determined for a uniform mean flow as in the original TPP; ii) the suggested model for convective pressure perturbations uses the convective wavenumber as axial wavenumber and the same orthogonal radial shape functions as for the acoustic modes. The reliability is demonstrated on the simulation data of a low-pressure fan. As acoustic and convective perturbations are separated, the accuracy of the results increases close to sources, allowing a reduction of the computational costs by shortening the simulation domain. The extended method is as robust as the original one [...] giving the same results for the acoustic modes in absence of convective perturbations.

Experimental hydroacoustics regards simultaneous velocity-pressure/visualization-pressure measurements and cross-correlation and conditional techniques. Furthermore, special signal processing techniques are used for the sake of removing unwanted noise contributions and separating the sound and <b>pseudo-sound</b> contributions.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the onset of collective motion in systems of model microswimmers, by performing a comprehensive analysis of the binary collision dynamics using three dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) with fully resolved hydrodynamics. From this data, we have constructed a simplified binary collision model (BCM) which accurately reproduces the collective behavior obtained from the DNS for most cases. Thus, we show that global alignment can mostly arise solely from binary collisions. Although the agreement between both models (DNS and BCM) is not perfect, the parameter range in which notable differences appear is also that for which strong density fluctuations {{are present in the}} system (where <b>pseudo-sound</b> mound can be observed[1]).

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of entropy and direct combustion noise in turbopropulsion systems and the parameters upon which these noise sources depend were studied. Theory and experiment were employed to determine that at least with the apparatus used here, entropy noise can dominate combustion noise {{if there is a}} sufficient pressure gradient terminating the combustor. Measurements included combustor interior fluctuating pressure, near and far field fluctuating pressure, and combustor exit plane fluctuating temperatures, as well as mean pressures and temperatures. Analysis techniques included spectral, cross-correlation, cross power spectra, and ordinary and partial coherence analysis. Also conducted were combustor liner modification experiments to investigate the origin of the frequency content of combustion noise. Techniques were developed to extract nonpropagational <b>pseudo-sound</b> and the heat release fluctuation spectra from the data...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedModern sonars are large in size. This {{is a result}} of several factors connected with operation at low frequencies. Non-linear interaction of two high-frequency sound beams in water may provide a source of low-frequency sound without the use of large transducers. The theory of interaction of two plane waves is reviewed, and conversion efficiency is studied. Early experimental work is also reviewed. To provide new experimental data, primary sources of 385 kHz and 435 kHz are mounted side-by-side in an anechoic tank. The sound field between the parallel beams is explored. A difference-frequency signal is detected, but its amplitude is found to be greater than the theoretical value. Non-linearities in the receiving hydrophone are suspected as contributing to the 50 -kHz signal level. Various techniques for eliminating <b>pseudo-sound</b> are discussed, and recommendations for further study are presented. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

The blower was subjected to different inflow conditions in order to better comprehend the importance of installation effects, and assess the capabilities of the proposed numerical tools to quantify those effects. The prediction tools include scale-resolved, statistical, stochastic and semi-analytical approaches. The predicted acoustic fields were validated by comparison with experimental data obtained on a dedicated test rig, permitting the necessary decontamination of the microphone signals from the reflections at the duct terminations, and turbulent boudary layer related <b>pseudo-sound.</b> A quite good agreement was found between the predicted and measured acoustic data. The tools showed also a good potential for estimating installation effects.

40|$|AbstractThe fouling is {{identifiable}} by {{the presence}} of dust on rotor and stator blades, and its main origin, in industrial turbomachinery, is the presence of a film of moist or lubricant driven to the trailing edge by the near-wall flow, or centrifuged toward the casing by impeller rotation. Solid particles pile up on them, leading to eccentricity and load unbalance. The formation of build-up results in performance reduction, and the chance of a deposit detachment while the impeller spun, may cause damages due to the impact on the machine parts. In industrial fans, the presence of fouling influences the characteristic curve and could anticipate stall when the flow rate is throttled. Rotating stall is an aerodynamic instability with a typical frequency about half the rotor frequency, acoustically identifiable from the changes in the emitted rotor noise, due to displacement from the stability. This work investigates rotating stall dynamics on an axial fan with fouled blades. The stall is identified with time-resolved <b>pseudo-sound</b> measurements in the end-wall region using DIY sensors. The signals have been analysed in frequency domain, and time domain using a phase space reconstruction technique. It is demonstrated a modification of the dynamic to stall and are identified diverse stall precursors...|$|E
40|$|The main {{scope of}} the present work is to {{investigate}} the mechanisms underlying the hydroacoustic and hydrodynamic perturbations in a rudder operating {{in the wake of}} a free running marine propeller. The study consisted of detailed near-field pressure fluctuation measurements which were acquired on the face and back surfaces of the rudder, at different deflection angles. To this aim, a novel wavelet-filtering procedure was applied to separate and analyze distinctly the acoustic and hydrodynamic components of the recorded near-field pressure signals. The filtering procedure undertakes the separation of intermittent pressure peaks induced by the passage of eddy structures, interpreted as <b>pseudo-sound,</b> from homogenous background fluctuations, interpreted as sound. The use of wavelet in the filtering procedure allows to overcome the limitations of the earlier attempts based on frequency (wave number) band-pass filtering, retrieving the overall frequency content of both the acoustic and the hydrodynamic components and returning them as independent signals in the time domain. Acoustic and hydrodynamic pressure distributions were decomposed harmonically and compared to the corresponding topologies of the vorticity field, derived from earlier LDV measurements performed by Felli and Falchi (Exp Fluids 51 (5) : 1385 - 1402, 2011). The study highlighted that the acoustic perturbation is mainly correlated with the unsteady load variations of the rudder and to the shear layer fluctuations of the propeller streamtube. Conversely, the dynamics of the propeller tip and hub vortices underlies the hydrodynamic perturbation...|$|E
40|$|Hydrokinetic {{turbines}} will be {{a source}} of noise in the marine environment - both during operation and during installation/removal. High intensity sound can cause injury or behavioral changes in marine mammals and may also affect fish and invertebrates. These noise effects are, however, highly dependent on the individual marine animals; the intensity, frequency, and duration of the sound; and context in which the sound is received. In other words, production of sound is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for an environmental impact. At a workshop on the environmental effects of tidal energy development, experts identified sound produced by turbines as an area of potentially significant impact, but also high uncertainty. The overall objectives of this project are to improve our understanding of the potential acoustic effects of tidal turbines by: (1) Characterizing sources of existing underwater noise; (2) Assessing the effectiveness of monitoring technologies to characterize underwater noise and marine mammal responsiveness to noise; (3) Evaluating the sound profile of an operating tidal turbine; and (4) Studying the effect of turbine sound on surrogate species in a laboratory environment. This study focuses on a specific case study for tidal energy development in Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, Washington (USA), but the methodologies and results are applicable to other turbine technologies and geographic locations. The project succeeded in achieving the above objectives and, in doing so, substantially contributed to the body of knowledge around the acoustic effects of tidal energy development in several ways: (1) Through collection of data from Admiralty Inlet, established the sources of sound generated by strong currents (mobilizations of sediment and gravel) and determined that low-frequency sound recorded during periods of strong currents is non-propagating <b>pseudo-sound.</b> This helped to advance the debate within the marine and hydrokinetics acoustic community as to whether strong currents produce propagating sound. (2) Analyzed data collected from a tidal turbine operating at the European Marine Energy Center to develop a profile of turbine sound and developed a framework to evaluate the acoustic effects of deploying similar devices in other locations. This framework has been applied to Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish Country's demonstration project in Admiralty Inlet to inform postinstallation acoustic and marine mammal monitoring plans. (3) Demonstrated passive acoustic techniques to characterize the ambient noise environment at tidal energy sites (fixed, long-term observations recommended) and characterize the sound from anthropogenic sources (drifting, short-term observations recommended). (4) Demonstrated the utility and limitations of instrumentation, including bottom mounted instrumentation packages, infrared cameras, and vessel monitoring systems. In doing so, also demonstrated how this type of comprehensive information is needed to interpret observations from each instrument (e. g., hydrophone data can be combined with vessel tracking data to evaluate the contribution of vessel sound to ambient noise). (5) Conducted a study that suggests harbor porpoise in Admiralty Inlet may be habituated to high levels of ambient noise due to omnipresent vessel traffic. The inability to detect behavioral changes associated with a high intensity source of opportunity (passenger ferry) has informed the approach for post-installation marine mammal monitoring. (6) Conducted laboratory exposure experiments of juvenile Chinook salmon and showed that exposure to a worse than worst case acoustic dose of turbine sound does not result in changes to hearing thresholds or biologically significant tissue damage. Collectively, this means that Chinook salmon may be at a relatively low risk of injury from sound produced by tidal turbines located in or near their migration path. In achieving these accomplishments, the project has significantly advanced the District's goals of developing a demonstration-scale tidal energy project in Admiralty Inlet. Pilot demonstrations of this type are an essential step in the development of commercial-scale tidal energy in the United States. This is a renewable resource capable of producing electricity in a highly predictable manner...|$|E
