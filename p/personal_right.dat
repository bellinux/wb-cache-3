5|$|Public or {{representative}} standing {{is standing}} possessed by an applicant who brings a case {{on behalf of}} a larger group of people, or even {{in the interest of the}} general public. The applicant need not show that a <b>personal</b> <b>right</b> or interest has been infringed. As long as the represented individuals have, or the public has, sufficient interest in the matter, the applicant will be held to have adequate standing to pursue the case.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for {{judicial review is a}} declaration, which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a <b>personal</b> <b>right</b> possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a <b>personal</b> <b>right</b> possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E

40|$|Protection of <b>personal</b> <b>rights</b> {{in civil}} law - Abstract The topic of this {{rigorous}} {{work is the}} protection of personality, a concept that is {{getting more and more}} attention in today's modern age. The right to protection of <b>personal</b> <b>rights</b> is guaranteed to everyone, both at the constitutional level by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms {{as well as at the}} statutory level, where individual <b>personal</b> <b>rights</b> are specified and refined by means of laws, especially by the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll. Civil Code (hereinafter "Civil Code"). The aim of this rigorous work is to describe and analyze both the rights of protection in general, in its complexity, as well as individual partial <b>personal</b> <b>rights</b> and the possibilities of their application and protection. It's based in particular on the Civil Code in its current version, but it is also provided with excursions to public law regulations. The whole work and its conception is based on the rich jurisprudence of the courts to show the application of the above mentioned protection. The first chapter defines the basic terms associated with the topic of protection of <b>personal</b> <b>rights.</b> The second chapter deals with the historical development of protection of <b>personal</b> <b>rights,</b> starting with the foundations of the Roman law, through its development during the period of [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Tan Eng Hong {{appeared}} {{to stand for}} the proposition that only {{the first and second}} limbs of the Karaha Bodas test are required, notwithstanding the lack of a violation of a <b>personal</b> <b>right.</b> However, in Vellama the Court of Appeal qualified the proposition and cautioned that Tan Eng Hong must be viewed in its proper context. The applicant in Tan Eng Hong was originally charged under section 377A of the Penal Code, but the charge was dropped and substituted with one for a lesser offence, which he pleaded guilty to. Although this arguably rendered his challenge to the constitutionality of section 377A theoretical, the application was still of [...] "great practical significance" [...] to him. Given the applicant's sexual orientation, so long as the constitutionality of section 377A was not decisively settled, a similar act committed by him could possibly attract prosecution. Therefore, the applicant's personal rights were affected. Thus, there was no contradiction between the adoption of the English position and the third requirement of the Karaha Bodas test in Tan Eng Hong.|$|E
2500|$|Trump {{may have}} {{strategically}} directed {{money from the}} Trump Foundation to support his presidential campaign. In one case, the grants were used specifically to pay for newspaper ads. In October 2016 RealClearPolitics reported that Trump directed significant amounts of foundation money to conservative organizations, possibly in return for political support and access. [...] The news organization found that, from 2011 through 2014, Trump had [...] "harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups.... In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president." [...] At {{least two of the}} groups are based in Republican-leaning early presidential primary states. In addition to Citizens United (above), groups include Iowa's The Family Leader, the South Carolina Palmetto Family Council, the American Conservative Union, and the American Spectator Foundation. Trump's granting of foundation money to these groups could have violated the law, if it was in return for his <b>personal</b> <b>right</b> to speak or gain access to networking events.|$|E
2500|$|A {{constructive}} trust is a trust which is {{imposed by the}} courts whenever the defendant knows that he has dealt with property in an [...] "unconscionable manner", such as stealing it, possessing it via fraud, and accepting a bribe while in occupation of a fiduciary office. The {{constructive trust}} is intended to take the property from the defendant's control, preventing them from causing additional harm with it. It thus acts regardless of the parties' intentions. In Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar & Co, Millet LJ defined a constructive trust as a trust which [...] "arises by operation of law whenever the circumstances are such {{that it would be}} unconscionable for the owner of property (usually but not necessarily the legal estate) to assert his own beneficial interest in the property and deny the beneficial interest of another". Essentially, a constructive trust will arise whenever an owner either ignores, or interferes, with the rights of another person with an interest in that property. There is a distinction between personal and proprietary rights to property. A constructive trust normally gives a proprietary right to the beneficiary that can be enforced on any other person. The alternative (a <b>personal</b> <b>right)</b> merely gives the beneficiary the right to recover money equivalent to the value of the property.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{context in}} which the common law left workers {{particularly}} vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another. In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a <b>personal</b> <b>right,</b> and akin to a property right in their jobs. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted, the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the [...] "Acquired Rights Directive"), required that a business transferee would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers' contracts. This means that the new employer who is a transferee of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company's shares: contractual variations require the employees' consent and dismissal rights remain {{as if it were the}} old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in Litster v Forth Dry Dock. The House of Lords held that a purposive interpretation is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would still be there in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law's normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance. The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the transferee employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clause or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.|$|E
2500|$|The locale of St Johns Wood {{comprises}} portions 165, 166, 381 and 382 in the Parish of Enoggera, Brisbane. The land on {{the western}} perimeter of St Johns Wood identified as Portion 382 being an area of , 1 rod and 16 perches was originally purchased 10 August 1864 by Joseph Berry. This land remained intact until subdivision in the 1980s. The land had been bought by Blue Metal & Gravel (BMG Resources Ltd.) who also owned the quarry on the opposite southern side of Waterworks Road, (where [...] stands today) {{with the intention of}} quarrying the site. In the 1970s there was enormous opposition to the quarry on the southern {{side of the road and}} BMG made the decision not to quarry the St Johns Wood site. Several attempts were made to subdivide the land including one in which it was to be subdivided into 60 townhouse sites. When these attempts proved fruitless the land was put up for sale and was purchased in 1984 by local real estate agent Syd Appleby and his wife Merryl and Allan and Maree Rainbow. They initially subdivided the land into 23 lots with the Applebys and the Rainbows retaining the largest two lots of 2.5 acres each in the north-western corner. The first purchasers of the subdivided land were airline pilot, Richard Kleeman and his wife Sue and Professor Peter Coaldrake and his wife Dr. Lee Coaldrake. Soon after their houses were built and they moved in, the Coaldrakes and the Applebys traded houses, with the Coaldrakes then owning the larger block in the north west corner next to the Rainbows. In 1991, the Coaldrakes and Rainbows decided to subdivide their two lots into six lots. Their properties had access with two other lots under a reciprocal easement arrangement. One of the owners demanded one hundred and thirty thousand dollars on payment to allow the subdivision to proceed without challenge. When this demand was rejected the owner took the matter to the Supreme Court where she lost the case. She continued to demand the money and appealed the court decision. This decision was upheld and the case proceeded to the High Court where it was again upheld. This case became and remains a landmark case on easements in Australian and British law. The issue was: When a dominant block is subdivided does each of the subdivided parts gain the benefit of the easement? The High Court held that it did only if it was of benefit to the subdivided parts. They emphasised the point that an easement is not a <b>personal</b> <b>right,</b> it belongs to land, it attaches to dominant land for the benefit of that land. If it benefits each of the subdivided parts, it is attached to them and does belong to them.|$|E
2500|$|While {{derivative}} claims mean suing in the company's name, {{a minority}} shareholder can sue {{in her own}} name in four ways. The first is to claim a [...] "personal right" [...] under the constitution or the general law is breached. If a shareholder brings a personal action to vindicate a <b>personal</b> <b>right</b> (such {{as the right to}} not be misled by company circulars) the principle against double recovery dictates that one cannot sue for damages if the loss an individual shareholder suffers is merely the same as will be reflected in the reduction of the share value. For losses reflective of the company's, only a derivative claim may be brought. The second is to show that a company's articles were amended in an objectively unjustifiably and directly discriminatory fashion. This residual protection for minorities was developed by the Court of Appeal in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd, where Sir Nathaniel Lindley MR held that shareholders may amend a constitution by the required majority so long as it is [...] "bona fide {{for the benefit of the}} company as a whole." [...] This constraint is not heavy, as it can mean that a constitutional amendment, while applying in a formally equal way to all shareholders, has a negative and disparate impact on only one shareholder. This was so in Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd, where the articles were changed to remove all shareholders' pre-emption rights, but only one shareholder (the claimant, Mr Greenhalgh, who lost) was interested in preventing share sales to outside parties. This slim set of protections for minority shareholders was, until 1985, complemented only by a third, and drastic right of a shareholder, now under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(g), to show it is [...] "just and equitable" [...] for a company to be liquidated. In Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd, Lord Wilberforce held that a court would use its discretion to wind up a company if three criteria were fulfilled: that the company was a small [...] "quasi-partnership" [...] founded on mutual confidence of the corporators, that shareholders participate in the business, and there are restrictions in the constitution on free transfer of shares. Given these features, it may be just and equitable to wind up a company if the court sees an agreement just short of a contract, or some other [...] "equitable consideration", that one party has not fulfilled. So where Mr Ebrahmi, a minority shareholder, had been removed from the board, and the other two directors paid all company profits out as director salaries, rather than dividends to exclude him, the House of Lords regarded it as equitable to liquidate the company and distribute his share of the sale proceeds to Mr Ebrahimi.|$|E
