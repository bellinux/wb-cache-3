25|$|The {{regional}} council, {{responsible for}} managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental {{problems such as}} pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as African feathergrass, goats rue and nodding thistle {{pose a threat to}} pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. Possums are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Eradication programmes also concentrate on rabbits, rooks and feral goats, while other exotic species such as <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus parma), wasps, ferrets, stoats and weasels are a source of concern.|$|E

50|$|The renewed {{interest}} in the <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> soon led to another milestone: in 1967 {{it was found that}} they still existed in the forests near Gosford, New South Wales. Further investigation demonstrated that the <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> was alive and well, and although not common, was to be found in forests along the Great Dividing Range from near Gosford almost as far north as the Queensland border.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} animals are present {{including}} African pygmy goats, black-breasted leaf turtles, giant African millipedes, gopher snakes, green-crested basilisks, guinea pigs, sheep, Nigerian dwarf goats, northern pygmy owls, ocellated rays, <b>Parma</b> <b>wallabies,</b> poison dart frogs, rabbits, rats, and tiger rat snakes.

50|$|The Australian House {{is one of}} the {{few places}} in Europe where koalas and Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos can be seen. There is also an aquarium, home to 1,500 species of fish from Australia's Great Barrier Reef. There are also timid rat-kangaroos, kookaburras and a variety of snakes. In nearby outdoor enclosures, there are <b>Parma</b> <b>wallabies</b> and red kangaroos, both in large enclosures.|$|R
50|$|Australian {{animals at}} the zoo include dingos, koalas, red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos, swamp wallaby, <b>parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> emu, Tasmanian devils, little {{penguins}} and wombats.|$|E

50|$|Woodland Walk {{houses a}} number of larger animal species from South America including: Brazilian tapir, capybara, Visayan warty pigs, Patagonian maras and giant anteaters. Other {{enclosures}} in the walk-through include: Canadian timber wolves, white-naped cranes and <b>parma</b> <b>wallabies.</b> The entrance to the woodland walk is via a bridge over the lake, which has {{a wide variety of}} ducks and Chilean flamingos.|$|R
40|$|Blood was {{collected}} from 31 <b>Parma</b> <b>wallabies</b> from five different captive populations. The morphology of erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets {{was similar to}} that previously described for macropodids. The effects of location (population), anaesthesia and analyser on the haematological characteristics of the wallabies were considered. Location had an affect on many of the values, anaesthesia affected some of the leucocyte values, and analyser had little effect...|$|R
50|$|In 1965 {{workers on}} Kawau Island (near Auckland, New Zealand) {{attempting}} {{to control a}} plague of introduced tammar wallabies (a widespread and fairly common species in Australia) were astonished to discover {{that some of the}} pests were not tammar wallabies at all, but a miraculously surviving population of <b>Parma</b> <b>wallabies</b> - a species long thought extinct. The extermination effort was put on hold while individuals were captured and sent to institutions in Australia and around the world in the hope that they would breed in captivity and could eventually be reintroduced to their native habitat.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> remains rare, {{there seems}} to be no {{immediate}} threat to it provided that more habitat destruction does not take place, and the population is thought to be slowly increasing.|$|E

50|$|The Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House is a 32,000 ft2 m2 indoor exhibit {{that opened}} in 1997 and houses small animals in two main areas: the Gallery and the Ecosystem. The Gallery begins with a large room ringed with terrariums exhibiting {{reptiles}} and amphibians like axolotls, green tree pythons, poison dart frogs, and Sistrurus catenatus. The next part of the Gallery features dwarf mongooses, naked mole rats, straw-coloured fruit bats and other small mammals in and around a man-made baobab tree trunk. The building continues in the Ecosystem, a geodesic dome 45 ft in height that simulates the world's tropical rainforests. The Ecosystem begins {{with a series of}} stream exhibits for dwarf caimans, dwarf crocodiles, and oriental small-clawed otters, continues with mixed-species exhibits for arboreal species like tamarins, two-toed sloths, and white-faced saki monkeys, and ends with exhibits for ground-dwelling <b>Parma</b> <b>wallabies</b> and Patagonian cavies.|$|R
50|$|Australian outback: {{this exhibit}} {{is in the}} design stage and it {{consists}} in an innmertion exhibit with <b>parma</b> and bennets <b>wallaby,</b> emus, kookaburras, cockatoos and black swan. It will have a gift shop at the end.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus parma) {{was first}} {{described}} by British naturalist John Gould in about 1840. A shy, cryptic {{creature of the}} wet sclerophyll forests of northern New South Wales (Australia), it was never commonly encountered and, even {{before the end of}} the 19th century, it was believed to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{at the zoo}} include giant otter, zebra, <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> Bennets wallaby, giant anteater, cottontop tamarin, {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemur, hamadryas baboon, lion, Bengal tiger {{including a}} white specimen, howler monkey, white tailed deer, pacarana, mountain tapir, South American tapir, capybara, llama, two toed sloth, brown bear, spectacled bear, black bear, and jaguar.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} {{participates in}} four Species Survival Plans (SSP) as of 2009: golden lion tamarin, Matschie's tree kangaroo, Oriental small-clawed otter, ring-tailed lemur. In addition, {{it is in}} the population management program for a number of other species: Galapagos tortoise, Haitian slider, harbor seal, <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> Prevost's squirrel, red-necked wallaby, roseate spoonbill, scarlet ibis.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Realm {{is viewed}} from a boardwalk. Although it {{originally}} displayed Australian animals, {{it is currently}} {{in a state of}} redevelopment. This exhibit opened with red kangaroo, dama wallaby, <b>parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> emu, black swan, cereopsis, radjah shelduck, and magpie goose. The small seasonal exhibit, which formerly housed warthogs and aardwolf, currently houses red river hog.|$|E
50|$|Thickly forested {{highland}} areas {{cover part}} of the mountains, and there are isolated populations of Waratah. The rufous scrub-bird lives in the Gibraltar Range, although its population was slightly reduced due to a fire in 2002. The mountain range {{is also home to}} the <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby.</b> During the 1850s, European fruit trees flourished {{at the base of the}} range.|$|E
50|$|A {{considerable}} {{variety of}} birds and animals {{are found in the}} area. Wedge-tailed eagles, eastern grey kangaroos and tiger snakes are common. Some of the more rare inhabitants include: the rufous scrub-bird, paradise riflebird, wompoo fruit dove, <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> rough-scaled snake, stuttering frog, Booroolong frog and the Davies' tree frog.

50|$|Like the pademelons, it {{prefers to}} occupy wet sclerophyll forest with thick undergrowth, and grassy patches, {{although}} Parma wallabies {{are also found}} occasionally in dry eucalypt forest and even rainforest. It is mainly nocturnal and usually shelters in thick scrub during the day, through which it can travel at speed along the runways it makes. It emerges from cover shortly before dusk to feed on grasses and herbs in forest clearings. The <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> is largely solitary, with two or at most three animals sometimes coming together to feed in favourable circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|Rare fauna inhabiting Mount Banda Banda {{include the}} Hastings River mouse, <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> {{sphagnum}} frog, Booroolong frog, giant barred frog, stuttering barred frog, the tree dwelling snail, the olive whistler, and the rufous scrub-bird, which {{was described by}} the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of [...] "universally outstanding significance to science and conservation". [...] The reptile and invertebrate fauna of the mountain are not yet comprehensively understood. However, as this Gondwana rainforest is in good condition, future surveys should provide a valuable picture of the local ecology.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> is the {{smallest}} member of the genus Macropus, at between 3.2 and 5.8 kg, less than one tenth {{the size of the}} largest surviving member, the red kangaroo. It is about 0.5 m in length, with a sparsely furred, blackish tail about the same length again. The fur is a reddish or greyish brown above, greyer about the head, and fading to pale grey underneath. Presumably, individuals had been sighted many times during the years when it was [...] "extinct", but mistaken for an especially slender and long-tailed example of the otherwise similar red-legged or red-necked pademelon.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{acclimatisation}} {{movement of}} the late 1800s, governor Grey introduced this and four other species of wallabies (including the rare <b>parma</b> <b>wallaby)</b> to islands in Hauraki Gulf, near Auckland, New Zealand, where they became well-established. In modern times, these populations {{have come to be}} viewed as exotic pests, with severe impacts on the indigenous flora and fauna. As a result, eradication is being undertaken, after initial protection for review of their Australian populations and the return of some wallabies to Australia. Between 1967 and 1975, 210 rock-wallabies were captured on Kawau Island and returned to Australia, along with thousands of other wallabies. Rock-wallabies were removed from Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands during the 1990s, and eradication is now underway on Kawau. Another thirty-three rock-wallabies were captured on Kawau during the 2000s, and returned to Australia, before eradication began.|$|E
50|$|Spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) is an {{endangered}} species listed on the EPBC Act, it is a medium-sized marsupial carnivore, {{the largest of the}} Dasyurus species and is distinguished by the white spots on the tail. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is listed as vulnerable on the EPBC Act. The <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> (Macropus parma) is listed as vulnerable in NSW under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (TSC Act), is a small nocturnal, cryptic wallaby that was once thought to be extinct. Other species that are listed as vulnerable on the TSC Act are the yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) often found in old-growth wet sclerophyll forests. The Rufous Bettong (Aepyprymnus rufescens) is roughly 3 kg marsupial that has significantly declined in range since European settlement. Long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and red-legged pademelon (Thylogale stigmatica) are also listed.|$|E
50|$|Australia lies in {{the northernmost}} part of the zoo; there {{you can find a}} large field that is home to free-roaming red kangaroos. It {{features}} a walk-through Woodland Aviary, which includes black swans, tawny frogmouth, straw-necked ibis, pied imperial pigeon, silver gull, smew, magpie goose, cockatiel, eclectus parrot, plumed whistling duck, long-billed corella, chestnut teal, wompoo fruit dove, Australian shelduck, white cockatoo, and sulphur-crested cockatoo. Beside the exit to the aviary is an emu exhibit. A pair of New Guinea singing dogs live beyond that, in an enclosure formerly home to dingoes. Also featured are <b>parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> Bennett's wallaby, and Matschie's tree kangaroo. A replica of an Australian sheep farm features a farmer's home, a building with various animal hides and preserves, spotted python, green tree python, a pair of laughing kookaburras, and a hands-on sheep pen. An exhibit with dromedary camels is just past the sheep farm as visitor's are finishing the loop around Australia. Overlooking the kangaroo field is a train station and snack bar.|$|E
50|$|A further {{addition}} {{which opened}} in 2011 was the education centre which was created as a renovation of the old soft bill aviary. The pheasants and kookaburras which lived in the soft bill aviary were {{moved to a new}} pheasantry along the front of the tropical house, while a group of Old English Game fowl from the building now join the other free roaming animals (including peafowl, helmeted guineafowl, silver pheasant, chicken and <b>Parma</b> <b>wallaby).</b> This new centre houses a hands on animal encounter hall in which both schools and general visitors are given the chance to hold bearded dragons, corn snake and a Chilean rose tarantula, while being given an educational talk about them. On the adjoining side there is also a museum which displays a variety of items which have been seized by HM customs at Heathrow Airport and donated to the park, a display of tribal artefacts (including genuine weaponry, tattoo kits and replica shrunken heads), displays of bones, feathers, eggs and fossils, along with an alligator skin which visitors are able to touch.|$|E
40|$|The {{proximal}} duodenum {{of eight}} marsupial species, (koala, common brushtail possum, ring-tailed possum, common wombat, great grey kangaroo, <b>parma</b> <b>wallaby,</b> short-nosed bandicoot and tiger cat) were investigated immunohistochemically using 12 specific antisera for gut hormones. Several types of immunoreactive cells were {{seen on the}} intestinal villi and in crypts of these species: 9 types in the koala; 8 types in the common brushtail possum; 7 types in the common wombat; 6 types in the short-nosed bandicoot and 5 types in the ringtailed possum, great grey kangaroo, <b>parma</b> <b>wallaby</b> and tiger cat. Gastrin-, somatostatin-, motilin- and serotonin-immunoreactive cells were seen in all species examined. A few BPP-, enteroglucagon-, CCK-, secretin-, GIP- and neurotensin-immunoreactive cells were seen but only in few species. A few substance P-immunoreactive cells were detected only in the koala. Immunoreactive cells were also seen in Brunner's glands: 5 types in the parma wallaby; 3 types in the great grey kangaroo and tiger cat; 2 types in the koala and common wombat; 1 type in the short-nosed bandicoot. No immunoreactive cells were found in Brunner's glands of the common brushtail possum...|$|E
