The Navy has acknowledged in recent years that its aviation systems have significant readiness and supply problems. Since 1990, GAO has included Defense Department (DOD) inventory management, including spare parts, on its list of government functions at high risk for waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. This report reviews (1) the impact of <b>shortages</b> of spare <b>parts</b> for two selected aircraft [...] the EA- 6 B Prowler and F- 14 Tomcat, (2) the reasons for the shortages, and (3) the initiatives that the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency have in place or planned to address overall spare <b>part</b> <b>shortage</b> issues. GAO found that spare <b>parts</b> <b>shortages</b> for the two aircraft have harmed Navy's readiness and the economy and efficiency of maintenance activities. Spare <b>parts</b> <b>shortages</b> have contributed to problems retaining military personnel. Navy managers attributed the spare <b>parts</b> <b>shortages</b> to the fact that more parts were required than the Navy originally anticipated and that problems arose in identifying, quantifying, or contracting with a private company to produce or repair the parts.

Shortages are a key indicator that the billions of dollars being spent on these parts are not being used effectively, efficiently, and economically. Despite additional funding from Congress, the Army still has concerns about spare <b>parts</b> <b>shortages.</b> Spare <b>parts</b> <b>shortages</b> for the Apache, Blackhawk, and Chinook helicopters have harmed operations and lowered morale among maintenance personnel. Cannibalization of parts from one aircraft to another is an inefficient practice that results in double work for the maintenance personnel, masks <b>parts</b> <b>shortages,</b> and lowers morale. Parts were unavailable for various reasons, including higher-than-expected demand for parts, delays in obtaining parts from contractors, and problems with overhaul and maintenance. Another factor contributing to the shortage was the Army's inability to obtain parts for these aging aircraft from the original manufacturers, which sometimes had gone out of business. The Army and the Defense Logistics Agency have efforts planned or underway to improve the availability of aviation spare parts. Once these initiatives are further along, GAO will review them to determine whether they can be enhanced. ...|$|R

40|$|Semiconductor capital {{equipment}} is manufactured in a high-mix and low-volume environment at Varian Semiconductor Equipment business unit of Applied Materials. Due to the demand {{growth over the}} past years, Varian has been continuously improving its operations practices to increase the factory capacity without investing additional floor space or labor shifts. A hypothesis-driven analysis is used to identify, understand and formulate solutions for the issues that Varian faces {{in order to increase}} its production capacity. Based on the preliminary analysis, we develop a hypothesis tree and we identify effective operation time reduction and cycle time reduction to be the two root hypotheses. Inventory shortages increase the effective operation time of the production lines and lower Varian's production capacity, especially those high-volume low-variety assemblies built in supermarket build area. We present a consumption based assembly level inventory management system based on the base-stock model to reduce assembly shortages on downstream production lines. This system will be used to manage those finished goods inventory of supermarket assemblies on a make-to-stock basis for all downstream consumptions, and it will allow Varian to increase those assemblies' service levels while reducing finished goods inventory level of assemblies by 30 %. Supermarket piece parts are the components used to build assemblies; piece <b>part</b> <b>shortages</b> delay the scheduled delivery of assemblies to the downstream production lines thereby causing assembly <b>shortages.</b> For piece <b>part</b> <b>shortages</b> caused by inaccurate inventory records, Varian lacks an effective solution. We present two component level inventory management systems for reducing piece <b>part</b> <b>shortages.</b> In short to middle term, we present a secured tablet solution as a self-check-out terminal to provide better user experience aiming at reducing inaccurate inventory records by 50 %. In middle to long term, we present a Vertical Lift Module solution to completely eliminate inaccurate inventory record while reducing storage space. by Yiming Wu. Thesis (M.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the application of}} the principles of lean manufacturing and supply chain planning at Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates. Varian is a manufacturer of ion implantation machines, and supplies and services equipment for most of the leading semiconductor manufacturers. The demand for the company's products is uncertain. The products are customizable, and the production schedules change from day to day to comply with customer requests. In situations where variability - whether in product features or logistics, use of lean manufacturing techniques like Value Stream Mapping and Waste Elimination helped to highlight the main problems. The main problem at Varian was the chronic <b>part</b> <b>shortage</b> from suppliers. Further investigation revealed improper supply chain and inventory management. Specifically, the Kanban policy is found to have a majority impact of current shortage situation. Lean manufacturing principles and supply chain planning were implemented to analyze and remedy chronic <b>part</b> <b>shortage.</b> Improper supply chain and inventory management practices were identified. A new Kanban policy was used to improve the shortage situation. Recommendations included a shorter lot size review period, larger safety factor and a new lot size decision making strategy based on historical demand. by Wu Chen. Thesis (M. Eng.)
