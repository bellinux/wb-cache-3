50|$|Variations of {{the basic}} Auto-Truck were soon produced. These {{included}} lifting <b>platform</b> <b>bodies</b> with a hydraulic pump and a long hand lever alongside the driver's saddle. They were used either for moving heavy loads around factories, to avoid lifting, or else as a pallet truck which could be moved under a wooden platform before lifting it off the floor to move it. Tipping hoppers were also made, although owing to {{the limitations of the}} small wheels, these were not intended for gardens or construction sites, as has often been claimed, but were mostly for collecting waste materials around factories. Another variation shortened the body and the truck was used for towing trailers.|$|R

A large trolley is likely to have had a headboard with the driver's seat on it, as on a lorry but a smaller trolley may have had a box {{at the front of the}} deck or the driver seated on a corner of the deck and his feet on a shaft. With a very small trolley, the 'driver' may even have led the horse as a pedestrian. They were normally drawn by a single pony or horse but a large trolley would have a pair.|$|E

40|$|Sulcata {{software}} simulates {{the operation}} of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) radar terminal descent sensor (TDS). The program models TDS radar antennas, RF hardware, and digital processing, as well as the physics of scattering from a coherent ground surface. This application is specific to this sensor and is flexible enough to handle end-to-end design validation. Sulcata is a high-fidelity simulation and is used for performance evaluation, anomaly resolution, and design validation. Within the trajectory frame, almost all internal vectors are represented in whatever coordinate system is used to represent platform position. The trajectory frame must be planet-fixed. The <b>platform</b> <b>body</b> frame is specified relative to arbitrary reference points relative to the platform (spacecraft or test vehicle). Its rotation is a function of time from the trajectory coordinate system specified via dynamics input (file for open loop, callback for closed loop). Orientation of the frame relative to the body is arbitrary, but constant over time. The TDS frame must have a constant rotation and translation from the <b>platform</b> <b>body</b> frame specified at run time. The DEM frame has an arbitrary, but time-constant, rotation and translation with respect to the simulation frame specified at run time. It has the same orientation as sigma 0 frame, but is possibly translated. Surface sigma 0 has the same arbitrary rotation and translation as DEM frame...|$|E
40|$|Background. The study aims {{to analyze}} the {{relationship}} between body posture and composition, as well as postural stability in Parkinson’s disease patients. Material and Methods. 32 people were evaluated. The {{study was conducted in}} the Laboratory of Posturology at Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce (Poland). Body posture was examined using the optoelectronic body posture Formetric Diers Method III 4 D. Postural stability was evaluated using the Biodex Balance System <b>platform.</b> <b>Body</b> composition was assessed with the method of bioelectrical impedance analysis using the Tanita MC 780 MA analyzer. Results. 11 patients (34. 37 %) had hyperkyphosis, 10 (31. 25 %) hyperlordosis, and 3 (9. 37 %) hyperkyphosis-hyperlordosis posture. Scoliosis (> 10 °) was observed in 28 (87. 5 %) subjects, whereas 4 (12. 5 %) presented scoliotic body posture (1 – 9 °). In the examined population, all parameters of postural stability were within normal limits. Conclusions. A significant positive correlation was observed between surface rotation (°), General Stability Index (r= 0. 4075, p= 0. 0206), and Anteroposterior Stability Index (r= 0. 3819, p= 0. 0310). There was also a significant positive correlation between surface rotation (+max) (°), General Stability Index (r= 0. 3526, p= 0. 0206), and Anteroposterior Stability Index (r= 0. 3873, p= 0. 0285). Metabolic age also presented a significant positive correlation between metabolic age and General Stability Index (r= 0. 4057, p= 0. 0212), as well as Anteroposterior Stability Index (r= 0. 3507, p= 0. 0490) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the training and}} detraining effects of a whole body vibration strength training programme. Methods: In total 41 young adult subjects participated, in 3 groups. The training group participated in a 10 week exercise programme (three times per week) on the vibration <b>platform</b> (<b>Body</b> Coach®), followed by a second training period of 6 weeks (once a week). The detraining group only participated in the 10 week vibration programme. A control group {{did not participate in}} any exercise programme during the study. Subjects had to perform a dynamic squat movement (lower limbs) and a push up movement (upper limbs) on the platform during vibration. The intensity and the duration of the vibration programme increased systematically by changing the amplitude, frequency and duration of the vibration periods. Pre and post tests for maximal strength, explosive strength (power), flexibility and some anthropometric measures were taken. Four subjects dropped out, resulting in a total sample of 37 subjects. Results: Maximal strength increased with 8, 1 % to 16, 1 % in the training group, and with 9, 0 % to 23, 5 % in the detraining group after 10 weeks of exercising. After 6 weeks of detraining, some detraining effects, although not statistically significant, were observed (0. 7 % to 6. 7 %) in the detraining group. Detraining was observed in 7 out of 10 strength measures after ending the exercise programme. The training group however showed a persistent increase in strength on 9 out of 10 tests. Conclusion: This whole body vibration programme showed an increase in strength in upper and lower limbs. Moderate detraining effects were observed after a detraining period of 6 weeks in a sample of young adult males and females. A stabilisation or maintenance programme (once a week) seems to be sufficient to keep the gained strength by using the whole body vibration method...|$|E
40|$|Recently, Facebook {{crossing}} 1 billion {{number of}} users mark has interestingly coincided with {{an increasing number of}} proposals for decentralized online social networks (OSNs) as privacy preserving alternatives for social networking [2, 3]. The former employs privacy-by-policy approach compared to more privacy-friendly privacy-by-design approach employed by the latter. Decentralized OSNs, where users host their content themselves, offer privacy protection from the service providers and restore the full control and ownership of content back to the users. However, because of the network effect, the adaptability of a new social network platform will be limited. At the same time, privacy-conscious users are opting out of today’s OSNs [1]. A more viable trade-off for the decentralized alternatives would be to cooperate and simultaneously compete with Facebook. They can run as 3 rd party apps on Facebook and allow the users to share sensitive content through them. They can exploit Facebook’s user base and overcome the network effect. However, it must be ensured that content is not accessible to Facebook. This may involve an identity provider independent from Facebook, in order to ensure faithful access control enforcement. In turn, they enable Facebook to gain on privacy reputation and attract more privacy conscious users. Facebook can serve content-agnostic advertisements while users consume the content hosted inside these apps. A number of challenges such as seamless interfaces between both ecosystems, availability of the decentralized OSNs, need to be addressed before such a hybrid infrastructure can replace an existing online social network <b>platform.</b> <b>BODY</b> A new way of social networking: decentralized alternatives can plug into Facebook as 3 rd party apps to overcome the network effect.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} threat of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) related deaths, the usage of mobile phone based {{computational}} <b>platforms,</b> <b>body</b> sensors and wireless communications is proliferating. Since mobile phones have limited computational resources, existing PC based complex CVD detection algorithms are often unsuitable for wireless telecardiology applications. Moreover, if the existing Electrocardiography (ECG) based CVD detection algorithms are adopted for mobile telecardiology applications, {{then there will be}} processing delays due to the computational complexities of the existing algorithms. However, for a CVD affected patient, seconds worth of delay could be fatal, since cardiovascular cell damage is a totally irrecoverable process. This paper proposes a fast and efficient mechanism of CVD detection from ECG signal. Unlike the existing ECG based CVD diagnosis systems that detect CVD anomalies from hundreds of sample points, the proposed mechanism identifies cardiac abnormality from only 5 sample points. Therefore, according to our experiments the proposed mechanism is up to 3 times faster than the existing techniques. Due to less computational burden, the proposed mechanism is ideal for wireless telecardiology applications running on mobile phones...|$|R
