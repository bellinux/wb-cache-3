40|$|With circulatory pathology, patient-specific {{simulation}} of hemodynamics {{is required to}} minimize invasiveness for diagnosis, treatment planning, and followup. We investigated the advantages of a smart combination of often already known hemodynamic principles. The CircAdapt model was designed to simulate beat-to-beat dynamics of the four-chamber heart with systemic and pulmonary circulation while incorporating a realistic relation between pressure-volume load and tissue mechanics and adaptation of tissues to mechanical load. Adaptation was modeled by rules, where a locally sensed signal results in a local action of the tissue. The applied rules were as follows: For blood vessel walls, 1) flow shear stress dilates the wall and 2) tensile stress thickens the wall; for myocardial tissue, 3) strain dilates the wall material, 4) larger maximum sarcomere length increases contractility, and 5) contractility increases wall mass. The circulation was composed of active and <b>passive</b> <b>compliances</b> and inertias. A realistic circulation developed by self-structuring through adaptation provided mean levels of systemic pressure and flow. Ability to simulate {{a wide variety of}} patient-specific circumstances was demonstrated by application of the same adaptation rules to the conditions of fetal circulation followed by a switch to the newborn circulation around birth. It was concluded that a few adaptation rules, directed to normalize mechanical load of the tissue, were sufficient to develop and maintain a realistic circulation automatically. Adaptation rules appear to be the key to reduce dramatically the number of input parameters for simulating circulation dynamics. The model may be used to simulate circulation pathology and to predict effects of treatment...|$|R

40|$|Historical {{numerical}} {{methods for}} solving stiff ordinary differential equations are investigated {{and a new}} numerical framework developed and applied {{to a variety of}} hydrodynamic stability problems where the effects of <b>passive</b> wall <b>compliance</b> are investigated. The compound matrix method is set in a general coordinate free framework using exterior algebra, and is considered to be the most accurate and easy to implement method for complex systems. The effect of <b>passive</b> wall <b>compliance</b> on the Blasius boundary layer flow is studied. The linear stability of the mean flow state is considered using the new numerical framework and shooting technique. A Newton algorithm is implemented to converge the eigenvalue such that the boundary condition at the surface is satisfied. Curves of neutral stability are produced in the Re-alpha plane for various degrees of compliance, damping and tension parameters. Three dimensionality is incorporated first by a simple introduction of rotation in the flow leading to the investigation of the Ekman boundary layer problem where a Coriolis force instability mechanism (type- 2) produces streamwise rolls at modest Reynolds numbers. The linear stability of the Ekman mean flow state is considered using an extension of the new numerical framework for use on the vector space Lambda(3) (C 6). Curves of neutral stability are produced in the E-gamma plane for constant values of the Reynolds number and in the Re-gamma plane for a selection of constant angle of orientation, E. This work is extended to consider the effects of wall compliance on the type- 2 viscous instability mechanism, with the type- 1 mode of instability briefly discussed. Three-dimensionality is then used for a direct application to the dolphin.

40|$|This study {{advances}} {{the conversation}} {{by looking at}} the current educational reform movement, No Child Left Behind (NCLB), through the lens of a practicing teacher. Seeking to understand how NCLB affects the morale and pedagogy of public education teachers in a school labeled "program improvement"; this study uses focus group interviews with five participating teachers at one inland southern California elementary school. Utilizing focus group interviews and the personal stories of the participants, this study investigates the culture, climate, and behavioral shifts that emerged following an ideological incongruence between teachers and administrators. This study considers NCLB's impact on teacher pedagogy and ideology. The data reveals that, pedagogically, teachers feel that the changes made to their school, a result of the NCLB mandates, were an attempt to undermine the culture and climate of the school. The findings suggest that teacher reactions to NCLB fall within a behavioral continuum of: acceptance, <b>compliance,</b> <b>passive</b> resistance, and active resistance. Ultimately, the teachers' ideological incongruence with NCLB positioned them to make tough pedagogical decisions.

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of the dynamic model of {{vibratory}} alignment the main features of the vibrational assembly process are investigated. The regularities of non−impact alignment, when an immovable part is excited in two perpendicular directions, are defined. It is revealed that during the vibrational alignment the movable part can move from static till dynamic equilibrium position. The distance between these two positions defines allowable error of mutual positioning of the parts subject to the assembly, when the unhindered parts insertion is still possible. On {{the basis of}} the dynamic model of vibratory displacement the regularities of a body displacement under controlled dry friction force at a particular time interval is examined. If elastic vibrations are excited, dry friction coefficient decreases and smaller friction force acts against the body displacement. Stoppage of these vibrations causes a steep increase of friction coefficient. When the body moves from static to dynamic equilibrium position on the inclined plane the vibratory displacement is governed by the transient regimes of motion. Assembly robots equipped with <b>passive</b> <b>compliance</b> vibratory end-effectors allow one to compensate considerably bigger deviations in part’s interposition without using sensors and feedback systems. Therefore usage of vibratory devices with <b>passive</b> <b>compliance</b> allows one to significantly reduce the expenses of robotic assembly...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study has}} been undertaken {{of the influence of}} a compliant boundary on absolute instability. In a certain parameter range absolute instability occurs in the boundary layer on a rotating disc, thereby instigating rapid transition to turbulence. The conventional use of wall compliance as a laminar-flow control technique has been to lower growth rates of convective instabilities. This has the effect of reducing amplification of disturbances as they propagate downstream. For absolute instability, however, only the suppression of its onset would be a significant gain. This paper addresses the question of whether <b>passive</b> wall <b>compliance</b> can be advantageous when absolute instability exists in a boundary layer. A theoretical model of a single-layer viscoelastic compliant wall was used in conjunction with the sixth-order system of differential equations which govern the stability of the boundary-layer flow over a rotating disc. The absolute/convective nature of the flow was ascertained by using a spatio-temporal analysis. Pinch-point singularities of the dispersion relation and a point of zero group velocity identify the presence of absolute instability. It was found that only a low level of wall compliance was enough to delay the appearance of absolute instability to higher Reynolds numbers. Beyond a critical level of wall compliance results suggest that complete suppression of absolute instability is possible. This would then remove a major route to transition in the rotating-disc boundary layer...|$|R
