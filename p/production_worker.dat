The thesis covers intervention measures aiming at integrating learning and work by developing an information system. The thesis presents and elaborates on the process and outcome of such a development. The empirical work in this thesis is based on an action case study research approach.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} on dust {{exposure}} and respiratory health among cement cleaners. There {{are only a}} few follow-up studies on respiratory health among cement factory workers and also studies on acute effects of cement dust exposure are limited in numbers. Objective: This study aimed at assessing cement dust exposure and adverse respiratory health effects among Ethiopian cement <b>production</b> <b>workers,</b> with particular focus on cement cleaners. Method: The first paper was a combined cross-sectional and cross-shift study. Forty exposed cement <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> from the crusher and packing sections and 20 controls from the guards were included. Full-shift personal total dust was measured in the breathing zone of the workers and Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured for all selected workers before and after the shift. A modified respiratory symptom score questionnaire was used to assess acute respiratory symptoms experienced {{at the end of the}} work shift. The second paper comprises an exposure assessment carried out in two cement factories (A and B). Personal full-shift samples of total (n= 150) and respirable dust (n= 36) were taken in the breathing zone of 105 cement workers. The third paper was a follow-up study, 112 personal total dust samples were collected from 46 workers. In total 127 workers; 56 cleaners, 44 cement <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> and 27 controls were randomly selected and examined for lung function and interviewed about chronic respiratory symptoms at baseline in 2009. Of these, 91 workers; 38 cement cleaners, 33 cement <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> and 20 controls were reexamined with the same methods one year later. Results: In the first paper we found that the exposed workers had considerably higher geometric mean (GM) total dust exposure (38. 6 mg/m 3 and 18. 5 mg/m 3 in the crusher and packing, respectively) than the controls (0. 4 mg/m 3). Stuffy nose (85 %), shortness of breath (47 %) and sneezing (45 %) were the most prevalent acute respiratory symptoms among the high exposed workers. PEF decreased significantly across the shift in the high exposed group. In the second paper, cleaners had significantly higher exposure to total and respirable dust than other <b>production</b> <b>workers.</b> Among cleaners, the GM for total and respirable dust exposure were 549 and 6. 8 mg/m 3 in Factory A and 153 and 2. 8 mg/m 3 in Factory B. Temporal variability (within-worker) dominated the variability in the cleaners’ total dust exposure. The distance from machines while performing cleaning tasks and the fraction of working hours spent on cleaning explained about 73 % of the temporal variability in total dust exposure among cleaners. Only 7 % of the cement <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> used respiratory protective devices. In the follow-up study, total GM dust exposure among cleaners was 432 mg/m 3. The levels were considerably lower among the <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> (GM= 8. 2 mg/m 3), but still 48 % exceeded 10 mg/m 3. The prevalence of all the chronic respiratory symptoms among both cleaners and <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> was significantly higher than among the controls. Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1) and FEV 1 / Forced Vital Capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) were significantly reduced from 2009 to 2010 among the cleaners and <b>production</b> <b>workers,</b> but not among the controls. Conclusion This study has shown increased prevalence of acute and chronic respiratory symptoms as well as reduced lung function among dust exposed cement <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> and excessively exposed cleaners than among the less exposed controls. It is likely that the adverse respiratory health effects are related to the dust exposure...|$|R

40|$|Background: Manual {{workers in}} the public sector have {{previously}} been found to be at risk of mental sickness absence (SA). As the impact of mental illness differs across economic sectors, this study investigated mental SA in the industrial sector, differentiating between office and <b>production</b> <b>workers.</b> Methods: Ten-year observational cohort study including 14 369 (8164 production and 6205 office) workers with a total of 101 118 person years. SA data were retrieved from an occupational health register. Mental SA episodes were medically certified as emotional disturbances [10 th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10 R 45) ] or mental and behavioural disorders (ICD- 10 F 00 –F 99). The first mental SA episode since baseline was called index mental SA. Recurrences were defined as any mental SA episode occurring > 28 days after recovery from index mental SA. Results: The incidence of mental SA was higher in <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> than in office workers, but office workers needed longer time to recover from mental SA. Mental SA recurred as frequently in <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> as in office workers. The median time to recurrence was 15. 9 months and tangibly shorter in office workers (14. 9 months) than in <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> (16. 7 months). <b>Production</b> and office <b>workers</b> aged > 55 years were at increased risk of recurrent mental SA within 12 months of recovery from index mental SA. Conclusions: The incidence of mental SA was higher in <b>production</b> <b>workers</b> than in office workers, whereas recurrence rates did not differ between them. Occupational health providers should pay special attention to older workers as they are at increased risk of recurrent mental SA.
