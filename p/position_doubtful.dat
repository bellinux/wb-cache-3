Petitions were sent up to parliament urging the necessity of such a seat of learning. York and Manchester competed warmly for the honour of receiving it. Fairfax wrote to his brother Ferdinando, then second Lord Fairfax, 20 March 1641, asking for his influence. In 1646 Fairfax was removed from Newton Kyme to the neighbouring, and much richer, rectory of Bolton Percy. Here he resided for a great portion of the time with his nephew Thomas, the third Lord Fairfax, as a parishioner at Nun Appleton, until the Restoration in 1660.

The royal infantry had to be rearranged in order of regimental seniority, and Turenne, seeing and desiring to profit by the attendant disorder, came out of his stronghold and attacked with the greatest vigor. The battle (15 December 1650) was severe and for a time doubtful, but Turenne's Frondeurs gave way in the end, and his army, as an army, ceased to exist. Turenne himself, undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama, asked and received the young king's pardon, and meantime the court, with the maison du roi and other loyal troops, had subdued the minor risings without difficulty.

A portion of the Parliamentary troops were also disbanded, and allowed to return to their homes; among these were Master Rippinghall and his son, and for some months matters went on at Abingdon as if the civil war had never been.

The Brongniartieae displays a wide geographical disjunction between Australia and the New World and previous phylogenetic studies had provided conflicting results about {{the relationships between the}} American and Australian genera. We carry out phylogenetic analyses of (1) a plastid matK dataset extensively sampled across legumes to solve the enigmatic relationship of the Cuban-endemic monospecific genus Behaimia; and (2) multilocus datasets with focus on all genera ever referred to Brongniartieae. These analyses resulted in a well-resolved and strongly-supported phylogenetic tree of the Brongniartieae. The monophyly of all American genera of Brongniartieae is strongly supported. The <b>doubtful</b> <b>position</b> of the Australian genus Plagiocarpus is resolved within a clade comprising all Australian genera. Behaimia has been traditionally classified in tribe Millettieae, but our new molecular data and re-assessment of morphological traits have resolved the genus within the early-branching papilionoid tribe Brongniartieae.

50|$|The only {{authority}} for the particulars of his ejection is John Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy, where the author is {{not sure of the}} Christian name, and calls him Mikefer, but says he was descended from a branch of the imperial line of Russia, and was sent to England by Mr. Joseph Bidell, a Russian merchant, to be educated at Oxford, when his and his two brothers' lives were in danger from a powerful faction in Russia. In an article in the ‘S. D. U. K. Dictionary,’ Mr. Thomas Watts is unable to connect this story definitely with any records in Russian historians. He became rector of Woolley, in Huntingdonshire, in 1618, and was ejected in or about 1643. It appears that the ‘fifths’ were duly paid to him by his successor. At the Restoration in 1660 he was reinstated, but after some time retired to his son's house at Hammersmith, where he died. The particular hardships he endured are narrated by Walker, but, they are not worth recording, as they are given upon mere hearsay, derived from a letter from Peter Phelips, minister of Woolley, to Mr. Clavel.

When the company outpost was overrun by the enemy while his platoon, firing from hastily-constructed foxholes, was engaged in resisting the brunt of a fierce mortar, machine-gun, grenade and small-arms attack launched by hostile forces from high ground under cover of darkness, Technical Sergeant Wilson braved intense fire to assist the survivors back into the line and to direct the treatment of casualties. Although twice wounded by gunfire, in the right arm and the left leg, he refused medical aid for himself and continued to move about among his men, shouting words of encouragement. After receiving further wounds in the head and shoulder as the attack increased in intensity, he again insisted upon remaining with his unit. Unable to use either arm to fire, and with mounting casualties among our forces, he resupplied his men with rifles and ammunition taken from the wounded. Personally reporting to his company commander on several occasions, he requested and received additional assistance when the enemy attack became even more fierce and, after placing the reinforcements in strategic positions in the line, directed effective fire until blown off his feet by the bursting of a hostile mortar round in his face. Dazed and suffering from concussion, he still refused medical aid and, despite weakness from loss of blood, moved from foxhole to foxhole, directing fire, resupplying ammunition, rendering first aid and encouraging his men. By his heroic actions in the face of almost certain death, when the unit's ability to hold the disadvantageous <b>position</b> was <b>doubtful,</b> he instilled confidence in his troops, inspiring them to rally repeatedly and turn back the furious assaults. At dawn, after the final attack had been repulsed, he personally accounted for each man in his platoon before walking unassisted one-half mile to the aid station where he submitted to treatment. His outstanding courage, initiative and skilled leadership in the face of overwhelming odds were contributing factors in the success of his company's mission and reflect the highest credit upon Technical Sergeant Wilson and the United States Naval Service. /S/ HARRY S.

40|$|Three {{empirical}} studies are conducted examining {{the efficiency of}} S&P 500 futures prices and the pricing of these futures contracts. In the first study, the ability of futures prices to predict the realized spot S&P 500 index prices on the expiration date is examined for near term contracts. The futures prices {{are found to be}} unbiased predictors of the realized spot index prices for the nineteen quarterly contracts from 1982 to 1986. Previous studies report significant deviations in S&P SOO futures prices from theoretically determined Cost of Carry Model (CCM) prices. In the second study, it is found that the CCM using the federal funds rate, a proxy for the overnight repurchase rate, provides relatively better estimates of the S&P S(x) futures prices over the 1984 - 1986 period. The futures mispricing also reflects the weekend effect anomaly: futures prices are "over-priced" relative to CCM prices on Mondays, whereas the opposite occurs on Fridays. The futures over-pricing (under-pricing) is characterized by "bull" ("bear") financial markets and the extent of price changes are relatively greater in the futures market. The futures under-pricing is supported by strong future market volume and open-interest positions. The basis and changes in it over the futures contract period are measures of how well integrated the futures market and the underlying spot market are. In the third study, based on daily closing prices for the S&P 500 index and index futures for the 1984 - 1986 period, it is found that the basis decreases over the contract period but the rate of decrease is independent of the time to expiration. The change in basis on Mondays is generally positive which also reflects the weekend effect anomaly. The daily basis is negative on 107 days, which generally occurs during strong futures market trading volume and open interest <b>positions.</b> It is <b>doubtful</b> whether the negative basis can be attributed to a negative net financing cost, where the dividend yield 0. 1 the spot index exceeds the cost of financing the spot index forward...|$|R

Trata-se de um estudo etnográfico, realizado entre 1995 - 1996, no qual se observou a dinâmica de atendimento policial em uma DEAM do estado do Rio de Janeiro, tendo sido também entrevistadas 32 mulheres que recorriam à DEAM em momento {{posterior}} à denúncia, para prestarem depoimentos ou solicitarem a "retirada" da queixa. Dentre os resultados, abordam-se as especificidades da demanda feminina à polícia, na qual os delitos denunciados estão subsumidos a um conjunto mais amplo de queixas referidas às "perturbações" masculinas à ordem familiar. This paper {{deals with}} the "suspension" of complaints from {{the records of the}} Women's Police Station, until Act n. 9. 099 / 95. The ethnographic study was carried out at a police station in the state of Rio de Janeiro (1995 - 1996) and included the examination of police records, interviews with the victims and observation of daily work at the office. Quite often women from the working class who are victims of marital violence chose not to legally punish their partners, contrarily to feminist's expectations. The results show the specificities of the feminine demand to the police, in which denounced crimes are included in a wider ensemble of complaints referred to male "disturbances" to the family order. The "suspension" of the complaint appears in such context as a police procedure which finds support in the <b>doubtful</b> <b>position</b> of the victims as for the criminalization of their partner's attitude and in the probable impunity of the accused, a strong characteristic of the Brazilian juridical system. Since most victims see the police intervention as a way to reorganize the familiar and conjugal relationship or {{to make it possible for}} a conjugal separation, they tend to administer its interference to their own benefit, regaining negotiations with the accused in a superior position to the one in which they found themselves before. Seen through the eyes of women, the "suspension" would be not a contradictory act to the denouncement but an element which could favor the return to a lost reciprocity...|$|R
