5000|$|In Canada, vegetarianism {{is usually}} synonymous with ovo-lacto vegetarianism. However, vegetarians are {{sometimes}} wrongly {{assumed to be}} <b>pescetarians</b> or pollotarians. Approximately 4.0% of adults were vegetarians [...]|$|R
50|$|Some <b>pescetarians</b> adopt {{their diet}} {{because of the}} {{inefficiency}} of other meat sources. For example, in the United States most cattle, chickens and pork were not free-range and fed with grains specifically grown for their food. Therefore, the environmental impact {{and the amount of}} energy needed to feed a cow, a chicken or a pig greatly exceeds its nutritional value. Such <b>pescetarians</b> might prefer to eat wild-caught fish, as opposed to farmed carnivorous fish that require food input of other fish. They might use guides such as the Seafood Watch to determine the sustainability of their seafood source.|$|R

25|$|Navratilova is a vegetarian. In an April 2006 interview, however, {{she said}} she had {{recently}} begun eating fish again because she found it hard to get enough protein while on the road; which would make her a <b>pescetarian</b> rather than a vegetarian; nevertheless in 2008 she described herself as vegetarian.|$|E
25|$|Strictly {{vegetarian}} food is rare since even vegetable {{dishes are}} flavored with the ubiquitous dashi stock, usually made with katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), {{and are therefore}} <b>pescetarian</b> more often than carnivorous. An exception is shōjin-ryōri (精進料理), vegetarian dishes developed by Buddhist monks. However, the advertised shōjin-ryōri at public eating places includes some non-vegetarian elements.|$|E
5000|$|Pescetarianism [...] (also spelled pescatarianism) or pesco-vegetarianism is the {{practice}} of following a diet that includes fish or other seafood, but not the flesh of other animals. Most <b>pescetarians</b> maintain a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet {{with the addition of}} fish and shellfish.|$|R
50|$|Pescetarianism {{is similar}} to many {{traditional}} diets emphasizing fish as well as fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, edible fungi, legumes, bread etc. Many coastal populations tend to eat this way. In common with some vegetarians, <b>pescetarians</b> often eat eggs, dairy products and packaged foods in addition to fruits, vegetables and grains.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>pescetarians</b> might regard {{their diet}} as a {{transition}} to vegetarianism, an ethical compromise, or a practical necessity to obtain nutrients absent or not easily found in plants. They argued {{that they have to}} eat [...] "some kind of meat", and fish is the least unethical meat source compared to chicken or mammals.|$|R

2500|$|However, historically, pit toilets {{were more}} common, {{as they were}} easier to build and allowed the reuse of the feces as fertilizer—very {{important}} {{in a country where}} Buddhism and its associated mostly vegetarian, <b>pescetarian</b> lifestyle acted to reduce dependence on livestock for food. [...] The waste products of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better.|$|E
2500|$|Semi-{{vegetarian}} diets consist {{largely of}} vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define meat only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism. A <b>pescetarian</b> diet {{has been described}} as [...] "fish but no other meat". The common use association between such diets and vegetarianism has led vegetarian groups such as the Vegetarian Society to state that diets containing these ingredients are not vegetarian, because fish and birds are also animals.|$|E
40|$|To {{study how}} a {{vegetarian}} or low meat diet influences {{the risk of}} colorectal cancer compared to a high meat diet, and to assess the explanatory role of factors associated with these diets. In the Netherlands Cohort Study – Meat Investigation Cohort (NLCS-MIC) (cohort of 10, 210 individuals including 1040 self-defined vegetarians), subjects completed a baseline questionnaire in 1986, based on which they were classified into vegetarians (n[*]=[*] 635), <b>pescetarians</b> (n[*]=[*] 360), 1 day/week- (n[*]=[*] 1259), 2 – 5 day/week- (n[*]=[*] 2703), and 6 - 7 day/week meat consumers (n[*]=[*] 5253). After 20. 3 years of follow-up, 437 colorectal cancer cases (307 colon, 92 rectal) were available. A non-significantly decreased risk of CRC for vegetarians, <b>pescetarians,</b> and 1 day/week compared to 6 - 7 day/week meat consumers was observed (age/sex adjusted Hazard Ratios (HR) : 0. 73 (0. 47 – 1. 13), 0. 80 (0. 47 – 1. 39), and 0. 72 (0. 52 – 1. 00), respectively). Most {{of the differences in}} HR between these groups could be explained by intake of dietary fiber and soy products. Other (non-) dietary factors characteristic for a vegetarian or low meat diet had negligible individual effects, but attenuated the HRs towards the null when combined. Vegetarians, <b>pescetarians,</b> and 1 day/week meat eaters showed a non-significantly decreased risk of colorectal cancer compared to 6 - 7 day/week meat consumers, mainly due to differences in dietary pattern other than meat intake...|$|R
2500|$|The Oxford Vegetarian Study {{showed that}} the health of vegetarians compares favourably with that of meat-eaters (excluding <b>pescetarians).</b> [...] British vegetarians have lower death rates than non-vegetarians, {{although}} this is at least partly due to non-dietary lifestyle factors, such as a low prevalence of smoking and the generally high socioeconomic status of vegetarians, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "pareve" [...] on a {{food label}} may imply {{the product is}} {{suitable}} for vegetarians or vegans, {{but this is not}} always true. Fish and fish products, like fish gelatin, are pareve, but in general not vegetarian and never vegan (but would be consumed by <b>pescetarians).</b> Honey, egg and egg products, like mayonnaise and albumen, are pareve and vegetarian but not vegan.|$|R

25|$|Vegetarians may {{avoid the}} {{negative}} {{health effects of}} processed red meat: A 1999 meta-study of five studies comparing vegetarian and non-vegetarian mortality rates in Western countries found that in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 34% lower in people who ate fish but not meat (<b>pescetarians),</b> 34% lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians, 26% lower in vegans and 20% lower in occasional meat eaters. A 2010 study found that heart disease is not linked with unprocessed red meat.|$|R
5000|$|A 1999 metastudy {{combined}} {{data from}} five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for <b>pescetarians</b> (fish eaters) to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. The study reported {{the numbers of}} deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the [...] "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these vegetarian cohorts".|$|R
2500|$|Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity (4th-6th centuries), vegetarianism nearly {{disappeared}} from Europe.

50|$|By tradition, most Hindu Brahmin {{communities}} {{follow a}} strict lacto-vegetarian diet. However, {{there are a}} number of Brahmin sub-groups that allow fish eating. These include the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community from Coastal South-Western India. This community regards seafood in general as vegetables from the sea. They refrain from eating any land-based animals. Other Hindu communities who consume seafood in great quantity are the Maithili Brahmin and the Bengali Brahmin. The latter also eat meat on special occasions. Amongst the northeast Indian Hindus of Assam, Tripura and Manipur, <b>Pescetarians</b> with fish and some poultry as part of their diet is a common practice.|$|R

50|$|One {{commonly}} cited {{reason is}} that of health, based on findings that red meat is detrimental to health in many cases due to non-lean red meats containing high amounts of saturated fats, choline and carnitine.

5000|$|Although {{very little}} {{isinglass}} {{remains in the}} beer when it is drunk, many vegetarians consider beers that are processed with these finings (such as most [...] cask-conditioned ales in the UK) to be unsuitable for vegetarian diets (although acceptable for <b>pescetarians).</b> A beer-fining agent that is suitable for vegetarians is Irish moss, a type of red algae also known as carrageenan. However, carrageenan-based products (used in both the boiling process and after fermentation) primarily reduce hazes caused by proteins, but isinglass is used {{at the end of}} the brewing process, after fermentation, to remove yeast. Since the two fining agents act differently (on different haze-forming particles), they are not interchangeable, and some beers use both.|$|R
5000|$|As in Canada, vegetarianismo (...) {{is usually}} synonymous with lacto-ovo-vegetarianism, and vegetarians are {{sometimes}} wrongly {{assumed to be}} <b>pescetarians</b> and/or pollotarians who tolerate the flesh of fish or poultry, respectively. Nevertheless, veganism, and freeganism, are very common among Brazilian anarchists, punks and members of other groups in the counterculture and/or left-wing movements. Other beliefs generally associated with Brazilian vegetarians are Eastern philosophies and religions, New Age and Spiritism. It is also commonly said {{to be related to}} the emo and indie youth subcultures as influence from the local punks. Brazilian vegetarians reportedly tend to be urban, of middle or upper class and live in the Central-Southern half of the country. Since the 1990s, and especially since the 2000s, several vegetarian and vegan restaurants have appeared in the metropolitan regions of São Paulo, Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro.|$|R
40|$|Background: Vitamin B 12 is {{naturally}} {{obtained in the}} diet in foods of animal origin. Research has demonstrated {{a high risk of}} deficiency in vegans and to a lesser degree in vegetarians. Little is known about intakes of this subgroup in Scotland and whether they are consuming sufficient dairy, eggs and fortified foods to meet requirements. This study aimed to assess vitamin B 12 intakes in this population and compare differences between levels of restriction. It also aimed to determine if they are meeting the reference nutrient intake of 1. 5 ug/day as recommended by COMA and to establish if supplements are taken. Methods: Participants were recruited either from Queen Margaret university or Edinburgh city centre. The study used a five day diet diary and questionnaire. Dietary analysis was performed using Windiets software. Daily average intakes and standard deviation were established using descriptive statistics. A one sample T-test was executed to compare intakes with the reference nutrient intake. Results: This study included fifteen participants consisting of ten vegetarians, two vegans and three <b>pescetarians.</b> From the whole group nine were below the reference nutrient intake of 1. 5 ug/day including seven vegetarians and two vegans. The two vegans were also below the lower reference nutrient intake of 0. 5 ug/day implying a high deficiency risk. There {{was no significant difference between}} the average intakes for the whole group at 0. 2 (p value < 0. 05) compared with the reference nutrient intake. Conclusion: It is possible for vegetarians to receive adequate intakes of vitamin B 12 from dairy and eggs. Vegans are more restricted as demonstrated by the two in this study who have a high deficiency risk and caution must be followed to ensure they receive sufficient intakes from fortified foods and/or supplements. While there was no significant difference between each group and the RNI, a larger sample size would likely give this result. Key Words: Vitamin B 12, Cobalamin, Vegetarian, Vega...|$|R
