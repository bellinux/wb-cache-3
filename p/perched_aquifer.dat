The northern hemisphere Ice age occurred in Pleistocene time, when a {{continental ice sheet}} reached {{as far south as}} Kansas during the Wisconsin glaciation. The ice age climate had two effects on the Trinity River: It caused downcutting (few people {{know that there is a}} 100 m deep buried canyon beneath the Trinity in Dallas) , and a wetter climate caused much more water to flow in the river. The greater river flow generated great sedimentary river terraces.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of natural contamination by Al and Fe colloids in volcanic aquifers of central-southern Italy were investigated. Localized <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers,</b> and their relative discharges, are strongly {{affected by the}} presence of massive suspended solids, which confer a white-lacteous coloration to the water. This phenomenon occasionally caused the interruption of water distribution due to the exceeding of Al and Fe concentrations in aquifers exploited for human supply. The cause was ascribed to water seepage from <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers.</b> Water discharges affected by such contamination was investigated for the Rocca Ripesena area (north-eastern sector of Vulsini Volcanic District) and for the Rianale Stream Valley (Roccamonfina Volcanic Complex). Hydrogeological survey of both areas confirmed the presence of <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers</b> not previously considered due to their low productivity. Pluviometric data and chemical parameters were periodically monitored. Water mineralization decreased with increasing rainfall, conversely Al and Fe concentrations increased. Statistical analysis confirmed the dependence of all the chemical variables on rock leaching, with the sole exception of Al and Fe which were imputed to colloids mobilization from local, strongly pedogenized pyroclastic material. The similarities in hydrogeological settings and mobilization dynamics in both areas suggest that the Al and Fe colloidal contamination should be more abundant than currently known in quaternary volcanic areas...|$|R

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the occurrence of}} arsenic in the groundwater system of the Cimino-Vico volcanic area (central Italy), different parts of which are currently widely used for local drinking water supply and for irrigation. The system shows a complex groundwater circulation, including a continuous basal <b>aquifer,</b> discontinuous <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers,</b> groundwater flows at high altitude, and local interactions with rising thermal fluids. Data on arsenic contents in 250 water samples from springs and wells and in 68 samples from rock outcrops were measured and combined with already existing information. Results highlight that arsenic concentrations of groundwater are influenced by type of aquifer, groundwater flow path, arsenic content of the aquifer rocks, and interaction with fluids rising from depth. Waters circulating in the Vico volcanics, one of the prominent rock units of the area, have high concentrations of arsenic, both for the basal and the <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers.</b> A large fraction of the waters associated with this rock unit have arsenic contents higher than 10 μg/L (82 percent for basal, 40 percent for perched). In contrast, waters circulating in the Cimino volcanics have lower arsenic contents: 30 percent of the basal and 10 percent of the <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers</b> have arsenic concentrations greater than 10 μg/L. Through an integrated approach, including leaching tests to investigate the arsenic behavior concerning the water-rock interaction and a geostatistical modeling of data, it has been possible to identify and tentatively quantify suitable water resources that have arsenic content not exceeding the quality standards for human consumption...|$|R

Sources of HE include the infiltration of past wastewater discharges from several HE-processing facilities through the ditch drainage system and leachate from former Landfill 3.

40|$|The Maltese Islands are {{composed}} of two limestone aquifers, the Upper and Lower Coralline Limestone separated by an aquitard, the ‘Blue Clay’. The Lower Coralline Limestone is overlain {{in part by the}} poorly permeable Globigerina Limestone. The upper <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers</b> are discontinuous and have very limited saturated thickness and a short water level response time to rainfall. Frequent detections of coliforms suggest a rapid route to groundwater. However, the unsaturated zone has a considerable thickness in places and the primary porosity of the Upper Coralline Limestone is high, so there is likely to be older recharge by slow matrix flow as well as rapid recharge from fractures. Measurement of SF 6 from a pumping station in a deep part of one of the <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers</b> indicated a mean saturated zone age of about 15 years. The Main Sea Level aquifers (MSL) on both Malta and Gozo have a large unsaturated thickness as water levels are close to sea level. On Malta, parts of the aquifer are capped by the <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers</b> and more extensively by the Globigerina Limestone. The limited detection of coliform bacteria suggests only some rapid recharge from the surface via fractures or karst features. Transmissivity is low and tritium and CFC/SF 6 data indicate that saturated zone travel times are in the range 15 - 40 years. On Gozo the aquifer is similar but is more-extensively capped by impermeable Blue Clay. CFC data show the saturated zone travel time is from 25 years to possibly more than 60 years.

High-resolution conceptual modelling is now necessary to solve problems of applied geology and hydrogeology...|$|R
40|$|Many {{volcanic}} islands face freshwater {{stress and}} the situation may worsen with climate change and sea level rise. In this context, an optimum management of freshwater resources becomes crucial, but is often impeded {{by the lack of}} data. With the aim of investigating the hydrogeological settings of southern San Cristóbal Island (Galapagos), we conducted a helicopter-borne, transient electromagnetic survey with the SkyTEM system. It provided unprecedented insights into the 3 -D resistivity structure of this extinct basaltic shield. Combined with remote sensing and fieldwork, it allowed the definition of the first hydrogeological conceptual model of the island. Springs are fed by a series of <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers</b> overlying a regional basal aquifer subject to seawater intrusion. Dykes, evidenced by alignments of eruptive cones at the surface, correspond to sharp sub-vertical contrasts in resistivity in the subsurface, and impound groundwater in a summit channel. Combined with geomorphological observations, airborne electromagnetics are shown to be a useful for hydrogeological exploratory studies in complex, poorly known environments. They allow optimal development of land-based geophysical surveys and drilling campaigns...|$|R
40|$|This report summarises {{the results}} of a {{collaborative}} study jointly funded by the North-west Region of the Environment Agency (the Agency) and the British Geological Survey (BGS). BGS was commissioned to carry out a geological and hydrogeological characterisation of the superficial deposits of the Central Manchester and Salford district as a contribution to a regional groundwater study of the Manchester and Cheshire aquifer being undertaken by the Agency. The overall objective {{of the study was to}} use a three-dimensional (3 D) model of the superficial deposits to examine potential groundwater-surface water interactions. By integrating the modern 1 : 10, 000 geological map with sub-surface (site investigation) information, the relationships within the quaternary deposits have been characterised and potential hydrogeological pathways between the surface water bodies and the deeper sandstone aquifer were identified. The work has shown that the Permo-Triassic aquifer is largely protected by glacial clay and silt deposits. However, the distribution and thickness of these deposits varies greatly across the area and hydraulic windows have been identified in the lowland areas where recharge may occur. Extensive sandy outwash sheet deposits, which are locally in contact with the underlying Permo- Triassic aquifer, offer the potential for lateral migration of groundwater in <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers.</b> Large areas and thicknesses of man-made material have been described and modelled and these could form potential sources of pollution, especially where they are in direct contact with the major <b>aquifer</b> or <b>perched</b> <b>aquifers.</b> The work involved four main tasks: • Determining the geometry, composition and spatial distribution of the principal superficial (drift) deposits; • Identifying potential pathways for groundwater movement through the drift; • Constructing a suite of land-use maps to help assess the locations of potentially contaminative activities; • Constructing a domain-based aquifer vulnerability model. Outputs of the study include: An attributed model of the superficial geology that can be interrogated at any x,y,z location An indication of potential flowpaths along bespoke sections through the 3 D model and in plan view along the major superficial aquifers A novel hydrogeological domains map, based on established domain principals, but derived by computation from the 3 D model A detailed dataset on past contaminative land use and the distribution, thickness and variation of the main areas of artificial ground All data delivered digitally (CD-ROM) and as a printed report with maps...|$|R
