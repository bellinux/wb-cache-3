25|$|According to {{internal}} GM documents, the ultimate culprit {{appears to be}} operating vehicles {{for long periods of}} time with low coolant levels. The low coolant is caused by pressure caps that fail in the open position. (The new caps and recovery bottles were introduced at the same time as DEX-COOL). This exposes hot engine components to air and vapors, causing corrosion and contamination of the coolant with iron oxide particles, which in turn can aggravate the <b>pressure</b> <b>cap</b> problem as contamination holds the caps open permanently.|$|E
50|$|The FMK-3 is a {{fibreglass}} cased Argentine anti-tank blast mine. It {{is produced}} by Direccion General de Fabricaciones Militares. The mine actually uses a FMK-1 anti-personnel mine as a fuze, the FMK-1 is modified with a <b>pressure</b> <b>cap</b> to increase the activation pressure. Argentina's stock of FMK-1 mines was modified in 2003 to prevent their use as anti-personnel mines, this involved welded an additional plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>cap</b> onto the mine.

FIA announce that from 1989 onwards turbos will be banned and to encourage teams to switch, two additional championships are introduced, which are open to non turbo teams only: the Jim Clark Cup for drivers, and the Colin Chapman Trophy for constructors.

5000|$|The two-story masonry {{structure}} was {{built as a}} soda water factory by John Fountain & Benjamin Tallman in 1852. The stone walls of the building are more than 2 ft thick so ice and soda supplies could be kept cool. These construction materials also have protected it from fires that destroyed surrounding buildings (3 fires occurred in 1856 alone), {{and as a result}} {{it is one of the}} oldest buildings in Placerville. Water was pulled through a small wood framed hole in the wall from a spring out back in the hillside. An odd-looking contraption (a small pressure vessel) housed inside the building, added carbon dioxide (...) to the water. A replica is currently on display. Bottles were then filled and <b>pressure</b> <b>caps</b> added with wire twists to hold the caps in place.|$|R

50|$|The Tower crown {{representing}} the bent of a striped ribbon façade {{consists of two}} big 41m span twisted steel arches with interim steel supports cantilevered from the central cylindrical RC core walls and 4 smaller arches-props supporting the white steel ribbons-stripes (tubular frames filled with perforated steel sheets). The twisted steel arches were designed and manufactured in Piedmont, Italy , and then delivered to Moscow in pieces by trucks and then finally assembled on the roof (bolted from inside). The parapet glazing surrounding roof open observation deck on Level 52 is made of cold bent (tempered triplex) glass with motorized foldable top elements for easy access of the BMU cradle over the parapet. The bespoke BMU system with three articulated arms crane and 300kg auxiliary hoist follows the complex twisting form of the façade in order to guarantee the proper access for maintenance and cleaning of the curtain wall. The special cradle {{has been designed to}} reach all the positions along the façade without physical impact on the curtain wall with support of safety straps, push locks and sockets incorporated in each curtain wall unit, special sticks and soft rubber rollers preventing any scratches or other damage from cradle contacts with fragile envelope of glass, <b>pressure</b> <b>caps</b> and soft aluminum cladding.|$|R

50|$|The mine {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel main body containing a 60 millimeter mortar shell body (originally the M49A2), linked to a tall thin fuze stand.

When the mine is triggered a black powder charge launches the mortar shell out of {{the main body of}} the mine and into the air.

40|$|The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) {{aimed for}} a {{one-dimensional}} quantity adequately reflecting the human physiological {{reaction to the}} multi-dimensionally defined actual outdoor thermal environment. The human reaction was simulated by the UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human thermoregulation, which was integrated with an adaptive clothing model. Following {{the concept of an}} equivalent temperature, UTCI for a given combination of wind speed, radiation, humidity and air temperature was defined as the air temperature of the reference environment, which according to the model produces an equivalent dynamic physiological response. Operationalising this concept involved (1) the definition of a reference environment with 50 % relative humidity (but vapour <b>pressure</b> <b>capped</b> at 20 hPa), with calm air and radiant temperature equalling air temperature and (2) the development of a one-dimensional representation of the multivariate model output at different exposure times. The latter was achieved by principal component analyses showing that the linear combination of 7 parameters of thermophysiological strain (core, mean and facial skin temperatures, sweat production, skin wettedness, skin blood flow, shivering) after 30 and 120 min exposure time accounted for two-thirds of the total variation in the multi-dimensional dynamic physiological response. The operational procedure was completed by a scale categorising UTCI equivalent temperature values in terms of thermal stress, and by providing simplified routines for fast but sufficiently accurate calculation, which included look-up tables of pre-calculated UTCI values for a grid of all relevant combinations of climate parameters and polynomial regression equations predicting UTCI over the same grid.

50|$|Central aortic blood <b>{{pressure}}</b> (<b>CAP</b> or CASP) is {{the blood}} pressure {{at the root of}} aorta. Studies have shown the importance of central aortic pressure and its implications in assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment with respect to cardiovascular risk factors. The traditional method of measuring blood pressure in the arms has been shown to underestimate the efficacy of drugs such as amlodipine and overestimate the efficacy of those like atenolol. A clinical trial demonstrated that different medications for lowering blood pressure have different effects on the central aortic pressure and blood flow characteristics, despite producing similar branchial blood pressure readings. The study also indicated that the CAP is a better independent predictor of cardiovascular and renal outcome.|$|E

It is found that the atmosphere acts as a low capacity conduit between two reservoirs through which 10 - 100 times the current atmospheric mass of CO 2 flows.

Measurements across a water gap were carried out on planar, convex and concave surfaces specimens. Test reflectors (spark eroded notches) were introduced at different depths for the respective specimen. The notches had different positions and orientations in relation to the weld. After detection of test reflectors, sizing tolerances were reviewed. Measurement data were post processed by means of reconstruction technique using SAFT.

In the present paper, a methodology based on finite element analysis simulations which allows to improve the result accuracy and catch the real behaviour of the burst tests observed experimentally is presented. The predicted burst pressure {{has been found to}} be 6 % higher than the one obtained on models with free ends, due to biaxial loading.
