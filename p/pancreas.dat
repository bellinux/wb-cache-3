5|$|The {{next most}} common type, acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the <b>pancreas,</b> arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine <b>pancreas</b> cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the <b>pancreas,</b> which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the <b>pancreas</b> to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the <b>pancreas.</b> This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|During a Whipple's procedure, {{commonly}} used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the <b>pancreas,</b> duodenum, {{and part of the}} jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the <b>pancreas</b> and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the <b>pancreas</b> or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|In various {{situations}} such as infection, insulin demands rise {{but are not}} {{matched by}} the failing <b>pancreas.</b> Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases further {{by way of a}} vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} <b>pancreas,</b> and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic mucinous cystic {{neoplasms}} are a broad {{group of}} <b>pancreas</b> tumors that have varying malignant potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become {{more powerful and}} common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are benign.|$|E
5|$|Sulfonylureas act by {{increasing}} insulin {{release from the}} beta cells in the <b>pancreas.</b> Metformin is available combined with the sulfonylureas glipizide (Metaglip) and glibenclamide (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the <b>pancreas.</b> Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the <b>pancreas</b> had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA1 synthesis, but SFTPA1 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, <b>pancreas,</b> thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, club cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the <b>pancreas.</b> The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} <b>pancreas,</b> liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, he was {{informed}} that he had cancer of the lungs, liver and <b>pancreas.</b> He died six week later, on 3 December 1993, at a nursing home in Walnut Creek, California. He was survived by his son Michael and younger brother Carl. His second wife, Mary Teresa Benderska, whom he had married on 29 October 1948, had died in 1986, and his daughter Gelen Christine had died in 1965. His papers are in the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, Baxter was {{diagnosed}} as suffering from cancer of the <b>pancreas,</b> and he died at his home on Glasgow's South Side on 14 April 2001, with his partner Norma and his sons Alan and Steven at his bedside. His funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral, where a reading was given by Gordon Brown, a long-time fan of Raith Rovers F.C., where Baxter began his career.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's <b>pancreas,</b> then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and <b>pancreas</b> that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and <b>pancreas</b> add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, <b>pancreas,</b> and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the <b>pancreas,</b> and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|The {{first is}} {{pancreatic}} intraepithelial neoplasia. These lesions are microscopic abnormalities in the <b>pancreas</b> {{and are often}} found in autopsies of people with no diagnosed cancer. These lesions may progress from low to high grade {{and then to a}} tumor. More than 90% of cases at all grades carry a faulty KRAS gene, while in grades2 and 3 damage to three further genes– CDKN2A (p16), p53 and SMAD4– are increasingly often found.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA2 synthesis, but SFTPA2 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, <b>pancreas,</b> thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. While {{the majority of these}} tissues express both SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 transcripts, only SFTPA2 expression was found in the trachea and prostate. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, Clara cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the <b>pancreas,</b> and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
25|$|MODY4: Homozygous IPF1 {{results in}} {{failure of the}} <b>pancreas</b> to form. Congenital absence of the <b>pancreas,</b> termed {{pancreatic}} agenesis, involves deficiency of both endocrine and exocrine functions of the <b>pancreas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>pancreas</b> {{receives}} {{blood from}} branches {{of both the}} coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery. The splenic artery runs along the top margin of the <b>pancreas,</b> and supplies the neck, body and tail of the <b>pancreas</b> through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery. The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the anterior and posterior surfaces {{of the head of}} the <b>pancreas</b> at its border with the duodenum. These supply the head of the <b>pancreas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} <b>pancreas</b> varies considerably. Several {{anatomical}} variations exist, {{relating to}} the embryological development of the two pancreatic buds. The <b>pancreas</b> develops from these buds {{on either side of}} the duodenum. The ventral bud eventually rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud, eventually fusing. If the two buds, each having a duct, do not fuse, a <b>pancreas</b> may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a <b>pancreas</b> divisum. This condition has no physiologic consequence. If the ventral bud does not fully rotate, an annular <b>pancreas</b> may exist. This is where sections of the <b>pancreas</b> completely encircle the duodenum, and may even lead to duodenal atresia.|$|E
25|$|JDRF's role in {{quickening}} {{the development}} and availability of the Artificial <b>Pancreas</b> consists of funding research in order {{to look over the}} outcomes of patients using the Artificial <b>Pancreas,</b> keeping close contact with the Food and Drug Administration so that the standards of the patient are met, advocating for health care coverage of technologies such as the Artificial <b>Pancreas</b> and working to ensure clinical acceptance of technologies such as the Artificial <b>Pancreas.</b> In 2011, JDRF strongly urged the FDA before Congress and in a petition to issue clear and reasonable guidance for an artificial <b>pancreas</b> by December 2011.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pancreas</b> {{contains}} tissue with an endocrine and exocrine role, {{and this}} division is also visible when the <b>pancreas</b> is viewed under a microscope.|$|E
25|$|Pancreatic {{diseases}} that affect digestion refers to disorders affecting the exocrine <b>pancreas,</b> {{which is a}} part of the <b>pancreas</b> involved in digestion.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, insulin is {{synthesized}} in the <b>pancreas</b> {{within the}} beta cells. One million to three million pancreatic islets form the endocrine {{part of the}} <b>pancreas,</b> which is primarily an exocrine gland. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the <b>pancreas.</b> Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.|$|E
25|$|One {{concept of}} the bio-artificial <b>pancreas</b> uses {{encapsulated}} islet cells to build an islet sheet which can be surgically implanted to function as an artificial <b>pancreas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{artificial}} <b>pancreas</b> is {{a technology}} in development {{to help people}} with diabetes automatically control their blood glucose level by providing the substitute endocrine functionality of a healthy <b>pancreas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>pancreas</b> secretes {{substances}} {{which help}} in the digestion of starch and other carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Proteases, the enzymes involved in the digestion of proteins, include trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. The enzyme involved in the digestion of fats is lipase. Amylase, also secreted by the <b>pancreas,</b> breaks down starch (amylum) and other carbohydrates. The <b>pancreas</b> also secretes phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, to {{replicate}} the natural function of the <b>pancreas</b> as closely as possible, an artificial <b>pancreas</b> might someday replace all of the beneficial endocrine functions lost, including the delivery of insulin, amylin, glucagon, and C-peptide.|$|E
25|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and about 50% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal <b>pancreas.</b> Less than 100 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the <b>pancreas.</b> Similar to the salivary glands, most of the <b>pancreas</b> specific genes encode for secreted proteins. Corresponding <b>pancreas</b> specific proteins are either expressed in the exocrine cellular compartment and have functions related to digestion of food uptake such as digestive chymotrypsinogen enzymes and pancreatic lipase PNLIP, or expressed in the various cells of the endocrine pancreatic islets and have functions related to secreted hormones such as insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation {{of cells}} of the <b>pancreas</b> {{proceeds}} through two different pathways, corresponding to the dual endocrine and exocrine functions of the <b>pancreas.</b> In progenitor {{cells of the}} exocrine <b>pancreas,</b> important molecules that induce differentiation include follistatin, fibroblast growth factors, and activation of the Notch receptor system. Development of the exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages. These are the predifferentiated, protodifferentiated, and differentiated stages, which correspond to undetectable, low, {{and high levels of}} digestive enzyme activity, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Other common causes include trauma, {{autoimmune}} disease, {{high blood}} calcium, hypothermia, and {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). <b>Pancreas</b> divisum is a common congenital malformation of the <b>pancreas</b> that may underlie some recurrent cases. Diabetes mellitus type2 {{is associated with a}} 2.8-fold higher risk.|$|E
