5|$|The Baltimore County Planning Commission first {{conceived}} the Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway project in 1949; by 1953 the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{taken over by}} the state due to slow progress at the county level. The <b>project</b> <b>was</b> included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available.|$|E

5|$|After a first {{interruption}} in development, the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> redefined as a short interactive demo for Windows-based personal computers. New team members, including professional {{artists and}} designers, were recruited for the demo, which would feature ten scenes from Chrono Trigger {{and most of}} its playable characters. In 2004, the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> publicly closed after Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games for trademark and copyright infringement. Despite its closure, the project has received critical and popular praise.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main {{scenario writer}} Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become}} a fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E

5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement <b>project</b> <b>was</b> estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction <b>project</b> <b>was</b> over double the original bid of $5.7million, {{due in part to}} the work delays.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, {{who wanted}} to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the film}} began in 1993 before the novel was published. Mike Nichols {{purchased}} the film rights, and the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> picked up by Savoy Pictures.

5|$|Development of the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{closely tied}} to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006.
