40|$|This paper {{examines}} the returns earned by subscribing to initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity. K. Rock (1986) suggests that initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity returns {{are required by}} uninformed investors as compensation for the risk of trading against superior information. The authors show that initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity with more informed investor capital require higher returns. The marketing underwriter's reputation reveals the expected level of "informed" activity. Prestigious underwriters are associated with lower risk offerings. With less risk there is less incentive to acquire information and fewer informed investors. Consequently, prestigious underwriters are associated with initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> of equity that have lower returns. Copyright 1990 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of setup costs on the pricing of {{investment}} banking services. The existence of setup costs is predicted to result in lower underwriter spreads in initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> for firms {{that are expected to}} issue again. Consistent with this prediction, the author finds significantly lower spreads for firms that make subsequent issues. He also finds that a firm's likelihood of changing underwriters in a subsequent offer is related to the time between offerings and the underwriter's pricing performance in the initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings.</b> These results suggest that the deviations from optimal initial <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> pricing carry a penalty for the underwriter.
