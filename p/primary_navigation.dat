2500|$|Android devices boot to the homescreen, the <b>primary</b> <b>navigation</b> and {{information}} [...] "hub" [...] on Android devices, {{analogous to the}} desktop found on personal computers. Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen. A homescreen may {{be made up of}} several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth. Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen, and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone. Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.|$|E
2500|$|F deck was {{the topmost}} deck, housing the ship's bridge. Berths for {{officers}} occupied {{most of this}} deck, but a children's playroom was in the aft starboard corner. The ship's lifeboats were also on this deck. E deck was the middle deck of the ship's superstructure. Most of E Deck consisted of first class cabins. The Drawing Room near the front had a row of windows said to [...] "rival those of Atlantic liners of the time". Aft of the Drawing Room a first-class promenade surrounded nearly the entire interior of the deck. The Bar, Smoking Room and Writing Room were further astern, past the first class cabins. Aft of the public rooms were the outdoor first class swimming pool and lido deck area. The interior of D deck also primarily consisted of first class cabins, many with private balconies. Cabine de Luxe #5, with a separate bedroom and sitting room, was on the forward starboard portion of the deck and was the most luxuriant single berth on the ship. The back portion contained [...] "studio" [...] class cabins that were narrower and smaller than the other first class rooms. The deck also had the forecastle {{of the ship and}} the <b>primary</b> <b>navigation</b> equipment. Aft of the fo'c'sle was a third class outdoor area. Aft of the private balconies of the interior first class cabins was a second promenade deck.|$|E

50|$|Initially, war {{shortages}} of VHF radio equipment prevented the system from being widely deployed. The first operational {{installation of a}} VAR was in Matawan, New Jersey in 1944. By 1948, the Civil Aeronautics Authority had built 68 VAR installations on various federal airways across the United States. Quickly overtaken by the more advanced VOR system, VARs never replaced LFR as the <b>primary</b> airway <b>navigation</b> system of the United States. The last VAR was decommissioned in 1960.|$|R
40|$|Provision of GNSS Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) {{architectures}} has {{the potential}} to provide an integrity-augmented SAA solution suitable for cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios where GNSS is used as the <b>primary</b> source of <b>navigation</b> and/or surveillance data (e. g, employing ADS-B). In this paper, we evaluate the opportunities offered by this integration, proposing a novel architecture that maximizes the synergies between ABIA and SAA functionalities in UAV applications. The performance of this Integrity-Augmented SAA (IAS) architecture was evaluated by simulating manned/unmanned platforms with different dynamics in representative cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IAS architecture is capable of performing high-integrity conflict detection and resolution when GNSS is used as the <b>primary</b> source of <b>navigation</b> and/or surveillance data...|$|R
5000|$|Away {{from the}} beaches, Yell Sound is little used for {{recreational}} purposes, possibly {{due to the}} relatively high volume of tonnage accessing Sullom Voe.

[...] Inertial navigation continues to be used on military aircraft despite the advent of GPS because GPS signal jamming and spoofing are relatively simple operations.|$|E
50|$|Less-expensive {{navigation}} systems, {{intended for}} use in automobiles, may use a vibrating structure gyroscope to detect changes in heading, and the odometer pickup to measure distance covered along the vehicle's track.
