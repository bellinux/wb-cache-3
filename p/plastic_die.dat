40|$|Abstract. The thermal {{parameters}} of 3 Cr 2 Mo <b>plastic</b> <b>die</b> steel were tested. The temperature fields of 3 Cr 2 Mo <b>plastic</b> <b>die</b> steel with the thickness 120 mm were calculated and analyzed under two quenching processes. The {{results showed that}} for interrupted process the cooling velocity was faster when the temperature was more than 500 ℃, which {{was not in the}} transformation zone of bainite and martensite. And the fast cooling rate effectively avoided the pearlite appearance. When the temperature was less than 500 ℃, the cooling velocity under interrupted cooing process was slower, which avoided the big microstructure stress. So for the 3 Cr 2 Mo <b>plastic</b> <b>die</b> steel with the thickness 120 mm, the interrupted process was better. In the paper, the hardness was tested after interrupted cooling process and tempering. The tempering hardness difference was {{less than or equal to}} 3 HRC. The study provided references for large <b>plastic</b> <b>die</b> steel on-line pre-hardening process formulation and optimization...|$|E

Pre-hardening <b>plastic</b> <b>die</b> steel can be {{directly}} processed into the mold, and it doesn’t need quenching and tempering again, which avoids quenching deformation and ensures the size precision of the mold.

In the paper, a new on-line quenching device was introduced, and the temperature field calculation model of 3 Cr 2 NiMo die steel was established. The cooling technology of three typical thickness steel plates was studied. The results provided the theoretical basis for die steel production...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{cutting force}} {{prediction}} in end milling {{plays an important}} role in studying the characteristics of milling to improve the machining quality and optimize the machining processes. To this end, a new method that improves cutting force prediction accuracy by considering cutting process dynamics and simplifies the process of computing the dynamic chip thickness is presented in this paper. The static chip thickness is calculated and the cutting process dynamics is taken into account in this method. To ensure the result accuracy and improve computing efficiency, Taylor’s series is adopted to acquire static chip thickness. Meanwhile, as feedback, the dynamic chip thickness caused by the cutter-workpiece system subjected to the cutting force is superposed on static chip thickness to get more accurate cutting force. Finally, the proposed method by dint of closed-loop system to acquire more accurate cutting force is experimentally validated in milling of <b>plastic</b> <b>die</b> steel NAK 80 with a four fluted flat-end milling cutter. Cutting force coefficients and modal parameters are identified based on the experiment. Both the simulations with and without considering dynamics show good agreement with the experimental result while considering dynamics leads to closer agreement...|$|E

Packaging also provides ease of handling and protection for assembly operations. This chapter defines chip, or die-level, and assembly-level packaging, {{with an emphasis on}} recent technologies.

The chip package provides an electrical interconnection to the assembly, module, or display and protects the chip in the manufacturing and application environments. A number of different materials can be used in the die package, including ceramics, plastics, and metals.

40|$|The FluidForming {{technology}} {{represents an}} alternative {{sheet metal forming}} approach {{as compared to the}} traditional, bladder based hydroforming, metal spinning, and sheet metal stamping processes. The machine construction allows for much higher forming pressures of up to 400 [*]MPa/ 60, 000 psi. The technology also enables material flow into the dies, thus, providing more material in potentially critical areas. Modular die construction allows for very cost effective solutions including <b>plastic</b> <b>dies,</b> 3 D printed dies, die nesting, and split dies. This approach, in-turn, allows undercuts in the parts and generates scratch- and mostly distortion-free parts from pre-painted, pre-patterned, and pre-polished materials like AL, SS, CU, TI or any of the new high performance alloys. As a result, the technology enables a new product development approach that can focus on optimization and/or Time-to-Market while maintaining or lowering the overall Cost-to-Market. In fact, the development cycle can be accelerated to be less than a week from the CAD design to the production of highly accurate, repeatable metal parts that may not even be manufacturable with other technologies...|$|R

50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a {{cryogenic process}} used to remove burrs and flash from <b>plastic</b> and <b>die</b> cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber.

40|$|Die drool {{phenomenon}} {{is defined as}} unwanted spontaneous accumulation of extruded <b>plastics</b> on <b>die</b> exit face(s) of extrusion <b>die</b> during <b>plastics</b> extrusion process. Such accumulated material builds up on die exit face(s) and frequently or continually sticks onto the extruded product and by this way reduces {{the quality of the}} product. When the die drool appears, the extrusion process must be shut down and the die exit face(s) must be manually cleaned, which is time consuming as well as money consuming. Die drool has been observed from the beginning of plastics extrusion and the first published remark about it was made in 1946. For a long time it was considered as only an engineering problem and even if a wide range of suppressing ideas based on modification of extrusion <b>dies,</b> <b>plastics</b> materials, and processing conditions have already been patented, its source remained unclear. During the last few years, a number of experimental as well as theoretical research papers focusing on its fundamental nature have been published. Nowadays, die drool is considered as a fundamental rheological phenomenon. The force which drives the building up of extruded <b>plastics</b> on <b>die</b> exit face(s) is negative pressure (suction) occurring in the die exit edge(s) region where the free surface of the extruded plastics is created. Moreover, two different die drool types (external and internal) exist. The formation mechanisms of external/internal die drool are based on negative pressure occurring in the die exit region together with deformation of free extrudate surface/material separation wherever inside the extrusion equipment, respectively. From the processing point of view, the internal die drool is much more problematic than the external one, primarily due to a higher build up rate and compact shapes of the accumulated drool mass. Two theories of internal die drool formation mechanism based on wall slip theories (flow-induced molecular weight fractionation and stress-induced cohesive chain disentanglement) have been recently proposed and tested. In this historically ordered review, breakthrough works in the field of die drool research are presented, many ways to suppress it are shown, techniques for its quantitative evaluation and experimental methods for its analytical investigation are introduced, external and internal die drool types are explained, and theories of external as well as internal die drool formation mechanism are presented and discussed in depth, which can be especially helpful for plastics extrusion experts {{as well as for the}} rheological community. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

The investigation results show that there are chances for replacing the conventional dielectric with water and that would imply considerable economic and ecology advantages. 1.

In 1902 he came upon a sidewalk sale offering some sheets of tortoise shell colored cellulose nitrate <b>plastic</b> and <b>dies,</b> and eventually he would discover that the small pieces of celluloid he punched out with the dies were ideal for picking stringed instruments. From the 1920s through the 1950s, D'Andrea Manufacturing would dominate the world's international pick market, providing to major businesses such as Gibson, Fender, and Martin. One of the main reasons celluloid was so popular as guitar pick material was that it very closely imitated the sound and flexibility of a tortoise shell guitar pick. The practice of using Hawksbill turtles for their shells would become illegal in 1973 as a provision of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), forcing musicians to find something else to pick with.|$|R
