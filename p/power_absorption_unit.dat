It is based on literature data on dielectric properties of DNA solutions and nucleoplasm. In skeletal muscle cells, the specific absorption rate (SAR) ratio between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm is found to be larger than one for CNA above 30 mg/ml. A nearly linear relationship is found between CNA and this nucleocytoplasmic SAR ratio. Considering the nanoscale of the layer of condensed counterions and bound water molecules at the NA-solution interface, the <b>power</b> <b>absorption</b> per <b>unit</b> volume is evaluated at this precise location.

In the first part of the review, most common processes that can be used to produce water are discussed. Humidification and De-Humidification (H & DH) appears to be very popular to produce water in small quantities. The literature reviews cover different H & DH techniques in which air is used as a medium to carry water in the form of vapor. In this paper, appropriate techniques reviewed include the usage of passive and active systems, which are operated with or without the support of solar energy. Use of fog harvesting, and thermo-electric module are also discussed in brief. A concept of producing water from a SWRO plant with wind power is also discussed.

Traditionally, chassis dynamometer is used to measuring power delivered from Vehicle Under Test (VUT) typically by Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle which access power by unidirectional. This one-way power delivery becomes a limitation for advanced EV with the regenerative braking feature, which the kinetic power of the vehicles is converted into electrical power. To test and measure this capability, a new chassis dynamometer is needed where the power delivery must be bidirectional. With that intention, this study proposes the usage of half-bridge bidirectional DC–DC converter (HBDC) as the <b>Power</b> <b>Absorption</b> and Delivery <b>Unit</b> (PADU) for a DC machine based dynamometer. PADU is controlled by modified Hysteresis Current Controller (HCC) and PID controller. The modified HCC and PID control power flow direction; back and forth during testing. The testing includes normal condition and regenerative braking condition. In normal condition, power is delivered by the DC machine whereas in regenerative braking condition, power is absorbed by the DC machine. Several test cases are considered; inclination test, declination test, normal drive condition, brake condition and stop condition. It is found that the HBDC successfully control the power flow in both normal condition and regenerative braking condition. As compared to conventional HBDC, modified HBDC reduces conduction loss with up to 28. 21 % reduction and switching loss with up to 7. 69 % reduction. To evaluate the power flow control, several power measurement points are taken in the simulation and comprehensive results are presented.
