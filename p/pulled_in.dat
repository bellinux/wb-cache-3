5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be <b>pulled</b> <b>in.</b> Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are <b>pulled</b> <b>in.</b> The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A Fixed – Fixed RF MEMS switch {{has been}} {{simulated}} for various air gaps and the {{variation of the}} electrical performance {{in accordance with the}} air gap has been studied. The switch was simulated and the <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> voltages for different air gaps were practically determined by electrostatic analysis using IntelliSuite software. Subsequently, the theoretical values were determined analytically and the values were found to be closely matching with less than 2 % error. The <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltage was found to be 9. 78 V for an air gap of 1. 5 µm and increased to 51. 36 V for an air gap of 4. 5 µm. However, the insertion loss was at – 0. 5522 dB for an air gap of 1. 5 µm at 60 GHz and smaller insertion losses was achieved only with larger air gaps. These investigations showed that large compromise on electrical performance is required for lower <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltage which is essential for the use of these switches in mobile applications. Considering these difficulties the authors have proposed a varying section fixed – fixed beam switches that can be designed to give lower <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltages even for larger air gaps. Therefore these proposed switches can ensure superior electrical performance along with low <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> voltages...|$|R

5|$|The show's 2000 and 2004 {{election}} coverage, {{combined with}} a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and The Daily Show to new levels of popularity and critical respect. Since Stewart became host, the show has won 23 Primetime Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards, and its ratings steadily increased. In 2003, the show was averaging nearly a million viewers, an increase of nearly threefold since the show's inception as Comedy Central became available in more households. By September 2008, the show averaged nearly two million viewers per night. Senator Barack Obama's interview on October 29, 2008, <b>pulled</b> <b>in</b> 3.6million viewers.|$|E

5|$|You Don't Know Jack is a 2011 {{video game}} of the party genre {{released}} by various home consoles and handhelds based on the series of You Don't Know Jack games. The game was developed by Jellyvision Games and published by THQ, and was released in North America on February 8, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS platforms. It is the first title in the series released by Jellyvision after an eight-year hiatus, taking advantage of online connectivity and other features of modern gaming consoles. A single player iOS port was released about two months later, but was later <b>pulled</b> <b>in</b> anticipation of a more robust client based on the Facebook version of the game.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is <b>pulled</b> <b>in).</b>|$|E
5|$|Believing the German {{attacks on}} 29 June {{indicated}} more counter-attacks {{for the following}} day, Dempsey reinforced the Odon bridgehead with a brigade of the 43rd division and <b>pulled</b> <b>in</b> its perimeter. The 159th Infantry Brigade of the 11th Armoured Division was placed {{under the command of}} the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division and acceding to O’Connor’s wishes for additional infantry, Dempsey attached the newly arrived 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division to VIII Corps; the lead brigade arrived near the Epsom start line during the night. To hold Hill 112, it was necessary hold Évrecy and Hill 113 for which there were insufficient troops and Dempsey ordered the 29th Armoured Brigade to abandon the hill. To hold the area between Rauray and the Odon, Dempsey withdrew the 29th Armoured Brigade north across the river after dark, ready for the expected German offensive.|$|E
5|$|Boudreau placed Gromek in the {{starting}} rotation to begin the 1949 Cleveland Indians season, giving the team a big four of Feller, Bob Lemon, Gene Bearden, and Gromek, who had spent the past year working on his curveball to help him improve on his 1948 season. In his first start of the season, he allowed two hits in an 8–2 victory against the Browns. By the end of May, he had an ERA of 2.80, which was among the lowest on the team, but only had a 2–4 record {{to show for it}} {{due to a lack of}} run support; the four losses included both a 1–0 and 2–0 defeat. With the increased productivity of Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Gromek fell out of favor with Boudreau, and he was moved primarily to relief duty. After being <b>pulled</b> <b>in</b> the second inning in a July 16 start against the Athletics, he was kept as a reliever the rest of the year. Gromek finished the season with four wins, six losses, and a 3.33 ERA in 92 innings over 27 games, 12 of them starts.|$|E
