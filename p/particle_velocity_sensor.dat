This method was originally developed out of operational necessity in order to enable seismic surveys to be conducted in areas with obstructions, such as production platforms, without having the compromise the resultant image quality. [...] Ocean bottom cables (OBC) are also extensively used in other areas that a seismic vessel cannot be used, for example in shallow marine (water depth <300m) and transition zone environments, and can be deployed by ROVs in deep water when repeatability is valued (see 4D, below). Conventional OBC surveys use dual-component receivers, combining a pressure sensor (hydrophone) and a vertical <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> (vertical geophone), but more recent developments have expanded the method to use four-component sensors i.e. a hydrophone and three orthogonal geophones. Four-component sensors have the advantage of being able to also record shear waves, which do not travel through water but can still contain valuable information.|$|E

The <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> may be realized in hardware by two «pressure sensors» (of isotropic directivity) displaced in space, and by computing the spatial first-order finite {{difference between the}} data of the two isotropic component-sensors. As each component-sensor's data are degraded by additive noises (modeled here with much generality as stochastically distributed as «stable» (a. k. a. «alpha stable» or « alpha stable»), and not restricted to being Gaussian), the <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> as a whole would also experience noise, the statistics of which is analytically derived here.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are often}} {{required in the}} automotive industry to optimize not only the acoustic performance, but also the durability and crash behaviour of cars. Therefore, validating the model when a prototype is built is remarkably important for improving the current design. Most conventional updating techniques for adjusting the acoustic numerical models inside the cabin use microphones located at different reference positions to compare predictions with real measurements. However, sound pressure is a scalar quantity which does not give information about the often unknown excitation distribution across the structure. This problem can also be addressed by using <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> close to the radiating surfaces due to their vector nature. In this paper, the use of <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> for updating and validating acoustic models is studied.

The advent of <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> {{as a viable}} addition to traditional pressure-based sensors in acoustics has fueled considerable research into the additional capabilities they might bring. Previous thesis work performed at NPS successfully demonstrated a working acoustic beamformer using a hybrid array comprised of a single conventional omnidirectional microphone and two 3 D Microflown Ultimate Sound Probes in an anechoic chamber. These Microflown sensors are vector sensors. They have integrated directionality through the inclusion of three orthogonal <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> with a microphone. Unfortunately, the signals of the <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> obtained outside in a light, gusting wind were unusable due to broadband noise. Since the fundamental limit to detecting quiet targets depends on the noise floor, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to perform an in situ measurement of the pressure equivalent noise floor of all sensors in the array and to minimize the wind noise. Noise levels measured in an anechoic chamber were 915 dB higher than the levels expected from the sensors alone. The additional noise is attributed to the data acquisition equipment. The use of an ACO WS 7 windscreen was shown to be extremely effective in mitigating broadband wind noise. ME 5, Republic of Singapore Nav...|$|R

From the output voltage of the probe microflown and the LDA-derived particle velocity in a standing wave, the sensitivity of the microflown is obtained.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} realization of two-dimensional acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> based on thermal convection. The sensors are {{of the order of}} 1 mm× 1 mm and consist of two crossing wires with each wire sensing the acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> in the direction parallel to it. Their small size allows the measurement of <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> with high spacial resolution and minimal disturbance of the sound field. Due to the inherent geometry of the design, the sensors have equal sensitivity in both directions and polar patterns exactly orthogonal to each other. Therefore, no calibration is required. Sensors with varying electrical and mechanical properties were designed, fabricated and characterized. The results give insight in the optimum sensor configuration as well as the influence of each aspect {{on the quality of the}} sensor in terms of sensitivity, bandwidth and power consumption. The influence of oscillatory boundary layer effects on the performance of the sensor was studied in more detail and lead to a sensor design optimized for low frequency measurements. The impact of metal films on the performance of the crossed-wires <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> was studied. This new insight resulted in the fabrication of sensors with higher sensitivity across the entire bandwidth, better reproducibility and long term stability. Experiments in liquid environment show that this design is also suitable for the measurement of <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> in such environments. While further investigation is needed to optimize the design for underwater measurements, the current results are very promising. The devices are smaller and mechanically more robust than existing parallel-wires <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors.</b> This allows for higher resistance against drag forces during high intensity measurements, harsh fabrication steps and, consequently, higher fabrication yield. Contrary to the fabrication method used for previous versions of <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> which relied on dicing, the crossed-wires design allows a break-out method to be used for separating the chips from the wafers. This technique is faster, cheaper and less harsh on the sensors hence further increasing yield. These sensors require only four electrical connections to the external electrical circuit reducing assembly time and thus also costs. In conclusion, the design proves to be versatile and highly customizable allowing it to be tailored to applications with specific requirements in regard to sensitivity, mechanical robustness, power consumption and frequency region of interest...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedAcoustic measurements have traditionally relied exclusively on sound pressure sensors. This research investigated {{the performance of}} Microflown 3 D hybrid pressure and acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> in a linear array. Each Microflown sensor has three output channels proportional to the acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> in the three, nominally orthogonal, directions {{in addition to an}} output from an omnidirectional pressure microphone. The linear array was formed with a conventional omnidirectional microphone as the center element and two Microflown sensors located 17. 2 cm away on either side. The Microflown acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> channels were characterized first by the amplitude and phase relationship of their transfer functions relative to their co-located pressure microphone. The transfer function between the Microflown pressure hydrophones and the conventional center microphone was also measured. This enabled the amplitude and phase of all channels to be expressed relative to the center microphone signal. Beamforming was carried out in the frequency domain by applying the appropriate weight and phase delay for the desired steer angle. The bandwidth of the beamformer was limited from about 300 Hz to 1. 5 kHz. At lower frequencies, insufficient signal to noise limited the coherence required to establish the transfer functions while at higher frequencies the phase of the <b>particle</b> <b>velocity</b> transfer functions grew increasingly sensitive to orientation angle. Experiments carried out in the Naval Postgraduate School Anechoic Chamber using single and multiple acoustic sources compared extremely well to the theoretical performance.
