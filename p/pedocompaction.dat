40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} aimed at {{evaluation}} of anthropogenic changes in three selected subtypes of Chernozems. Object of study were [...] Luvi-haplic Chernozem (Praha), Luvi-haplic Chernozem (Unčovice) and Calcaric Chernozem (Velešovice). We followed [...] aggregates stability, texture, porosity, bulk density, total organic carbon content, soil reaction and buffering capacity. Results showed that studied heavy textured soils had high ability to <b>pedocompaction.</b> Agro-ecological limits were overstepped in Porosity, bulk density and total content organic carbon decreased. Exchangeable soil reaction also decreased and soil acidity increased. Buffering capacity again acids was also lower. Critical limits of <b>pedocompaction</b> were not overstepped but in subsoil horizons values were near to the limits...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis "Selected parameters of soil quality in Chernozems" was to determine soil physical, chemical, and biological soil properties in Luvic Chernozem (Praha - Ruzyně) and Calcaric Chernozem (Velešovice). Results showed that soils were influenced by anthropogenic activities. We determined increasing of <b>pedocompaction,</b> soil acidity, and decreasing of phosphorus. Basal soil respiration was low...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{bachelor}} thesis " Monitoring of degradation {{changes in}} Chernozems as affected by intensive land use" {{was to compare}} selected physical and chemical soil properties of Luvi-haplic Chernozem (Unčovice), Calcaric Chernozem (Velešovice) and Haplic Chernozem (Hrušovany na Jevišovkou). Results showed decreasing of aggregates stability, porosity, total organic carbon and humic substances content and quality, and cation exchange capacity. On the other hand increasing of bulk density and <b>pedocompaction</b> was determined. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} humic substances content and quality and in pedocompation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} division, growing and {{importance}} of various types of forage crops {{in relation to the}} erosion threat of soils in the Czech Republic. The first part focuses on the evaluation of the causes and course of degradation of soils in the present and the subsequent development of land in terms of expected climate change. The most serious degradation factors include <b>pedocompaction,</b> dehumification, occupation of land, poor infiltration, water and wind erosion. Only on account of water erosion, 42 % of agricultural land in the Czech Republic is at risk. In another part of the thesis the importance of various species of legumes, permanent grassland, wide rowed crops and their impact on soil erosion hazard is given. Last but not least, the work summarizes the organizational, technical and agro-technical erosion control measures. They are characterized by the possibility of their use, effectiveness and ambitiousness...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{different}} types of soil degradation under the conditions in the Czech Republic. The first part {{is focused on the}} evaluation of the causes and course of degradation of soils in the present time. Among the most serious degradation factors may be included the following: <b>pedocompaction,</b> dehumification, land appropriation, bad infiltration, water and wind erosion. In the Czech Republic, only water erosion alone threatens 42 % of all agricultural land. In the thesis organisational, technical and agrotechnical anti-erosion control measures are summarised. Their utilisation, efficiency and sophistication are also described. In the next part of the thesis there are six specific land blocks in the same farm in South Bohemia presented. Each of these blocks has a different acreage, the average slope, the crops cultivated and different representation of strongly threatened and moderately erosion-threatened vulnerable areas. The thesis evaluates the number of plants per 1 sq. m, the condition and density of the growth due to the erosive threat to all of these localities...|$|E
