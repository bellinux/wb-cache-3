5|$|Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a {{party and}} asked him to do the film. He read the {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E
5|$|O'Farrell's {{replacement}} {{was to be}} Scotland coach, Tommy Docherty. Docherty {{left the}} Scotland job and his first task at United {{was to keep the}} club in the top flight. He managed it once, but he was unable to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> again and the club was relegated in 1973–74. They bounced straight back up the following season, though, and in their first season back in the top flight, the team cruised to a third-place finish and yet another FA Cup final. The next year, they went one better, beating Liverpool in the final to claim his first and only trophy at Old Trafford. It was soon discovered, however, that Docherty {{was having an affair with}} the wife of the club's physiotherapist, and he was immediately fired, replaced by Queens Park Rangers' manager Dave Sexton.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{the same}} play {{was made into}} a two-hour {{television}} movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested Lee J. Cobb and Bing Crosby for the role of Columbo, but Cobb was unavailable and Crosby turned it down because he felt it would take too much time away from the golf links. Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk, who wanted the role, could <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind.|$|E

25|$|The Brachiosauridae are {{composed}} of quadrupedal dinosaurs that are generally very large, {{with the exception of}} the possible insular dwarf Europasaurus. The brachiosaurids can be distinguished from other macronarian taxa by their broad, thick and spoon-shaped teeth. Their maxillary teeth were twisted apically, at the top, and the shape of these teeth was optimal for biting off resistant vegetation. While brachiosaurids, like other sauropods, did not perform significant food processing in their mouths, their teeth enabled them to slice through food instead of having to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> of tree branches. Evidence for this precision shearing consists of apical wear facets on the teeth and distinctive bone structure that suggests orthal, vertical, jaw action.|$|E
25|$|The two leads, Hansard and Irglová, {{are both}} {{professional}} musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead {{to be played}} by actor Cillian Murphy, who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy was {{also going to be}} one of the film's producers. But Murphy declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old) and also felt that he hadn't the vocal capabilities to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film The Commitments, the story of a Dublin soul music cover band. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.|$|E
500|$|Next, Naseeruddin Shah {{was cast}} as an ageing South Indian superstar with [...] "hideous wigs, dark glasses and painted-on mustaches". He {{performed}} a [...] "fast dance number" [...] in the film, a full 22 {{years after he}} last {{did it in the}} song [...] "Tirchi Topiwale" [...] from Tridev (1989). Regarding his character, Ekta Kapoor stated, [...] "This role requires him to play to the gallery, provoke claps, laughs, and whistles and I know he can <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> because Naseer is the Shah of all actors." [...] Luthria added, [...] "Expect a man who unabashedly enjoys the flesh of women".|$|E

500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd {{wrote in}} 2016 that [...] "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" [...] and accuse it of {{harboring}} a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze {{the substance of}} the claim, but did opine that the Times is [...] "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> all the time? No." ...|$|E

500|$|Scully {{has noted}} that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} {{discussion}} about making sure we [...] did deal with some of the emotional ramifications of death [...] and not just make it all joke, joke, joke. But at the same time, we're a comedy, they're animated, they're not real." [...] In one of the first scripts for the episode there was a scene in which Rod and Todd discuss their mother's death. However, according to Maxtone-Graham, the writing staff decided to cut it because [...] "it just never played anything but sad." [...] He added that the writers [...] "really wanted to address how [...] would feel" [...] but they [...] "could never <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without it just being sad." [...] Scully has commented that it was a [...] "very sweet scene" [...] but it was too difficult to [...] "get out of it comedically to the next scene." ...|$|E
500|$|After Homer {{realizes that}} he is [...] "slow", Marge {{recommends}} that he take an adult education course at the annex center. Down at the center, however, Homer changes his mind and decides to become a teacher. He talks to the administrator and accepts an opening to teach a class on having a successful marriage. Despite being confident that he can <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> he is frightened {{on his first day}} and is unable to help his pupils with their relationship problems. The class collectively gets up to leave, but when Homer mentions his conversation with Marge in bed, the class decides to stay, eager to hear gossip. Marge soon discovers that everyone in town knows her personal secrets, reacting by confronting Homer about it and he promises to stop. He instead continues telling her secrets anyway. Homer then takes the night off teaching class by having his class observe the family over dinner.|$|E
500|$|The first {{ship was}} begun in November 1951 {{and the other}} two {{followed}} in 1952. By this time Stalin's support was the main impetus behind the ships and little time was wasted cancelling them after his death on 5 March 1953. Stalingrads hull was ordered to be used for weapons tests while the two other ships were scrapped where they lay. The hull was launched in 1954 after it was modified to suit its new role. It was towed from Nikolayev to Sevastopol in 1955, but it grounded at the entrance to Sevastopol Bay. Initial attempts to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the rocks by brute force failed, and the capsizing of the battleship [...] further delayed salvage work, so that she was not freed until mid-1956. She served as a target for the first generation of Soviet anti-ship missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing weapons before she was scrapped in the early 1960s.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{called the}} battle {{sequence}} [...] "remarkable", {{even though the}} series had already included several space battles. Moore felt {{they were not going}} to top the previous ones, but the visual effects team were able to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> as [...] "the best battle sequence we've ever done." [...] A scene cut from the teaser's battle sequence showed Samuel Anders aiming his Viper's guns at Diana Seelix's ship after discovering his Cylon nature. Another Anders cut scene focused on cutting the cast off his leg, due to the absence of his leg injury sustained from [...] "The Son Also Rises". With Baltar's storyline, the writers refer to the rooms used by his cult as [...] "Baltar's lair". Also, as the writers were aware that Baltar himself was visually similar to Jesus, Moore points out that he is not Jesus, though he admitted that the visual similarities help to [...] "drive some things home".|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Dirty Sexy Money actor Seth Gabel had been {{cast as the}} lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character.

[...] In an interview with TV Guide, Gabel commented that during shooting {{he felt that he}} looked [...] "like such a doofus holding a gun," [...] but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, [...] "I was so scared that I wouldn't <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Once I saw myself being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, I felt more confident and relaxed." [...] His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a Chicago Tribune interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has [...] "special technology than can heal burns".|$|E
500|$|... "The Magicks of Megas-tu" [...] {{was first}} {{broadcast}} on NBC on October27, 1973. Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, {{in their book}} Trek Navigator (1998), consider [...] "The Magicks of Megas-tu" [...] {{to be one of}} the best animated episodes. They explained that while it was quite ambitious and heady for a Saturday morning children's program, [...] "it's somehow appropriate that Star Trek is able to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> successfully." [...] They compared this episode to the live action Star Trek episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren" [...] where Kirk and his crew also gain superpowers, saying it was [...] "a better episode, as Kirk pleads humanity's case to the Megans." [...] They highlighted that the episode depicts Kirk successfully defending Lucifer from banishment and noting that he will not fall prey to legendary superstitions and at the end of the episode following Kirk's successful defense. They gave the episode three out of four stars.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the seasons}} progressed, and the {{character}} began to grow darker and more sinister, Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene, either with physical subtleties like little smiles at key moments, or [...] "self-deprecating humor". One such instance, which became popular with audiences, was in the season six episode [...] "Justice", where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail. The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue, but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> To Rosenbaum, this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person, because {{it is well known}} that Lex always wanted hair. This moment reflects an earlier episode, where Lex reveals his feelings of meagerness when comparing himself to Clark. In season five's [...] "Lockdown", Lex provides a window into his thoughts about his place in Smallville. As writer Steven S. DeKnight describes it, the audience gets to see a moment where Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider, and that he views Clark as this [...] "perfect person". DeKnight believes that, from how Clark sees it, Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has, like his family and girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reception}} of the album was positive. Stephen Holden of Blender called Wainwright's tribute [...] "a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled {{the spirit of the}} ultimate gay icon", and declared the album was [...] "as good an introduction to the great American songbook as any". Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote that Wainwright [...] "elegantly outdoes [...] on a couple of the ballads" [...] and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, [...] "who turns in a stunning, showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show". In his review for Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau stated it was [...] "a relief to hear him essay the show tunes and Tin Pan Alley chestnuts of this tribute album". Furthermore, he wrote that the songs [...] "expand [...] melodic compass", allowing him to [...] "bring something new to them too – namely, sexuality in the sensuality as opposed to gender-preference sense". Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine had positive comments about the album: [...] "That Wainwright has the temerity to cover such a bona fide classic—and the chops to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without breaking a limb or his brain—speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities." ...|$|E
