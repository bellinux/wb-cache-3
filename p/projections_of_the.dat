Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Nemegtomaia was deep, narrow, and short (compared {{to the rest}} of the body), and reached 179mm (7in) in length. It had a {{well-developed}} crest, formed by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the crest formed an almost 90degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other oviraptorids, the nasal processes (<b>projections)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above (where they connected with the nasal bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the orbit (eye opening) was 52mm (2in); the eyes looked large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two fenestrae (openings); a large antorbital fenestra at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. Nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the frontal bone on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull.|$|E

5|$|The tip of {{the upper}} jaw is beak-like and {{separated}} from {{the remainder of the}} jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by ligament, chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for shearing chitin and bone. Fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago. The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw bone. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones. The brain of Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} the Coriolis force on {{ballistic}} trajectories {{should not be confused}} with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the Mercator projection. The <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.|$|E
25|$|The virion is pleomorphic; the {{envelope}} {{can occur in}} spherical and filamentous forms. In general, the virus's morphology is spherical with particles 50 to 120 nm in diameter, or filamentous virions 20nm in diameter and 200 to 300 (–3000) nm long. There are some 500 distinct spike-like surface <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> envelope each projecting 10 to 14nm from the surface with some types (i.e. hemagglutinin esterase (HEF)) densely dispersed over the surface, and with others (i.e. hemagglutinin (HA)) spaced widely apart.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} with vectors, the graphical representation {{may be too}} cumbersome. Vectors in an n-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as coordinate vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of n real numbers (n-tuple). These numbers are the coordinates of the endpoint of the vector, {{with respect to a}} given Cartesian coordinate system, and are typically called the scalar components (or scalar <b>projections)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector on the axes of the coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitions}} {{given in}} this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes, like the geodetic latitude, can be extended to define a three-dimensional geographic coordinate system as discussed below. The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used only as intermediate constructs in map <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

The protuberances are feathered due to their preferences for semi-liquid organic matter. They {{are similar to the}} hairy maggot blowfly in appearance but smaller in size. During the pupal stage, the puparium is brown in color and the same shape as the larvae.|$|E

25|$|Roy Park {{has noted}} in {{particular}} Hazlitt's critique of excessive abstraction {{as a major}} flaw in the period’s dominant philosophy and poetry. ("Abstraction", in this case, could be that of religion or mysticism as well as science.) This is the reason, according to Hazlitt, why neither Coleridge, nor Wordsworth, nor Byron could write effective drama. More representative of the finer spirit of the age was poetry that turned inward, focusing on individual perceptions, <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poets' sensibilities.
