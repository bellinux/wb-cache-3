40|$|Abstract Background The {{strength}} of the cement-bone interface in hip arthroplasty is strongly related to cement penetration into the bone. A modified femoral <b>pressuriser</b> has been investigated, designed for closer fitting into the femoral opening to generate higher and more constant cement pressure compared to a commercial (conventional) design. Methods Femoral cementation was performed in 10 Sawbones ® models, five using the modified <b>pressuriser</b> and five using a current commercial <b>pressuriser</b> as a control. Pressure during the cementation was recorded at the proximal and distal regions of the femoral implant. The peak pressure and the pressure-time curves were analysed by student's t-test and Two way ANOVA. Results The modified <b>pressuriser</b> showed significantly and substantially longer durations at higher cementation pressures and slightly, although not statistically, higher peak pressures compared to the conventional <b>pressuriser.</b> The modified <b>pressuriser</b> also produced more controlled cement leakage. Conclusion The modified <b>pressuriser</b> generates longer higher pressure durations in the femoral model. This design modification may enhance cement penetration into cancellous bone and could improve femoral cementation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To compare {{pressures}} {{generated by}} 2 different cement pressurisers at various {{locations in the}} proximal femur. Methods. Two groups of 5 synthetic femurs were used, and 6 pressure sensors {{were placed in the}} femur at 20 -mm intervals proximally to distally.

40|$|Cement {{pressurisation}} is {{an important}} step in total hip arthroplasty that determines the long-term integration at the cement-bone interface. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of a new <b>pressuriser</b> designed by us against the standard existing pressurisers in an in vitro experimental set-up using two parameters: cement penetration and cement pressurisation. A polypropylene cup model was designed to represent the acetabulum. DePuy’s T-handle, Exeter and our own plunger type <b>pressuriser</b> were each tested for cement pressurisation in this acetabular model. Cement penetration and pressures were measured. The cement intrusion into the capillaries with the DePuy <b>pressuriser</b> was found to vary between 2  and 8  mm (mean: 5  mm at the pole and 4. 6  mm at the rim), with the Exeter <b>pressuriser</b> it varied between 3  and 9  mm (mean: 5. 8  mm at the pole and 7. 8  mm at the rim) and with the plunger type <b>pressuriser</b> it varied between 4  and 6  mm (mean 5. 2  mm at the pole and 4. 8  mm at the rim). The peak pressure achieved with the DePuy <b>pressuriser</b> was 60  kPa whereas it was 70  kPa with the plunger type <b>pressuriser.</b> The mean penetration with the plunger type <b>pressuriser</b> was found to be better than the other types.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the fixation strength at {{the interface between}} the Kerboull-type plate and bone cement in 6 experimental conditions. Methods. Experimental materials comprised a simulated acetabular block, a simulated Kerboull-type plate, a <b>pressuriser</b> cover, a <b>pressuriser</b> arm, and bone cement. The simulated Kerboull-type plate {{was placed on the}} simulated acetabular block, with the <b>pressuriser</b> cover. Bone cement was added and the <b>pressuriser</b> arm was inserted. After 6 days of curing, pulling tests were performed to measure the fixation strength at the interface between the plate and the bone cement. Six experimental conditions were evaluated. In condition 1, a 1 -mm plate was used with no gap between the plate and the acetabular block. In condition 2, a 2. 5 -mm plate was used with no gap. In condition 3, a 2. 5 -mm plate was used with a 2 -mm gap. In condition 4, the plate was not used. In condition 5, condition 2 was tested with the model rotated 45 º.

40|$|Most {{mechanical}} {{failures of}} acetabular fixation within {{ten years of}} primary cemented hip replacement are attributable to a failure to achieve good initial fixation of bone and cement. Several {{studies have suggested that}} to achieve good fixation between bone and cement between 3 mm and 5 mm of cement penetration into bone is desirable. Whilst several acetabular cement pressurisation systems exist, {{little is known about the}} effects of cement pressurisation on the pattern of pen-etration of cement into cancellous bone within the pelvis. The current paper assesses the penetration of bone cement into bovine acetabular bone by various pressurisation techniques. We found that pressurisation with the use of a swab in glove or the DePuy <b>pressuriser</b> led to improvement in cement penetration both in terms of maximum depth and also percentage cover of the cup by cement (p < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in mean maximal penetration between the use of the <b>pressuriser</b> and the swab in a glove technique (p = 0. 3). If only a plain cup was used as a <b>pressuriser,</b> the penetration achieved was significantly lower in comparison to use of a <b>pressuriser</b> (p < 0. 02). When compared to previously documented acrylic models, the pattern of intrusion noted in the bovine model was different: penetration was lower at the equatorial and base regions of the acetabulum...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Frequent {{failures}} of the <b>pressuriser</b> heater tubes used in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs) have been found. Axial cracks initiating from the tube outer diameter have been detected in some tubes {{as well as the}} resulting electrical problems. Replacement of the heater tubes requires an undesirably prolonged plant shutdown. In order to better understand these failures a series of residual stress measurements were carried out to obtain the near surface and through-thickness residual stress profiles in a stainless steel <b>pressuriser</b> heater tube. Three different residual stress measurement techniques were employed namely, Deep-Hole Drilling (DHD), Incremental Centre Hole Drilling (ICHD) and Sachs ’ Boring (SB) to measure the through thickness residual stress distribution in the heater tubes. Results showed that the hoop stresses measured using all three techniques were predominantly tensile at all locations, while the axial stresses were found to be tensile at the surface and both tensile and compressive as they reduce to small magnitudes within the tube. The magnitude of the in-plane shear stresses was small at all measurement depths at all locations. The various measurement methods were found to complement each other well. All the measurements revealed a characteristic profile for the through-thickness residual stress distribution...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} process large soil samples {{containing}} potato cyst nematodes, the Seinhorst (1964) cyst elutriator was scaled up to process both sandy and marine-clay soils in batches {{of up to}} 2. 5 kg. Several modifications were implemented. To maintain the required upward current of 3. 01 min¿ 1, an inflow of 8. 01 min¿ 1 was necessary in the enlarged, 7. 5 cm diam. sedimentation tube. Also water inflow is now regulated using a flow meter with <b>pressuriser.</b> Several experiments were undertaken, using artificial sandy soil and marine-clay soil, both naturally infested with potato cyst nematodes.

40|$|PhDWith time, {{the rate}} of {{symptomatic}} acetabular component loosening accelerates and overtakes that of the femoral component as the principal reason for the revision of total hip replacement. In the femur extensive study has shown that cement pressurisation and good preparation of the bone bed improves the survival rate, but acetabular fixation requires further investigation. Production of cement pressure in the acetabulum is anatomically difficult. Pressurisation with conventional and novel designs of cement pressurisers {{has been compared to}} manual techniques and component insertion. The pressurisers increased peak and mean pressures and pressure duration. Finite element modethng of cup insertion showed that flanges and higher insertion rates increased cement penetration into cancellous bone. Per-operatively, one design of <b>pressuriser</b> produced cement pressures comparable to those found in the laboratory. Structural finite element modelling of the natural hip indicated that the subehondral plate and the relatively dense cancellous bone supporting it distribute the joint contact force into the medial and lateral pelvic cortices. A perfectly bonded cemented polyethylene cup stiffened the acetabulum so that more load was transferred directly to the cortices at the acetabular rim, with consequent interface stress concentrations. However, complimentary experimental studies using a dynamic joint simulator and a servo-hydraulic materials testing machine suggested that perfect fixation between cement and bone at the rim was not possible, even under laboratory conditions. Debonding of the cement bone interface at the rim, where dense bone prevents cement interdigitation, allowed micromotion. Since the clinical mechanism of failure of the acetabular component appears to be progressive debonding, from rim to apex, of the cement-bone interface, these studies support the initiation of the failure mechanism by mechanical factors, which may then allow the ingress of wear debris. The experimental studies suggested that the use of pressurisers reduces the amount of micromotion and thus may improve the long term stability of the interface...|$|E
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of small leaks from the primary system of a Nuclear Pressurised Water Reactor. Leak rates of 12 g/s are invariably difficult to detect and locate. The typical leak indicators in a nuclear reactor control room are a drop in pressure and level from the <b>pressuriser,</b> and the air sampler detecting particulate matter. However, {{in both cases the}} leak is normally quite substantial by the time any parameters or values are obviously outside the normal operating conditions. Therefore, a small leak could go undetected for a significant amount of time. As part of the reactor safety studies, {{it is important to have}} more information about small leaks. Due to the lack of small leak data, the solution was to construct a high pressure water rig producing temperatures and pressures close to those experienced in the primary circuit, these being 200 ºC and 100 bar respectively. Pressure is maintained by a vane water pump and heating is achieved by passing a high current through a small diameter, thin walled pipe. To reproduce different size cracks, various size carburettor jets are used. The water on exiting this crack, flashes to steam and immediately meets metallic pipe lagging, which is typical of most primary systems. With the typical crack scenario recreated it is now important to add sensors that will detect conditions associated with a small leak. These sensors are either mounted on or around the lagging material. The parameters that are monitored include vibrations, acoustics, thermal variations, moisture change, air flow and pressure adjustment leaving a predetermined outlet. The sensor outputs are pre-processed and the nonlinear data are applied to an artificial neural network, whereas the other data are applied to a digital logic system. The results showed that with 13 different leak rates, separated by only 1. 4 g/s the ANN was able to correctly differentiate and identify different leak sizes with a certainty of over 97 %. The results from all the analysis are further presented graphically through an Operator Advisory System. This informs the operator of the predicted leak size and location. All of the available sensor data relevant to the leak can be viewed and location of the leak is presented by a three dimensional model of the reactor system.
