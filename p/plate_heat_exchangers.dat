2500|$|<b>Plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{have also}} evolved {{as a result}} of the {{increase}} of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his milking parlor in order to harvest the additional milk. This increase in parlor sizes has resulted in tremendous increases in milk throughput and cooling demand. Today's larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on bulk milk coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE's are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the bulk milk tank.

50|$|To achieve {{improvement}} in PHE's, two important factors namely {{amount of heat}} transfer and pressure drop {{have to be considered}} such that amount of heat transfer needs to be increased and pressure drops need to be decreased.

Therefore, it requires more pumping power than the other types of heat exchangers. Therefore, higher heat transfer and less pressure drop are targeted.

50|$|After the {{extraction}} and tea creaming processes, the tea solution {{is still too}} dilute to pass through a drier. Drying at this point would take too much capital for little gain, and any type of spray or freeze-drying would cause the resulting powder to have too low a density. The answer is to first concentrate the solution to what is usually 40% solids before drying, which involves the removal of water through evaporation. Concentration of tea is normally done through reduction of pressure. At high temperatures, the theaflavins in the solution are converted to thearubigins and carbohydrates caramelize. Forced evaporation systems had hot spots which led to undesirable sensory characteristics such as stewed and burnt flavors. <b>Plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> can cause the desired evaporation at around 45 °C, with short residence times that {{reduce the risk of}} thermal damage.

50|$|However, {{with both}} variable- and constant-flow systems, fully {{automatic}} balancing {{can enhance the}} performance of the HVAC system, eliminating any problems caused by high or excessive system pressures, including noise from the valves and, ultimately, poor control of room temperature. The way the system is balanced will also {{have a major impact on}} energy usage, by minimising pumping costs. In variable-flow systems the use of combination valves, when fitted with a 0 to 10 V, 3 point or thermal motor, integrates the three functions of motorised control valve, differential pressure control valve and a double-regulating valve commissioning set into one product. Applications for this type of product include the control of fan-coil units, chilled beams and air-handling units in variable-volume heating and cooling systems and the control of secondary flow on <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> This integrated approach significantly reduces installation and commissioning costs, since the three control functions are specifically matched to ensure optimum system performance and only one valve has to be mounted in the system instead of three. The problem of high and varying pressure drops across traditional 2-port control valves is also effectively eliminated, ensuring a control-valve authority of 100%. It also saves on space, an important concern in, for example, air handling unit installations where the available plant room space for valve installation is often severely restricted.|$|E

With {{the introduction of new}} HFC refrigerants to replace CFC refrigerants, the understanding and modeling of heat transfer coefficient characteristics is important in designing more efficient evaporators for refrigeration and air conditioning applications. In the present work experimental data for two-phase {{evaporation heat}} transfer of refrigerant R- 134 a in a <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (Yan and Lin, 1999 b) is compared with relevant published correlations (Yan and Lin, 1999 b; Kandlikar, 1991) in order to explore a proposed correlation scheme to best predict the data set. Experimental data for the evaporation heat transfer of refrigerant R- 134 a in a <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> could only be found published by Yan and Lin (1999 b). Their work utilizes a single pass <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> consisting of three plates, to collect two-phase flow data. In the present work, resulting correlations proposed by Yan and Lin (1999 b) are found to have large discrepancies from the data for both a single-phase water-to-water experiment and the two-phase experiment for evaporation heat transfer coefficient of refrigerant R- 134 a in a <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Research of other literature revealed the Kandlikar (1991) model for correlating flow boiling heat transfer in augmented tubes and compact evaporators to have relevance in the present study. In the present work one correlation for the single-phase water-to-water experiment, and two correlation schemes for the two-phase refrigerant R- 134 a experiment are proposed which best fit the experimental data presented by Yan and Lin (1999 b) for the <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The new single-phase correlation provides an accurate prediction to the data. The first proposed two-phase correlation utilizes augmentation factors similar to those proposed by Kandlikar (1991). Results for this correlation are within 17 % of the experimental data. Augmentation factors are ignored in the second proposed two-phase correlation, which predicts the data within 16 %. Both correlations provide better results than the Kandlikar model (Kandlikar, 1991), which predicts the data within 20 % for vapor quality between 0. 2 and 0. 8, and the correlation proposed by Yan and Lin (1999 b), which yields a large discrepancy from the data.
