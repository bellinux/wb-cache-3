50|$|While {{attending}} Colorado’s Holy Cross Abbey, Gulezian studied Joseph Campbell, Carl Jung, and James Joyce, {{who became}} a significant influence on his <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> music, linear time, Roman Catholicism, and temporal reality. While still in high school, Gulezian was introduced to John Fahey through Robbie Basho. After recording his first self-published album Snow on his own Aardvark Records imprint, Gulezian signed to John Fahey’s Takoma Records label. Snow was re-released in 1980 (with minor modifications) to a global audience on Takoma/Chrysalis as Unspoken Intentions. It received international critical acclaim, and established Gulezian as a visionary artist; musicians such as Henry Kaiser and Michael Hedges cited Unspoken Intentions as a major influence. In the midst of Gulezian's accelerating professional success, the Takoma label went bankrupt. Disillusioned with the music industry, Gulezian returned to college and graduated with honors, with degrees in entrepreneurship and marketing from the University of Arizona’s Eller Center for the Study of the Private Market Economy.|$|E

40|$|Folk <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> {{diversity}} often {{differ from}} the criteria laid out by linguists and have particular implications for applied/sociolinguists since the collective identification <b>of</b> <b>language</b> diversity largely determines {{the ways in which}} individuals regard the categorisation of their own (and others) linguistic uses as belonging to a specific social and/or regional variety. Folk perceptions can thus help define speech communities as well as explain sociolinguistic other phenomena. This paper provides a critical analysis of the existing folk linguistic research into language variation {{in a number of different}} contexts: the UK, the USA, France and Japan. It is hoped that the information gained will help build up a more detailed sociolinguistic picture of the complex and often contradictory nature of lay individuals’ attitudes towards linguistic variation. In the final sections of the paper the authors argue for a greater deal of recognition within modern linguistics of the value <b>of</b> examining folk <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> diversity...|$|R

Suleiman (2004) contends that language use {{is one of the}} least studied dimensions of this Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

This presentation specifically discusses careful strategies when interviewing participants or family of participants living in an area conflict such as Palestine. While there are already safeguards in place when analyzing interviews such as member checking (Janesick, 2011), this presentation will suggest additions to the qualitative interviewing guide in order to further protect anonymity and information which is shared throughout the course of the collection of data.

A central problem in speech production research is to discover the neural sources that generate the control signals supplied to motoneurons during speaking. Speechmovementproduction appears to share organizational principles with other motor behaviors; thus speech movements probably arise from an interaction of centrally generated command signals with sensory information. That speech movements are ultimately linked to the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> however, has ledmany investigators to suggest that speechmovement control involves unique features, features that {{may be linked to}} abstract linguistic units...|$|E

Results showed that a candidate’s use of swear words increased the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> informality and improved the general impression about the source. The latter effect was particularly strong for male candidate, as female candidate was already evaluated positively, irrespective of her cursing. In addition, though the manipulation of the politician’s vulgarity did not directly affect participants ’ self-reported likelihood of voting for him or her, an indirect effect through language informality and impression about the candidate emerged. On the contrary, profanity use reduced perceived persuasiveness of the message, suggesting that the influence of swearing could be automatic and unaware. Theoretical implications are discussed.

40|$|This paper compares {{prominence}} that listeners perceive {{with actual}} articulatory prominence. We calculated phrasal boundaries from articulatory patterns using an algorithm of the C/D model, and compared those calculated boundaries with perceived boundaries. The jaw displacements, measures of prominence, were measured using EMA; articulatory boundaries {{were derived from}} a C/D model algorithm. The data {{is a set of}} English sentences that vary in the placement of contrastive emphasis. Perception data were obtained from listeners who were asked to evaluate syllable prominence and syllable boundaries for these sentences. The results indicate that perception of syllable prominence shows strong correlations with articulatory prominence, showing that jaw displacement can be a strong perceptual cue for syllable prominence. Further, perception of syllable prominence is also correlated with algorithmically-calculated articulatory syllable boundaries. These results encourage us to explore the relation between articulation and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> prosody in terms of the C/D model framework...|$|E
