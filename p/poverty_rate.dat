5|$|The Tutsi RPF {{restarted}} their offensive, {{and took}} control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July. The international response to the genocide was limited, with major powers reluctant to strengthen the already overstretched UN peacekeeping force. When the RPF took over, approximately two million Hutu fled to neighbouring countries, in particular Zaïre, fearing reprisals; additionally, the RPF-led army was a key belligerent in the First and Second Congo Wars. Within Rwanda, a period of reconciliation and justice began, with the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the reintroduction of Gacaca, a traditional village court system. Since 2000 Rwanda's economy, tourist numbers, and Human Development Index have grown rapidly; between 2006 and 2011 the <b>poverty</b> <b>rate</b> reduced from 57% to 45%, while life expectancy rose from 46.6 years in 2000 to 59.7 years in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of living without compromising the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian <b>poverty</b> <b>rate</b> had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|E

40|$|Although the <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> among solo mothers vary a lot between {{countries}} {{there is one}} common feature: solo mothers perform worse in terms of financial resources compared to married or cohabiting mothers. Even in countries with low <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> in general, the differences in income between solo mothers and married/cohabiting mothers remain and are significant. It is interesting {{to ask the question}} why? Again referring to a cross national setting we see that <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> vary widely {{between countries}} and this raises the hypothesis that different factors play a role in determining solo mothers' economic well being. In this paper the main question is: What is preventing Swedish and Belgian solo mothers from poverty? Sweden and Belgium are interesting to look at for several reasons. Looking at the <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers in both countries, we see that they are low compared to many other countries. Sweden in 1992 and Belgium in 1990 had <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers of 3. 8 % (Hobson and Takahashi, 1997) and 8 % (Bradshaw, 1996 a) whereas the <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers in some other European countries were much higher: The Netherlands (20. 9 %) (1991) Germany (41 %) (1990) United Kingdom (58 %) (1990) 2. Although both countries have relatively low <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers, {{they do not have the}} same type of social policies. If we take Esping-Andersen's typology of welfare regimes (1990) as a point of reference we find two different welfare regimes. Sweden is defined as a social democratic welfare state and Belgium as a conservative/corporatist welfare state. 3. One would expect the latter to be more orientated towards the male breadwinner ideology with worse outcomes for women without male breadwinner, This is apparently not the case for solo mothers in Belgium. All this makes it interesting to look at these two countries. Is public policy the main reason for the low <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> and how can it be explained that different policies have almost the same outcomes...|$|R
