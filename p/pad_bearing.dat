50|$|The first tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> {{in service}} was {{probably}} built under A.G.M. Michell's guidance by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd, for a centrifugal pump at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, in 1907, {{just two years}} after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to Reynold's equation. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamboat the Paris, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War. The practical results were spectacular - the troublesome thrust block became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles. It was estimated that the Royal Navy saved coal to a value of £500,000 in 1918 alone {{as a result of}} fitting Michell's tilting-pad bearings.|$|E

Also the bearing needs to be designed in order to be suited for the rotor-bearing system and operating condition. In this paper, it is observed that the static and dynamic characteristics of a five pad tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> for the LBP and LOP configurations are influenced by the variation of preload and pivot offset. In this context, rotor dynamic analysis of the 5 MW industrial gas turbine supported by the tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> at the front and roller bearing at the rear is carried out based on the dynamic coefficients of the tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> investigated.

Mainly, the second critical speed, the rigid body mode of conical shape with high whirling in the tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing,</b> is significantly changed by preload and pivot offset regardless of the LBP and LOP configurations.

40|$|LectureA new 46 MW {{steam turbine}} became {{unstable}} as the {{load on the}} turbine was increased. The turbine had a relatively long slender shaft and the subsynchronous frequency was near the first critical speed of 1800 rpm. In an effort to allow the machine to reach full load a bearing redesign was undertaken. The bearing design was changed from the original 5 pad tilting pad journal (TPJ) bearings, orientated with the load on the bottom pad (LOP), to three pad TPJ?s also in the LOP configuration. Analysis indicated that the additional asymmetry in the dynamic coefficients would significantly increase the system logarithmic decrement (log dec) and allow the machine to run at full load without going unstable. With the three pad bearings installed the machine {{was brought up in}} speed and experienced subsynchronous vibration before reaching full speed. A design review of the bearings indicated that the top two pads of the three <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> were operating in the fully starved condition; that is they were not receiving sufficient oil to develop a hydrodynamic oil film. As such the horizontal stiffness went to near zero.

40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting pad bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted tilting pad bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a {{tilting pad thrust bearing}} while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is the elimination of the bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|E

Another {{important point is that}} many users mistakenly believe that tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> eliminate all cross-coupling forces that cause subsynchronous instability. While this is true of the cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross, coupling force from labyrinth seals can overcome the beneficial characteristics of tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper describes the installation of an integrally geared compressor that initially had problems with high <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperatures. The manufacturer attempted to modify the bearings to reduce the pad temperatures but this was unsuccessful due to unacceptable high vibration amplitudes caused by rotordynamic instability. The rotordynamic instability was caused by a strong subsynchronous excitation of a cantilevered rotor natural frequency located at 47 percent of running speed. The subsynchronous excitation was due to labyrinth seal cross coupling effects. Based on the recommendation of the authors, the manufacturer installed swirl brakes to decrease the subsynchronous vibration excitation, which eliminated the rotordynamic instability and allowed the bearings to be modified in order to reduce <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperatures...|$|R

Significant improvement in load carrying capacity, wear resistance and friction coefficient of the tribiological mechanical component can be achieved by forming regular micro structure in form of micro dimple on the thrust <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. In the present work numerical analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spherical, cylindrical, elliptical, rectangular and square texture on the thrust pad hydrodynamic bearing and a comparison is done with the plain thrust bearing. The above texture profile was chosen in the view to easy fabrication of such texture using laser technology or etching process. These textured pads are tested on the various type of operating condition. The Reynolds equations are solved numerically by the finite difference method and an analysis is done on the effect of texture height, aspect ratio, and number of textures both in radial and circumferential directions on thrust <b>pad</b> <b>bearing.</b> It is observed that the load carrying capacity increases with increase of texture height ratio. This is because as texture height is increased it restricts the flow of lubricants which increases pressure and load carrying capacity. The analysis shows as aspect ratio is increased the roughness of surface is increased so pressure is increased, which result is increasing load carrying capacity. However with very larger value of aspect ratio the roughness of surface decreases, which decreases the load carrying capacity. Similar studies the done for behavior of coefficient of friction on variation of aspect ratio, texture height ratio etc. The author believes that such detail analysis on different texture profile on thrust pad hydrodynamic to study different tribological behavior under different condition will help researchers around the world...|$|E
