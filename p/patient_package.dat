40|$|Background and Objective: The <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> insert is an {{important}} source of drug information. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the PPI of the anti-infective agents manufactured in Palestine with the imported equivalents. Method: The selection criteria generated 15 different anti-infective agents available as 36 locally manufactured products and 15 imported equivalents. The design of the <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> insert was evaluated in terms of the number of words used in eight main headings and the presence or absence of certain information regarding nine statements. Results: Inserts of locally manufactured products have significantly fewer words than those of imported products with respect to warnings, dosage and administration, and side effects. The most significant difference was found in the warnings. Moreover, differences were found between inserts of local and imported products in terms of the presence of the nine informative statements. Locally manufactured products did not mention inactive ingredients, clinical pharmacology or date of last revision, but all of them provided information on the use of the drug during pregnancy and lactation and on the duration of therapy. However, in general they provided less information than the imported equivalents. Conclusion: Palestinian authorities and local manufacturers should implement appropriate measures to regulate the quality and quantity of information in the <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> insert of locally produced anti-infective agents. PPI improvement will better direct health practices to the benefit of the patients. Key words: <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> insert, evaluation, Palestine, drug information...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecombinant adenoviruses {{are being}} {{developed}} for gene therapy of inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis because they efficiently transduce recombinant genes into nondividing cellsin vivo. First generation recombinant adenoviruses, rendered defective by deletion of sequences spanning E 1 a and E 1 b, express low levels of early and late viral genes that activate destructive cellular immune responses. Current strategies for improving recombinant adenoviruses attempt to inactivate other essential genes through deletion and growth in new packaging cell lines or incorporation of temperature sensitive mutations which allow propagation of the virus in available packaging cell lines at permissive temperatures. We describe in this report {{a new type of}} recombinant adenovirus that is deleted of all viral open reading frames. This recombinant (called ΔrAd), which contains only the essentialciselements (i. e., ITRs and contiguous packaging sequence), is propagated in 293 cells in the presence of E 1 -deleted helper virus. Concatamers of the monomeric vector genome were passaged and capable of transduction. The ΔrAd genome is packaged into virions that sediment at a lower density than the helper virus in cesium gradients forming the basis for a purification protocol. A fully deleted recombinant adenovirus that expresses human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was produced and used to transduce human airway epithelial cells derived from a cystic fibrosis <b>patient.</b> <b>Packaging</b> and propagation of a fully deleted adenovirus is an important step toward the development of a safer vector.

Setting: Female members of community social organizations, female relatives of psychology students, and caregivers to psychotic patients. Nature of the study: Randomized, controlled healthy human volunteer study with three parallel experiments, involving the inserts of cisapride, itraconazol, and risperidon. Design. Subjects were recruited in a convenience sample and randomized to one control and two intervention groups (one with a normal insert and one with an insert with a benefit message). Material and methods: Subjects were asked to read the inserts (using mock text in the control group) in 5 to 15 minutes. Knowledge of the medication was tested with 20 simple questions (to be answered Yes/No/Don't know) and benefit/risk perception with a five-point bipolar Likert scale. Results: In the three experiments respectively 89, 102, and 83 subjects were recruited. The provision of inserts increased the knowledge about medication in all the intervention groups. Thirty-one pet-cent, 41 %, and 54 % of the subjects who read a normal insert agreed that the benefit of the medicine was greater than its risks, compared to 62 %, 64 %, and 70 % of subjects who read an insert with a benefit message included (P < 0. 05 in all 3 experiments).
