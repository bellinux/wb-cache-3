5000|$|Lake Anna is {{approximately}} 17 mi long from tip to tip, with 200 mi of shoreline. The lake {{is divided into}} two sides: the public side (also known as the [...] "cold" [...] <b>side)</b> and the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> (also known as the [...] "hot" [...] side). The public side is roughly 9000 acre, while the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> is roughly 4000 acre. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and <b>private</b> <b>sides</b> are divided by three stone dikes. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> has no marinas or public access ramps; only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the <b>private</b> <b>side.</b> The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees significantly higher boat traffic than the <b>private</b> <b>side,</b> especially on summer weekends.|$|R

5000|$|The public side {{is known}} as the [...] "cold" [...] side because it {{provides}} water to cool the generators at the power plant; the private or [...] "hot" [...] side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> can be substantially warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point, where it can be too hot for swimming. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> into the public side through underground channels; consequently, the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish migrate to these warmer waters.|$|R
