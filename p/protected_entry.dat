Examines the definition of "refugee" {{set out in the}} Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 and Directive 2004 / 83, the principle of non-refoulement, the status of asylum seekers, European migration policy and access to asylum procedures.

40|$|Keeping {{valuable}} secrets requires costly protection efforts. Breaking them requires costly search efforts. In {{a dynamic}} {{model in which}} {{the value of the}} secret decreases with the number of those holding it, we examine the secret holders' protection decisions and the secret breakers' timing of entry, showing that the original secret holder's payoff can be very high, even when protection appears weak, with implications for innovators' profits from unpatented innovations. We show that the path of entry will be characterized by two waves, the first of <b>protected</b> <b>entry</b> followed by a waiting period, and a second wave of unprotected entry...|$|E
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{interaction of}} processes in a computing environment is fundamental for its security and reliability. Processes can be attacked by other processes or by external clients, errors in one process can propagate to others. We show here three patterns {{that can help}} provide a secure and reliable execution environment although {{they need to be}} complemented with other patterns. They include <b>Protected</b> <b>Entry</b> Points, which control the correct use of entry points according to their signatures (type and length of parameters); and Protection Rings, which control the calls between processes, enforcing constraints on entry points and signatures according to the level of trust in the processes. Finally, the Multilevel Secure Partitions (MSP) pattern, confines execution of a process to a system partition that has a specific confidentiality or integrity level. 1...|$|E
50|$|Tying {{may also}} be a form of price discrimination: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a {{one-time}} shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying {{may also be}} used with or in place of patents or copyrights to help <b>protect</b> <b>entry</b> into a market, discouraging innovation.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the strategic development of the external dimension of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), a system which forms {{an integral part of}} the space of freedom and security. Seeking to assess the level of realisation of the EU’s ambition to become an important actor in international refugee protection and to establish a genuinely coherent asylum policy, the paper evaluates the state of development of the external dimension of the CEAS. Regional Protection Programmes, which seek to enhance protection capacity in third countries, as well as the efforts to establish a voluntary Joint European Resettlement Programme in solidarity towards third states, are analysed. The debate relating to <b>protected</b> <b>entry</b> procedures is also considered, albeit more briefly as there have not yet been any concrete proposals or common actions at the EU level in this respect. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the unforeseen or unintended {{effects of the}} European Union’s refugee law on the world’s most vulnerable refugees, those forgotten by the law. The paper focuses on those refugees automatically denied protection in Europe by being impliedly defined out of the EU’s refugee definition. Not only must refugees seeking protection in Europe meet the legal definition, {{but they are also}} assumed to have the means to reach Europe. Due to the limitations on legal access routes, often only those who can afford to pay a smuggler have the chance to reach Europe. The great majority of the world’s refugees remain outside Europe. Therefore, an exploration of the external policies of the EU institutions which are designed to counter the limiting affects of its restrictive migration policy is required. The paper examines the move towards the establishment of Regional Protection Programmes, <b>Protected</b> <b>Entry</b> Procedures and Resettlement Schemes as providing possible hope for enduring protection for those refugees trapped outside Europe...|$|E
40|$|Both Ada and Java support {{concurrent}} programming, {{but through}} quite different approaches. Ada has built-in tasking features with concurrency semantics, {{independent of the}} language's OOP model, whereas Java's thread support relies on OOP {{and is based on}} special execution properties of methods in several predefined classes. Ada achieves mutual exclusion through protected objects with encapsulated components; Java uses the classical "monitor" construct with "synchronized" methods/blocks. Ada models condition-based synchronization and communication through suspension objects, <b>protected</b> <b>entries,</b> and rendezvous; Java provides the low-level "wait" / "notification" methods. Both languages offer timing control; Ada additionally provides user-specifiable scheduling policies...|$|R

50|$|To avoid {{stopping}} {{passenger trains}} in tunnel sections, a relaxation {{of the rules}} was in force permitting the clearance of the home signal (<b>protecting</b> <b>entry</b> to a station area) without bringing the train quite or nearly to a stand. The consequence of this was that drivers rarely encountered any home signal at danger, and some were accustomed to fail {{to look out for}} it. Many of the signals were of miniature arm or disc type, and the tunnel signals were oil lamps of inconsistent performance. Bunker-first or tender first running and the smoky tunnel conditions made signal spotting difficult. Out of sequence running and the heavy running of special goods and excursion trains added to the signalmen's load.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} battery, {{known as}} the caserne sous le parados (barracks under the entrance) is composed of gun chambers all oriented opening on the northeastern facade, with arched vaults expressed on the main wall as blind arches. Materials include limestone, millstone and brick. Concrete was added after 1879, and was retained in the 2006 renovation. A small bastion <b>protects</b> the <b>entry</b> from direct fire directly opposite the gate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Protected</b> object <b>entries</b> {{are similar}} to procedures, but {{additionally}} have guards. If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as {{this is the only}} time when the evaluation of guards can have changed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} implementation of action-based concurrent objects. Concurrency is expressed by allowing objects to have actions with a guard and a body, {{in addition to}} methods and variables. Condition synchronization is expressed by method guards <b>protecting</b> <b>entry</b> into an object. An action of an object can execute any time when its guard is true, with the restriction that at most one action or methods can execute within an object, thus guaranteeing atomicity. In principle, all objects can execute in parallel. The appeal of this model {{is that it is}} conceptually simple for programmers and comes with a verification and refinement theory based on atomic actions that is a straightforward extension of that for sequential programs. The concurrency model is suited for tightly coupled shared-memory processors. The implementation makes use of a recent thread library, NPTL, that supports a large number of kernel threads. Each active object has its own thread that cycles through the actions, evaluates their guards, and executes an enabled action. Syntactic constraints restrict when guards need to be re-evaluated. We compare the efficiency of the generated code with that o...|$|R
50|$|Because {{barriers}} to <b>entry</b> <b>protect</b> incumbent firms and restrict competition in a market, they {{can contribute to}} distortionary prices and are therefore most important when discussing antitrust policy.

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} the extent of real {{appreciation}} and real depreciation in the external {{value of the dollar}} since the late 70 s has been overstated for most industries by the Federal Reserve Board's 10 -country index, and is better proxied by the Dallas Fed's 101 -country index. Earlier findings seem robust to the choice of index. Namely, changes in the real external value of the dollar have passed most fully into domestic prices of industries heavily reliant on imported inputs and producing import substitutes, and least fully into capital-intensive and concentrated industries and those <b>protected</b> by <b>entry</b> barriers.

50|$|On July 30, {{he heard}} that another {{fortress}} was being created, and he {{thought that it was}} unnecessary. Later, Hita y Salazar sent two letters to the Crown in which he explained the progress made at the Castillo de San Marcos and gave suggestions on the fort. He also explained that he thought any attacker who arrived in Saint Augustine would try to conquer it and hold Anastasia Island, cutting off resupply fleets and bombarding the castle. To protect the island and prevent an invasion, Hita y Salazar decided that its engineers build a four-armed redoubt, which would be placed on the coast of El Pinillo and would <b>protect</b> <b>entry</b> and access to Anastasia Island. It seemed that many of his decisions may have been influenced by a false idea that there was an army on Anastasia Island that could bombard the castle and cut off supply lines. There was no army there, however. After he came to reason and withdrew his theory of the invasion of the island, British General Oglethorpe did exactly that in 1739. The supply ships were prepared for the attack, and the castle was able to prevent the few cannonballs that were sent by Oglethorpe. Blocks and others elements (such as the Coquina rock) with which the castle was built, blocked the impact of the cannonballs. Consequently, the bombardment was ineffective. Hita y Salazar sent a plane to the Viceroy of New Spain, Payo Enríquez de Rivera, explaining the state the Fort was in and that his advance, foundations, tanks and bastions that were being built. Hita y Salazar, apparently, had reached economic and technical problems in certain parts of the work. The accounts and expenses always exceeded the budgeted amount. He faced an impeachment trial that was applied to him in 1678, but came out unscathed.|$|R
