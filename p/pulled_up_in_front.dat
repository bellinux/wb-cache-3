2500|$|On 20 April 2017, {{a police}} officer was shot dead on the Champs-Élysées by an extremist and two other {{officers}} were injured. They were all sitting in a parked police van, when the attacker <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the van. [...] The attacker tried to shoot civilians (including a tourist) and was immediately shot dead by other police on the spot. The shooting happened {{two days before the}} first round of voting in the 2017 French presidential election.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2005, Mos Def {{released}} the single [...] "Katrina Clap", renamed [...] "Dollar Day" [...] for True Magic, (utilizing the instrumental for New Orleans rappers UTP's [...] "Nolia Clap"). The song is {{a criticism of}} the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. On {{the night of the}} MTV Video Music Awards, Mos Def <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Radio City Music Hall on a flatbed truck and began performing the [...] "Katrina Clap" [...] single in front of a crowd that quickly gathered around him. He was subsequently arrested despite having a public performance permit in his possession.|$|E

2500|$|The Mexico City police {{department}} {{noticed that the}} Matamoros killings were similar to murders carried out in Mexico City between 1987 and 1989. After consulting local witchcraft practitioners and sorcerers, the police heard that Constanzo was probably hiding in Cuauhtémoc, one of the city's boroughs. Another contact told the police {{that there was an}} address of interest in the [...] neighborhood, next to Cuauhtémoc. The {{police department}} sent 16 officers to search the area. At a supermarket, they interrogated a shoemaker who claimed to have seen a woman who matched Aldrete's description. The police then spotted a man at the supermarket who was attempting to buy large amounts of groceries with U.S. dollars. They followed the man and saw that he was living at an apartment on Río Sena. By the end of the week, the police concluded that the man was De León and that he was buying groceries for Constanzo. On May 6, 1989, the police surrounded the building and waited for traffic to subside before raiding the premises. However, a black vehicle <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the apartment complex and the police walked over to investigate. Constanzo noticed the police from the window of his apartment and opened fire at the officers who were at ground level. Constanzo threw golden coins and paper money from the window, and burned some of his money on a stove. Constanzo eventually ran out of ammunition and began to lose his patience. After about 45 minutes, and worried of his imminent capture, Constanzo ordered De León to kill him and Quintana Rodríguez.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "weird" [...] wedding {{occurred}} here involving Mr. and Mrs. Nick Zavitz of St. Thomas, Ontario. They {{got married}} in their respective tow straps deep in the mud of the main pit. A trio of quad riders would <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Trans Am on a pickup truck chassis and spray the newlyweds with mud instead of rice.|$|R
50|$|A car <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of {{a wooden}} gate. Teenage Pauline (Amanda Langlet) {{gets out of the}} car to open the gate to allow her older cousin Marion (Arielle Dombasle) to drive inside their family's {{vacation}} home on the north-western coast of France. As the girls settle into their trip, Marion quizzes Pauline on her love life, and Pauline confesses that she has not had any serious affairs of the heart.|$|R

60|$|The man {{was just}} {{swinging}} into Northumberland Avenue, and he <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the hotel. Deane went in hurriedly, {{and made his}} way to the smoking-room, exchanging abrupt greetings with one or two acquaintances. There he ordered and drank quickly a large brandy-and-soda. When he retraced his steps, he felt more composed.|$|E
6000|$|A {{limousine}} {{swung around}} the corner and <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the door, a few minutes later. The footman on the box sprang down. He heard her voice as she said [...] "Good-by" [...] to some one. The car rolled smoothly away. She crossed the pavement with an involuntary glance at the tall, approaching figure.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the police}} <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house, Mae tells Jimmy that he's {{innocent}} {{of the crime}} and that Jack is planning to frame him. A police inspector (played by the Lecturer) bursts in. Jack accuses Jimmy of murdering Mary while [...] "hopped up" [...] on reefer. Jimmy begs Mae {{to tell the truth}} and exonerate him. Mae, however, is too weak and too dependent on the [...] "stuff" [...] Jack gives her. She remains silent and Jimmy is dragged away to stand trial.|$|R
5000|$|The first airing {{introduced}} Mr. Six as {{an apparently}} elderly, slow-moving {{man dressed in}} his trademark tuxedo and large glasses, <b>pulling</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of {{a house in a}} retro-style bus. The occupants of the house are sitting around the front yard apparently very bored. Mr. Six slowly shuffles off the bus, then suddenly comes to life and performs a high-energy dance routine as [...] "We Like to Party" [...] begins playing, and invites the bored family to Six Flags. The dance he performs borrows moves from the Melbourne Shuffle, Jumpstyle, and Techtonik. Subsequent ads showed different variations of Mr. Six dancing and inviting people to Six Flags. The role was, initially, non-speaking.|$|R
5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|R
60|$|Remembering Beatrice's {{confidence}} as to her sermon manufacturing functions, Geoffrey felt amused at her father's naïve way {{of describing}} them, and Beatrice also smiled faintly as she answered that the sermon was ready. Just then {{the roll of}} wheels was heard without, and the only fly that Bryngelly could boast <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the door.|$|E
60|$|He {{swung his}} whip, {{and the team}} plunged forward down the declivity with the wagon jolting and {{rattling}} behind them. Two or three hours later he <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Farquhar's homestead, where, as he informed its owner, he meant to stay the night; and when the dusk was closing in he sat with the others on the stoop.|$|E
60|$|Philip Romilly was accosted, {{late that}} afternoon, by {{two young women}} whose {{presence}} on board he had noticed {{with a certain amount}} of disapproval. They were obviously of the chorus-girl type, a fact which they seemed to lack the ambition to conceal. After several would-be ingratiating giggles, they finally <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him whilst he was promenading the deck.|$|E
50|$|Malvo {{then moves}} into a remote cabin {{listening}} to a police scanner to monitor Lester's interactions with the police. Malvo also breaks into the car of the two FBI agents to get their credentials and to call FBI headquarters to cancel their requested backup. He then visits a local car dealership, and steals a car resembling the FBI car and takes the salesman hostage. Malvo then waits outside the police station, and trails Lester when the police drive him home. While the police stand guard outside Lester's house, Malvo's car <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. They go to see who is inside the vehicle and see that the salesman is driving, with his hands ductaped to the steering wheel. Malvo then approaches them from behind, shooting and killing them both.|$|R
50|$|On {{a stormy}} July night, Lynda Bradley, {{the owner of}} The Molly Thorvaldson Café, notices a pair of {{headlights}} <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the café just before closing time. She allows the flustered looking teenage girl from inside the truck {{to come in and}} have a cup of coffee. Lynda learns that this girl's name is Noreen and tells her that she is in Pembina Lake. Noticing that she is most likely in some sort of trouble with no place to go, Lynda makes up the cot for her to sleep on that night. Later on, Noreen notices something slimy in the couch cushions, a gnawed-on chicken leg, and tosses it to the dog. In the morning, Dolores Harper comes by to help with the café like she does every Saturday morning. Meanwhile, Tessie, Seth's dog, is sick and so is Noreen.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Price, {{president}} of the PulsePoint Foundation, said that {{the idea for the}} application came to him in 2010 while he was serving as the fire chief in the San Ramon Valley. While he was out to lunch he heard sirens and saw one of his own engines <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the restaurant he was dining in. [...] It turned out that someone next door had collapsed and gone into cardiac arrest. Since Price was the department chief, he was not dispatched to the call and did not know about it, but he was CPR certified and carried a defibrillator in his car. This incident left him wondering if technology could help produce a way for civilians who were trained to help {{in the event of a}} nearby emergency. The American Heart Association estimates that 383,000 out of hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States.|$|R
60|$|The cab <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of a very}} ordinary-looking cafe in a {{side street}} leading {{from one of the}} boulevards. Louis {{dismissed}} the man and looked {{for a moment or two}} up and down the pavement. His caution appeared to be quite needless, for the thoroughfare was none too well lit, and it was almost empty. Then he entered the cafe, motioning me to follow him.|$|E
60|$|David shivered {{a little}} as he threw in the clutch, passed on round {{the back of the}} {{building}} and through the iron gates of the ancient dower house. He felt a little sigh of relief as he <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the long, grey house, in front of which Sylvia Laycey was waiting to receive him. She waved her hand gaily and looked with admiration at the car.|$|E
60|$|We reached St. Claude at daybreak, and {{following}} Madame's directions, the driver <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of a large}} house in the Avenue du Jura. Again there was the same difficulty in hoisting the unwieldy lady out of the vehicle, but this time, in response to my vigorous pull at the outside bell, the concierge and another man {{came out of the}} house, and very respectfully they approached Madame and conveyed her into the house.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the TWA {{terminal}} at the Los Angeles International Airport, ca. 1974. A {{few cars}} <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the terminal, {{which is a}} large light-colored structure baring the name "Trans[?] Airlines". A bus at right <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> next to a sign bearing the initials "TWA", situated next to a glass door and series of windows behind which several people can be seen. A few people walk on the concrete walkway outside the glass window, and across from them runs a striped path marked for pedestrians through the main street. A strip divides the road in two and is decorated with a line of palm trees. Both roads appear to be one-way, with traffic facing the left on both sides. In the foreground to the left is a small sign bearing the words "Parking for American Bonanza TWA". In the background, part of an airplane with the TWA marking on its tail can be seen, while the distance is composed of several buildings...|$|R
50|$|The site {{selected}} by Grigor, {{on a flat}} topped rise just north of Coonowrin Creek, was roughly halfway between the Caboolture River and Edmund Lander's homestead on the Mooloolah River (today's town of Mooloolah), both of which also became Cobb and Co. coaching stages. The landmark quality of the nearby Glass House Mountains, the fresh water available from Coonowrin Creek, and the elevated site of the accommodation house were all probably considerations in the siting of Bankfoot, especially the availability of water for horses. The top of the rise was level enough for horse-drawn vehicles to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the building, {{and it had a}} long enough road frontage to accommodate stables and a feed shed next to the house. There was also a layer of stone about 600mm under the soil surface, which might have been useful in preventing wheels bogging below a certain point when the ground was sodden after rain.|$|R
50|$|Jerry is then shown {{cruising}} {{through the}} air, and then spots Tom behind him. He continues on his course, but <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> just <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a fast-rotating fan, leaving Tom {{to fall into}} the duct and be shredded. Tom falls out of the duct and has a striped appearance. The belt starts flying by itself in the air until Tom squirts it with gas and stops the belt from working again. Tom then laughs himself silly.|$|R
60|$|One {{day just}} before this time Wildeve was {{standing}} {{at the door of the}} Quiet Woman. In addition to the upward path through the heath to Rainbarrow and Mistover, there was a road which branched from the highway a short distance below the inn, and ascended to Mistover by a circuitous and easy incline. This was the only route on that side for vehicles to the captain's retreat. A light cart from the nearest town descended the road, and the lad who was driving <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the inn for something to drink.|$|E
60|$|The {{feature of}} it which {{impressed}} Ashe most at this moment, however, {{was the fact}} that it looked warm; {{and for the first time}} since the drive began he found himself in a mood that approximated cheerfulness. It was a little early to begin feeling cheerful, he discovered, for the journey was by no means over. Arrived within sight of the castle, the cart began a detour, which, ten minutes later, brought it under an arch and over cobblestones to the rear of the building, where it eventually <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a great door.|$|E
60|$|I strolled over to {{the high}} French windows and looked out upon the grey twilight. I had {{scarcely}} {{stood there for a}} moment when the sound of horses' feet and smoothly rolling wheels coming up the broad drive told me that Mr. Ravenor's visitor was at hand, and immediately afterwards a small brougham flashed past the window and, describing a semi-circle, <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the hall door. A footman leaped down from the box and several servants stood on the steps and respectfully saluted the lady who had alighted from the carriage. A moment or two later {{there was a knock at}} the door.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the {{attendant}} cantered up the grassy enclosure, and <b>pulling</b> <b>up</b> his steed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of the royal}} stand, blew a second fanfare upon his bugle. He was a raw-boned, swarthy-cheeked man, with black bristling beard and a swaggering bearing.|$|R
60|$|Sally drove {{right through}} the {{settlement}} and back outside it before she could check the horses, and she had just <b>pulled</b> them <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the wooden hotel when Hawtrey reached it. He stood beside the wagon holding up his hand to her, and Sally, who laughed, dropped bodily into his arms, which was, as he realized, a thing that Agatha certainly would not have done. He set Sally down upon the sidewalk, and when a man came out to take the team Hawtrey took her into the hotel.|$|R
50|$|During one {{of those}} cold and stormy nights Bedelia sneaks out of the house, leaving behind most of her {{personal}} belongings. However, being pregnant, she is too weak {{to make it to}} the station and is saved from certain death by freezing by Charlie, who finds her lying in the snow-covered road. As a consequence, she has to stay in bed with a severe cold for several days. Eventually the roads are cleared of snow, and the first vehicle to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Horsts' house is a delivery van with the groceries they have ordered by telephone. The delivery boy also leaves behind a large bag of food ordered by Ben Chaney to be fetched by the latter the moment he is no longer snowed in his cottage. Shortly afterwards, Charlie chances upon Bedelia sprinkling some white powder on a piece of Gorgonzola taken from Chaney's bag of groceries, and is immediately reminded of a story he was told by Chaney about the death of one of Bedelia's former husbands. But only now that he has caught her in the act is he finally convinced of his wife's guilt and categorically resists all her attempts at making him an accessory after the fact.|$|R
