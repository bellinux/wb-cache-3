40|$|The article {{covers the}} issue of the most {{important}} product among additional food for infants — baby <b>porridges.</b> It includes historical data on usage of various cereal crops in human nutrition. A special significance of <b>porridges</b> in culture of food and traditions of Russian population is highlighted. The authors give information about nutritional value and chemical composition of different cereals — buckwheat, rice, pearl-barley, millet, oats etc. A special attention is given to differences in concentrations of nutrients and micronutrients manufactured by different ways from the same kind of cereal. The necessity to feed infants with commercial baby <b>porridges</b> is based in the article. There are also represented characteristics of various commercial <b>porridges</b> for nutrition of infants: hypoallergenic, glutenfree and containing gluten, enriched with pre- and probiotics. The article also contains data on nutritional value of milk and milk-free <b>porridges.</b> The authors raised a discussion on possibility and standards of usage of different additional components, such as sugar, maltodextrin, honey, vanillin, vegetable oils in production of infant <b>porridges.</b> The selection of certain type of <b>porridges</b> as additional food for healthy and infants with different diseases and digestive disorders is based. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Two tannin sorghums, (high-tannin, {{black with}} tannin), high {{anthocyanin}} sorghum (black), and non-tannin sorghum (white) {{were used to}} investigate the effects of sorghum phenolic compounds on in vitro starch digestibility, estimated glycemic indices (EGI) and resistant starch contents (RS) of <b>porridges.</b> Sorghum varieties were chosen to have {{a wide range of}} total phenols (3 - 23 mg/g gallic acid) and tannin contents (0 - 34 mg catechin eq. /g). Normal corn starch, enzyme resistant high amylose corn starch, and whole sorghum grains were cooked with the aqueous fraction of sorghum bran extracts obtained with 70 % aqueous acetone. Endosperms of soft and hard sorghum varieties were mixed with sorghum brans and cooked into <b>porridges</b> with distilled water. Hi-tannin, black and black with tannin sorghum bran extracts significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased starch digestibility and estimated glycemic index (EGI) while they increased resistant starch (RS) contents of normal corn starch, enzyme resistant high amylose corn starch, and whole sorghum grain <b>porridges.</b> The highest reduction in starch digestibility of the <b>porridges</b> occurred with hi-tannin sorghum bran extracts, followed by black with tannin and black sorghum bran extracts. Double cooked corn starch <b>porridges,</b> which were cooked with these bran extracts had EGI values of 49 - 67 and RS contents of 9. 1 - 57. 7 %. These RS values are higher than foods such as legumes, whole pasta and whole grain cereals which are considered health foods with low EGI (36 - 71) and high RS contents (2. 9 - 6. 8). Only brans of condensed tannin-containing sorghum varieties (tannin, black with tannin sorghums) significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased starch digestibility, and EGI, and increased RS contents of the endosperm <b>porridges.</b> When tannin sorghum bran extracts were cooked with zein added to corn starch <b>porridges,</b> starch digestibility of the <b>porridges</b> significantly (p< 0. 05) increased, while RS significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased because the zein reacted preferentially with the tannins. The cooking trials indicated that sorghums with tannins significantly reduced the activity of digestive enzymes, reduced EGI, and increased RS contents of <b>porridges.</b> Thus, specialty sorghum varieties have a potential to lower EGI and increase RS contents of starchy foods. Their aqueous bran extracts have potential use to reduce risk factors for type II diabetes and obesity...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{focuses on the}} sensory {{properties}} of fifteen (15) composite <b>porridges</b> processed from flour of new shoots tubers of Borassus aethiopum Mart basis. The composite flours were processed from mixture of various ratios of B. aethiopum flour (BAM) and powders of beans of Vigna unguiculata (VUW) and leaflets of Moringa oleifera (MOL). Sensory analyses were performed to reveal the descriptive profile regarding four (04) sensory parameters, namely aroma, flavour, appearance, and texture, and then the general acceptance of the <b>porridges.</b> Thus, the sensory profile of the studied composite flour <b>porridges</b> was determined against two control flours (ET 1 and ET 2). Then, the general acceptance was probed {{with two of the}} composite flours highlighting better sensory profiles, and then compared to both control flours. From the sensory description of the studied <b>porridges,</b> the samples EF 07 (57 % BAM, 26 % VUW, and 17 % MOL) and EE 09 (61 % BAM, 24 % VUW, and 15 % MOL) provided higher sweet flavour (4. 27 and 4. 07 / 9), agreeable aroma (6. 67 and 6. 47 / 9), and fluid texture (6. 27 and 5. 53 / 9), and revealed lower bitter taste (1. 73 and 1. 80 / 9). Besides, composite flours <b>porridges</b> EF 07 and EE 09 were accepted by 86 % and 82 % persons including 46 % and 24 % full acceptance, respectively. Oppositely to the composite flours <b>porridges</b> containing no substantial ingredient, the control <b>porridges</b> (ET 1 and ET 2) recorded 100 % acceptation by panelists. The formulations of composite flours with B. aethiopum Mart new shoots basis could be more accepted as food after addition of additives such as sugar, milk and natural aromas. Such processing could result in better promotion of this plant species culture for the biodiversity preservation and generating significant incomes for farmers in rural zones...|$|R

5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the <b>porridge</b> and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn <b>porridge</b> or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{addition}} of different proportions of fermented and malted sorghum flours on the proximate composition, viscosity, pH and consumer acceptability of extruded instantised sorghum weaning foods were evaluated. The main {{objective was to}} increase the nutrient density of the weaning <b>porridges</b> through viscosity reduction, since low nutrient density {{has been identified as}} major obstacle in young child feeding. The extrudates did not differ greatly in their proximate composition. Addition of malted sorghum flour resulted in <b>porridges</b> with greatly reduced viscosities (1000 - 3000 cP). However, its addition caused an overall reduction in consumer acceptance. Addition of fermented sorghum flour resulted in some viscosity reduction, although not to the same extent achieved by malt addition. Samples made from plain and plain/fermented materials seemed to appeal to a number of consumers. It is concluded that <b>porridges</b> made from composites of extruded plain/malted/fermented sorghum flours seem to offer the best route to address the identified problem of child nutrition. To improve product consumer acceptability, it is recommended that approved food colours and flavours be incorporated in the extruded sorghum weaning foods...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{recently}} conducted through INTSORMIL (Purdue Hamaker Project) to examine thick sorghum millet consumption related to preference and satiation in the Sikasso, Segou and Mopti regions of Mali. This {{is part of}} a larger study to understand the effect of thick <b>porridges,</b> and delayed glucose delivery to the body, on satiety and overall food consumption. The conclusions from the following data is that <b>porridges</b> (tô) are generally eaten more frequently and are consumed in a thicker consistency in the villages (Figures 1 and 2), and are very satiating (Figure 3 thicker <b>porridges</b> correlated with lower hunger scores at 2 and 4 hours post-consumption). This research should be used in a promotional campaign to encourage urban populations to consume more sorghum and millet tô. Possible campaign solgans could be something similar to “eat sorghum and millet, they are healthy satiating foods. ” Particularly in this time of high prices for grain imports, this could be helpful. (a little calculation – if one million families ate one more meal a week of sorghum/millet tô (using about 1 kg of flour for the meal), that is about 50, 000 metric tonnes of grain a year, which is more than the total wheat imports into Mali in 2008) ...|$|R
