25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by history, {{environmental}} conditions, auscultation of the ventral abdomen, radiographs, ultrasound, or fecal examination (See Diagnosis). Historically, medical {{treatment of the}} problem is with laxatives such as liquid paraffin or oil and <b>psyllium</b> husk. More recently veterinarians treat cases with specific synbiotic (pro and prebiotic) and <b>psyllium</b> combinations. <b>Psyllium</b> is the most effective medical treatment. It works by binding to the sand to help remove it, although multiple treatments may be required. Mineral oil is mostly ineffective since it floats {{on the surface of the}} impaction, rather than penetrating it. Horses with sand or dirt impaction are predisposed to Salmonella infection and other Gi bacteria, so antibiotics are often added to help prevent infection. Medical management usually resolves the colic, but if improvement doesn't occur within a few hours then surgery must be performed to flush the colon of any sand, which procedure that has a 60–65% survival rate. Horses that are not treated, or treated too late after the onset of clinical signs, are at risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Stopping {{straining}} during bowel movements, by use {{of correct}} posture, dietary fiber intake (possibly included bulk forming laxatives such as <b>psyllium),</b> stool softeners (e.g. polyethylene glycol, and biofeedback retraining to coordinate pelvic floor during defecation.|$|E
25|$|Bulking fibers can be soluble (i.e., <b>psyllium)</b> or {{insoluble}} (i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose). They absorb {{water and}} can significantly increase stool weight and regularity. Most bulking fibers are not fermented or are minimally fermented throughout the intestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Horses {{should not}} be fed {{directly}} {{on the ground in}} areas where sand, dirt and silt are prevalent, although small amounts of sand or dirt may still be ingested by grazing. Management to reduce sand intake and prophylactic treatments with sand removal products are recommended by most veterinarians. Such prophylaxis includes feeding a pelleted <b>psyllium</b> for one week every 4–5 weeks. Longer duration of treatment will result in gastrointestinal flora changes and the <b>psyllium</b> to be broken down and ineffective for sand clearance. Other methods include feeding the horse before turnout, and turning the horses {{out in the middle of}} the day so they are more likely to stand in the shade rather than graze.|$|E
25|$|The United States FDA allows {{producers}} of foods containing 1.7 g per serving of <b>psyllium</b> husk soluble fiber or 0.75 g of oat or barley soluble fiber as beta-glucans {{to claim that}} reduced {{risk of heart disease}} can result from their regular consumption.|$|E
25|$|The only {{potentially}} {{curative treatment}} for complete rectal prolapse is surgery, however {{in those patients}} with medical problems that make them unfit for surgery, and those patients who have minimal symptoms, conservative measures may benefit. Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation, and thereby reduce straining. A bulk forming agent (e.g. <b>psyllium)</b> or stool softener can also reduce constipation.|$|E
25|$|Non {{surgical}} {{measures to}} treat internal intussusception include pelvic floor retraining, a bulking agent (e.g. <b>psyllium),</b> suppositories or enemas to relieve constipation and straining. If there is incontinence (fecal leakage or more severe FI), or paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor (anismus), then biofeedback retraining is indicated. Some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively, compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery.|$|E
25|$|Dietary fibers {{have three}} primary mechanisms: bulking, {{viscosity}} and fermentation. Different fibers have different effects, {{suggesting that a}} variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health. Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism. For instance, cellulose and wheat bran provide excellent bulking effects, but are minimally fermented. Alternatively, many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms. For instance, <b>psyllium</b> provides bulking as well as viscosity.|$|E
25|$|Viscous fibers thicken the {{contents}} of the intestinal tract and may attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, and reduce lipid absorption (notably shown with cholesterol absorption). Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects. Some viscous fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract (guar gum, beta-glucan, glucomannan and pectins), but some viscous fibers are minimally or not fermented (modified cellulose such as methylcellulose and <b>psyllium).</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-term use of NSAIDs {{can lead}} to mucosal damage of the colon, {{secondary}} to decreased levels of homeostatic prostaglandins. Mucosal injury is usually limited to the right dorsal colon, but can be more generalized. Horses may display acute or chronic intermittent colic, peripheral edema secondary to protein losing enteropathy, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Treatment involves decreasing the fiber levels of the horse's diet by reducing grass and hay, and placing the horse on an easily digestible pelleted feed until the colon can heal. Additionally, the horse may be given misoprostol, sucralfate, and <b>psyllium</b> to try to improve mucosal healing, as well as metronidazole to reduce inflammation of the colon.|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, <b>psyllium,</b> rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E
