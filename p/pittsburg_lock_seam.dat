25|$|Seaming technique. This is a {{vertical}} or horizontal classical cladding construction used in copper roof and façade designs. Available in sheets and strips, the cladding is fixed with clips. Since water tightness {{may not be}} a concern on vertical surfaces, angle standing seams are often sufficient. Double <b>lock</b> standing <b>seams</b> are often not necessary. Links to photographs of horozontal and vertical standing and flat <b>lock</b> <b>seams</b> at the University of Debrecen's Copper Gateway in Hungary and of pre-oxidized copper clad seamed facades at the Hotel Crowne Plaza Milano, in Milan, Italy, are available.|$|R
40|$|Prawn, {{crab and}} clam meat were {{processed}} in experimental ca s having reduced internal tin coating of 5. 6 GSM. Conventional cans having 11. 2 GSM tin coating {{were used as}} control. Results showed that experimental cans behaved normally when used for canning prawns, provided the lacquer film was perfect with no exposure of metal. When there was a discontinuity in lacquer film exposing the metal blackening took place in such areas. Areas subjected to severe strains like the <b>lock</b> <b>seam</b> side and expansion rings on can ends {{were found to be}} more prone to blackening. Experimental cans were found unsuitable for canning crab meat or clam meat because in both cases the can wall as well as the contents underwent discoloration, in all cases...|$|R
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of copper roofing systems {{is that they}} are relatively easy to repair. For small pits or cracks, affected areas can be cleaned and filled with solder. For larger areas, patches can be cut and soldered into place. For major areas, the affected copper can be cut out and replaced using a flat <b>locked</b> soldered <b>seam.</b>|$|R
25|$|Flat <b>locked</b> and {{soldered}} <b>seam</b> roofing {{systems are}} typically used on flat or low-pitched roofs. They {{are also used}} on curved surfaces such as domes and barrel vaults.|$|R
25|$|Standing seam roofing is {{composed}} of preformed or field-formed pans. The pans run parallel to {{the slope of the}} roof and are joined to adjacent pans with double-locked standing <b>seams.</b> Copper cleats <b>locked</b> into these <b>seams</b> secure the roofing to the deck.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2004 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 65 - 67) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxv, 108 leavesAir ducts {{and related}} equipments are important components of climate and ventilation systems {{in order to}} distribute clean air, necessary for the occupied space, to whole system and to control thermal comfort. Despite of Turkish standards on air duct are present, studies on energy consumption associated with air leakage are very rare in Turkey, on the contrary to many developed countries. In this study, the subject of preventing energy losses related to the leakage, which causes inefficient working condition, has been investigated. Firstly, air duct system and quality requirements have been explained and the main standards have been analyzed for airtightness of air distribution systems, as well. Secondly, duct system measurements have been conducted by choosing two different approaches. One approach covers leakage calculation of a single duct by using European Standard called Eurovent, whereas the other one divides the system into single sections and uses the Power Law Model for calculation of leakage occurred in each section. Single duct leakage measurements were made on 300 mm and 1000 mm diameter circular ducts and 300 mm by 250 mm and 1000 mm by 500 mm flanged joint rectangular ducts for positive internal pressures. Test results showed that duct leakage depends on the method of duct fabrication, method of sealing, workmanship and static pressure differential. Furthermore, calculated leakage factors were under the allowable leakage limits in classification. C. for rectangular and circular ducts that were produced by Venco A. Ş. Comparing rectangular to circular ducts both had the same length of seam and surface area; the leakage from circular ducts was less than 80 % from rectangular ducts. The air leakage from all test ducts, with the same <b>lock</b> <b>seam</b> type, decreases, whereas the surface area increases. Branched duct leakage measurements were made on 300 mm and 630 mm diameter circular ducts and 300 mm by 200 mm and 500 mm by 300 mm rectangular ducts and also air distribution system for positive internal pressures. Test results showed that fittings in a system cause sudden changes in static pressure; therefore, duct leakage depends on fitting locations. The leakage rate in Spiro sealed system was less than 5 % Trelleborg sealed system. The leakage measured in {{this study showed that}} seam leakage accounts from 14 % to 20 % of the total in the two rectangular ducts and from 8 % to 13 % for the round ducts with Pittsburgh and Spiral <b>lock</b> <b>seams.</b> These data show that the joints are the major source of duct leakage. Improvement in duct construction leading to duct systems with less leakage will need to focus on better joints. Keywords: airtightness duct system, air duct leakage, duct leakage model, ductwork test procedure and methods...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and {{ornament}} decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability. Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final patina. Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey. Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process. Zinc is still used in alloys such as brass and nickel silver, and in the electroplating of steel as well. Today, galvanized steel and pure zinc material, usually Double <b>Locked</b> Standing <b>Seam</b> panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of titanium in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common.|$|R
