40|$|Prostaglandin-H (<b>PGH)</b> <b>synthase</b> from ram {{seminal vesicles}} is a dimeric {{integral}} membrane protein of molecular weight 140 kDa. <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> {{is a key}} enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, has cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities, and contains heme as a coenzyme.

Single crystals can be obtained from concentrated solutions of <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> in the presence of polyethylene glycol 4000 as a precipitant.

40|$|Diethylstilbestrol (DES) {{has been}} found to be {{oxidized}} in Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells by prostaglandin-H synthase (<b>PGH</b> <b>synthase).</b> It is hypothesized that <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> mediates adverse effects of DES and other carcinogenic estrogens such as induction of neoplastic transformation and genotoxicity. Interest in PGH synthase-catalyzed reactions focuses on two aspects: oxidation and metabolic activation of stilbene and steroid estrogens by <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase,</b> and modulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis via effects of these compounds on <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase.</b> Studies of the former aspect of PGH synthase-catalyzed in vitro metabolism have revealed that cooxidation of DES, DES analogues, and steroid estrogens gives rise to reactive intermediates; DES and DES analogues known to transform SHE cells are metabolized by <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> in vitro; <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> catalyzes both the formation and oxidation of catechol metabolites from steroid estrogens, and reactive intermediates from DES and from steroid estrogens are stable enough to bind both to the catalytic enzyme <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> and to other proteins. The data support the contention that PGH synthase-catalyzed metabolic activation plays a role in the induction of neoplastic transformation by stilbene and steroid estrogens but is not conclusive evidence for a cause-effect relationship. More recently, two closely related DES indanyl analogues have been found to differ in their interaction with PGH synthase: indenestrol A is cooxidized and activated like DES, whereas indenestrol B inhibits the enzyme. They provide useful tools to test the above hypothesis from a new perspective. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin H 2 (<b>PGH</b> 2) <b>synthase</b> catalyzes the bis-dioxygenation of {{arachidonic acid}} to yield {{prostaglandin}} G 2 (PGG 2) (cyclooxygenase (cox) reaction) and the peroxidative cleavage of PGG 2 to yield PGH 2 (peroxidase (perox) reaction). These reactions constitute the first committed {{step in the}} biosynthesis of prostanoids, which mediate symptoms of inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the cox reaction only and attenuate the synthesis of prostanoids. There are two isoforms of <b>PGH</b> 2 <b>synthase,</b> PGS- 1, which is constitutively expressed, and PGS- 2, which is induced by mitogens and cytokines. PGS- 2 {{is believed to be}} the principal target for NSAIDs. ^ The goals of this dissertation were to use novel bromoacetamido-NSAID analogs as mechanistic probes to delineate the catalytic mechanism of <b>PGH</b> 2 <b>synthase.</b> Bromoacetamido-analogs of two potent classes of NSAIDs (indomethacin and mefenamic acid) inactivated the cox and perox activity of homogeneous ovine PGS- 1. Stoichiometric measurements showed that one analog molecule labeled the cox site and another labeled the perox site. These bromoacetamido-NSAID analogs represent the first affinity-labeling agents other than aspirin which can be used to map the cox site and allowed the generation of cox-only and perox-only PGS- 1. ^ The ability to generate cox-only synthase questioned catalytic mechanisms of <b>PGH</b> 2 <b>synthase</b> which require that the perox reaction must initiate the cox reaction via higher oxidation states of Fe 3 +-protoporphyrin-IX (namely, Fe 5 + and Fe 4 +). The visible spectral intermediates associated with the cox and perox activities of PGS- 1 and with the 15 (R) -dioxygenase activity of aspirin-treated PGS- 2 were studied. A kinetically competent Fe 2 +-intermediate was detected during the cox reaction catalyzed by cox-only PGS- 1 and during the 15 (R) -dioxygenation reaction catalyzed by aspirin-treated PGS- 2. The detection of the lower oxidation state of iron contradicted existing catalytic mechanisms. ^ The generation of cox-only PGS- 1, the lack of lag-phase kinetics during the cox reaction catalyzed by cox-only PGS- 1, and the detection of a Fe 2 +-intermediate during the mono- and bis-dioxygenation of arachidonic acid led to the proposal of a new catalytic mechanism for both <b>PGH</b> 2 <b>synthases.</b> This mechanism involves the generation of a peroxy radical via the reduction of Fe 3 +-protoporphyrin-IX to Fe 2 +. The peroxy radical can then generate the arachidonyl radical for oxygen insertion. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of menadione on porcine aortic endothelial cell prostaglandin synthesis. Addition of 1 - 20 microM menadione caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of stimulated prostaglandin synthesis with an IC 50 of 5 microM at 15 min. Concentrations greater than 100 microM menadione were necessary to increase 51 Cr release from prelabeled cells. Recovery of enzyme inactivated by menadione required a 6 -h incubation in 1 % serum. In a microsomal preparation, menadione was shown to have no direct effect on conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. In intact cells menadione caused only a 40 % inhibition of the conversion of PGH 2 to prostacyclin. Enzymes involved in the incorporation and the release of arachidonic acid were not affected by menadione (20 microM, 15 min). Menadione undergoes oxidation/reduction reactions in intact cells leading to partial reduction of oxygen-forming, reactive oxygen species. In our cells menadione was found to increase KCN-resistant oxygen consumption. Further, an increased accumulation of H 2 O 2 was observed with a time course consistent with menadione-induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. We conclude that menadione at sublethal doses caused inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The mechanism involves inactivation of <b>PGH</b> 2 <b>synthase</b> by a reactive species resulting from metabolism of menadione by endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|The central enzyme in the {{prostaglandin}} (PG) biosynthetic cascade is <b>PGH</b> 2 <b>synthase</b> or cyclo-oxygenase (COX). At present, {{two distinct}} isoforms of PGH 2 synthase/COX have been identified: COX- 1 and COX- 2. In many systems, COX- 1 is a constitutively expressed isoform {{that is responsible}} for normal physiological production of PGs, whereas COX- 2 is an inducible isoform that responds to cytokines, endotoxin and growth factors by producing high levels of PGs. The regulation of COX- 2 mRNA and protein, and the subsequent production of PGE 2, were therefore examined in amnion-derived WISH cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Treatment of WISH cells with EGF (0. 01 - 100 ng/ml) elicited dose-dependent synthesis of COX- 2 mRNA and protein de novo. In addition, stimulation of WISH cells with EGF (10 ng/ml) induced steady-state levels of COX- 2 mRNA and protein that appeared within 30 min and then declined rapidly to near baseline levels within 2 - 4 h. In contrast, COX- 1 protein was unchanged in response to treatment with EGF. PGE 2 production was also rapid and transient. Preincubation of cells with the novel COX- 2 enzymic inhibitor NS- 398 (10 (- 5) - 10 (- 10) M) completely prevented PGE 2 formation in a dose-dependent manner. Preincubation of cells in dexamethasone (Dex; 0. 1 microM), however, resulted in only a 31 % decrease in PGE 2 formation in response to EGF (10 ng/ml) while completely attenuating PGE 2 biosynthesis in tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) -stimulated cells. In addition, Dex (0. 1 microM) was only partly effective at preventing EGF-induced COX- 2 mRNA and protein expression de novo, whereas Dex completely inhibited TNF-alpha-promoted COX- 2 mRNA and protein expression. Thus the results presented here demonstrate that EGF induces the rapid but transient expression of COX- 2 mRNA and protein and the subsequent production of PGE 2 in WISH cells...|$|R

In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, interleukin 1 (IL- 1) is known to induce the synthesis of this enzyme, thereby raising the level of <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> protein severalfold over the basal level. Pretreatment with aspirin at low concentrations (0. 1 - 1 micrograms/ml) inhibited more than 60 % of the enzyme mass and also the cyclooxygenase activity in IL- 1 -induced cells with only minimal effects on the basal level of the synthase enzyme in cells without IL- 1. Sodium salicylate exhibited a similar inhibitory action whereas indomethacin had no apparent effect. Similarly low levels of aspirin inhibited the increased L-[35 S]methionine incorporation into <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> that was induced by IL- 1 and also suppressed expression of the 2. 7 -kilobase <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA.

Transfection of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells with the <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> cDNA resulted in increased intracellular <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> protein (determined by Western blot analysis) and increased release of prostacyclin. Rabbits intravenously transfected with the <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> gene had increased plasma levels of prostacyclin and PGE 2, and their lungs produced increased {{amounts of the}} same eicosanoids.

In addition, pulmonary edema and release of thromboxane B 2 into the perfusate after endotoxin infusion were markedly decreased in transfected lungs compared to controls (animals transfected with a pCMV 4 construct that did not contain a cDNA insert). The data suggest that augmented endogenous production of prostacyclin and PGE 2, achieved by liposome-mediated gene transfer, protects the lungs from endotoxin.

40|$|Platelets {{adhere to}} the subendothelial layer of newly deendothelialized arteries. Attachment can be reduced with {{exogenous}} prostacyclin (PGI 2). Thus, the subendothelium {{may be unable to}} produce sufficient PGI 2 to prevent platelet adherence and subsequent platelet-platelet interaction. Consistent with this explanation are data from an earlier report (1977. Moncada S., A. G. Herman, E. A. Higgs, and J. R. Vane. Thromb. Res. 11 : 323 - 344) indicating that the smooth muscle layer of aorta has only 10 - 15 % of the capacity of endothelial cells to synthesize PGI 2. We have measured the concentrations of PGI 2 synthase and prostaglandin endoperoxide (<b>PGH)</b> <b>synthase</b> in bovine aorta and obtained results quite different from those described in this earlier report. Tandem immunoradiometric assays for PGI 2 synthase and <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> antigens were used to quantitate these proteins in detergent-solubilized homogenates of endothelial cells and smooth muscle tissue prepared from 10 different bovine aorta. The concentrations of PGI 2 synthase in endothelial cells and smooth muscle were found to be the same. However, the concentration of <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> in endothelial cells averaged greater than 20 times that of smooth muscle. Results similar to those determined by immunoradiometric assay were also obtained when <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> and PGI 2 synthase catalytic activities were measured in preparations of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, when bovine aorta and renal arteries were subjected to immunocytofluorescence staining using monoclonal antibodies to PGI 2 synthase, fluorescence staining of equivalent intensity was detected in both the endothelial cells and the smooth muscle. Moreover, the intensity of fluorescence was similar throughout cross-sections of vascular smooth muscle, indicating that there is no gradient in PGI 2 synthase concentrations between the endothelium and adventitia. Our results indicate that the propensity of platelets to {{adhere to the}} subendothelium of deendothelialized arteries and form aggregates cannot be attributed simply to an inability of the denuded vasculature to produce PGI 2 from PGH 2, but may be a consequence of the low <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> activity of smooth muscle. Consistent with this concept are the results of Eldor et al. (1981. J. Clin.

Radioimmunoassay indicated a 45 - 55 % decrease in prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production when Zellweger's fibroblasts were incubated with arachidonic acid. This deficiency was not overcome by pretreatment of the Zellweger's fibroblasts with media containing arachidonic acid, {{and it was}} not due to channeling of arachidonic acid into other eicosanoid products. Modifications in the peroxide tone of the Zellweger's fibroblasts by addition of H 2 O 2 or catalase failed to increase PGE 2 production. Using Northern analysis, we were unable to detect an mRNA transcript for <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> in unstimulated Zellweger fibroblasts but identified a 4. 2 -kb mRNA transcript after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Treatment for 6 h with 10 nM PMA raised PGE 2 production in normal and Zellweger fibroblasts to equivalent levels. These increases were prevented by addition of H- 7, staurosporine, cycloheximide, or actinomycin D. Our findings suggest that the reduced PGE 2 production in peroxisomal deficient fibroblasts is due to a decrease in <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA.

IL- 2 elicited a steady increase in PGI 2 synthesis by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) and bovine aortic endothelial cells but {{had no effect on}} vWf or tPA. Both purified natural IL- 2 (nIL- 2) and rIL- 2 induced significant PGI 2 synthesis. Substitution of the cysteine residue at position 125 of rIL- 2 with serine or alanine led to loss of PGI 2 -stimulatory activity in HUVECS without affecting thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes. HPLC analysis of arachidonate metabolites detected predominantly 6 keto-PGF 1 alpha (6 KPGF 1 alpha) peak. Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with cycloheximide and actinomycin D resulted in inhibition of 6 KPGF 1 alpha synthesis.

40|$|The {{covalent}} {{modification of}} proteins by metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) {{was investigated in}} human platelets. Following incubation of washed human platelets with radiolabeled AA, ethanol precipitation of the proteins, and lipid extraction by organic solvents, {{a small fraction of}} the radioactivity added (0. 3 %) was tightly bound to the protein pellet. A dozen labeled protein bands were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Exhaustive hydrolysis of platelet proteins by proteases released an amphipathic radiolabeled material which had a chromatographic behavior similar to that of a known peptidolipid, leukotriene C 4. These findings suggest a covalent nature for the observed binding. This binding was specific for AA since palmitate, myristate, or linoleate did not bind to a significant extent. It involved products of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways: it was indeed inhibited to a greater extent by eicosatetraynoic acid than by indomethacin. The protein-associated radioactivity was increased by the thromboxane synthase inhibitor dazoxiben. Indomethacin completely abolished this increase in binding, which could not be reproduced by exogenous prostaglandin (PG) E 2, F 2 alpha, or D 2, and might thus involve PGG 2 and/or PGH 2. Diamide, an agent known to inhibit the reduction of 12 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in platelets, produced an increase of the covalent binding, which was abolished by eicosatetraynoic acid but not by indomethacin: this suggests that the lipoxygenase product bound was 12 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid or a by-product. Dazoxiben and diamide produced distinct patterns of protein labeling after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One labeled band had a Mr of 70, 000 as the <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> monomer. Addition of AA at 17 microM enhanced the labeling of this band, while 100 microM was inhibitory. Labeling of this band was also induced by thrombin in prelabeled platelets. Two monoclonal antibodies against <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> caused immune precipitation of a 70 -kDa labeled protein in homogenates of [3 H]AA-labeled platelets. <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase,</b> purified from ram seminal vesicles, was covalently modified after incubation with [3 H]AA: this labeling was almost completely abolished by indomethacin. As much as 40 % of platelet <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> was covalently modified after incubation with 17 microM AA.

The present study confirms that the Hodgkin's neoplastic (Reed-Sternberg, H-RS) cells in tissue are also capable of producing prostaglandins by demonstrating the presence of <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> in these cells in B 5 -fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.

Optimum rates of superoxide were seen at concentrations of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in excess of 80 /xM and reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 3 -phosphate in excess of 100 juM.

The amounts of these eicosanoids in response to recLDL-[14 C]AA-CE were comparable to or exceeded those that were produced in response to the addition of 10 microM unesterified [1 - 14 C]AA. By contrast, resting monocytes formed only small amounts of products of the 5 -lipoxygenase pathway, leukotriene (LT) B 4 and LTC 4 from either recLDL-[14 C]AA-CE or [14 C]AA, indicating preferential utilization of AA in the <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> reaction.

PGH synthase- 1 expression, which was evaluated by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, was about twofold greater in preparations with endothelium from SHR than from WKY rats. There was no difference in PGH synthase- 1 expression between preparations with and those without endothelium in both strains. In SHR but not WKY aortas, acetylcholine (10 - 5 mol/L, 5 minutes) caused a significant endothelium-dependent release of PGH 2, as measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. PGH 2 evoked more potent contractions in rings without endothelium from SHR than from WKY rats, whereas the thromboxane analogue U 46619 and prostaglandin F(2 α) caused a comparable response in both preparations.

In this study, {{the effects of the}} cyclical expansion and relaxation of the vessel wall on endothelial cell metabolism have been modeled using a uniaxial strain device. A normal range of physiological strains for large arteries was examined. The production rates of prostacyclin (PGI 2), endothelin, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 (PAI- 1) by endothelial cells were constant over 24 hour periods. The production of both PGI 2 and endothelin was enhanced by cells exposed to a high level of cyclical strain compared to controls, while t-PA production was unaltered. These results were true for human and bovine endothelial cells. The stimulation of endothelin production was dose dependent with the level of strain while PGI 2 stimulation required a minimal level of strain before increases over controls were observed. Human endothelial cells subjected to cyclical strain showed elevated production of PAI- 1 compared to controls. The possibility that cyclical strain could be used to regulate cell function was investigated. Cyclical strain was applied in an on-off-on manner over a 36 hour period with a 12 hour division between initial application of strain and final reapplication of strain. When the strain was stopped, PGI 2 production rapidly returned to control levels while endothelin production remained elevated but at a level significantly below the initially stimulated rate. Reapplication of cyclical strain caused a return of the endothelin production rate to a level essentially the same as that during the initial stimulation period. This study initiated a quantitative investigation of cyclical strain effects on endothelial cell production of the mRNA levels of prostaglandin H (<b>PGH)</b> <b>synthase</b> gene, the enzyme of which is involved in production of PGI 2. Preliminary results using a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique suggested that mRNA levels of <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> are not altered in response to cyclical strain...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandins {{produced}} {{within the}} CL {{may serve as}} local modulators of CL function. The present {{study was designed to}} characterize the cellular mechanisms by which the cytokine interleukin- 1 (IL- 10) stimulates prostaglandin production in cul-tured luteal cells. Cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D (Act D) did not affect basal, but completely inhibited IL-l 1 -stimulated prostaglandin F 2,, (PGF,,) production (p < 0. 05). The phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) inhibitor, aristolochic acid (PLAX), and the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, compound 48 / 80 (PLCX), suppressed IL-l 0 -stimulated (p < 0. 05), but not basal, PGF 2, pro-duction. The addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA) restored the stimulatory effect of IL-l 0 in PLCX-treated, but not in PLAX-treated, cells, suggesting that PLA 2 is a key regulatory point of IL-l 3 action. Chronic exposure of the luteal cells to IL- 1 P resulted in stimulatory effects beyond that of increasing AA availability, presumably by up-regulation of prostaglandin endo-peroxide (<b>PGH)</b> <b>synthase.</b> Chronic exposure of luteal cells to IL- 1 also inhibited progesterone production, but this effect ap-peared to be independent of endogenous PGF,. production. The ability of IL- 1 p to comprehensively stimulate luteal PGF, production while inhibiting luteal progesterone production is suggestive that IL- 1 I may facilitate regression of the C...|$|E
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{mechanisms by}} which acutely activated leukocytes metabolize NO and regulate its bioactivity are unknown. Therefore, healthy, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) -deficient human neutrophils were examined {{for their ability to}} consume NO and attenuate its signaling. fMLP or PMA activation of healthy neutrophils caused NO consumption that was fully blocked by NADPH oxidase inhibition, and was absent in CGD neutrophils. Studies using MPO-deficient neutrophils, enzyme inhibitors, and reconstituted NADPH oxidase ruled out additional potential NO-consuming pathways, including Fenton chemistry, <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase,</b> lipoxygenase, or MPO. In particular, the inability of MPO to consume NO resulted from lack of H 2 O 2 substrate since all superoxide (O 2 minusdu;) reacted to form peroxynitrite. For healthy or MPO-deficient cells, NO consumption rates were 2 - to 4 -fold greater than O 2 minusdu; generation, significantly faster than expected from 1 : 1 termination of NO with O 2 minusdu; Finally, fMLP or PMA-stimulated NO consumption fully blocked NO-dependent neutrophil cGMP synthesis. These data reveal NADPH oxidase as the central regulator of NO signaling in human leukocytes. In addition, they demonstrate an important functional difference between CGD and either normal or MPO-deficient human neutrophils, namely their inability to metabolize NO which will alter their ability to adhere and migrate in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possible role of prostacyclin (PGI) in the pathogenesis of hypertension in 2 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods: Measurement of mRNA and protein levels of <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> (PGHS) - 1, PGI synthase 2 and the PGI receptor, in the thoracic aorta was performed in SHR aged 5, 10, 20, and 40 weeks old and in age-matched normotensive 2 Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rats with a competitive polymerase chain reaction method and immunoblotting. Aortic production of 6 -keto-PGF, the main metabolite of PGI, was also measured. Results: Compared with age-matched WKY rats, PGHS- 1 mRNA and protein 1 a 2 levels in the thoracic aorta of SHR increased with age, reaching three- and twofold higher than WKY rats at 40 weeks old, respectively. PGI synthase mRNA and protein levels in SHR were significantly higher than in WKY rats at 20 and 40 weeks old. In contrast, PGI 2 2 receptor mRNA levels in SHR were consistently lower than in WKY rats at all ages. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that hypertension elicits alterations in levels of arachidonic acid metabolites, including PGH and PGI. They also suggest that the decreased 2 2 expression of PGI receptor mRNA in prehypertensive SHR could be one of the causes of hypertension in SHR. Ó 1999 Elsevier 2 Science B. V.

40|$|Platelet {{activation}} is {{a hallmark}} of severe preeclampsia, and platelet <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> 1 –derived (PGHS 1 -derived) thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) has been implicated in its pathogenesis. However, genetic disruption of PGHS 1 delays parturition. We created hypomorphic PGHS 1 (PGHS 1 Neo/Neo) mice, in which the substantial but tissue-dependent variability in the inhibition of PGHS 1 -derived eicosanoids achieved by low-dose aspirin treatment is mimicked, to assess the relative impact of this strategy on hemostatic and reproductive function. Depression of platelet TxA 2 by 98 % in PGHS 1 Neo/Neo mice decreased platelet aggregation and prevented thrombosis. Similarly, depression of macrophage PGE 2 by 75 % was associated with selectively impaired inflammatory responses. PGF 2 α at 8 % WT levels was sufficient to induce coordinated temporal oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression in uterus and normal ovarian luteolysis in PGHS 1 Neo/Neo mice at late gestation, while absence of PGHS 1 expression in null mice delayed OTR induction and the programmed decrease of serum progesterone during parturition. Thus, extensive but tissue-dependent variability in PG suppression, as occurs with low-dose aspirin treatment, prevents thrombosis and impairs the inflammatory response but sustains parturition. PGHS 1 Neo/Neo mice provide a model of low-dose aspirin therapy that elucidates how prevention or delay of preeclampsia might be achieved without compromising reproductive function...|$|E
40|$|The dioxygenase-cytochrome P 450 fusion {{proteins}} (DOX-CYP) {{comprise a}} heme-containing enzyme family that shares structural and catalytic properties with mammalian prostaglandin H (PGH) synthases. 7, 8 -Linoleate diol synthase (7, 8 -LDS) of Gaeumannomyces graminis was first characterized, and DOX-CYP enzymes are of mechanistic and biological interest. The {{growing number of}} fungal genome sequences has revealed DOX-CYP homologues in medically and economically important species. The aim of this thesis was to identify novel members of the DOX-CYP fusion protein family. The devastating rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae contains two DOX-CYP genes. The fungus synthesizes 7 S, 8 S-dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (7, 8 -DiHODE) by dioxygenation of linoleic acid to 8 R-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (8 R-HPODE), and subsequent isomerisation to the diol. 7, 8 -LDS of M.  oryzae was identified by gene deletion, but the infection and reproduction processes of the Δ 7, 8 -LDS strain were not altered. A mutant with constitutive protein kinase A activity profoundly changed the oxygenation profile, possibly due to post-translational modification. The human pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus and A.  clavatus contain three DOX-CYP, designated psi producing oxygenase A (ppoA), ppoB, and ppoC, and form three oxylipins: 5 S, 8 R-DiHODE, 8 R, 11 S-DiHODE, and 10 R-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid.  PpoA was identified as 5, 8 -LDS, and ppoC as 10 R-DOX. The 8, 11 -linoleate hydroperoxide isomerase activity was reduced by two imidazole-containing P 450 inhibitors, miconazole and 1 -benzylimidazole. PpoB could not {{be linked to the}} biosynthesis of 8, 11 -DiHODE for the following reasons: First, the 8, 11 -hydroperoxide isomerase activity was retained in A.  fumigatus ΔppoB strains. Second, the P 450 domain of the deduced ppoB of A.  clavatus lacks a heme-thiolate cysteine ligand, presumably essential for hydroperoxide isomerase activity. Linoleate 9 R-DOX activities of Aspergillus terreus and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were discovered. 9 R-HPODE was further converted into unstable allene oxides, as judged by the accumulation of their hydrolysis products, α- and γ-ketols. These allene oxide synthase activities were specific for 9 R-hydroperoxides. The 9 R-DOX and AOS were found to have unique characteristics. In conclusion, novel DOX-CYP enzymes were identified in human and plant pathogenic fungi. These enzymes might be involved in biological processes, and show interesting catalytic similarities to human <b>PGH</b> <b>synthase</b> and thromboxane synthase (CYP 5 A) ...|$|E
