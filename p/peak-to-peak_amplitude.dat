Previous {{reports from}} our lab {{have shown that}} those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have decreased activity and/or coherence in delta, theta, alpha and beta cognitive responses. In the current study, we investigated gamma responses in visual SEO and ERO in 15 patients with AD and in 15 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls. The following parameters were analyzed over the parietal-occipital regions in both groups: (i) latency of the maximum gamma response over a 0 – 800 ms time window; (ii) the maximum <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses in 3 frequency ranges (25 – 30, 30 – 35, 40 – 48 Hz); and (iii) the maximum <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses over a 0 – 800 ms time block containing four divided time windows (0 – 200, 200 – 400, 400 – 600, and 600 – 800 ms). There were main group effects {{in terms of both}} latency and <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of gamma ERO. However, <b>peak-to-peak</b> gamma ERO <b>amplitude</b> differences became noticeable only when the time block was divided into four time windows. SEO amplitudes in the 25 – 30 Hz frequency range of the 0 – 200 ms time window over the left hemisphere were greater in the healthy controls than in those with AD. Gamma target ERO latency was delayed up to 138 ms in AD patients when compared to healthy controls. This finding may be an effect of lagged neural signaling in cognitive circuits, which is reflected by the delayed gamma responses in those with AD. Based on the results of this study, we propose that gamma responses should be examined in a more detailed fashion using multiple frequency and time windows...|$|R

The declination log records six well-defined oscillations with <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of 20 - 30 ". The inclinations are shallower than expected for this latitude (52 " 44 'N) which are probably due to the magnetic recording process although low geomagnetic inclinations are not ruled out.

No evidence for any geomagnetic excursions (such as the Gothenburg 'Flip') was found. The Llyn Gwernan Lateglacial palaeomagnetic record is compared with the published palaeomagnetic records for a number of European sites. Correlations between records suggest that the ages of the Llyn Gwernan palaeomagnetic features, derived from a series of radiometric radiocarbon measurements, are in general compatible with those of the European sites.

The typical <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of the variability are 10 %. Typical time-scales and an activity parameter for our variable BL Lac objects were inferred from structure function and autocorrelation function analyses. In only 4 BL Lac objects we were able to measure a characteristic time-scale, which was in the range between 1. 3 and 2. 7 days.

Consistency is found for a scenario, where x-ray selected BL Lac objects have on average stronger magnetic fields and are seen under relatively larger viewing angles than the radio-selected BL Lac objects.
