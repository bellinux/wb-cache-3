In addition, women who reported higher dispositional emotional processing also reported fewer depressive and anxious symptoms and greater life satisfaction; while for men, higher dispositional emotional expression was linked to greater life satisfaction.|$|E

Among {{a sample of the}} two largest immigrant groups in the Netherlands (wave 1, N = 1939), four acculturation strategies were identified: separation, assimilation, equal-medium integration, and high integration. Associating the acculturation strategies with four indicators of <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustments</b> (life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness) at the first and the second wave (wave 2, N = 848), a robust pattern was found over time: only the “high integration” strategy was associated with better <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Additionally, the positive outcome of the “high integration” strategy could be interpreted as an additive effect (i. e. no statistical interaction) of the beneficial impact of the national and the ethnic identification...|$|R

25|$|Cross-sectional {{research}} of cancer samples reveals some positive, negative and mixed links with emotional approach coping. Higher emotional processing and emotional expression in female cancer survivors {{was associated with}} higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions. In male cancer survivors, higher emotional processing {{has been linked to}} higher positive emotions and higher emotional expression has been linked with lower negative emotions and fewer intrusive thoughts. However, the links between emotional approach coping and <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustment</b> are not all positive some are negative or mixed. In one study of women who had received an abnormal result on an ovarian cancer screen, higher emotional processing was associated with higher intrusive thoughts and neither emotional processing nor emotional expression were associated with cancer-related post-traumatic growth.|$|E
25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustment</b> to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.|$|E
500|$|Self-control {{has been}} called the [...] "master virtue" [...] by {{clinical}} and social psychologists, suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person's overall <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustment.</b> People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing, self-esteem and openness to experience, as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations. Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life, such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder. Meanwhile, many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification. The tendency to choose short-term rewards at the expense of longer-term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} sexual identity, {{adolescence}} is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin {{to recognize and}} make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences. A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively. [...] Coming to terms with and creating a positive LGBT identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustment,</b> the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out {{in the midst of a}} heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence. [...] Because of this, statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.|$|E
2500|$|A recent {{systematic}} review of 850 research {{papers on the}} topic concluded that [...] "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior, drug/alcohol use/abuse." [...] There is substantial research suggesting that religious people are happier and less stressed. Surveys by Gallup, the National Opinion Research Center and the Pew Organization conclude that spiritually committed people {{are twice as likely}} to report being [...] "very happy" [...] than the least religiously committed people. An analysis of over 200 social studies contends that [...] "high religiousness predicts a rather lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being," [...] and a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower levels of hypertension, depression, and clinical delinquency. Surveys suggest a strong link between faith and altruism. Studies by Keith Ward show that overall religion is a positive contributor to mental health, and a meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 also found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustment,</b> being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better self-actualization.

30|$|In addition, {{experiences}} of unemployment may also leave a psychological scar. Following Erikson ([1959]), a healthy psychological ego development {{during the transition}} from adolescence to adulthood comprises identity formation that encompasses {{the formation of an}} occupational identity (see Erikson [1959]: 94 – 100). In this perspective, early unemployment may be regarded as conflicting with the formation of an occupational identity, harming perceptions of self-worth (see Goldsmith et al. [1997]). Additionally, social comparison processes adversely impact self-esteem and foster depression among unemployed (Sheeran et al. [1995]). Drawing on Seligman ([1975]), the exposure to events perceived as uncontrollable, such as unemployment, bring about a feeling of helplessness, which diminishes psychological well-being and self-esteem and further undermines the motivation to control outcomes (Seligman [1975]; Goldsmith et al. [1997]). Such poor <b>psychological</b> <b>adjustments</b> are thus in turn thought to affect job search strategies and success so that a vicious circle may ensue (Furnham [1985]).|$|R

Results Children {{with higher levels of}} identity integration, social support, family socioeconomic status, who attended public school and who lived in the third-tiered city of Weihai demonstrated better subjective wellbeing.
