40|$|Although {{theoretical}} {{investigation has}} demonstrated that fewer strain transfer layers imply a greater strain transfer ratio, as well as increased accuracy, most researchers are still focused on investigating encapsulated Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in surface strain measurements. This is because, in a traditional view, bare FBGs are too fragile to be mounted on the substrate for measuring surface strain. Polyimide FBGs may provide a better balance point between accuracy and protection. A new method to measure surface strain with <b>polyimide</b> <b>fiber</b> Bragg gratings is proposed. Bare polyimide FBGs have a polyimide coating, but like regular non-coated FBGs. This gives polyimide FBGs a higher strain transfer ratio and response frequency.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{integration}} of functional electrospun micro- and nanofiber based materials in two fields of microsystem technology: fibrous scaffolds as cell culture substrates and fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites as thermal interface materials (TIMs). Electrospun structures {{have been found to}} carry great potential as biomimicking microenvironments for future tissue engineering and cell culture applications. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, electrospun polyurethane fiber architectures have been fabricated, characterized and studied as cell culture scaffolds. The effects of plasma treatment, as a physical surface modification of the electrospun scaffold interface, are characterized and demonstrated to improve the possibility for human embryonic stem cell culture expansion. Electrospun scaffolds with specific fiber diameters are shown to allow maintenance of astrocytes with complex morphologies, limit up-regulation of protein expression related to astrocyte stress and activation, and to facilitate the formation of three-dimensional neuronal networks. Taken together, these findings indicate that electrospun scaffolds can be used to complement or improve traditional in vitro culture methods. To enable detailed studies of the interplay between physical and chemical cues for cells in controlled microenvironments, a method to integrate electrospun structures with microfluidic systems was devised. Thermal interface materials have been identified by the semiconductor industry as one of the major bottlenecks in the heat dissipation for high power density devices. The second part of this thesis presents the development of a novel metal matrix composite TIM technology utilizing fiber reinforcements formed through electrospinning. Employed as a TIM, the composite structure relies on heat conduction through its continuous metal phase, while the fiber network modifies the thermo-mechanical properties. Three specific implementations have been developed: <b>Polyimide</b> <b>fibers</b> with an indium matrix and a tin-silver-copper (SnAgCu) alloy matrix, and carbonized mesophase-pitch based fibers with a SnAgCu alloy matrix. To facilitate liquid phase infiltration of the indium matrix into the <b>polyimide</b> <b>fibers,</b> a chemical reduction based method for coating Ag nanoparticles on the fiber surface was developed. Using the same Ag coating, the SnAgCu composite was fabricated and demonstrated to exhibit a reduced elastic modulus, which indicates the potential to lower the thermally induced stress when bonding materials with thermal expansion mismatch. The expected increase in thermal conductivity when switching from polymer to carbonized fibers is found to be limited, and improved methods to reduce the thermal contact resistance at the matrix-fiber interface are needed. Measurements of low thermal contact resistances (< 1 Kmm 2 /W) and high thermal conductivities (~ 20 W/mK) show that the composite architectures are promising candidates for future applications when compared to both existing and other emerging TIM technologies...|$|R

The formed polyimide gels were dried by freeze-drying from tert-butyl alcohol to obtain polyimide aerogels, which consisted of a three-dimensional network of <b>polyimide</b> <b>fibers</b> tangled together. By varying the solution concentration of the polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups, polyimide aerogels with different densities (ranging from 0. 19 to 0. 42 g/cm(3)) were obtained.

In addition, the glass transition temperature (349 degrees C) of the polyimide aerogels was much higher than that (210 degrees C) of the corresponding linear polyimide.

Three of these fibers have greatly contributed {{to the safety of}} all the space missions since the Apollo program. Beta alumina-silica microfiber developed for the outer layer of the space suit after the Apollo 1 fire is no longer used and has been replaced by other glass fibers. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) fiber used in the current spacesuit is mostly known today through its trade mark Gore-Tex.

The composition and thickness of the solder oxide have {{a direct impact on}} the quality of interconnects and the reliability of a packaged system. The characterization of the nano-scale oxide of lead-free solder particles is investigated by transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The solder powders are exposed to air at 150 oC for 0, 120 and 240 h. The oxide thickness is 6 nm and 50 nm measured by STEM for 0 h and 120 h samples, respectively. The increase in oxide thickness of solder particles is proportional to the rooting of the oxidation time. The intersection analysis method for analyzing Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiles is also presented which could be expand to analyze oxide of other alloy, i. e. Cu, Ag or stainless steel. In the next part of this thesis, a new composite design consisting of electrospun <b>polyimide</b> <b>fiber</b> networks and infiltrated metal matrix is presented. Three composites are fabricated including polyimide fiber-InSnBi, polyimide fiber-indium and polyimide fiber-SnAgCu composites. The microstructure of the composite is investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray detector and X-ray diffraction, showing a good bonding between the fibers and the metal matrix. These composites demonstrate high thermal conductivity, low thermal contact resistance and reliable thermomechanical performance during thermal cycling. The polyimide fiber-indium composites are sandwiched between chips and heat spreaders with different packaged sizes to detect the junction temperature and junction-to-case thermal resistance. The shear strength of the polyimide fiber-indium composite between Sn surfaces can reach 4 MPa which is larger than that with Au and Cu surfaces. Both composites present good reliability during the humidity-heat aging tests. The polyimide fiber-indium composite’s ultimate tensile strength at 20 °C is five times higher than that of the pure indium, and the tensile strength of the composite exceeds the summation of those from its individual components. With the increase in temperature, the ultimate tensile strength declines but still precedes pure indium and the elongation at fracture increases. Contrary to most metallic materials, the ultimate tensile strength of the composite is inversely proportional to the logarithmic strain rate in a certain range. Finally, a new strengthening mechanism is presented based on mutually reinforcing structures formed by the indium and surrounding fibers, underlining the effect of compressing at the fiber-indium interfaces by dislocation pileups and slip pinning. The creep threshold of the composite corresponds to the fracture strength of the <b>polyimide</b> <b>fiber,</b> and the step-like sudden increases of the composite’s creep strain are due to the breakage of fibers. The fiber-indium interfaces are also beneficial to the composite’s creep resistance. In the final part of the thesis, two novel thermal interface materials are developed and characterized including boron nitride fiber-indium composite and carbon fiber-SnAgCu composite. Thermally conductive boron nitride fiber or carbon fiber is prepared via electrospinning and heat treatment.

The technology of preparation of polymer compositions comprised of the following steps: mixing, pelletizing, drying and molding. Mixing of the compositions was performed in a rotating electromagnetic field. Under the action of the rotating electromagnetic field, ferromagnetic particles cаme into intensive chaotic motion, which leads to a uniform distribution of fibers in a polymer matrix. Molding samples was performed by compression molding. We study the thermal, physical, mechanical and tribological properties of polymer composites created.

Navy has been seeking lightweight, high-temperature-resistant electrical-insulation materials in a program directed toward reducing fire hazards and weights in ship electrical systems. To satisfy the requirements of this program, an electrical-insulation material must withstand a 3 -hour gas-flame test at 1, 600 F (about 871 C). Prior to the development reported here, RP 46 was rated for use at temperatures from - 150 to + 700 F (about - 101 to 371 C), and no polymeric product - not even RP 46 - was expected to withstand the Navy 3 -hour gas-flame test...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{reinforcing}} porous substrate {{that features}} unprecedented capability of offering proton conductivity is demonstrated for potential {{use in a}} reinforced composite proton exchange membrane. The unusual porous substrate (hereinafter, referred to as "sPI substrate") is composed of 3 -trihydroxysilyl propane- 1 -sulfonic acid (THSPSA) -based silicate coating layers and electrospun <b>polyimide</b> (PI) nonwoven <b>fibers.</b> The THSPSA coating layers bearing sulfonic acid groups endow the sPI substrate with strong affinity for water molecules and also afford appreciable proton conductivity. Another distinctive characteristic of the sPI substrate is the nanoarchitectured structure of the THSPSA coating layers (shell) that encapsulate the PI nonwoven fibers (core). As a result, the core-shell structured sPI substrate maintains a highly porous structure, which {{plays a crucial role}} in providing effective proton-conducting channels after the impregnation of a polymer electrolyte (herein, sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPAES)). Notably, owing to the assistance of the proton-conductive sPI substrate, the sPI substrate-reinforced SPAES composite membrane presents higher proton conductivity than a PI nonwoven-reinforced SPAES composite membrane under various relative humidity (RH) conditions. This intriguing proton conductivity behavior is discussed based on an in-depth understanding of the unique core-shell structure and functionality of the sPI substrate and, moreover, is quantitatively interpreted by estimating theoretical proton conductivities predicted from series and parallel two-layer models. close 12...|$|R
40|$|Further {{crosslinking}} of the {{fluorinated polyimide}} was examined {{to separate the}} cure reactions from degradation and to determine the optimum post curing conditions. Glass transition/melting temperatures were ascertained using DSC, while weight loss during curing and Td were determined using TGA. Furthermore, the mechanical properties were measured using an Instron {{to relate to the}} thermal properties to find the optimum curing conditions. The polyimide resin exhibited the best post-curing conditions for further crosslinking for 8 hours at 410 degress C based on Tg, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. Blister temperatures, resulting from rapid heating, were obtained by monitoring changes in transverse thickness expansion using two different techniques. Both techniques employed showed similar blister temperatures in relation to the amount of absorbed moisture, regardless of sample size. The polyimide resin exhibited blister temperatures ranging from 225 - 362 degrees C, with 1. 7 - 3. 0 wt% absorbed moisture, and the polyimide composite had blister temperatures from 246 - 294 degrees C with 0. 5 - 1. 5 wt% moisture. Weight loss of the fluorinated polyimide and its corresponding <b>polyimide</b> carbon <b>fiber</b> composite under elevated temperature was examined. Weight loss as a function of exposure temperature and time was measured using TGA and by pre- and post-weighing of specimens treated in an oven. Both techniques showed similar weight loss trends as a function of time and temperature, but TGA showed much greater weight loss due to greater surface area to volume (i. e., small sample size). The neat polyimide resin and carbon fiber composite exhibited negligible weight loss at temperatures below 430 degrees C for exposure times up to 20 minutes. Transition-metal carbides were initially synthesized by carbothermal reduction of transition-metal halides and polymer precursor mixtures, at temperatures that range from 900 to 1500 degrees C in an argon atmosphere. TaC was synthesized from TaBr 5, as a model carbide for this process. Significant (> 40 vol%) amounts of TaC were formed at reaction temperatures as low as 900 degrees C for one hour, with greater times and temperatures leading to > 90 vol% yield. Universality of method was also proven by using other various transition-metal halide salts (NbBr 5, WCl 4, and WCl 6) with the polyimide...|$|R
40|$|In this study, creep {{response}} of metals and polyimide composites at elevated temperatures are analyzed by using empirical models. Empirical models are typically constructed based on experimental observations and their material parameters are calibrated by fitting experimental data. Although empirical models {{do not provide}} physical insight into the creep responses of materials, they are practical in structural design applications since they are expressed in simple mathematical functions. Creep responses of Copper alloy NARloy-Z and Titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V are analyzed in this study by using empirical approach. Deformation-mechanism maps are used to predict their creep behaviors at various stresses and temperatures, and determine the design stresses based on their creep responses. Parametric studies are also conducted to {{provide the basis for}} the parameter fitting process. Furthermore, the effect of energy dissipation is incorporated into a phenomenological viscoplastic model to further understand the creep and cyclic responses of NARloy-Z. It is noted that the phenomenological model allows for rigorously incorporating the energy dissipation effect, {{which is one of the}} prominent characteristics of time-dependent materials, while the empirical model is limited. From the analyses, it is concluded that the amount of energy dissipation is much more pronounced under cyclic loading, while it is negligible under creep loading. Higher amount of energy dissipation leads to a more pronounced stress softening behavior, which is one of the sources for material failures. The empirical model and deformation maps are extended to understand creep responses of <b>polyimides</b> and carbon/polyimide <b>fiber</b> composites at elevated temperatures. PMR- 15 polyimide is used as an example to illustrate how empirical model is used to predict the creep response. Rule of mixtures is considered to capture the creep {{response of}} carbon/polyimide composite. Results showed that empirical models can give reasonable predictions of creep behaviors for alloys, polyimides, and polyimide composites along axial fiber direction. Thus, the model can be used to construct deformation maps and determine design (allowable) stresses for structural design purposes...|$|R
40|$|The term HYCARB denotes {{a hybrid}} {{composite}} of polyimide matrices reinforced with carbon and boron fibers. HYCARB and an improved process for fabricating dry HYCARB tapes have been invented in a continuing {{effort to develop}} lightweight, strong composite materials for aerospace vehicles. Like other composite tapes in this line of development, HYCARB tapes are intended {{to be used to}} build up laminated structures having possibly complex shapes by means of automated tow placement (ATP) - a process in which a computer-controlled multiaxis machine lays down prepreg tape or tows. The special significance of the present process for making dry HYCARB for ATP is that it contributes to the reduction of the overall cost of manufacturing boron-reinforced composite-material structures while making it possible to realize increased compression strengths. The present process for making HYCARB tapes incorporates a "wet to dry" process developed previously at Langley Research Center. In the "wet to dry" process, a flattened bundle of carbon fiber tows, pulled along a continuous production line between pairs of rollers, is impregnated with a solution of a poly(amide acid) in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP), then most of the NMP is removed by evaporation in hot air. In the present case, the polyamide acid is, more specifically, that of LaRC. IAX (or equivalent) thermoplastic <b>polyimide,</b> and the <b>fibers</b> are, more specifically, Manganite IM 7 (or equivalent) polyacrylonitrile- based carbon filaments that have a diameter of 5. 2 m and are supplied in 12, 000 -filament tows. The present process stands in contrast to a prior process in which HYCARB tape was made by pressing boron fibers into the face of a wet carbon-fiber/ poly(amide acid) prepreg tape. that is, a prepreg tape from which the NMP solvent had not been removed. In the present process, one or more layer(s) of side-by-side boron fibers are pressed between dry prepreg tapes that have been prepared by the aforementioned gwet to dry h process. The multilayer tape is then heated to imidize the matrix material and remove most of the remaining solvent, and is pressed to consolidate the multiple layers into a dense tape. For tests, specimens of HYCARB tapes and laminated composite panels made from HYCARB tape were prepared as follows: HYCARB tapes were fabricated as described above. Each panel was made by laying down ten layers of tape, containing, variously, one, two, or three boron-fiber plies and the remainder carbon- fiber-only plies (see figure). Each panel was made by laying down ten layers of tape. Each panel was then cured by heating to a temperature of 225 C for 15 minutes, then pressing at 200 psi (A 1. 4 MPa) while heating to 371 C, holding at 371 C for 1 hour, then continuing to hold pressure during cooling. Control specimens that were otherwise identical except that they did not contain boron fibers also were prepared. In room-temperature flexural tests, the HYCARB specimens performed comparably to the control specimens; in room-temperature, open-hole compression tests, the HYCARB specimens performed slightly better, by amounts that increased with boron content...|$|R
