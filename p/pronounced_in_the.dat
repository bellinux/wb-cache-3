5|$|Relations between an-Nasir Yusuf and the Bahri Mamluks grew tense {{after the}} former refused to invade Egypt. In October 1257, Baibars {{and his fellow}} Mamluks left Damascus or were {{expelled}} {{from the city and}} together they moved south to Jerusalem. When the governor Kutuk refused to aid them against an-Nasir Yusuf, Baibars deposed him and had al-Mugith Umar, the emir of Karak, <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> khutba at the al-Aqsa Mosque; over the years, al-Mugith Umar had allowed the political dissidents of Cairo and Damascus, who sought protection from either the Mamluk and Ayyubid authorities, a safe haven within his territory.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga Dynasty (350–1000 CE) {{kings of}} Karnataka built many Hindu temples along with saptamatrika carvings and memorials, {{containing}} sculptural details of saptamatrikas. The evidence of Matrika sculptures is further <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gurjara–Patiharas (8th to 10th century A.D.) and Chandella period (8th to 12th century A.D.). The Chalukyas {{claimed to have}} been nursed by the Sapta Matrikas. It was a popular practice to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom in ancient times. During the Chalukya period (11th to 13th century), all Matrikas continued to figure among the deity sculptures of this period.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} {{of this system}} with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's pronunciation {{was in no way}} unusual, this permits scholars of history of English to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of exactly how Middle English was <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midlands {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century (Matthew 2004, p.936).|$|E
5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear dorsals.|$|E

5|$|The progressions in {{northern}} art developed almost simultaneously {{with the early}} Italian Renaissance. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, {{to the extent that}} many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, {{as can be seen in}} the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially <b>pronounced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
