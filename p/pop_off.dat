500|$|The Cure {{are often}} {{identified}} with the gothic rock genre, and are viewed {{as one of the}} form's definitive bands. Selecting the Best for One Side of a C90 |last=Doran |first=John |date=27 October 2008 |website=The Quietus}} However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006, [...] "It's so pitiful when 'goth' is still tagged onto the name the Cure", and added, [...] "We're not categorisable. I suppose we were post-punk when we came out, but in total it's impossible [...] I just play Cure music, whatever that is." [...] Smith has also expressed his distaste for gothic rock, describing it as [...] "incredibly dull and monotonous. A dirge, really." [...] While typically viewed as producers of dark and gloomy music, the Cure have also yielded a number of upbeat songs and been part of the new wave movement. Spin has said [...] "the Cure have always been an either/or sort of band: either [...] Robert Smith is wallowing in gothic sadness or he's licking sticky-sweet cotton-candy <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> his lipstick-stained fingers." ...|$|E

R3hab went on to compliment Porcelain Black's original song, stating, [...] "The original vibe is crazy, and I am {{a big fan of}} Lil Wayne. This track makes you wanna rage like the lyrics say! I see [...] as a rollercoaster ride. Breaks slow it down. Then there is a climb, and the big drop!" [...] Porcelain Black complimented R3hab's remix in an interview with MTV News: [...] "I wish his remixes were the official singles because they really <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> next level. I love all the spooky horror pop synths he throws in the mixes, and the breakdowns make me wanna throw back shots of whiskey and hair whip. If I could have sex with a song I'd def be tappin’ dat remix!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A pushdown {{automaton}} reads a given input string {{from left}} to right. In each step, it chooses a transition by indexing a table by input symbol, current state, and the symbol {{at the top of}} the stack. [...] A pushdown automaton can also manipulate the stack, as part of performing a transition. The manipulation can be to push a particular symbol to the top of the stack, or to <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> the top of the stack. The automaton can alternatively ignore the stack, and leave it as it is.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{incident}} {{happened in}} 2012. Due {{to the summer}} heat, {{the head of the}} Jelly Bean statue <b>popped</b> <b>off,</b> and one of the jelly beans inside was stolen. This prompted Android engineer Dan Morrill to post on Google+, [...] "Jelly Bean is so ridiculously hot that the JB statue overheated, and his head partially melted and <b>popped</b> <b>off.</b> And then we think somebody stole one of the jelly beans. People: please don't steal our jelly beans." [...] The statue has since been repaired.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly {{after its}} introduction, the Corvair faced {{competition}} from the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet and was plagued by problems—though according to a 1960 Time report, [...] "many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car." [...] Problems included an engine cooling fan belt that tended to <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> its 2-axis pulleys (unless the fan ran constantly, the air-cooled engine would overheat and seize), carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage [...] "which sometimes runs well under 20 m.p.g." [...] The 1960 model gasoline heater was cited as a problem, which itself could consume up to a quart of gas an hour—with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair's carburetors to improve economy.|$|E
2500|$|Orange Man {{marked the}} debut for the highly {{successful}} [...] "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" [...] television campaign, created by HHCL throughout its first run, which would continue {{in its first}} run until 1996. Although Orange Man was the most notorious of the advertisements, other advertisements in the campaign also proved to be controversial and were banned, including Exploding Pensioner (1993) which offended pensioners and several charity groups such as Age Concern, Scotsman (1994)–which featured a legless, blue afro-sporting orange Scotsman–for scaring children, and another 1994 advertisement featuring a man's head <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> from his body, which was banned during children's programming for also being too frightening. Nonetheless, by 1994, the campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market. One commentary later said [...] "While it's {{a matter of debate}} as to how offensive these ads were deemed, as opposed to how good HHCL were at pretending they were offensive and exploiting the publicity, the phrase 'You Know When You've Been Tango'd' wasn't going anywhere for the next decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 1999, Mary Ellen Matthews {{has been}} the {{official}} photographer of SNL, responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday. Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: [...] "I think it just helps the image <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> the screen...If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional...The [...] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can." [...] Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.|$|E

2500|$|The Man Who Fell in Love {{with the}} Moon {{was very well}} {{received}} when {{it was published in}} 1991. The Washington Post called it [...] "amazing" [...] and [...] "dazzlingly accomplished" [...] and The Oregonian said the novel [...] "boldly creates a new voice from the Old West." [...] The New York Times was equally effusive: [...] "The miracle of the novel is that it obliges us to rethink our whole idea of narration and history and myth." [...] The Los Angeles Times found it [...] "brave, original, ribald, funny, [...] heart-rending" [...] and concluded that the book is [...] "as bright as it is dark, full of fictional and philosophical pleasures, a quirky, unsettling look at American history and a vision quest in the grand old tradition." [...] The book's extensive cast of quirky characters was singled out by several reviewers. The Washington Post said the characters were [...] "winningly rebellious...brimming with life", while the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said [...] "Spanbauer has populated his pages with characters so colorfully drawn they practically <b>pop</b> <b>off</b> the page and start dancing, egged on by mass consumption of whiskey, locoweed and opium stardust." [...] Reviewers compared Spanbauer to Mark Twain, D. H. Lawrence, Gabriel García Márquez, Garrison Keillor, Thomas Berger, Walt Whitman, William H. Gass, Molly Gloss, and Russell Hoban.|$|E
