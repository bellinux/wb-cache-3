5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive <b>provisioning).</b> Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass <b>provisioning).</b>|$|E

The nest varies from {{a hole in the}} ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the value relevance of the legally mandated <b>provisions.</b> This paper examines the effects of changes in <b>provisions</b> on the value relevance of earnings. The results show that the calculation of <b>provisions</b> will deteriorate the relevance of earnings when the changes in <b>provisions</b> may artificially and mechanically smooth earnings. However, the <b>provision</b> for railroad maintenance functions as a allocation method of operating revenues and the <b>provision</b> for insurance payment functions as a allocation method of operating expenses. These <b>provisions</b> seem to improve the value relevance of earnings. Therefore, we cannot discriminate against the legally mandated <b>provisions</b> for the very reason that their calculation is formally restricted. Whether <b>provision</b> is legally mandated or not, we still have many unresolved problems about <b>provisions</b> on the disclosure in the balance sheet and on the calculation in the income statement. ...|$|R

English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the <b>provisioning</b> of their nests.

We specifically focus on the determinants of the six E-index <b>provisions</b> that were proposed by Bebchuk et al. (2009) to conversely affect firm value. The six <b>provisions</b> are split into two indices: those that provide managers with a monetary benefit if a takeover was successful (MB <b>provisions)</b> and those that do not (TP <b>provisions).</b> Results indicate that CEOs with a role duality use their power to influence the adoption of MB <b>provisions</b> and resist the adoption of TP <b>provisions.</b> Moreover, in the presence of CEO duality, the relationship between MB <b>provisions</b> and firm value worsens. On the other hand, the relationship between TP <b>provisions</b> and firm value is unaffected by the presence of CEO duality. This suggests that CEOs having a role duality do not feel the need to work in the shareholders’ best interest when entrenched with MB <b>provisions.</b> Our findings suggest that studying all the <b>provisions</b> of the E-index as a whole can be misleading in some cases...|$|R
