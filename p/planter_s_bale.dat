Approximately 200, 000 adult interviews are completed each year in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. The challenge for BRFSS is how to effectively manage an increasingly complex surveillance system that serves the needs of numerous programs while facing changing telecommunication technology and the greater demand for more local-level data. To determine options and recommendations for how best to meet BRFSS future challenges, CDCs Behavioral Surveillance Branch conducted a 2 -day strategy workshop, attended by survey-research specialists. The workshop featured presentations on the current system; emerging technologic challenges; telephone-surveying techniques; program perspectives of CDC, partner organizations, and states; and recommendations for change.

40|$|The human repair {{proteins}} XPA and ERCC 1 {{have been}} shown to be absolutely required for the incision step of nucleotide excision repair, and recently we identified an interaction between these two proteins both in vivo and in vitro (L. Li, S. J. Elledge, C. A. Peterson, E. <b>S.</b> <b>Bales,</b> and R. J. Legerski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 : 5012 - 5016, 1994). In this report, we demonstrate the functional relevance of this interaction. The ERCC 1 -binding domain on XPA was previously mapped to a region containing two highly conserved XPA sequences, Gly- 72 to Phe- 75 and Glu- 78 to Glu- 84, which are termed the G and E motifs, respectively. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to independently delete these motifs and create two XPA mutants referred to as delta G and delta E. In vitro, the binding of ERCC 1 to delta E was reduced by approximately 70 %, and binding to delta G was undetectable; furthermore, both mutants failed to complement XPA cell extracts in an in vitro DNA repair synthesis assay. In vivo, the delta E mutant exhibited an intermediate level of complementation of XPA cells and the delta G mutant exhibited little or no complementation. In addition, the delta G mutant inhibited repair synthesis in wild-type cell extracts, indicating that it is a dominant negative mutant. The delta E and delta G mutations, however, did not affect preferential binding of XPA to damaged DNA. These results suggest that the association between XPA and ERCC 1 is a required step in the nucleotide excision repair pathway and that the probable role of the interaction is to recruit the ERCC 1 incision complex to the damage site. Finally, the affinity of the XPA-ERCC 1 complex was found to increase as a function of salt concentration, indicating a hydrophobic interaction; the half-life of the complex was determined to be approximately 90 min...|$|R

Seventy percent of health-care costs in the United States are for chronic diseases. In 1999, to allow public health officials to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists released Indicators for Chronic Disease Surveillance. The report provided standard definitions for 73 indicators developed by epidemiologists and chronic disease program directors at the state and federal level. The indicators were selected because of their importance to public health and the availability of state-level data. This report describes the latest revisions to the chronic disease indicators. The revised set of 92 indicators includes 63 indicators that were unchanged from the first edition, six that have been revised, and 23 that are new. Four indicators from the first edition were deleted. Of the indicators, 24 are for cancer; 15 for cardiovascular disease; 11 for diabetes; seven for alcohol; five each for nutrition and tobacco; three each for oral health, physical activity, and renal disease; and two each for asthma, osteoporosis, and immunizations.

40|$|Selection of a rainfall-runoff {{model is}} a compromisebetween model {{complexity}} and available inputdata. While more complex models should betterrepresent the physical processes, the assumption that they lead to more reliable results has been questioned (Loague and Freeze, 1985). They have shown that simpler, less data-intensive models provided as good or better simulations than physically based models. An empirical {{model is a}} representation of data and has no real theoretical basis. A physically based model {{is one that has}} a theoretical basis and whose parameters and variables are measurable in the field (Beven, 1983). In reality, many empirical relationships are used for parameter estimation by the “physically based ” models (Wilcox et al., 1990). The SCS runoff equation is basically an empirical model which came into common use in the 1950 s. It is the product of more than 20 years of studies involving rainfall runoff relationships from small rural watersheds. The model was developed to provide a consistent basis for estimating the amounts of runoff under varying land use and soil types (Rallison and Miller, 1981). No other rainfall-runoff model has been used as successfully or as often on ungaged rangeland catchments as the CN (Graf, 1988). A major limitation of the curve number method is that rainfall intensity and duration are not considered, only total rainfall volume. Time-based physical models such as Green-Ampt are thought to better mimic the impacts of land use on runoff, because infiltration parameters can be directly related to catchment characteristics (Wilcox et al., 1990). However, such models require disaggregated daily precipitation data which are difficult to obtain. Even though the Green-Ampt equation has a physical basis, much may be lost or diluted by the regression equations needed to parameterize the model (Wilcox et al., 1990). In a study of 585 storm events on 36 watersheds in six physiographic provinces of the Central and Eastern U. <b>S.,</b> <b>Bales</b> and Betson (1981) concluded that the curve number appears to be a good numeric index of land use and is potentially a useful basin characteristic for use in hydrologic model regionalization.

40|$|According to the World Health Organization's World Health Report 1997, {{diseases}} {{of the heart and}} circulatory system account for more than 15 million deaths per year. Even though methods of prevention are now well known, the number of deaths due to heart attack and stroke are expected to continue rising. Concern over this growing epidemic led to the organization of the International Heart Health Conferences, which brought together scientists, policymakers, and health professionals from around the world. The goal of the first conference, held in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1992, was to discuss methods of applying existing knowledge about cardiovascular disease (CVD) toward its prevention on a global scale. To that end, the Advisory Board for the conference published The Victoria Declaration on Heart Health and formed the Victoria Declaration Implementation Committee to carry out policies emanating from International Heart Health conferences. The Second International Heart Health Conference, held in Barcelona, Spain, in 1995, focused on financial constraints as perhaps the greatest barrier to global CVD prevention. Acknowledging that economic considerations will influence efforts to lessen the gap between accumulating and applying CVD prevention techniques, the Advisory Board published a second document, The Catalonia Declaration: Investing in Heart Health. This document asserts that investing in heart health now will save money in the long term. It also provides a list of 14 recommendations for promoting heart health, presents resources for and barriers to implementing CVD prevention programs, and highlights 41 successful projects that have been implemented around the world. Although The Catalonia Declaration provides valuable information on research, policy, and programs, people who wish to initiate prevention programs may require more indepth information. Accordingly, this companion document, Worldwide Efforts to Improve Heart Health: A Follow-up to the Catalonia Declaration 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 dSelected Program Descriptions, was developed to further explore case studies presented in The Catalonia Declaration and to discuss many other programs that promote heart health.

There is concern that a cotton gin in an eradication zone may serve as a site of boll weevil reintroductions when processing cotton harvested in a neighboring infested zone. Similarly, there is a question whether weevil-free areas can safely import gin products, such as cottonseed and baled lint, from infested areas without risking an introduction. Many countries require fumigation of imported U. <b>S.</b> cotton <b>bales</b> to protect against boll weevil introductions, costing the U. S. cotton industry millions of dollars annually. In previously reported experiments, we quantified the potential for boll weevils to survive passage through precleaning machinery in the gin. In this study, we quantified survival potential of boll weevils passing through the gin stand and segregating into the cottonseed, mote, or lint fractions. We also examined boll weevil survival when passed with ginned lint through a lint cleaner. We present a flow chart of experimentally determined survival potentials of boll weevils passing through the various subprocesses of the gin, from which one can calculate the risk of a live boll weevil reaching any point in the process. Our data show that there is virtually no chance of a boll weevil being segregated alive into the cottonseed or of one surviving in the lint to approach the bale press. Therefore, quarantine or fumigation of cottonseed and cotton bales to guard against boll weevil introductions is unnecessary...|$|R

We present a scenario resulting in time-dependent behaviour of the bow shock and transient, local ion reflection under unchanging solar wind conditions. Dayside magnetopause reconnection produces flux transfer events driving fast-mode wave fronts in the magnetosheath. These fronts push out the bow shock surface due to their increased downstream pressure. The resulting bow shock deformations lead to a configuration favourable to localized ion reflection and thus the formation of transient, travelling foreshock-like field-aligned ion beams. This is identified in two-dimensional global magnetospheric hybrid-Vlasov simulations of the Earth's magnetosphere performed using the Vlasiator model ([URL] We also present observational data showing the occurrence of dayside reconnection and flux transfer events {{at the same time}} as Geotail observations of transient foreshock-like field-aligned ion beams. The spacecraft is located well upstream of the foreshock edge and the bow shock, during a steady southward interplanetary magnetic field and in the absence of any solar wind or interplanetary magnetic field perturbations. This indicates the formation of such localized ion foreshocks. The simulation was run on the Sisu supercomputer at the CSC – IT Center for Science, Espoo, Finland. We thank T.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in two main parts. The first part compares and {{contrasts}} early experiments with non-slave labour in Cuba and Sao Paulo. The second part considers {{projects for the}} gradual abolition of slavery and the transition to free labour. The objective is to examine how Cuban and Brazilian planters solved the problem of labour supply triggered by a rapid growth of plantation exports during the nineteenth century. At this time sugar and coffee plantations came to characterize economic development in the two areas. Continued expansion was threatened by international pressures to end the trans- Atlantic slave trade. Challenged by international demands to terminate the "African trade" Cuba and Brazil sought to solve the labour problem by means of immigration. From the mid-century {{until the end of}} slavery in the 1880 <b>s,</b> <b>planters</b> would experiment with several labour systems, involving a variety of labour relations. Besides slaves, Europeans, Chinese, Mexican Indians, Canary Islanders, and free domestic workers (white and coloured) would be employed on the plantations. Substituting "free" labour for slave labour was {{not simply a matter of}} labour supply. For Cuba there was the question of the relationship with Spain and its consequences for the defense of slavery and the impact on immigration. For Brazil there was the question of forging a national identity. What would be the place of slaves, freedmen and immigrants in the new nation. In both regions these considerations had a racial dimension. Also planters were anxious to secure a cheap disciplined workforce. What labour system would best meet these requirements? As this thesis demonstrates this was a time of experimentation. From the first, in Brazil alternative supplies of labour were regarded as a means of transition to free labour. In Cuba new supplies of workers were viewed as complementing slavery. But the first experiments with non-slave labour affected the processes of the abolition of slavery and the transition to free labour while the meaning of "free labour” and “transition” also changed over time...|$|R

Through {{the introduction of a}} required, credit-based class, a small NAIA university has shown improvements in their athletic performance. PURPOSE: To determine if a required, credit-based class would improve athletic performance amongst NAIA collegiate athletes. METHODS: All rostered athletes (2010 year: N = 192; 2011 year: N = 208; 2012 year: N = 204) at a small NAIA university were required to register for a sports conditioning class, beginning in the fall of 2010 to the present. All in-season athletes (15 men’s basketball; 14 women’s basketball; 23 women’s soccer; 18 men’s soccer; 14 golf; 16 track; 29 cross country; 14 volleyball; 40 baseball; 21 softball) met a minimum of 1 x/wk and all off-season athletes meet a minimum of 2 x/wk. Each sport would perform sports specific programs for 60 minutes on each required day, ranging in skills from Olympic lifts to plyometric training. All athletes are tested in September, December, and April on vertical jump, 20 yard dash, 5 - 10 - 5, and body weight. Team records were kept to test improvement. RESULTS: Statistical significant improvements were seen in measurements for athletes, September to December 2012, in increased vertical jump, t (186) = 2. 61, p 3 ̆c. 01; faster 5 - 10 - 5, t (164) = 5. 362, p 3 ̆c. 001.

40|$|Alfalfa stem {{can be a}} {{potential}} feedstock for producing bioethanol. Numerous studies {{have been carried out}} to assess the conversion of different feedstocks into bioethanol, although studies related to life cycle assessment (LCA) of feedstocks such as alfalfa are limited. However, LCA does serve to highlight areas where positive and negative impacts can be expected in the overall biomass to ethanol process. This research therefore focuses on investigating and evaluating an alfalfa bioethanol production system in terms of five key life cycle impact categories: abiotic depletion (AD), acidification (A), eutrophication (E), global warming (GW), human toxicity (HT), and energy demand. The study concerns three subsystems: the cultivation subsystem (<b>S</b> 1), the <b>baling</b> and pre-processing subsystem (S 2), and the ethanol conversion subsystem (S 3). Each subsystem could have different scenarios depending on specified input combinations, and SimaPro 7. 2 with CML 2 baseline 1990 V 2. 05 version was used to assess environmental impacts. The results of energy assessment correspond to LCA results, showing that the environmental impact associated with alfalfa-ethanol production increases with increased energy demand. Energy analysis of S 1 showed that the energy requirements for producing 1 kg of alfalfa under non-irrigated and irrigated cultivation were between 0. 63 MJ to 1. 30 MJ and 0. 51 MJ to 0. 94 MJ, respectively. The best input combination in S 1 was inorganic fertilizer with irrigation, for it consumed 0. 51 MJ/kg energy and resulted in the least environmental impact. The energy requirements for the postharvest pre-processing of 1 kg of alfalfa biomass were 0. 82 MJ to 1. 62 MJ under different iii scenarios, with the drum drying requiring the highest energy in S 2 : 0. 197 MJ of electricity and heat per hectare. Considering the three systems (namely S 1, S 2, and S 3) demonstrates that irrigated alfalfa production scenarios revealed lower energy demands in comparison to nonirrigated scenarios; inorganic scenarios showed lower energy demand over organic scenarios. Compared to the use of organic fertilizers, application of inorganic fertilizers has decreased the impact with respect to AD, A, GW, and HT while slightly increasing E in S 1, S 2, and S 3. Therefore, the most favourable scenario was the inorganic irrigated scenario in all subsystems. The LCA results concluded that GW was the most influential impact category for all three subsystems, whereas AD, A, E, and HT had a comparatively lower impact on each system. To produce 1 L of ethanol, 32. 78 MJ (minimum) to 38. 43 MJ (maximum) of energy input was required for S 3 in all production scenarios at 50 % water recycling. In S 1, S 2, and S 3, the inorganic irrigated scenarios had lower energy demands than the organic irrigated scenarios. The highest energy consuming process in S 3 was ethanol plant heat energy. Overall, the inorganic, irrigated, and 50 % water recycling represented the best case scenario for all subsystems (S 1, S 2, and S 3) in terms of energy demand with an average of 7. 82 MJ for 1 kg of alfalfa biomass input. Comparing the three subsystems shows that the alfalfa cultivation subsystem (S 1) consumed 6. 2 % to 15. 1 % of the total energy. The ethanol conversion subsystem (S 3) is the highest energy consuming subsystem in this study, falling into the 77. 5 % - 94. 8 % range of the total for different scenarios. The baling and pre-processing subsystem (S 2) required between 3. 5 % and iv 4. 0 % of the total energy.
