5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of <b>Perpendicular</b> Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early <b>Perpendicular</b> work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of the chapter house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E

60|$|Two {{opposite}} {{points are}} to be observed concerning a priori general propositions. The first is that, if many particular instances are known, our general proposition may be arrived at {{in the first instance}} by induction, and the connexion of universals may be only subsequently perceived. For example, it is known that if we draw <b>perpendiculars</b> to the sides of a triangle from the opposite angles, all three <b>perpendiculars</b> meet in a point. It would be quite possible to be first led to this proposition by actually drawing <b>perpendiculars</b> in many cases, and finding that they always met in a point; this experience might lead us to look for the general proof and find it. Such cases are common in the experience of every mathematician.|$|R

5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} the wall is vertical (<b>perpendicular</b> to the base) and the upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards.

5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped together into a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). In the early nineteenth century examples influenced by the English <b>Perpendicular</b> included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly <b>perpendicular</b> form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
