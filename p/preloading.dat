Recent findings: Clinical data from several studies underscore the inability of measures of ventricular filling to assess either <b>preload</b> or <b>preload</b> responsiveness. Whereas less invasive monitoring techniques than pulmonary arterial catheterization demonstrate better discriminations with estimates of both <b>preload</b> and <b>preload</b> responsiveness. Measuring dynamic changes in stroke volume, descending aortic flow, and both superior and inferior vena caval diameters during ventilation provides good predictive value in defining <b>preload</b> responsiveness. One study demonstrated that resuscitation protocols keyed to esophageal flow measures improved outcome in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.

Fifty-six subjects participated in the present study which consisted of four randomised test days, i. e. 1 d per macronutrient and one control day. During each test day, the subjects were required to consume the <b>preload</b> in full, and then their subsequent food intake was measured. The volunteers were divided into two groups: the first (T 0) group, which consumed the <b>preload</b> immediately before lunch, and the second (T 1) group, which consumed it 1 h beforehand. The main results showed that the participants consumed significantly less at lunch following the consumption of all three <b>preloads</b> than on the no-preload day, and consumed less after the consumption of the carbohydrate <b>preload</b> than after the consumption of the lipid <b>preload.</b> When energy from the <b>preload</b> was included, overall energy intake was significantly greater in all the three <b>preload</b> conditions than in the situation involving no <b>preload,</b> with only partial compensation for <b>preload</b> energy in all conditions. Total daily energy intake was highest after the lipid <b>preload</b> ingestion, but this could be a chance finding since it was not significantly higher than that observed after protein or carbohydrate <b>preload</b> ingestion. No significant effects of the interval between the <b>preload</b> and test meal ingestion were found.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the {{variation of the}} dynamic characteristics of a spindle with the change of bearing <b>preload.</b> The correlations between the variation of bearing <b>preload</b> and fundamental modal parameters were first examined by conducting vibration tests on physical spindle units. Experimental measurements show that the dynamic compliance and damping ratio associated with the dominating modes were affected to vary with variation of the bearing <b>preload.</b> When the bearing <b>preload</b> was slightly deviated from a standard value, the modal frequency and damping ability also vary to different extent, which further enable the spindle to perform with different compliance. For the spindle used in this study, a standard <b>preload</b> value set on bearings would enable the spindle to behave a higher stiffness as compared with others with a <b>preload</b> variation. This characteristic can be served as a reference to examine the variation of bearing <b>preload</b> of spindle in assemblage or operation.

50|$|Vacuum {{consolidation}} (or vacuum <b>preloading)</b> is a {{soft soil}} improvement method {{that has been}} successfully used by geotechnical engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies {{in countries such as}} Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for soil improvement or land reclamation (Chu et al., 2005). It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required. However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system. The vacuum <b>preloading</b> method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas. Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum. It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum <b>preloading</b> is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum consolidation is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.|$|E

Secondary locking is used to assist and/or provide redundancy to the primary locking feature (threads) in preventing <b>preload</b> loss in almost any mechanical applications. Two different secondary locking features are studied: the Locking Heli-Coil insert and the Loctite Threadlocker (R) applied before assembly to a Standard Heli-Coil insert. Five parameters are studied in this thesis: percentage loss of initial <b>preload,</b> initial rate of <b>preload</b> loss, secondary rate of <b>preload</b> loss, steady-state value, and the final <b>preload</b> value. Statistical analysis was used to quantify the dependencies between locking levels. Results show that the loss of initial <b>preload</b> is dependent on secondary locking features, the initial and secondary rate of <b>preload</b> loss are dependent on secondary locking features, the steady-state value and the final <b>preload</b> value are dependent on secondary locking features.

50|$|A {{torque to}} yield {{fastener}} (TTY) is mounting hardware {{in the form}} of a fastener which is torqued beyond the state of elasticity and therefore undergoes plastic deformation, causing it to become permanently elongated. Torquing a fastener to yield results in a high <b>preloading</b> of the fastener which, depending on the load frequency and amplitude, can significantly increase the fatigue life of the fastener. When the applied load doesn't surpass the clamping force of the fastener, the strain of the fastener will be lower than when the <b>preloading</b> is smaller than the applied load. It is therefore beneficial in high-frequency high-load situations with a higher risk of fatigue related failure, like a bolted down cylinder head, to use torque to yield bolts.|$|E

40|$|Bolted joints are {{integral}} parts of mechanical systems, and bolt <b>preload</b> loss {{is one of}} the major failure modes for bolted joint structures. Understanding the damping and frequency response to a varying <b>preload</b> in a single-bolted lap-joint structure can be very helpful in predicting and analyzing more complicated structures connected by these joints. In this thesis, the relationship between the bolt <b>preload</b> and the natural frequency, and the relationship between the bolt <b>preload</b> and the structural damping, have both been investigated through impact hammer testing on a single-bolted lap-joint structure. The test data revealed that the bolt <b>preload</b> has nonlinear effects on the structural damping and on the natural frequency of the structure. The damping ratios of the test structure were determined to increase with decreasing <b>preload.</b> An increase in structural damping is beneficial in most engineering circumstances, for it will reduce the vibrational response and noise subjected to external excitations. It was also observed that the modal frequency increased with increasing <b>preload,</b> but remained approximately constant for <b>preload</b> larger than 30 % in the bolt yield strength. One application for studying the <b>preload</b> effect is the detection for loose bolts in structures. The possibility of using impact testing for estimating <b>preload</b> loss has been confirmed, and the modal damping was determined to be a more sensitive indicator than the natural frequency in a single-bolted lap-joint structure...|$|R
