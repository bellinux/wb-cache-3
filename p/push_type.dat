40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{increase in}} the competitive advantage that the Japanese manufacturing companies have experienced in the past decades over their American counterparts has been widely attributed to their use of 2 ̆ 2 just in time with Kanban 2 ̆ 2 among other things. Slow down in the increase of productivity and loss of business to foreign competitors have made the American manufacturing managers increasingly aware of the inadequacy of the classical 2 ̆ 2 push 2 ̆ 2 type production systems. In the last decade the American manufacturing managers have shown an increasing amount of interest in abandoning these <b>push</b> <b>type</b> systems and adopting the more current 2 ̆ 2 pull 2 ̆ 2 type systems such as 2 ̆ 2 just in time with Kanban 2 ̆ 2. ^ The difference between pull and push systems lies in the control structure. In the classical push system, a work center has no control on {{the arrival of the}} jobs to be processed. Once the processing of a job is completed, it immediately gets pushed to the next work center. Hence the inventories at a given work center in a push system consist of nonprocessed jobs. In a pull system, on the other hand, a work center has no control on the delivery dates (the date a job needs to be delivered) but can specify the time a job has to arrive to be processed. Hence in a pull system the inventories on a given work center consist of processed jobs, waiting to be pulled by the next work center. ^ Most research in the scheduling literature so far has focused on <b>push</b> <b>type</b> manufacturing systems. In this thesis we study and analyze two major scheduling problems which are relevant for pull type systems. The first problem considers the scheduling of jobs on a single machine without lot sizing. The second problem is similar to the first one except that both scheduling and lot sizing are done simultaneously. ^ We focus on The Single Machine Scheduling Problem. Extending the results to The Multiple Machine Scheduling Problem requires further research. Some ideas along this line are proposed. ...|$|E
40|$|Composites {{are finding}} {{increasing}} application in many advanced engineering fields like aerospace, marine engineering, hightech sports equipment, etc., {{due to their}} high specific strength and/or specific stiffness values. The use of composite components in complex situations like airplane wing root or locations of concentrated load transfer is limited {{due to the lack}} of complete understanding of their behaviour in the region of joints. Joints are unavoidable in the design and manufacture of complex structures. Pin joints are one of the most commonly used methods of connection. In regions of high stresses like airplane wing root joints interference fit pins are used to increase its fatigue life and thereby increase the reliability of the whole structure. The present contribution is a study on the behaviour of the interference fit pin in a composite plate subjected to both pull and <b>push</b> <b>type</b> of loads. The interference fit pin exhibits partial contact/separation under the loads and the contact region is a non-linear function of the load magnitude.

40|$|In general, it is {{difficult}} to schedule operation for whole large chemical plant. In the case of polymerization plant, the plant operation is usually scheduled to divide to some blocks, which are production block, store block, and so on. The production block is scheduled to minimize production cost. On the other hand, the store block is scheduled to operate the production block using feasible scheduling. The following features make the store block scheduling difficult. (1) The product must be treated as a continuum. (2) The product is handled by two or more machines concurrently. (3) The capacities of queues for intermediates have upper bound. (4) The operations are not necessarily started when the operations can be started. (5) The store block is very large system. This paper proposed the hybrid scheduling system to achieve Just-In-Time (JIT). The proposed system determines the schedule of store block using <b>push</b> <b>type</b> algorithm by the production block demand, and determines that using pull type algorithm by the delivery demand.

40|$|In our {{previous}} works on molecular dynamics ~MD! simulations of lithium metasilicate (Li 2 SiO 3), {{it has been}} shown that the long time behavior of the lithium ions in Li 2 SiO 3 has been characterized by the component showing the enhanced diffusion ~Le´vy flight! due to cooperative jumps. It has also been confirmed that the contribution of such component decreases by interception of the paths in the mixed alkali silicate (LiKSiO 3). Namely, cooperative jumps of like ions are much decreased in number owing to the interception of the path for unlike alkali-metal ions. In the present work, we have performed a Monte Carlo simulation using a cubic lattice in order to establish the role of the cooperative jumps in the transport properties in a mixed alkali glass. Fixed particles ~blockage! were introduced instead of the interception of the jump paths for unlike alkali-metal ions. Two types of cooperative motions ~a pull type and a <b>push</b> <b>type!</b> were taken into account. Low-dimensionality of the jump path caused by blockage resulted in a decrease of a diffusion coefficient of the particles.

Current methods for teaching lean include hands-on projects and simulation. However, simulation games {{available in the}} market lack simplicity, ability to store the results, and modeling power. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a virtual simulation platform which would enable students to perform various experiments by applying lean concepts. The design addresses these deficiencies through the use of VE-Suite, a virtual engineering software. The design includes user-friendly dialogue boxes, graphical models of machines, performance display gauges, and an editable layout. The platform uses laws of operations management such as Little's law, economic order quantity (EOQ) models, and cycle time. These laws enable students to implement various lean concepts such as pull system, just-in-time (JIT), single piece flow, single minute exchange of dies (SMED), kaizen, kanban, U-layout, by modifying the process parameters such as process times, setup times, layout, number, and placement of machines. The simulation begins with a traditional <b>push</b> <b>type</b> mass production line and the students improve the line by implementing lean techniques.

Firstly, we introduce a protocol development process which builds on the existing diffusion of innovation theories. Secondly, a quantitative analysis using system dynamics is provided to evaluate the criticality of the factors affecting the MPTCP diffusion.

The material flow between upstream stages is <b>push</b> <b>type,</b> while between downstream stages it is driven by continuous review, reorder point/order quantity inventory control policy. Exponentially distributed lead times between stages are assumed. External demand occurs according to pure Poisson, while the demand that cannot be met is lost. The system is modelled using matrix analytic methods as a Markov birth-and-death process. An algorithm is developed to generate the transition matrix for different parameters of the system. Then, the corresponding system of stationary linear equations is generated and {{the solution of the}} stationary probabilities is provided. Key performance metrics such as average inventories and customer service levels at each echelon of the system can be computed.

40|$|Aims—To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic yield {{and safety of}} a new <b>push</b> <b>type</b> videoenteroscope (PVE) for diagnosis of small bowel disease.  Methods—Three hundred and thirteen patients were referred {{for one or two}} way PVE from December 1993 to June 1996. Indications for PVE were: an unexplained iron deficiency anaemia with or without clinically evident gastrointestinal bleeding; or a complementary investigation for suspected small bowel disease, after a small bowel barium follow through (SBBFT) considered as normal or abnormal, but without a definite diagnosis.  Results—A jejunoscopy and a retrograde ileoscopy were carried out in 306 and 234 patients, respectively. In patients with isolated anaemia (n= 131) and those with clinically evident gastrointestinal bleeding associated anaemia (n= 72), PVE provided a diagnosis in 26 (19. 8 %) and 22 (30. 5 %) cases, respectively. Lesions found were located in the jejunoileum in 30 (14. 7 %) patients and in the gastroduodenum or the colon in 18 (8. 8 %) patients—that is, within the reach of the conventional gastroscope/colonoscope. In patients with normal (n= 54) or abnormal (n= 56) SBBFT, PVE provided a diagnosis in 17 (31 %) and 27 (48 %) cases, respectively. In 25 % of cases, the abnormal appearance of SBBFT was not confirmed. The site of the radiological abnormality was not reached in 27 % of cases. Lesions were located at the jejunum and the ileum in 59 (64 %) and 33 (36 %) cases, respectively.  Conclusions—PVE is useful in around 30 % of cases of unexplained anaemia or after an SBBFT which failed to provide an accurate aetiological diagnosis. Use of retrograde videoenteroscopy increases diagnostic yield by one third. ...|$|E
