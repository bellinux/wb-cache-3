50|$|Another way {{to manage}} RFI is to {{establish}} a radio quiet zone (RQZ). RQZ is a well-defined area surrounding receivers that has special regulations to reduce RFI in favor of radio astronomy observations within the zone. The regulations may include special management of spectrum and power flux or <b>power</b> <b>flux-density</b> limitations. The controls within the zone may cover elements other than radio transmitters or radio devices. These include aircraft controls and control of unintentional radiators such as industrial, scientific and medical devices, vehicles, and power lines. The first RQZ for radio astronomy is United States National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), established in 1958.|$|E

Technical guidelines are presented to assist the prospective TDRSS medium-and high-data rate user in selecting and procuring a viable, steerable high-gain antenna system. Topics addressed include the antenna gain/transmitter power/data rate relationship; Earth <b>power</b> <b>flux-density</b> limitations; electromechanical requirements dictated by the small beam widths, desired angular coverage, and minimal torque disturbance to the spacecraft; weight and moment considerations; mechanical, electrical and thermal interfaces; design lifetime failure modes; and handling and storage.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 16, 1986 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaAn {{increase}} in the maximum <b>power</b> <b>flux-density</b> (pfd) permitted from satellites in the 2025 to 2300 MHz band is currently under consideration by IRAC. This analysis assumes the worst case conditions for interference to telemetry operations at the missile test ranges {{as a result of}} current and proposed satellite pfd levels. Assumptions in the analysis include the maximum permitted <b>power</b> <b>flux-density</b> with uniform energy distribution over the band of interest, polarization compatibility, and alignment of the telemetry station, the missile and the satellite. It was found that the performance of essentially all missile telemetry receiving systems may be appreciably degraded by even the lowest pfd limits currently permitted. For the higher pfd limits under consideration, degradations in the order of 40 dB are to be expected at stations with dish antennas of only five foot diameter. An {{increase in}} the size or gain of an antenna will reduce the probability of interference, because of its decreased beamwidth, but will also increase the performance degradation because of the station’s increased figure of merit, G/T. For satisfactory missile telemetry operation under these conditions, the normal missile’s telemetry received signal-to-noise ratio would have to be well over 40 dB to overcome satellite interference. The results of the analysis are actually independent of all receiving station parameters except the station’s figure of merit, G/T. Probability of interference is not addressed because of the variation of conditions and missions of the various test ranges as well as the unknown number of satellites and their characteristics - present and future. If missile and satellite telemetry is to coexist in the 2200 to 2290 MHz band, the implementation of several recommendations is considered necessary. The recommendations are; 1) Satellite pfd levels should remain at the current limits; 2) Coordination between the satellite controllers and the range operations must be established; and 3) Multiple telemetry receiving stations with significantly different aspect angles with respect to the test vehicle during the test should be used...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} spectrum {{is a natural}} resource. For decades the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and consequently its individual member countries have been regulating and assigning this spectrum to ensure its optimal usage. The analogue systems that dominated the frequency bands until {{a few decades ago}} had known radiation properties and thus the conditions for coexistence were also known. A certain part of the frequency band was assigned to an exactly known service, with no other service being allowed to operate on the same frequency. Yet with the development of digital systems and digital signal processing this situation has changed. It is no longer the case that some part of the frequency band is dedicated exclusively to one service. In certain conditions, the ITU allows the coexistence of several systems on the same frequency band. The main reason for this thesis is the current condition established by the ITU for the coexistence of satellite systems (Broadcasting Satellite Systems) and MMDS (Multi-channel Multipoint Distribution Systems) on the same frequency band. The thesis primarily focuses on the parameters that {{have a major impact on}} the coexistence of the MMDS and satellite systems working on the same frequency band and with the same geographical coverage. Another issue is how the parameters of terrestrial systems should be set so as to enable their coexistence with satellite systems without limiting the terrestrial systems. One must be cautious with restrictions because the potentially excessive restrictions on MMDS systems would limit their economic viability or even completely stop their deployment. This doctoral thesis contains the results of comprehensive research into these matters. All parameters that could potentially have some impact on the coexistence of digital systems have been included in the research work and appropriately processed. Calculations have been made in compliance with the ITU’s recommendations and regulations. Those calculations have been confirmed with extensive measurements of professional commercial systems (MMDS and BSS). In addition, a special transmitting/receiving system was constructed for the worst-case simulation – having a BSS transmitter, MMDS transmitter and BSS/MMDS receiver on the same line. The motivation for this work was the general concern of the EU and US electronic communications administrations regarding the coexistence of local MMDS and BSS according to the ITU’s regulations. The measurements and calculations show that, due to the latest technological developments, modern systems coexisting on the same frequency band (according to the ITU) are much less sensitive to mutual interference. It is therefore necessary to change the ITU regulation. This doctoral thesis proposes which changes should be made. As stated in the conclusion, the study concentrates on a single parameter R – the protection ratio between the desired and interfering signals. According to the results of our calculations and measurements, parameter R in the equation for the allowed power flux density of an interfering signal is critical. This figure is set by ITU-RR Appendix 30 Annex 3 to 30 dB for digital receivers. Yet in this thesis we propose the following value for parameter R: 11 dB (8 dB + 3 dB in the event of locally extremely bad weather). In this case, the power flux density would be - 84 dBW/m 2 which is an adequate <b>power</b> <b>flux-density</b> for the interferer (in our case for MMDS), and its coexistence with BSS. ...|$|E
