30|$|Living organisms {{typically}} respond sensitively {{to numerous}} cues. Probably {{the most severe}} responses occur upon their exposure to <b>harmful</b> <b>substances.</b> Hence, toxicology {{is one of the}} oldest disciplines and since evolution of mankind, living organisms are used to determine toxicity of substances [1]. Besides screening of drugs and active ingredients, response of small organisms is applied to monitor the existence of <b>harmful</b> <b>substances</b> in different water bodies. The conventional approach to monitor presence of toxins in rivers and estuaries applies physicochemical and analytical chemical techniques. However, the constantly increasing diversity of <b>harmful</b> <b>substances</b> and a range of potentially synergistic actions complicate a reliable assessment. Bioresponse-linked instrumental analytics bridges this gap to a certain extend as it links biomolecular recognition with chemical analysis [2]. Other approaches make use of the fact that <b>harmful</b> <b>substances</b> such as certain metals frequently accumulate in biological organisms. Thus, chemical analysis of accumulation levels can drastically increase sensitivity of detection [3].|$|R
