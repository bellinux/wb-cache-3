40|$|Firstly, {{the basic}} principles, the advantages, the {{disadvantages}} and the engineering {{applications of the}} conventional TPA, OTPA, OPAX and mixed TPA in recent years are comprehensively analyzed. Meanwhile, the potential applications of power flow in the TPA field are especially discussed. Secondly, focused on the OTPA method, an acoustic transfer path system by spherical radiation transfer path simulation system and a vibration transfer path experiment system by a rectangular <b>plate</b> <b>vibrator</b> excitation are designed considering {{the effects of the}} distance from reference points. The results show that the relative error between the OTPA values and the theoretical values as well as the experimental values is less than 5 % and 8 % respectively. At the same time, OTPA is sensitive to noise. When the noise is lower, the nearer reference points can improve the precision of OTPA method. Therefore, it is needed to arrange sensors and design operating conditions reasonably. Finally, the development trend of TPA method is presented...|$|E
40|$|Removal of {{unsuitable}} soil and replacement {{with a strong}} material {{is one of the}} oldest and simplest ground improvement techniques. During this process, a layered soil system with a strong layer overlying a weak layer is achieved. Studies on the load-settlement response of footing on such layered system are limited. An experimental study is carried out to obtain the load-settlement response of a model circular footing resting on (a) unreinforced aggregate layer overlying a sandy soil layer, and (b) geogrid-reinforced aggregate layer overlying a sandy soil layer. A large-scale test chamber of size equal to 1 m x 1 m x 1 m is used to perform the experiments. Actuator of 10 T capacity is used to apply the loads in a displacement-rate controlled mode. A <b>plate</b> <b>vibrator</b> is used to prepare uniform sand and aggregate layers inside the test chamber. Relative density equal to 70 % is maintained for both the layers during the entire test program. The improvement in the load carrying capacity of model footing with the increase in the thickness of aggregate layer and with the introduction of geogrid reinforcement in the aggregate layer is proposed in the study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamics of {{two models}} (simplified and complex) of a small, typical {{vibrating}} table is {{considered in the}} paper. The table consists of vibrating <b>plate</b> and electrical <b>vibrator,</b> mounted in the central position of the plate, which excites the vibrations of the table. The coefficient of transversal stiffness of the spring has been determined {{on the basis of}} numerical simulation. The spring is an essential element of the system. The results of performed numerical simulations are presented in the graphical form...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of signals from vibrators {{have been investigated}} over half a century, however such sources are rarely applied in a marine environment. The objective of this thesis is to study the modeling of the pressure field generated by oscillating <b>vibrator</b> <b>plates</b> in an acoustic medium. The methodology {{is based on the}} representation theorem applied to two states, one state relates to the real vibrator source and the other corresponds to a hypothetical state which is defined as the Green function for pressure. These states are used to model the output of a single vibrator source which consists of a pair of oscillating plates. The model relates to a faulting source where the constitutive law fails is removed. The pressure wavefield is represented everywhere inside the model by a surface integral over the Green’s function convolved with the wavefields on the plates. Based on the derived equation, we deploy an analytical solution for the rigid plates and the measurements at large source – receiver distance are approximated based on radius and the aimed frequency. In order to obtain a flat spectrum of pressure, we introduce an example of controlled plate motion of the sweep. The numerical results corresponding to our model are computed and analyzed. The surface of each plate is gridded and each grid point is assumed to be a point source. The primary wavefield from the vibrator is obtained at a given receiver location by summing the radiated signals from individual points. In the same manner, the ghost of the primary wavefield is calculated, thus the total wavefield from the vibrator at the observation point is obtained by combining the primary and its ghost. Finally, the signals created by a group of <b>vibrator</b> <b>plates</b> are considered. The directivity of the vibrator source is analyzed as well as the contribution of the ghost effect and the array effect...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} carried out to obtain the load-settlement {{response}} of a model square footing resting on unreinforced and reinforced granular beds. The response was obtained for two cases: (a) geogrid-reinforced sand layer, and (b) geogrid-reinforced layered system consisting of aggregate layer overlying a sand layer. The parameters considered in the experimental study include the thickness of the aggregate layer, the depth of geogrid reinforcement placed in sand layer and in aggregate layer, width of the reinforcement, and relative density of bed. <b>Plate</b> <b>vibrator</b> was used to compact uniform sand beds to relative densities equal to 50 % and 70 % inside large-size test chamber of dimensions equal to 1 m × 1 m × 1 m (in length, in width, and in depth). Load was applied on square footing using a 100 kN capacity actuator in displacement-controlled mode, and the improvement in the load carrying capacity of the footing resting on reinforced sand layer and layered system was quantified in terms of load improvement factors. In addition, the optimum embedment depth and width of reinforcements were proposed for various cases considered in the study. The optimum depth of reinforcement for the case of aggregate layer overlying sand layer decreased to 0. 30 times the width of the footing from 0. 45 times the width of the footing for sand only case...|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [51372148, 51172138]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GK 201401003]A magnetoelectric {{theoretical}} model combing piezoelectric and piezomagnetic parts about the longitudinal vibration was {{proposed for the}} laminate composite based on equivalent circuit. The model shows that the magnetoelectric voltage is relative to the thickness ratio, total thickness, frequency and loss. A simple laminate magnetoelectric composite was prepared by bonding a nickel plate and a multilayer piezoelectric vibrator together for the experimental research. The multilayer vibrator enjoys high capacitance, large effective area and low thickness, leading to a high magnetic field sensitivity of 1 mOe at the magnetoelectric field coefficient of 2. 58 V/cmOe in the simple composite with nickel thickness of 0. 2 mm. The model fits the resonance frequency well with the experimental results. Numerical calculation well predicates the magnetoelectric experimental behaviors, presenting a magnetoelectric maximum at about the thickness ratio 0. 3 between the nickel <b>plate</b> and multilayer <b>vibrators.</b> This approach provides a method for the magnetoelectric application...|$|R
