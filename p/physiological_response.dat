5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed. The changing of the pelage of arctic animals is attributed to the indirect effect {{of the change in}} temperature, i.e. a <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> not a simple physical effect.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E

5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

40|$|Performing {{surgical}} procedures {{can increase the}} physiological stress and mental strain experienced by practicing surgeons and their trainees. This may negatively affect work and learning capacity and quality of patient care by increasing the incidence of burnout, sleep disorders, fatigue and other negative behaviours such as substance abuse. This study aimed to compare the <b>physiological</b> and psychological <b>responses</b> of similar clinical situations between orthopaedic surgeons and their clinical fellows. An observational prospective cohort study was performed in that matter. Our results showed overall increased <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> of the fellows during surgery days compared to the clinic days. On the contrary, staff did not show significant variability in their <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> between OR and clinic days. Type of procedure and type of approach used for a procedure had a distinct effect on fellows’ <b>physiological</b> <b>responses.</b> Further evaluation including <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> during different intraoperative steps might help identify specific stressors present in the working and learning environment...|$|R

One hundred undergraduate students (51 males, 49 females) were asked to complete the Positive and Negative Perfectionism Scale and the Hardiness Scale. They were then exposed to a psychological stress. The results indicated that negative perfectionism was positively correlated with <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, skin conductance, respiratory rate, and heart rate.

25|$|Binding {{affinity}} data {{alone does}} not determine the overall potency of a drug. Potency {{is a result of}} the complex interplay of both the binding affinity and the ligand efficacy. Ligand efficacy refers to the ability of the ligand to produce a biological response upon binding to the target receptor and the quantitative magnitude of this response. This response may be as an agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist, depending on the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> produced.|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{formation}} in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes {{that are involved in}} the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox msx family during development and regeneration.|$|E

The IgG-4 test specificity is questionable as healthy individuals with no symptoms of food intolerance also test positive for IgG-4 to several foods.|$|E

40|$|Listening {{to music}} {{often leads to}} <b>physiological</b> <b>responses.</b> Do these <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> contain {{sufficient}} information to infer emotion induced in the listener? The current study explores this question by attempting to predict judgments of "felt" emotion from <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> alone using linear and neural network models. We measured five channels of peripheral physiology from 20 participants-heart rate (HR), respiration, galvanic skin response, and activity in corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major facial muscles. Using valence and arousal (VA) dimensions, participants rated their felt emotion after listening to each of 12 classical music excerpts. After extracting features from the five channels, we examined their correlation with VA ratings, and then performed multiple linear regression {{to see if a}} linear relationship between the <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> could account for the ratings. Although linear models predicted a significant amount of variance in arousal ratings, they were unable to do so with valence ratings. We then used a neural network to provide a non-linear account of the ratings. The network was trained on the mean ratings of eight of the 12 excerpts and tested on the remainder. Performance of the neural network confirms that <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> alone can be used to predict musically induced emotion. The non-linear model derived from the neural network was more accurate than linear models derived from multiple linear regression, particularly along the valence dimension. A secondary analysis allowed us to quantify the relative contributions of inputs to the non-linear model. The study represents a novel approach to understanding the complex relationship between <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> and musically induced emotion. © 2013 Russo, Vempala and Sandstrom...|$|R
25|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, although the results were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Intertidal organisms, {{especially}} those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of temperatures. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30°C (86°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide. Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on coping mechanisms. For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> of making proteins that help recovery from temperature stress just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that no unique <b>physiological</b> <b>response,</b> {{such as an}} increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively {{as a threat to}} group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.|$|E
2500|$|A ligand {{that can}} bind to a receptor, alter the {{function}} of the receptor, and trigger a <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> is called an agonist for that receptor. Agonist binding to a receptor can be characterized both in terms of how much <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> can be triggered {{and in terms of the}} concentration of the agonist that is required to produce the <b>physiological</b> <b>response.</b> High-affinity ligand binding implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand is adequate to maximally occupy a ligand-binding site and trigger a <b>physiological</b> <b>response.</b> [...] The lower the Ki concentration is, the more likely there will be a chemical reaction between the pending ion and the receptive antigen. Low-affinity binding (high Ki level) implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand is required before the binding site is maximally occupied and the maximum <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to the ligand is achieved. In the example shown to the right, two different ligands bind to the same receptor binding site. Only one of the agonists shown can maximally stimulate the receptor and, thus, can be defined as a full agonist. An agonist that can only partially activate the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> is called a partial agonist. In this example, the concentration at which the full agonist (red curve) can half-maximally activate the receptor is about 5 x 10−9 Molar (nM = nanomolar).|$|E
