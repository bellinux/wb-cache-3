40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{changes in}} the community of rotifers and microcrustaceans associated with the construction of a large and dendritic reservoir in Iguaçu River (Brazil), as the last reservoir of a sequence of five cascading systems. Differences were clear between <b>pre-filling</b> and post-filling phases for organisms and some of environmental variables. In the <b>pre-filling</b> phase, the community was more homogeneous along the downstream river gradient, and spatial compartmentalization in the new reservoir was common during the post-filling phase. From 140 identified taxa, 10 species occurred exclusively in the <b>pre-filling</b> phase and 32 in the post-filling phase. After completion of the fifth reservoir filling-up, opportunistic, pioneer and fast-developing species quickly dominated, and downstream of the fourth reservoir the <b>pre-filling</b> decreasing gradient of richness, diversity and evenness disappeared. Richness of rotifers and cladocerans, cladocerans diversity, and evenness of rotifers, cladocerans and copepods were generally higher in the post-filling phase. A non-metric multidimensional analysis based on a presence/absence matrix depicted a homogeneous and dense group of species associated to the <b>pre-filling</b> phase and a second, dispersed group related to the post-filling phase. Spearman correlations pointed out significant positive effects of transparency on rotifer species richness in the post-filling phase, and negative effects on the microcrustacean richness in the <b>pre-filling</b> phase. Dam construction caused disruption of the downstream lotic gradient along the series of dams, leading to the development of distinct species in lentic spatial compartments...|$|R

However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between different cement augmentation techniques. Uniform synthetic bones simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each augmentation technique. In all cases a polyaxial screw and acrylic cement (PMMA) at medium viscosity were used. Five groups were analyzed: I) only screw without PMMA (control group); II) retrograde cement <b>pre-filling</b> of the tapped area; III) cannulated and fenestrate screw with cement injection through perforation; IV) injection using a standard trocar of PMMA (vertebroplasty) and retrograde <b>pre-filling</b> of the tapped area; V) injection through a fenestrated trocar and retrograde <b>pre-filling</b> of the tapped area. Standard X-rays were taken in order to visualize cement distribution in each group. Pedicle screws at full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. A total of 30 screws were tested. The results of pullout analysis revealed better results of all groups with respect to the control group. In particular the statistical analysis showed a difference of Group V (p =  0. 001) with respect to all other groups. These results confirm that the cement augmentation grants better results in pullout axial forces. Moreover they suggest better load resistance to axial forces when the distribution of the PMMA is along all the screw combining fenestration and <b>pre-filling</b> augmentation technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pedicle screws with PMMA cement {{augmentation}} {{have been}} shown to significantly improve the fixation strength in a severely osteoporotic spine. However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques, namely solid screws with retrograde cement <b>pre-filling</b> versus cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation, remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between conical and cylindrical screws based on the aforementioned cement augmentation techniques. The potential loss of fixation upon partial screw removal after screw insertion was also examined. Method The Taguchi method with an L 8 array was employed to determine the significance of design factors. Conical and cylindrical pedicle screws with solid or cannulated designs were installed using two different screw augmentation techniques: solid screws with retrograde cement <b>pre-filling</b> and cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation. Uniform synthetic bones (test block) simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each screw design and cement augmentation technique. Pedicle screws at full insertion and after a 360 -degree back-out from full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. Results The results revealed the following 1) Regardless of the screw outer geometry (conical or cylindrical), solid screws with retrograde cement <b>pre-filling</b> exhibited significantly higher pullout strength than did cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation (p = 0. 0129 for conical screws; p = 0. 005 for cylindrical screws). 2) For a given cement augmentation technique (screws without cement augmentation, cannulated screws with cement injection or solid screws with cement <b>pre-filling),</b> no significant difference in pullout strength was found between conical and cylindrical screws (p > 0. 05). 3) Cement infiltration into the open cell of the test block {{led to the formation of}} a cement/bone composite structure. Observations of the failed specimens indicated that failure occurred at the composite/bone interface, whereas the composite remained well bonded to the screws. This result implies that the screw/composite interfacial strength was much higher than the composite/bone interfacial strength. 4) The back-out of the screw by 360 degrees from full insertion did not decrease the pullout strength in any of the studied cases. 5) Generally, larger standard deviations were found for the screw back-out cases, implying that the results of full insertion cases are more repeatable than those of the back-out cases. Conclusions Solid screws with retrograde cement <b>pre-filling</b> offer improved initial fixation strength when compared to that of cannulated screws with cement injection through perforation for both the conically and cylindrically shaped screw. Our results also suggest that the fixation screws can be backed out by 360 degrees for intra-operative adjustment without the loss of fixation strength. </p...|$|R

This body force term is designed to produce a Z-pinch like implosion {{that can be used}} in the development and evaluation of shock-hydrodynamics algorithms that are intended to be used in Z-pinch simulations. The model uses a J×B Lorentz force, motivated by a 0 -D analysis of a thin shell (or liner implosion), as a source term in the equations and allows for arbitrary current drives to be simulated. An extension that would include the multi-physics aspects of a proposed combined radiation hydrodynamics (rad-hydro) capability is also discussed. The specific class of prototype problems which are developed is intended to illustrate aspects of liner implosions into a near vacuum and with idealized <b>pre-fill</b> plasma effects. In this work, a high-resolution FCT method implemented on structured overlapping meshes is used to demonstrate the application of such a model to these idealized shock-hydrodynamic studies.

Additionally, a set of more realistic implosion problems which include density profiles approximating plasma <b>pre-fill</b> and a set of perturbed liner geometries that excite a hydro-magnetic like Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the implosion dynamics are demonstrated.

The {{upcoming}} {{operation of}} Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) will {{be supported by}} an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) system working at 140 GHz in second harmonic at the nominal magnetic field of 2. 5 T. Because the optimization of the plasma breakdown is crucial {{to ensure a successful}} plasma build-up, dedicated plasma start-up experiments were performed on three stellarator/heliotron devices: Heliotron J, LHD and WEGA. Start-up behavior and dependencies on ECRH injected power, neutral gas pressure and rotational transform were obtained in X 2 heating. Plasma start-up delay time decreases with the increase in ECRH input power. However, this behavior saturates when low <b>pre-fill</b> neutral gas pressure conditions are met. Both the delay time and the electron density are an increasing function of the gas pressure. On Heliotron J and WEGA devices, the higher the rotational transform is, the faster the start-up and the higher the plasma density are. Analysis of the temporal evolution of the plasma start-up shows that plasma start-up on stellarators is a two-step process. In addition, off-axis heating experiments are characterized by a longer plasma start-up duration compared to on-axis heating discharges. Third harmonic in X-mode has been attempted on LHD for different neutral gas puffing settings but no plasma breakdown was achieved. This multi-machine study was useful to define ECRH start-up scenarios for W 7 -X. ...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{installation}} of a full metal, ITER-like, first wall provided the opportunity to study {{the impact of the}} plasma-facing materials on plasma initiation or breakdown. This study for the first time presents a full experimental characterisation of tokamak breakdown at JET, using all discharges since 2008, covering both operations with a main chamber carbon and a beryllium ITER-like main chamber wall. It was found that the avalanche phase was unaffected by the change in wall material. However, changes in out-gassing by the wall and lower carbon levels resulted in better controlled density and significantly lower radiation during the burn-through phase with the ITER-like wall. Breakdown failures, that usually developed with a carbon wall during the burn-through phase (especially after disruptions) were absent with the ITER-like wall. These observations match with the results obtained from a new model of plasma burn-through that includes plasma–surface interactions (Kim et al 2012 Nucl. Fusion 52 [[URL] 103016). This shows that chemical sputtering of carbon is the determining factor for the impurity content, and hence also radiation, during the burn-through phase for operations with a carbon wall. As seen experimentally, with a beryllium main wall, the plasma surface effects predicted by the model do not raise the radiation levels much above those expected for pure deuterium plasmas. With the ITER-like wall, operation with higher <b>pre-fill</b> pressures, and thus higher breakdown densities, was possible, which helped maintaining the density after breakdown...|$|E

FORMAK provides a means of adjusting to this situation using the latest computer technology, including the following advantages: 3 -level on-line help during form-filling, i. e. simple enter requests, explanatory texts for each of the form's boxes and context-sensitive Windows help for complicated situations; position-perfect printing onto the original form; realistic display as screen background assuring familiar 2 -D orientation; intelligent navigation through the form; automatic calculation of certain values on the basis of other entries (as in sprea dsheet systems); selection of values from predefined option lists; learning from user suggestions; access to databases for partial <b>pre-filling</b> of forms and to update the databases...|$|R
40|$|IrxRu 1 -xO 2 (1 >= x >= 0) with nanorod {{structure}} {{were successfully}} synthesized by employed <b>pre-filling</b> the Ir and/or Ru guest species into the peripheral-pore of NH 2 -modified as-synthesized SBA- 15 and explored as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolyzers. Various physicochemical parameters for zeolite template and/or IrxRu 1 -xO 2 {{were obtained by}} SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and N- 2 gas absorption/desorption measurements. The morphology for prepared IrxRu 1 -xO 2 samples with individual and/or cluster nanorods was changed with the component difference. Cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, steady state polarization curves and stability tests were performed to investigate the catalytic activity and stability of these electrocatalysts for OER. The cell with catalyst RuO 2 showed best catalytic performance with the lowest onset potential (1. 374 V at 10 mA cm(- 2)), which may be ascribed to regular nanoclusters and larger outer active surface area. Meanwhile, the cell stability tests suggested that the addition of IrO 2 in IrxRu 1 -xO 2 improved {{the stability of the}} RuO 2 catalyst. Copyright (c) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|Despite being {{consistently}} stated as {{an important}} characteristic of good tax policy, tax simplicity has largely been ignored in actual tax reform. After so many years and attempts, the goal of tax simplification in Australia appears to be as elusive as ever. The central tenets of this paper are that tax policy simplification is virtually not possible and that tax law simplification has limited benefits. In practice, therefore, {{it is argued that}} reduced tax complexity can be achieved mainly through administrative (or procedural) simplification. The paper then focuses on pre-filled income tax returns in Australia as a recent example of administrative simplification. We perceive <b>pre-filling</b> as the government&# 039;s attempt to build a further bridge between the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and individual taxpayers, adding to the existing bridges between the ATO and taxpayers and tax practitioners. It is concluded that, at this early stage, the reactive and partial model in use in Australia (compared to Nordic and other initiatives) {{is a step in the}} right direction but has not yet led to significant operating cost savings. This may change if the recommendations of the Henry Review are fully accepted and implemented, possibly smoothing the pathway to total automation of tax return preparation...|$|R
