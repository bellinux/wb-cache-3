The first type has two insulated wires led into the interior and attached to two insulated brass cones which are connected by a wire [...] "bridge" [...] of platinum silver. This bridge is surrounded by a <b>priming</b> <b>composition</b> of guncotton dust and mealed powder and the remainder of the tube is filled with powder.

This disc is connected by an insulated wire to a brass cone, also insulated, the bridge being formed from an edge of the cone to a brass wire which is soldered to the mouth of the tube. <b>Priming</b> <b>composition</b> surrounds the bridge and the tube is filled with powder. The electric circuit passes from the gun lock to the disc, then through the bridge to the body of the tube, returning through the metal of the gun and mounting.|$|E
50|$|First {{used as a}} <b>priming</b> <b>composition</b> {{in small}} copper caps {{beginning}} in the 1820s, mercury fulminate quickly replaced flints {{as a means to}} ignite black powder charges in muzzle-loading firearms. Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, mercury fulminate or potassium chlorate became widely used in primers for self-contained rifle and pistol ammunition. Mercury fulminate has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its constituent elements. The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well. Today, mercury fulminate has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include lead azide, lead styphnate and tetrazene derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require mercury for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.|$|E

40|$|Materials from 38 {{paintings}} by Francis Bacon (1909 ‐ 1992), including 21 complete works and 17 partially destroyed canvases are investigated. Observations {{are made of}} the artist's technique and details are compiled of the supports used. Samples of paint and priming were taken for analysis using polarized light microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS), pyrolysis‐GC‐MS (Py‐GC‐MS), and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM‐EDX). Analysis of priming layers appears {{to show that the}} <b>priming</b> <b>composition</b> correlates well with particular ranges of dates. A fairly limited range of materials are found, with many of the same pigments found in works spanning Bacon's career, though other pigments were introduced at different stages in his career. Oil paints were used consistently for the painting of figures, but household paints were increasingly used in backgrounds from the 1960 s onwards. A variety of different synthetic media are found in later works, including household acrylic paints and spray paints. Increased knowledge of Bacon’s materials is expected to be of great value to conservators caring for the work of this highly significant artist, and is already helping in the authentication of works attributed to him...|$|E

40|$|The microstructure, phase compositions, and phase {{fractions}} {{were studied}} in conventionally cast B- 1900 + Hf and both conventionally cast and directionally solidified MAR-M 247 {{as a function}} of tantalum concentration. The hot tensile and creep rupture properties of the solutionized and aged MAR-M 247 -type alloys were also determined {{as a function of}} tantalum level. The effects of tantalum on the microstructure and phase compositions of B- 1900 + Hf and MAR-M 247 (conventionally cast and directionally solidified) were found to be very similar. The addition of tantalum to the as cast and heat treated alloys was shown to cause the partial replacement of the Hf in the MC carbides by Ta, although the degree of replacement was decreased by the solutionizing and aging heat treatment. The gamma prime and minor phase fractions (primarily MC type carbides) both increased approximately linearly with tantalum concentration. The gamma <b>prime</b> phase <b>compositions</b> were relatively insensitive to tantalum variations {{with the exception of the}} tantalum and/or hafnium levels. Bulk tantalum additions increased the tantalum, chromium, and cobalt levels of the gamma phase in both alloy series. The increase in the concentrations of the latter two elements in the gamma phase was a result of the decrease in the gamma phase fraction with increasing bulk tantalum concentration and constant gamma/gamma prime partitioning ratio. Tantalum additions increased the yield stress and ultimate tensile strength of the directionally solidified MAR-M 247 type alloys and had no significant effect on ductility...|$|R

40|$|Plant sucking aphids cause both {{quantitative}} and qualitative yield losses in cereals; moreover aphid-transmitted viruses are responsible for other {{quantitative and}} qualitative damages, thus direct or indirect effects of aphid infection are in focus of interest. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is determined primarily by the protein content and composition, the gluten proteins (glutenins, gliadins) being the <b>prime</b> factors. Allelic <b>composition</b> of the gliadin- and glutenin loci {{as well as the}} absolute amount and/or the relative ratio of gliadins to glutenins are very important in dough making and in determining baking quality.  Wheat plants were caged at the beginning of stem elongation. Cages were treated with 0. 1 % methyl parathion. One week later, the caged plants were artificially infected with 5 alata individuals of Metopolophium dirhodum, Diuraphis noxia, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Flour from grains originating from plants infected artificially with cereal aphids were analyzed for glutenin and gliadin and total protein content, using Size Exclusion HPLC. It was found that aphid infection had significant effect on the glutenin and gliadin content, the total protein content and the gliadin/glutenin ratio. Both the glutenin and gliadin content was significantly higher in the seeds harvested from aphid infected plants. However, the gliadin/glutenin ratio was significantly lower in wheat flour prepared from aphid infected plants than in those from uninfected control. The most significant decrease in gliadin/glutenin ratio was caused by M. dirhodum, D. noxia, S. avenae infection followed by R. padi at high-abundance and low-abundance, respectively. As the gliadin/glutenin ratio was significantly lower in flours made from aphid infected wheat seeds, it may be suggested that aphid feeding results in decreased bread making quality of wheat flour...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{structure}} of the Hecke algebras related to unimodular matrix groups over Dedekind domains and to unitary matrix groups over the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field is being analysed. The first main result of the analysis of the unimodular groups over a Dedekind domain o is a measure formula which in the case of (2 x 2) matrices allows to calculate the number of right cosets of type GL_ 2 (o) A_i contained in a double coset of type GL_ 2 (o) A GL_ 2 (o) by means of the determinantal divisors of the matrix A. As an application of this measure formula to the product in the Hecke algebra one obtains a reduction formula. The second central result is a tensor product decomposition. Denote by H^* the Hecke algebra on the set of all matrices from o^{n x n} with determinant in Z { 0 } with respect to the subgroup GL_n(o) and by H^*_p for every prime p in N the Hecke algebra on the set of all matrices from o^{n x n} with a determinant of type p^k or -p^k for some k in N_ 0, likewise with respect to the subgroup GL_n(o). Then H^* is isomorphic to the tensor product of the H^*_p for the primes p in N. Furthermore, it will be proven that the H^*_p are always finitely generated algebras. For the case n = 2 the explicit construction of some systems of generators and the analysis of minimality show that in those cases in which p o has the prime ideal decomposition p' or (p') ^ 2 over o there even exist algebraically independent systems of generators [...] more precisely, that H^*_p is isomorphic to C[X_ 1, X_ 2] in those cases [...] , and that in those cases of <b>prime</b> ideal <b>composition</b> p o = p' q' there always exists a set of relators R(p) such that H^*_p is isomorphic to C[X_ 1, X_ 2, X_ 3, X_ 4] / R(p), which in the case that o is the ring of integers of a quadratic number field yields a representation of H^* as tensor product where the isomorphism type of H^*_p for the inert, ramified and split primes p can always be given explicitly. The analysis of the unitary matrix groups yields distinguished representatives of right cosets (those whose C-block is the zero matrix) and the existence of simultanous sets of representatives of right and left cosets. The main result is a weak version of a tensor product decomposition. As a negative result it is proven that in general a tensor product decomposition similar to the one for the case of a unimodular group does not exist here...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{order to}} develop a more {{effective}} prophylactic HIV- 1 vaccine it is important optimize the components, improve Envelope glycoprotein immunogenicity {{as well as to}} explore prime-boost immunization schedules. It is also valuable to include several HIV- 1 subtype antigens representing the world-wide epidemic. Methods: HIVIS-DNA plasmids which include Env genes of subtypes A, B and C together with Gag subtypes A and B and RTmut/Rev of subtype B were modified as follows: the Envelope sequences were shortened, codon optimized, provided with an FT 4 sequence and an immunodominant region mutated. The reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was shortened to contain the most immunogenic N-terminal fragment and fused with an inactivated viral protease vPR gene. HIVISopt-DNA thus contains fewer plasmids but additional PR epitopes compared to the native HIVIS-DNA. DNA components were delivered intradermally to young Balb/c mice once, using a needle-free Biojector® immediately followed by dermal electroporation. Vaccinia-based MVA-CMDR boosts including Env gene E and Gag-RT genes A were delivered intramuscularly by needle, once or twice. Results: Both HIVIS-DNA and HIVISopt-DNA primed humoral and cell mediated responses well. When boosted with heterologous MVA-CMDR (subtypes A and E) virus inhibitory neutralizing antibodies were obtained to HIV- 1 subtypes A, B, C and AE. Both plasmid compositions boosted with MVA-CMDR generated HIV- 1 specific cellular responses directed against HIV- 1 Env, Gag and Pol, as measured by IFNγ ELISpot. It was shown that DNA priming augmented the vector MVA immunological boosting effects, the HIVISopt-DNA with a trend to improved (Env) neutralization, the HIVIS-DNA with a trend to better (Gag) cell mediated immune reponses. Conclusions: HIVIS-DNA was modified to obtain HIVISopt-DNA that had fewer plasmids, and additional epitopes. Even with one DNA prime followed by two MVA-CMDR boosts, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were readily induced by priming with either DNA construct <b>composition.</b> <b>Priming</b> by HIV-DNA augmented neutralizing antibody responses revealed by boosting with the vaccinia-based heterologous sequences. Cellular and antibody responses covered selected strains representing HIV- 1 subtypes A, B, C and CRF 01 _AE. We assume this is related to the inclusion of heterologous full genes in the vaccine schedule...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} century the forests of Central Europe changed from open {{woodlands}} to even-aged stands with closed-canopy. This change resulted in severe decline of forest biodiversity. This study examines how, and why such change affected xylophagous insects. I have studied microhabitat preferences, i. e. distribution of xylophagous insects in canopy and understorey of closed forests, forest edges and wooded meadows. I used method of rearing insect from timber baits exposed to ovipositing females of xylophagous insects in different situations in the forest at the beginning if vegetation season. After one season of exposition,the baits were collected enclosed in fly-wire cages, where emerging insects were collected for two seasons. This thesis consists of two parts: The first part is an unpublished manuscript dealing with effect of habitat insolation, vertical stratification, forest structure and amount of dead wood on community of long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) and jewell beetles (Buprestidae) feeding on wood of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Baits were exposed in the canopy and the understorey of forest interior, the canopy and the understorey of forest edge and on solitary trees on wooded meadows. Most insect species do prefer insoled wood for their development, and were {{more common in the}} understorey than in the canopy. Insolation of bait was thus the <b>prime</b> factor affecting <b>composition</b> of reared insects. No relation was found between dead wood volume and species composition or abundance of reared insects This shows that insolation of the dead wood is crucial to conservation of most xylophagous insects. The second part of the thesis studies effect of vertical stratification and insolation on distribution of xylophages feeding reared from wood of 8 tree species (Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, P. x canadensis, Salix alba, Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus laevis) and host specificity of xylophages. Results show that: (i) community composition of xylophages reflects evolutionary history of their host plants; (ii) communities reared from different trees exhibit different preferences for forest strata and insolation of the habitat, probably in connection to preferred growth conditions of the host plant, (iii) many xylophagous insect species exhibit strong preferences to insoled habitats, and are thus confined to forest edges in extensively managed forests as well as in unmanaged forest reserves...|$|R
