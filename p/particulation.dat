50|$|The {{penetration}} depth {{is proportional to}} the maximum length of the jet, which {{is a product of the}} jet tip velocity and time to <b>particulation.</b> The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material, the time to <b>particulation</b> is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material. The speed can reach 10 km/s, peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation; the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2-5 km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are face-centered cubic metals, as they are the most ductile, but even graphite and zero-ductility ceramic cones show significant penetration.|$|E
50|$|Mushrooms {{can be used}} {{to create}} color dyes via color-extraction with a solvent (often ammonia) as well as <b>particulation</b> of raw material. The {{shingled}} hedgehog mushroom and related species contain blue-green pigments, which are used for dyeing wool in Norway. The fruiting body of Hydnellum peckii {{can be used to}} produce a beige color when no mordant is used, and shades of blue or green depending on the mordant added. Phaeolus schweinitzii produces green, yellow, gold, or brown colors, depending on the material dyed and the mordant used.|$|E
40|$|<b>Particulation</b> in free-form {{hemispherical}} shaped charge jets {{is considerably}} {{different from that}} in conical shaped charge jets. From {{the analysis of the}} <b>particulation</b> data for 23 experiments covering ten free-form hemi designs with copper liners, it is concluded that jets with higher convergence pressures have delayed <b>particulation,</b> sometimes by as much as a factor of two. Breakup is also found to be design dependent, with free-form hemis have delayed breakup compared with cones. Also, in going from the earlier, boat-tail high explosive (HE) designs to later, more efficient hemispherical HE designs, it is found that <b>particulation</b> is delayed in the tail of the jet. These effects indicate the potential for deeper armor penetration based on control of <b>particulation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Image-converter (IC) camera {{photography}} {{has provided}} spectacular images and quantitative records of liner collapse and early jet formation in shaped charges. We have extended {{the application of}} the IC camera to observations of shaped charge jet surfaces undergoing <b>particulation.</b> Sequential, high-resolution photographs were taken following the same 10 -cm portion of jet at 2. 5 -{mu}s intervals. Simultaneous color rotating-mirror framing camera photographs and 450 -keV flash x-ray radiographs were also taken of the same region. This combination provides a detailed record of the evolution of surface structure during jet necking and <b>particulation.</b> In the high-resolution photographs, individual features on the jet surfaces as small as {approximately} 100 {mu}m can easily be detected and followed as they evolve over time. The jet surface structure is rough with overlapping slip dislocation lines running along the surface at 45 {degree} to either side of the jet axis. This is similar to the texture that develops in long rods undergoing static tension. We discuss the implications of these images for increasing jet <b>particulation</b> times...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of shaped charge jet break-up {{was carried out in}} order to investigate the role of nonlinear instabilities leading to the <b>particulation</b> of the jet. Statistical methods generally used for studying fluctuations in nonlinear dynamical systems are applied to experimentally measured velocities of the individual particles. In particular we present results suggesting the deviation of non-Gaussian behavior for interparticle velocity correlations, characteristic of nonlinear dynamical systems. Results are presented for two silver shaped charge jets that differ primarily in their material processing. We provide evidence that the <b>particulation</b> of a jet is not random, but has its origin in a deterministic dynamical process involving the nonlinear coupling of two oscillators analogous to the underling dynamics observed in Rayleigh-Benard convection and modeled in the return map of Curry and Yorke...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the authors discussed a 3 D computational {{model for the}} <b>particulation</b> of a stretching shaped charge jet, based on the experimentally observed double-helix surface perturbations on softly recovered jet particles. The 3 D problem {{was derived from the}} unperturbed 2 D problem, which was first used to generate a stretching jet. A portion of this 2 D jet was selected for study in the cylindrical 3 D mode, and the double-helix perturbations were placed on the cylinder surface. This initial computation was greatly simplified, to make it feasible to run on a CM 200 massively parallel processor. The initial output of this computation, which is being published here for the first time, leads to a significant simplification of the analysis of the <b>particulation</b> process, by avoiding the search for the elusive ``most favored wavelength`` which is characteristic of 2 D axi-symmetric analyses. Previously unnoticed characteristics of flash radiographs from Viper jets, appear to support the computational results obtained, despite a counter-intuitive prediction of the location of necking loci, relative to the perturbing helices. The approximations used in this initial computation are discussed critically. Planned improvements are defined. A vision of future fundamental computations, which become possible with more powerful ASCI machines, is projected...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews prior 1 D and 2 D axisymmetric, {{analytical}} and computational studies, {{as well as}} empirical studies of the shaped charge jet <b>particulation</b> problem and discusses their associated insights and problems. It proposes a new 3 D computational model of the <b>particulation</b> process, based upon a simplified version of the observed counter-rotating, double helical surface perturbations, found on softly recovered shaped charge jet particles, from both copper and tantalum jets. This 3 D approach contrasts with the random, axisymmetric surface perturbations which have previously been used, to try to infer the observed length distribution of jet particles, {{on the basis of}} the most unstable wavelength concept, which leads to the expectation of a continuous distribution of particle lengths. The 3 D model, by its very nature, leads to a non-random, periodic distribution of potential initial necking loci, on alternate sides of the stretching jet. This in turn infers a potentially periodic, overlapping, multi-modal distribution of associated jet particle lengths. Since it is unlikely that all potential initial necking sites will be activated simultaneously, the 3 D model also suggests that longer jet particles containing partial, but unseparated necks, should be observed fairly often. The computational analysis is in its very early stages and the problems involved in inserting the two helical grooves and in defining the initial conditions and boundary conditions for the computation will be discussed. Available initial results from the 3 D computation will be discussed and interpreted...|$|E

40|$|In 1956, Royal Dutch Shell {{discovered}} {{crude oil}} at Oloibiri, {{a village in}} the Niger Delta, and commercial production began in 1958. Today, there are 606 oil fields in the Niger Delta, of which 360 are on-shore and 246 offshore. Nigeria is now the largest oil producer in Africa and the eleventh largest in the world, averaging 2. 5 {{million barrels per day}} (bbl/d) in 2004. Nigeria's proven oil reserved is 35. 2 billion barrels. Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in the 1956, the country has been suffering the negative environmental consequences of oil development. The transport and fate of spilled oil in water bodies are governed by physical, chemical, and biological processes that depend on the oil properties, hydrodynamics, meteorological and environmental conditions. These processes include advection, turbulent diffusion, surface spreading, evaporation, dissolution, emulsification, hydrolysis, photo-oxidation, biodegradation and <b>particulation.</b> Oil spill models have the capability of predicting the three-dimensional evolution of oil, including entrainment, subsurface transport, sedimentation, and refloating of spilled oil.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the general issues of ageing, learning, and education for the elderly. It also examines the more specific issues of why, how and what elders want to learn. The world's population is ageing rapidly. For example, it is estimated that by 2020 20 % of the population in the USA will be 65 years old and over. It is predicted that 24 % of the Hong Kong population will be over 65 years old by 2025 (Bartlett & Phillips, 1995). The phenomenon has been described in colorful terms as the "silver tsunami" (Pew Report, 2001 cited in Summer, 2007). Ageing has an impact on all aspects of human life including the social, economic, cultural and political domains. Understanding and providing for ageing is, therefoer, an important issue for the twenty-first century. The World Health Organisation ([WHO], 2002) has proposed a model of active ageing based on optimizing opportunities for health, <b>particulation,</b> and security in order to enhance quality of life for people as they age.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} biomicroscopic {{evaluation}} of vitreal alterations {{in a large}} group of patients affected by primary retinitis pigmentosa (RP). 286 RP patients (571 eyes), 153 (305 eyes) males and 133 (266 eyes) females, have been studied; the mean age of this whole group was 37. 26 ± 14. 93 years (age range: 5 - 77). Vitreal static and dynamic biomicroscopy was performed on fully dilated pupils by means of a Haag-Streit 900 slit-lamp and high-power positive precorneal lenses (+ 90 and + 78 dpt Volk lenses). Most patients showed floating cottonball-like condensations (26. 824 %) often associated with fibrillary degeneration (15. 88 %), while non-pigmentary vitreal <b>particulation</b> was detected in 26. 609 % of cases and the pigmentary type in 12. 017 %, respectively. Posterior vitreal detachment was detected alone in only 0. 43 % of cases while 18. 24 % of examined eyes showed no vitreal alterations. A high statistical correlation between vitreal aspects and pigmentary grading of the fundus oculi (p = 0. 0001), as well as duration of the disease (p = 0. 0074), was found; at the same time, no statistical correlation with refractive error was demonstrated (p = 0. 47) ...|$|E
40|$|It is now {{possible}} to obtain high resolution sequential photographs of the initial formation and evolution of hypervelocity metal jets formed by shaped charge devices fired in air. Researchers have been frustrated by the high velocity of the jet material and the luminous sheath of hot gases cloaking the jet that made detailed observation of the jet body extremely difficult. The camera system that provides the photographs is a large format multi-frame electro-optic camera, referred to as an IC camera (IC stands for image converter), that utilizes electro-optic shuttering, monochromatic pulsed laser illumination and bandpass filtering to provide sequential pictures (in 3 D if desired) with minimal degradation due to luminous air shocks or motion blur. The large format (75 mm image plane), short exposure (15 ns minimum), ruby laser illumination and bandpass filtering (monochromatic illumination while excluding extraneous light) produces clear, sharp, images of the detailed surface structure of a metal shaped charge jet during early jet formation, elongation of the jet body, jet tip evolution and subsequent <b>particulation</b> (breakup) of the jet body. By utilizing the new camera system {{in conjunction with the}} more traditional rotating mirror high speed cameras, pulsed radiography, and electrical sensors, a maximum amount of, often unique, data can be extracted from a single experiment. This paper was intended primarily as an oral presentation. For purposes of continuity and simplicity in these proceedings, the authors have chosen to concentrate {{on the development of the}} IC camera system and its impact on the photography of high speed shaped chargejets...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, {{no studies}} have been {{published}} that evaluated histomorphometric data from {{a large number of}} patients while comparing different sites and methods of autologous bone grafting in sinus floor augmentation procedures. A meta-analysis of the English literature from January 1995 till April 2009 was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed search engine and the following journals were explored: Clinical Oral Implant Research, International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants, International Journal of Periodontics and Restorative Dentistry, and the Journal of Periodontology. RESULTS: Out of 147 titles, according to our criteria, 25 articles were left for analysis. The majority were prospective controlled studies (21) and 2 randomized clinical trials, 1 pilot study and 1 case series. A reference value of 47 % for total bone volume (TBV) was found while using iliac bone grafting as a standard. Use of intraoral bone grafts increases the TBV, with 11 % for chin bone and 14 % for bone grafted from other intraoral sites. <b>Particulation</b> of the bone graft has a negative effect on the TBV of 18 %. Surprisingly, no correlation between TBV and the time of graft healing was found. Histological section thickness seemed to be a significant variable, as every micron increase of section thickness leads to an increase of 0. 4 % of TBV. CONCLUSIONS: Bone grafting from the iliac crest resulted in a significantly lower TBV compared with intraoral bone grafting. However, due to the limited availability of intraoral bone to be harvested, iliac grafts still have to be considered the gold standard in augmenting the severely atrophic maxilla...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, {{no studies}} have been {{published}} in which histomorphometric data from a large group of patients comparing various biomaterials for sinus floor augmentation procedures were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of the English literature from January 1993 till April 2009 was carried out. Out of 147 titles, according to our criteria, 64 articles were selected for analysis describing the use of autologous bone and their alternatives, such as allogenic, xenogenic, and alloplastic materials. RESULTS: On the basis of autologous bone grafting, a reference value for total bone volume (TBV) of 63 % was found. <b>Particulation</b> of the bone graft resulted in a general reduction of - 18 % in TBV. Delayed implant placement reduced the TBV with - 7 %. Overall TBV was 8 % or 6 % higher if a biopsy was, respectively, taken before 4. 5 months or after 9. 0 months after initial sinus augmentation surgery. Allogenic, xenogenic, alloplastic, or combinations of graft materials all resulted in a significant lower amount of TBV compared to autologous bone grafting ranging from - 7 % to - 26 %. Inventorying the effect of "biopsy time" for autologous bone, the TBV was significantly higher before 4. 5 and after 9. 0 months of healing time compared to period in between. Surprisingly, no significant differences in TBV with respect to "biopsy time" for bone substitutes were found. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the aspect of TBV autologous bone still has to be considered to be the gold standard in sinus augmentation surgery.

40|$|Delphinium sergii Wissjul. is an endemic {{of eastern}} coast of Black Sea. It {{is listed in}} Red book of Ukraine with {{conservation}} status “vulnerable” (Didukh 2009). It grows mainly in eastern part of Ukraine in nature and is not typical for the Kyiv region. It is a perennial plant with bright blue flowers. The individuals of this specie are cultivated in the M. M. Gryshko National Botanical Garden during last 15 years. The {{results of the study}} of ontogenetic development and morphological diversity show that D. sergii is characterized by heterophylly and common morphological variability of leaf blade. The correlation of degree between leaf blade dissection and their formation and age was established. Dissected leaves are found to be “older” while with entire laminas – “younger”. Formation of different leaves in individuals of the same age states their dependence from lighting, soil moisture, crop density, genetic heterogeneity and plasticity of individuals in different conditions of growth. We observed a difference in terms of passing through ontogenetic stages among the individuals too. Our investigation established that the individuals of D. sergii ex situ can accelerate the ontogenetic development and reach the generative stage for just 2 years. The juvenile period in some individuals may last for just one growing season. It is noted that under the unfavorable factors (thickened crops, drought, and shading) development of D. sergii individuals became slower. This species can be reproduced both by seed and vegetative. Propagation by seeds is the main way for distribution of these plants. Vegetative reproduction could be realized by <b>particulation</b> of individuals at g and ss stages. In Кyiv region D. sergii is blooming in June-July. Delphinium is well known as such representing the “bee-flowers syndrome”. According to our observations the main pollinators of D. sergii in conditions of our botanical garden were Bombus pascuorum (Scopoli, 1763), B. hortorum (Linnaeus, 1761), B. lucorum (Linnaeus, 1761), and B. lapidarius (Linnaeus, 1758).

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{thin-film}} metal nitride materials from elemental metal targets by plasma-assisted pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been explored and analysed. 	A new UHV PLD growth {{system has been}} installed and assembled and its system elements were calibrated. A series of GaN thin films have been grown to calibrate the system. In-situ RHEED indicated that the films were single crystal and that growth proceeded in a three-dimensional fashion. SEM images showed heavy <b>particulation</b> of film surfaces that was not in evidence for later refractory metal nitride films. This may {{be connected to the}} fact that Ga targets were liquid while refractory metals were solid. Most GaN films were not continuous due to insufficient laser fluence. Continuous films did not exhibit photoluminescence. 	HfN films have been grown by PLD for the first time. Films grown have been shown to have high reflectivity in the visible region and low resistivity. These factors, along with their crystal structure, make them suitable candidates to be used as back-contacts in GaN LEDs and could also serve as buffer layers to enable the integration of GaN and Si technologies. Growth factors affecting the films’ final properties have been investigated. Nitrogen pressure, within the operating range of the plasma source, has been shown to have little effect on HfN films. Substrate temperature has been demonstrated to have more influence on the films’ properties, with 500 °C being established as optimum. ZrN films have also been grown by PLD. Early results indicated that they exhibit reflectivities 50 % ± 5 % lower than those of HfN. However, further growth and characterisation would be required in order to establish this as a fundamental property of ZrN as nitride targets were mostly used in ZrN production. 	Single-crystal epitaxial GdN and SmN films have been produced by PLD. This represents an improvement in the existing quality of GdN films reported in the literature, which are mostly polycrystalline. In the case of SmN, these are the first epitaxial films of this material to be grown. Film quality has been monitored in-situ by RHEED which has allowed growth to be tailored to produce ever-higher crystal quality. Post-growth analyses by collaborators was also of assistance in improving film growth. Substrate temperatures and nitrogen plasma parameters have been adjusted to find optimum values for each. In addition, laser fluence has been altered to minimise the presence of metal particulates in the films, which interfere with magnetic measurements carried out in analyses. Capping layers of Cr, YSZ or AlN have been deposited on the GdN and SmN prior to removal from vacuum to prevent their degradation upon exposure to atmospheric water vapour. The caps have been steadily improved over the course of this work, extending the lifetime of the nitride films in ambient. However, they remain volatile and this may persist since water vapour can enter the film at the edge regardless of capping quality. Optical transmission has shown an onset of absorption at 1. 3 eV for GdN and 1. 0 eV for SmN...|$|E
