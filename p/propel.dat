5|$|Graham {{and many}} of the players that had helped <b>propel</b> the Browns to a series of {{championship}} game appearances retired before the 1956 season. The 1956 team finished 5–7 that year, its first-ever losing record.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who, despite {{evidence}} to the contrary, deny that the moon landings took place. The Apollo moon landing hoax claims helped <b>propel</b> conspiracy theories into a quasi-political narrative.|$|E
5|$|Ballard is a {{wheelchair}} racing athlete, competing mainly in category T53 sprint events. Compared to T54 athletes, she has less {{use of her}} abdominal muscles, which means she cannot raise herself as much in her wheelchair {{to get the best}} angle to <b>propel</b> herself forward.|$|E

25|$|The {{projectile}} {{could be}} fired with <b>propelling</b> charge M7 (normal) at reduced velocity or with <b>propelling</b> charge M8 (super) to achieve full velocity. The dummy <b>propelling</b> charge M6 simulated the M8 charge. The velocity and range {{data in the}} table below is for the M8 charge.|$|R
50|$|A <b>propelling</b> nozzle {{converts}} a {{gas turbine}} or gas generator into a jet engine. Energy {{available in the}} gas turbine exhaust is converted into a high speed <b>propelling</b> jet by the nozzle. Turbofan engines may have an additional and separate <b>propelling</b> nozzle which produces a high speed <b>propelling</b> jet from the energy {{in the air that}} has passed through the fan. In addition, the nozzle helps to determine how the gas generator and fan operate as it acts as a downstream restrictor.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mukerji played leading roles in the social drama Mehndi (1998) and the comedy Hello Brother (1999). Both these films were {{critical}} and commercial disappointments which failed to <b>propel</b> her career forward.|$|E
5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot pedals to <b>propel</b> the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|Syracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, {{including}} a goal with 3:00 {{remaining in the}} game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period to <b>propel</b> the Orange into the Championship game. Syracuse's come-from-behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest.|$|E

25|$|Cable-propelled transit (CPT) is {{a transit}} {{technology}} that moves people in motor-less, engine-less vehicles that are <b>propelled</b> by a steel cable. There are two sub-groups of CPT – gondola lifts and cable cars (railway). Gondola lifts are supported and <b>propelled</b> from above by cables, whereas cable cars are supported and <b>propelled</b> from below by cables.|$|R
50|$|In {{projectile}} {{motion the}} most important force applied to the ‘projectile’ is the <b>propelling</b> force, {{in this case the}} <b>propelling</b> forces are the muscles that act upon the ball to make it move, and the stronger the force applied, the more <b>propelling</b> force, which means the projectile (the ball) will travel farther. See pitching, bowling.|$|R
5|$|The Mark 50 torpedo stored {{chemical}} energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas, which is sprayed over {{a block of}} solid lithium. The reaction generates heat, creating steam to <b>propel</b> the torpedo in a closed Rankine cycle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000–01 season, Pathan was {{immediately}} back in the Under-19s, this time bowling more, often delivering more than 20 overs per innings. In four matches, he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out, and took 10 wickets at 32.50. He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra, prompting the Baroda selectors to <b>propel</b> him into the senior team.|$|E
5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to <b>propel</b> the crew far enough in the event of an explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
3000|$|Three {{types of}} {{bio-inspired}} underwater robots {{have been developed}} in this research, including robotic fish <b>propelled</b> by a caudal fin, robotic manta ray <b>propelled</b> by two pectoral fins, and robotic fish <b>propelled</b> by multiple IPMC fins. The robotic fish was fabricated to verify the speed model described in “Physics-based control-oriented modeling of robotic fish <b>propelled</b> by IPMC caudal fin” section while the manta ray was built to validate the fabrication process for pectoral fin described in “Bio-inspired design of underwater robots” section. The robotic fish <b>propelled</b> by multiple IPMC fins was developed to validate both forward swimming and turning capabilities.

5|$|Dookie is {{the third}} studio album by American punk rock band Green Day, {{released}} on February 1, 1994, through Reprise Records. It was the band's first collaboration with producer Rob Cavallo and its major record label debut. Dookie became a worldwide commercial success, peaking at No. 2 on the US Billboard 200 and charting in seven countries. The album helped <b>propel</b> Green Day, and even punk rock music into mainstream popularity. Dookie was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for the shipment of 10 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to <b>propel</b> two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a greatly}} {{improved}} security {{situation in the}} city in 2012, many Somali expatriates began returning to Mogadishu for investment opportunities and {{to take part in}} the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process. Through both private efforts and public initiatives like the Somali Diaspora Corps, they have participated in the renovation of schools, hospitals, banks and other infrastructure, and have played a leading role in the capital's recovery. They have also helped to <b>propel</b> the local real estate market.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{electric}} skateboards {{have also}} appeared. These {{no longer require}} the <b>propelling</b> of the skateboard {{by means of the}} feet; rather an electric motor <b>propels</b> the board, fed by an electric battery.|$|R

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to <b>propel</b> while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers <b>propel</b> themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and <b>propel</b> themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
50|$|The {{howitzer}} fired separate loading, bagged charge ammunition, {{with seven}} different <b>propelling</b> charges, from 1 (the smallest) to 7 (the largest). The M454 Nuclear shell {{had its own}} M80 cartridge with three <b>propelling</b> charges.|$|R

5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails <b>propel</b> them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes <b>propel</b> themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could <b>propel</b> the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it {{to land on the}} Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E
