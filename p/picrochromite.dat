40|$|SUMMARY. Approximately forty, {{variously}} shaped, chromitite bodies {{occur in}} dunites and harz-burgites of the alpine-type peridotite complex of southern New Caledonia. The chromitites consist of pichrochromite (59 to 42 % Cr 203) and serpentinized olivine (Foge-a 2) and display {{a variety of}} textures (massive, disseminated, and orbicular) consistent with a magmatic cumulate origin. Dunites contain olivine (Foaz- 87) and I to 3 % <b>picrochromite</b> (50 to 39 % Cr~O 3). Harzburgites have less than 1 % spinel, ranging from <b>picrochromite</b> to ceylonite (45 to 28 % Cr 203) and often forming symplectic intergrowths with bronzite. Temperatures of crystallization f the cumulate picrochromites {{are believed to have}} been about I 2 oo ~ while the more aluminous symplectic spinels equilibrated under different conditions and may reflect a late stage recrystallization episode. THE New Caledonian ultramafic belt is an alpine-type, peridotite-gabbro-grano-diorite complex, which outcrops over the entire 500 km length of the archipelago as a series of spectacular, upstanding massifs and covers ome 41 % oftheislands ' urface of I 7 I 3 O km z. The southern portion of the largest, the Massif du Sud, consists predo-minantly of partially serpentinized harzburgite containing a cumulate dunite and eucrite core and intruded by felsic plutons. Chrome-rich spinels occur both as acces...|$|E
40|$|The {{products}} of Cr-smectite clays heated to 1350 ° C in nitrogen {{were evaluated by}} X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis. Cr-smectite clays were prepared at room temperature by contact between smectite clays and Cr species contained in OH-Cr solutions. The Cr species were prepared using chromium nitrate solution by addition of NaOH solution with OH/Cr = 2. Products of firing in nitrogen at the high temperature were different (magnesia chromite, donathite, iron chromium oxide and <b>picrochromite)</b> {{depending on the type}} of isomorphous substitution of the smectite structure and the amount of retained chromium...|$|E
40|$|Are kimberlites, lamproites, ultramafic lamprophyres and carbonatites genetically {{associated}} or not? There {{are strong}} opinions {{for and against}} any relationship. The 20 Ha Khaderpet pipe, discovered by Rio Tinto Exploration, is an unusual diamondiferous carbonatite-kimberlite clan rock (KCR) association in the Anumpalle Cluster of the Wajrakarur Kimberlite Field in the Dharwar Craton of Peninsular Indian. The Khaderpet pipe has a discrete sovite phase intrusive into KCR breccia, not noticed elsewhere in the Wajrakarur kimberlite field. Petrographically, the KCR is a clast-supported lithic breccia and crystal lithic tuff, with occasional pelletal lapilli. Clasts show a weak horizontal imbrication. The overall appearance of the tuffs and breccias is suggestive of terminal-blocked, vent accumulations that formed by under pressure, with spallation of country rock causing an abundance of granitoid debris. The sovite phase has up to 95 % calcite, occasionally showing flow textured polycrystalline laths set in a minor saponite matrix. There are mineralogical gradations from an olivine-rich ultramafic to a calcite-dominant rock resembling pure carbonatite. Rare REE mineral phases in the carbonatite include allanite and other REE-rich unidentified mineral phases. Xenocrystic high pressure phases in both ultramafic and carbonatite include mantle-derived diamonds, lherzolitic -, eclogitic – and subcalcic-pyrope, Ti-poor andradite, chrome diopside, <b>picrochromite</b> and picroilmenite. Extensive metasomatism {{in the form of}} reddening of country rock feldspars by hematite, introduction of green chlorite, and saponitic alteration of breccia clasts and the ultramafic phase is common. The chemistry of the Khaderpet ultramafic component, suggests the KCR is transitional between kimberlite and ultramafic lamprophyres, like certain other pipes in the Wajrakarur Kimberlite Field, with strong enrichment in LREE, CaO and CO 2. However, low MgO (~ 13 %) and high CaO (~ 10 %) values are more typical of ultramafic lamprophyres such as alnoite or aillikite. The significant carbonate content and the presence of accessory Ti-andradite would lead to the KCR being classified as an ultramafic lamprophyre under the IUGS classification. The Khaderpet carbonatite component shows extreme enrichment in REE approaching that of world-average carbonatite. Given the chemical and petrological characteristics of a carbonatite, along with the associated and widespread aureole of metasomatism, this phase {{is considered to be a}} late-stage fractionation product of the Khaderpet diamond-bearing ultramafic magma...|$|E
