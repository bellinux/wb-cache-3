To support this agenda within the University of Nottingham, ESCAPES aimed ‘to maximise both student satisfaction and administrative efficiency in the placement experience {{and to make a}} significant contribution to students’ readiness for career progression’ through applying service design techniques to a placements service, implementing changes, and then monitoring impact. Selected student-centred placement processes were investigated and refined to demonstrate a model of good practice, using appropriate technology, to support students’ experience of the placement from preparation through to conclusion. Working closely with three areas working on placements, improvements in processes were identified from the student viewpoint and executed through improvements to placement administration software and workflow together with learning and teaching activities using the Mahara ePortfolio system. These improvements were documented to inform central University <b>placements</b> <b>activity,</b> with the long-term aim of developing further tools and methods to make provision of placements more straightforward for the University. This will in turn improve provision for an increased level of <b>placement</b> <b>activity</b> in the light of anticipated rise in demand from students seeking to improve their employability...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Reviews (PEARs) Project was {{commissioned}} in 2008 by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) to review both the five-year programme of pharmacy {{education and training}} {{and the process of}} undergraduate course accreditation. This abstract describes the views of university staff and students on clinical placement education. Materials & Methods Design: Review of school (n = 3) documentation;qualitative interviews (n = 7) with key school staff (n = 8);self-completion questionnaire surveys of all undergraduate students(response rate 84. 5 %; n = 584 / 691) and pharmacy school staff(response rate 59. 8 %; n = 49 / 82). Setting: Irish schools of pharmacy. Main outcome measures: Views of staff and students on clinical <b>placement</b> <b>activity.</b> Results Documentary review indicated that the curriculum time spent on <b>placement</b> <b>activity</b> was small (29 – 104 h across four years); with staff indicating infrastructure and funding issues limiting further activity. A large majority of students with experience of placements (79 %, n = 436 / 554) indicated their professional placement(s) (term time and vacational) were a very good or good learning experience (78 %, n = 339 / 436). Most placements were in community pharmacy, with less than 10 % of students in any year having hospital placement experience. Most students (96 %, n = 556 / 580) and a majority of staff(66 %, n = 29 / 44) stated that placement education should be compulsory in at least one year of study. Over three-quarters of staff respondents strongly agreed or agreed that placements provide a meaningful experience of the workplace (92 %, n = 22 / 24), provide an opportunity for the development of professional behaviour and values (92 %, n = 22 / 24) and provide an opportunity for the application of knowledge (79 %, n = 19 / 24). Discussions, Conclusion Experience in the workplace is essential to contextualise learning and develop the skills, knowledge and values that determine professional competence. Although valued by students and staff, {{at the time of this}} study clinical placement education Ireland was limited. Therefore, PEARs recommended that the 4 + 1 model of pharmacy education to registration should be replaced by a five-year fully integrated programme of education, training and assessment,and that there should be a national body to co-ordinate <b>placement</b> <b>activity.</b> Disclosure of Interest None Declare...|$|R

40|$|The {{placement}} {{of young children}} with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is portrayed in the literature as complex, mainly due to difficulties matching the setting type with the child’s condition. Most studies focus on placement’s outcome; however, this phenomenological study explores placement as a process evolving through social interactions between parents and professionals. Therefore, the process for young ASD children within the Israeli context is explored {{from the perspectives of}} both parents and kindergarten teachers. The findings are interpreted based on Schutz’s social phenomenology. Data include semi-structured interviews with five mothers and four teachers, visual tools, documents, emails, telephone conversations and home–school communication notebooks. A detailed analysis of each case study is followed by a cross-case analysis. Findings suggest the <b>placement</b> <b>activity</b> offers little choice and is emotionally charged. Nevertheless, parents and teachers are actively involved, advocating for the child’s needs. Additionally, both agencies relate their actions to their “life-world” experience as parents or educators of ASD children. Knowledge within the <b>placement</b> <b>activity</b> creates boundaries between parents and professionals. Parents describe themselves as experts in their own field, whereas teachers and local education authorities see themselves as the experts and parents as informants and as passive recipients of services. Consequently, parents perceive local education authorities as alienated from their needs, not offering sufficient information or support. Informal agencies, mainly other parents sharing the same experiences, are perceived as offering missing information and support. Findings suggest that placement should be regarded as a socially evolving process whereby parents and professionals negotiate the appropriateness of a solution, relying on each agency’s “life-world” experience raising and educating an ASD child. Conceptualizing the process as such depends on developing a systemic change in professionals’ attitudes and actions towards parental involvement through educational programs that strengthen their notions of self-efficacy when working with parents...|$|R
