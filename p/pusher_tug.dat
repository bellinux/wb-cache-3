500|$|In 1861, Bartholomew {{met with}} the chairman, Warde-Aldam, to propose a system of {{sectional}} boats, each consisting of six compartments, with a bow and stern section. The compartments or tubs would be unloaded into ships by a hydraulic hoist at Goole, which would lift them from the water and tip them over.

5000|$|A pusher, pusher craft, pusher boat, <b>pusher</b> <b>tug,</b> or towboat, is a boat {{designed}} for pushing barges or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels {{refer to them}} as towboats.

These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways.

50|$|Steamboats entered {{trade in}} the 1820s, so the period 1830-1850 became {{the golden age of}} steamboats. As there were few roads or rails in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase, river traffic was an ideal solution. Cotton, timber and food came down the river, as did Appalachian coal. The port of New Orleans boomed as it was the {{trans-shipment}} point to deep sea ocean vessels. As a result, the image of the twin stacked, wedding cake Mississippi steamer entered into American mythology. Steamers worked the entire route from the trickles of Montana, to the Ohio River; down the Missouri and Tennessee, to the main channel of the Mississippi. Only {{with the arrival of the}} railroads in the 1880s did steamboat traffic diminish. Steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s.

50|$|On 25 August 1947, she {{proceeded}} to Orange, Tex., {{where she was}} decommissioned the same day and assigned to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. The tug was named Undaunted on 16 July 1948 and transferred to {{the custody of the}} Maritime Administration—although still owned by the Navy—in September 1961. By January 1963, her name was struck from the Navy list. She was later transferred to the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. She was then loaned as a training vessel to the US Merchant Marine academy at Kings Point, NY and renamed the T/V Kings Pointer. In 1993 the Kings Pointer was sold to basic Towing of Escanaba, MI and was renamed the Krystal K. In 1998 the vessel was sold again to Pere Marquette Shipping of Ludington, MI for use as a push tug for their 400 bulk barge Pere Marquette 41. The Krystal K was rebuilt as an articulated <b>pusher</b> <b>tug</b> and received a Hydraconn connection system and an elevated pilot house. Upon completion the tug was given her original name of Undaunted. The M/T Undaunted is still in service to this day on the Great Lakes.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} Bartholomew had {{obtained}} {{a patent on}} 7 February 1862, the plans had developed somewhat, as the design now included a steam-powered <b>pusher</b> <b>tug</b> instead of the stern compartment, and included chains which {{ran the length of}} the train to enable it to be steered. He had no idea how the boat would behave when afloat, and so the detailed design work was give to Hudswell and Clarke of Leeds, while the design of the hoist was the responsibility of William Armstrong and Co. Ltd. The original plan was to use doors {{in the side of the}} compartment to unload the coal, which would require it to be hoisted some 35 ft upwards to allow the coal to discharge into a coaster. Although Hudswell and Clarke may have built one compartment with side doors, and several designs were contemplated, the engineer at Armstrong's suggested that a better solution would be to raise the compartments in a cage, which could then be tipped right over, so that the coal was emptied out of the top of the boat. This they thought would only require the compartment to be raised by 25 ft, and so the hoist would be cheaper to build. By September 1863, the Aire and Calder had taken delivery of six compartments and a stern tug, but the bow section was missing, and construction of the hoist had not begun. Warde-Aldam expressed some concern, as the handling of such a boat was still unknown.|$|E

40|$|The {{inland waters}} of Ghana have a {{considerable}} {{potential for the}} operation of inland water transport (IWT) services. These services {{could be part of}} a multimodal transport corridor, to connect the northern regions and the northern landlocked countries with the industrial southern part of the country, which also includes the port of Tema, one of the gateways of the landlocked countries. However, despite the many advantages of IWT, these waters are currently barely used for freight transportation. The absence of a high quality IWT service is mainly unfortunate, as Ghana suffers from the consequences of the unilateral road transport market: the many trucks leads to congestions, traffic hazards and long (and unreliable) transport times. Besides this, the freight transportation by road is rather expensive. An IWT service on the Ghanaian inland waters could be able to improve the cost and time performances of the Ghanaian transit corridor. The Ghanaian inland waters are mainly formed by Lake Volta and the upstream Volta Rivers. The water levels of these waters are subject to the local climate, which results in (very) low water levels during the dry season (from November to July). The water levels of Lake Volta allow year round navigation, but that does not hold for the Volta Rivers. In fact, Buipe Port, along the Black Volta, is probably the most upstream location that can be reached for most part of the year, while a year round accessibility can be guaranteed after dredging a shoal, a bit downstream of the port. The potential container market for the IWT service is quite small, being about 8, 000 TEUs per year. Nearly all these containers are currently transported by road from Tema Port to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Due to the congestions and (bad) conditions of roads and trucks, the northbound journey (about 1, 000 km) takes about four days. The corresponding price for transport is also very high, being about USD 2, 600 for a 20 ft. container. The only commercial IWT service at Lake Volta, is not able to deliver better performances, due to bad and inappropriate equipment. The feasibility of three different IWT services is investigated: roll-on/roll-off of truck/trailer combinations or roll trailers on the one hand, and lift-on/lift-off of containers on the other hand. All the alternatives are based on the concept of barges being <b>pushed</b> by <b>push</b> <b>tugs,</b> as this is the most promising concept from a financial point of view. It can be concluded that the potential transit container market of 8, 000 TEU/year, for which the IWT service has to compete for, is too small to result in a profitable service. However, when relocating the transit traffic (clearance) procedures from Tema Port to Buipe Port, the yearly container throughput via Lake Volta will be much higher, making an IWT service viable and profitable. Besides, this relocation will result in extra space in the port of Tema, and can result in more efficient clearance procedures, thereby decreasing the total door-to-door time of transit traffic. <br/...|$|R

With a quick lunge he locked antlers in the grip he wanted; a twist of his massive neck and shoulders forced the opposing head aside, and a mighty spring of his crouching haunches finished the work. The second moose went over with a plunge like a bolt-struck pine. As he rolled up to his feet again the savage old bull jumped for him and drove the brow antlers into his flanks. The next moment both bulls had crashed away into the woods, one swinging off in giant strides through the crackling underbrush for his life, the other close behind, charging like a battering-ram into his enemy's rear, grunting like a huge wild boar in his rage and exultation. So the chase vanished over the ridge into the valley beyond; and silence stole back, like a Chinese empress, into her disturbed dominions.|$|R
