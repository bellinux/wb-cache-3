5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining was too high a <b>price</b> <b>to</b> pay for the actual benefits gained at high speed. Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.|$|E

The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock <b>price</b> <b>to</b> nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone.

In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} price {{discrimination}} {{in international trade}} {{that is associated with}} movements in exchange rates. This phenomenon is referred to as "pricing to market. " We find strong evidence of <b>pricing</b> <b>to</b> market for Japanese exports of automobiles. We find moderate evidence of such behavior for German auto exports, and very little <b>pricing</b> <b>to</b> market for U. S. auto exports. We conjecture that these sharp differences in export pricing behavior may be due to differences in the extent of overseas production by firms based in these countries. <b>Pricing</b> <b>to</b> market may be more important to firms that do not have plants in their target markets.; The patterns observed for automobiles do not hold up for total merchandise exports, where <b>pricing</b> <b>to</b> market varies by both source and destination country.

40|$|This paper investigates price {{discrimination}} of German exporters across different foreign markets. We examine {{the degree of}} pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations in the pricing of 70 export items. The model is estimated using panel data on export unit values.

The main results for 70 manufactured goods and 15 destination countries between 1990 - 1994 are : The degree of <b>pricing</b> <b>to</b> market differs among destinations and products.

In 2007, NBCUniversal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes.

In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved. Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99.

5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a <b>price</b> <b>to</b> be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E

Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal.
