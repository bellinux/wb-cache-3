25|$|The social constructionist {{perspective}} (see social constructionism for {{a general}} definition) on adolescent sexuality examines how power, culture, meaning and gender interact to affect the sexualities of adolescents. This perspective is closely tied to feminist and queer theory. Those {{who believe in the}} social constructionist perspective state that the current meanings most <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society tie to female and male sexuality are actually a social construction to keep heterosexual and privileged people in power.|$|E

40|$|To stand {{a chance}} of {{reclaiming}} their pre-colonial rights, indigenous peoples often have to deploy the tools and logic of the colonial state. Through {{a case study of}} community conservancy in Namibia, we demonstrate that the same holds for the practice of participatory mapping. We engage with J. B. Harley's deconstruction of maps and use our ethnographic data to reveal the silences and lies inherent in the rigid cartographic representations of conservancy maps. The indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> case study are the San, who have been marginalized and displaced from their land. We highlight how these people, once perceived by the colonialists as “rootless,” do have strong relational connections across the landscape. We argue that the practice of counter-mapping, along with its critique, is incomplete without full attention to the silences of the map and the relational rhizomes (across boundaries) of the peoples involved...|$|R
