40|$|IP {{multicast}} is {{an emerging}} WAN technology {{that provides the}} capability for efficient information dissemination from senders to potentially large sets of receivers. IP multicast distribution trees or pathways are enabled via {{a combination of the}} LAN-based Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) working in concert with multicast routing protocols. Reliable multicast transport protocols are designed to make efficient use of the underlying IP multicast routing technology, and yet provide reliable delivery semantics to end user applications. Although, much attention has recently been focused on the congestion control aspects of reliable multicast protocols, little analysis has been carried-out regarding the basic protocol control costs. In this paper, Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol II (RMTP II), a reliable multicast transport that has recently been proposed to the IETF, is analyzed.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model for the problem of scheduling tests for core-based system-on-chip (SOC) VLSI designs. Given a set of tests for each core in the SOC {{and a set of}} test resources (e. g., test access mechanisms (TAM)), we determine the test plan for the application of the tests to the SOC. Test planning in this paper refers to the combined activities of test access architecture partitioning and test scheduling. These activities must be performed in conjunc-tion as the choice of the test access architecture influences the test schedule. We justify the formulation of test schedul-ing w. r. t. minimum average completion time criterion as compared to minimum makespan.

40|$|Disruption of transit {{service is}} a common {{occurrence}} in many cities around the world, and these incidents may have serious impacts on the transit user’s journey. Transit user behavioural response under disrupted service conditions, specifically how transit riders choose among available mode options to complete their trips, is not well understood. Mode choice studies often lack proper consideration of travel time variability and uncertainty in such situations, neither do they fully account for some options considered by users, such as waiting, taking a shuttle bus, or cancelling the trip. This study aims to investigate transit user mode choice in response to peak hour rapid transit service disruption in the City of Toronto, incorporating such factors as the type of disruption, stage of the passenger’s trip (pre-trip or en-route), weather conditions, and uncertainty of delay duration. A joint Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) survey is designed where the RP part gathers information on the respondent’s actual response {{to the most recent}} service disruption while the SP part solicits the respondent’s responses under a set of hypothetical service disruption scenarios. A transit trip <b>planner</b> <b>tool</b> is developed to generate alternative transit mode and path options to avoid the disrupted segment.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 55 - 56) Predicted {{increases in}} air traffic are driving {{a paradigm shift}} in the Air Traffic Management system. The ATM research community has identified the adoption of Trajectory-Based Operations a viable concept of operation to accommodate the traffic growth while maintaining system safety and efficiency. This transition would require pilots and controllers to use trial planner tools to create, evaluate, modify trajectories that are exchanged between the ground and airborne systems. However, various lags (e. g., in communications or computation of trajectories) can induce delays in providing the feedback to the user during conflict search and trial planning processes. This research addresses this issue by conducting an experiment to {{study the effects of}} feedback delays on pilots during conflict detection and avoidance tasks. Twelve pilots participated in 40 en-route flight part-task simulations that required them to avoid separation violations with surrounding aircraft while maintaining flight safety and fuel efficiency. Actual air traffic over Kansas City airspace was simulated in the experiment and scaled to have moderate and higher density than current day level. The traffic was displayed on the NASA Ames Cockpit Situation Display, which featured a trial <b>planner</b> <b>tool</b> equipped with conflict alerting functionality. Feedback delays of 0, 2, 4 and 8 seconds were added to the conflict alerting functionality to observe any significant changes in pilot comfort as well as route efficiency and safety. Irrespective of the levels of feedback delays, pilots showed no significant decrease in performance in moderate traffic density simulations. However, the results were considerably different in the high traffic density condition, where the efficiency decreased significantly at levels of delay greater than 0 seconds and the pilot decision time increased significantly. In addition, pilots were more likely to commit to unsafe routes in high-density conditions with feedback delays greater than 0 seconds. It is reasonable to assume that delays are impossible to completely eradicate, but perhaps they need not be completely removed from these systems to successfully meet flight and business objectives. With thorough calculations stakeholders may be able to extrapolate the amount of feedback delay that can be deemed as acceptable in order to meet safety as well as business requirements...|$|E
