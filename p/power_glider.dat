40|$|In eleven lectures {{presented}} at a symposium {{on the occasion}} of the 'international trade exhibition for flying and general aviation' (AERO ' 95, Friedrichshafen, April 1995), a retrospect is given on the most important achievements of the German piston motor producers since 1955 with special regard to the actual state of the art at piston aircraft engines in Germany and Austria. In addition, future aims and requirements in the development of aircraft engines have been compiled. The lecture program includes the following topics: rotax motors, two-stroke aircraft engines for light aircrafts, two-stroke opposed-pisoton aircraft engines for multifuel operation, opposed-cylinder engines, VIP rotary-piston engines, propeller design, noise reduction in aviation, driving system of the <b>power</b> <b>glider</b> STEMME S 10.

5000|$|The 45 lb PBS TJ-100 {{turbine engine}} [...] {{requires}} a two-minute cooldown before retracting into the fuselage. The prototype was tested by Bob Carlton, an experienced jet <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> pilot who flies an aerobatic routine in a Super Salto jet <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> {{with the same}} engine. Sonex Aircraft also uses the same engine, and hired Carlton to test its SubSonex jet-powered homebuilt aircraft.|$|R

50|$|<b>Powered</b> <b>gliders</b> have {{recently}} seen {{an increase in}} popularity. By combining the efficient wing size and wide speed envelope of a glider airframe with an electric motor, {{it is possible to}} achieve long flight times and high carrying capacity, as well as glide in any suitable location regardless of thermals or lift. A common method of maximising flight duration is to quickly fly a <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> upwards to a chosen altitude and descending in an unpowered glide. Folding propellers which reduce drag (as well as the risk of breaking the propellor) are standard. <b>Powered</b> <b>gliders</b> built with stability in mind and capable of aerobatics, high speed flight and sustained vertical flight are classified as 'Hot-liners'. 'Warm-liners' are powered craft with similar abilities but less extreme thrust capability.|$|R
