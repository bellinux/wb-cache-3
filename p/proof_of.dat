5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations {{for developing the}} axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E

Examples are: identification-, signature-, group signature-, anonymous credential-, and identity escrow-schemes as well as voting systems, e-cash, multi-party computations, and trusted computing. This dissertation studies efficient zero-knowledge <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for exponentiation homomorphisms. We prove that there are inherent efficiency limitations for existing <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for homomorphisms and describe novel <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> knowledge that overcome these efficiency limitations. All efficient zero-knowledge <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for homomorphisms happen to be instances of the same protocol. We refer to this protocol as the Σψ-protocol. While all efficient zero-knowledge <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for homomorphisms are obtained using the Σψ-protocol, the converse is not true: the Σψ-protocol is not known to yield efficient <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> knowledge for al...|$|R
