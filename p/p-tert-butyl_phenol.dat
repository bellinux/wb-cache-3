25|$|Calixarenes are characterised by a {{three-dimensional}} basket, cup or bucket shape. In calixarenes the internal volume is around 10 cubic angstroms. Calixarenes are characterised {{by a wide}} upper rim and a narrow lower rim and a central annulus. With phenol as a starting material the 4 hydroxyl groups are intrannular on the lower rim. In a resorcinarene 8 hydroxyl groups are placed extraannular on the upper ring. Calixarenes exist in different chemical conformations because rotation around the methylene bridge is not difficult. In calixarene 4 up-down conformations exist: cone (point group C2v,C4v), partial cone Cs, 1,2 alternate C2h and 1,3 alternate D2d. The 4 hydroxyl groups interact by hydrogen bonding and stabilize the cone conformation. This conformation is in dynamic equilibrium with the other conformations. Conformations can be locked in place with proper substituents replacing the hydroxyl groups which increase the rotational barrier. Alternatively placing a bulky substituent on the upper rim also locks a conformation. The calixarene based on <b>p-tert-butyl</b> <b>phenol</b> is also a cone. Calixarenes are structurally related to the pillararenes.|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} MWW-based {{catalysts}} (MCM- 22, MCM- 36 and ITQ- 2) were {{studied in the}} liquid phase alkylation of phenol by tert-butanol (TBA). Ammonia adsorption calorimetry was applied to investigate the acid properties of zeolites with different framework topology and cristallinity. It was established that acid properties of MCM- 22 family depend mainly of the solid Al-content (the Si/Al ratio varied from 9. 1 to 46. 0). Delamination of MCM- 22 precursor (MCM- 22 (P)) leading to ITQ- 2 results in the decrease of the total acidity and th eincrease of the intermediate acid sites concentration, while the pillaring process yielding MCM- 36 affected mainly the total concentration of acid sites, the acid strenght distribution being similar to th ecorresponding MCM- 22 zeolite. The catalytic activity and selectivity of zeolite-based calysts are discussed. The most active catalyst for the studied reaction was MCM- 22 B (Si/Al 15. The results obtained with MCM- 22 as catalyst revealed that, despite th expectations due {{to the presence of}} 10 -MR pores in the structure of this zeolite, no enhanced selectivity to <b>p-tert-butyl</b> <b>phenol</b> is observed. This has been rationalized by the assumption that most of reactions occurring in this system take place on acid sites at or close to the external surface. This assumption is also supported by the similar catalytic selectivity of the MWW-derved structures (viz. MCM- 36 and ITQ- 2), which expose a higher concentration of external pockets. However, it is noticeable the high catalytic activity of MCM- 22 zeolites for the liquid phase alkylation of phenol by TBA that is comparable to the gas phase activity of large pore zeolites like as HY or HM...|$|E
