40|$|First-day {{spacecraft}} failures frequently {{occur as}} a result of the loads experienced during launch into orbit. These loads include structural vibrations transmitted at points of structural contact, and structural-acoustic vibrations created by the excitation of the payload fairing cavity. Structural control techniques, using piezoelectric actuators, have previously been studied as cost-effective ways of reducing the structural-acoustic vibrations being transmitted into the fairing cavity. These structural control methods, while effective at reducing the sound transmitted into a structure, have not been as effective for controlling acoustic reflections from surfaces. This is due to large impedance mismatches at the solid-fluid interface where control is applied. Recent developments in <b>plasma</b> <b>engineering</b> have made it possible to create a uniform glow-discharge plasma over a surface at one atmosphere (OAUGDP).

Experimental campaigns {{over the past two}} years have focused on understanding the physical mechanisms that affect the plasma performance realized with all-molybdenum walls versus walls with low-Z coatings. RF sheath rectification along flux tubes that intersect the RF antenna is found to be a major cause of localized boron erosion and impurity generation. Initial lower-hybrid current drive (LHCD) experiments (PLH < 900 kW) have demonstrated fully noninductive current drive at Ιρ ~ 1. 0 MA with good efficiency, Ιdrive = 0. 4 PLH/neoR (MA,MW, 1020 m− 3,m). Disruption mitigation via massive gas-jet impurity puffing has proven successful at high plasma pressure, indicating this technique has promise for implementation on ITER. Pressure gradients in the near SOL of Ohmic L-mode plasmas are observed to scale consistently as Ι 2 (over) ρ, and show a significant dependence on X-point topology. Modeling of H-mode edge fueling indicates high self-screening to neutrals in the pedestal and scrape-off layer (SOL), and reproduces experimental density pedestal response to changes in neutral source.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{fundamental}} {{issues related to}} synthesis of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which is relationship between plasma parameters and SWNT characteristics were investigated. Given that among plasma-based techniques arc discharge stands out as very advantageous in several ways (fewer defects, high flexibility, longer lifetime) this techniques warrants attention from the plasma physics and plasma technology standpoint. Both experimental and theoretical investigations of the plasma and SWNTs synthesis were conducted. Experimental efforts focused on plasma diagnostics, measurements of nanostructures parameters, and nanoparticle characterization. Theoretical efforts focused to focus on multi-dimensional modeling of the arc discharge and single wall nanotube synthesis in arc plasmas. It was demonstrated in experiment and theoretically that controlling plasma parameters can affect nanostucture synthesis altering SWNT properties (length and diameter) and leading to synthesis of new structures such as a few-layer graphene. Among clearly identified parameters affecting synthesis are magnetic and electric fields. Knowledge of the plasma parameters and discharge characteristics is crucial for ability to control synthesis process by virtue of both magnetic and electric fields.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the plasma based processes which take place during the deposition of thin films is a prerequisite to deposit complex layer systems. The deposition of metallic and non-metallic films using dense plasmas in combination with suitable in-situ-diagnostics is described in this paper. In the experiment dense He- and Ar-plasmas were generated by a low pressure arc discharge using a hollow LaB_ 6 -cathode in the plasma facility PETRA (<b>plasma</b> <b>engineering</b> and technology research assembly). Typical values for the density and electron temperature were n_e = 10 " 1 " 2 [...] 10 " 1 " 3 cm"-" 3 and kT_e = 5 [...] 20 eV. The influence of different configurations of the magnetic field (homogeneous and cusp) were investigated in view of homogenity of the layers and the deposition rate. Usually the adhesion of non-metallic films (a-C:H) on metal substrates {{is limited by the}} high internal stresses of the coating and the poor interfacial contact between coating and substrate. A concept to improve the adhesion of coatings is to introduce a metal interlayer (Al) with a gradient transition to the non-metal coating. For the deposition of homogeneous coatings a combination of plasma assisted PVD and CVD methods was used. The coatings were characterised by SEM, EDS, TEM/TED, IR-spectroscopy, Raman-spectroscopy and SIMS analyses as well as microindentation measurements. The influence of different parameters on the plasma and the local distribution of plasma density and electron temperature were measuredDissertation by Hemel, V., 128 refs.

40|$|Isolated hepatocytes {{removed from}} their {{microenvironment}} soon lose their hepatospecific functions when cultured. Highly oxygen-demanding hepatocytes are commonly maintained under oxygen-deficient culture conditions, limited by culture medium thickness as well scaffold thickness. Thus, the cells are forced into anaerobic metabolic states that degenerate liver specific functions. Furthermore, cells separated from their extracellular matrix and disconnected from the synergistic interactions between other hepatic cells types further exacerbate hepatocellular function. This study aims to improve hepatospecific activity, especially CYP 3 A 2 - a biomarker that is notoriously known to quickly lose expression in primary cultures, by creating a platform based on collagen sandwich cultures. The modified sandwich cultures are substituted with self-assembling peptide, RAD 16 -I, combined with integrin-binding sequence RGD or laminin receptor binding sequence YIGSR functional peptide motifs to create a cell-instructive peptide scaffold. To facilitate oxygen and nutrient diffusion and exchange, plasma modification technology is employed to control peptide layer dimension. We have successfully shown that <b>plasma</b> <b>engineering</b> {{can be used to}} optimize peptide thickness. (cont.) Likewise, we have shown that the incorporation of the functional motifs enhanced hepatospecific activity. CYP 3 A 2 expression from cultures on our platform improved over 256 times the levels found in collagen sandwich cultures, the current standard for hepatocyte cultures. This study demonstrates the capability of sandwich cultures with modified instructive self-assembling peptides and the importance of thinner cultures scaffolds to promote better oxygen and nutrient exchange. We believe that our novel bioengineered platform has the potential to greatly improve existing hepatocyte culture methods and be invaluable to future in vitro hepatocyte studies as well as toxicity tests.
