2500|$|Cannon Mountain was {{the site}} of the first {{passenger}} aerial tramway in North America. From its construction in 1938 to its 1980 retirement, the first tram carried 6,581,338 passengers up the [...] route to near the summit of Cannon Mountain. On May 24, 1980, the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway II was dedicated. Alexander Bright, a skier involved in developing the sport in the area, conceived the idea of building a tramway in New Hampshire during his trip to Europe {{as a member of the}} US Olympic Ski Team in 1933. In Europe, Bright had seen passenger-carrying tramways and recognized that building one in New Hampshire could foster the growth of skiing and summer tourism in the White Mountains. Bright persuaded L.R. Batemen of the American Steel and Wire Company to conduct a preliminary survey to locate a suitable site for a tramway and to estimate construction costs. In November 1933, the first <b>physical</b> <b>survey</b> of Franconia Notch was made by Batemen, E.J. Lloyd and Roland Peabody of Franconia, who was called in as an advisor because of his knowledge of the area and his enthusiasm for recreation development in the White Mountains. Bright's idea appealed to an increasing numbers of people and groups associate with winter sports, and Peabody, through his enthusiasm, aroused the support of the New Hampshire legislature.|$|E

40|$|The Gypsum Plain {{region of}} the Delaware Basin hosts {{approximately}} 1800 km 2 of the Castile Formation outcrop. A myriad of karstic developments from closed sinkholes to large multi-kilometer cave systems have been documented within the region. Karst studies on the distribution and speleogenetic evolution within Castile strata began within the last decade with ever increasing data resolution. In this study, {{a combination of both}} <b>physical</b> field <b>surveys</b> and analyses of high resolution (~ 30 cm accuracy) LiDAR data was used to create a theoretical model for karst development across the region. This idealized model considers speleogenetic formation type variations (hypogene and epigene), the density of karstic features based on lithology variations, and the connection between the local hydrostratigraphic setting and the regional hydrogeological framework. Field studies included physical mapping of 20 km 2 of the Gypsum Plain from the Castile’s western outcrop to where it dips into the subsurface to the east. These surface surveys involved the recording of all surfically-expressed karstic phenomena and the mapping of all enterable caves so that the speleogenetic evolution could be analyzed. The way in which hypogene and epigene caves are surfically expressed across the region indicates that many of the caves have been affected by either multi-stage epigenetic development or multi-stage hypogenetic development with epigenetic overprinting. Through the use of the methods outlined above, surficial karst manifestations vary across the region, from hypogenetic exposures in the west and epigenetic phreatic / vadose exposures in the east. Additionally, supplementary LiDAR data was used to create digital elevation models (DEM) so that the effectiveness of <b>physical</b> field <b>surveys</b> versus remote sensing techniques could be determined. Previous works in the area by Stafford et al., (2008 b) determined that remote sensing preserved only 36 % of all karstic features found through <b>physical</b> field <b>surveys.</b> Given today’s advancements in remote sensing accuracy, this study determined that on average LiDAR analysis identifies almost seven times more karstic features than <b>physical</b> <b>surveys</b> over a given area...|$|R

Additionally, eelgrass and green algae overlap extensively in shallow intertidal areas, confounding efforts to distinguish between habitat types from imagery alone. A relative exposure index (REI) was developed to identify areas of eelgrass habitat that may be prone to disturbance from wind-waves. Approximately 2200 hectares of eelgrass habitat were identified.
