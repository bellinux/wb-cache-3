40|$|LAPLUS {{is a novel}} switch {{algorithm}} for {{flow control}} of the Available Bit Rate (ABR) Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) service. It ensures a steady-state rate allocation satisfying the MCR-plus-equal-share criterion. It only requires constant-time processing and two tags to be stored per flow. It is naturally able to take <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rates</b> of flows into account. LAPLUS solves in a novel way the problem of selecting a measurement interval.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how {{the concept of}} cell conformance testing developed within the CCITT could apply for connections with two types of traffic (namely with both CLP= 0 and CLP= 1 cells) in the Traffic Contract recommended by the CCITT (i. e., declaration of the <b>peak</b> <b>cell</b> <b>rates</b> of the CLP= 0 and the aggregate CLP= 0 + 1 cell streams). This issue is crucial {{in the sense that}} this Traffic Contract could be invalid if it were impossible to define an unambiguous conformance testing procedure. We show that most of the cell conformance testing mechanisms that could be naturally considered suffer from an undesirable phenomenon, namely measurement phasing which jeopardizes their use. We then propose a mechanism for cell conformance testing which does not suffer from any problem of measurement phasing and which can account for cell tagging. Along with this mechanism we propose a method of computing reference Cell Loss Ratios for connections with both CLP= 0 and CLP= 1 cells...|$|R
40|$|Vernier {{performance}} with moving targets is accurate independent of velocity. Is this inherent in ganglion-cell responses or must central mechanisms integrate activity {{to achieve this}} invariance? Precision of responses to bars and gratings was assessed by neurometric analysis. For magnocellular (MC) cells, spatial precision with bar stimuli was independent of movement speed; this was not so for parvocellular cells. For gratings, precision was maximal for MC cells at low temporal frequencies and increased above ~ 6 Hz. With slow stimuli, rates are low but the many impulses give precise spatial information. With rapid movement, peak rates are high but the few impulses give noisy signals. MC-cell spatial precision resembled human performance, so these features are utilised psychophysically. This constrains central motion mechanisms. The neurometric result required analysis over several hundred milliseconds. However, near-optimal performance is achieved with brief presentations (< 100 ms). This is resolved if central spatiotemporal filters extract a motion signal by combining/comparing activity of a small sub-mosaic of cells. Secondly, in the motion tasks, human performance correlated with cell signal-to-noise ratio. In other tasks such as flicker detection, human performance correlated with <b>peak</b> <b>cell</b> <b>rates.</b> This difference may arise from multiple detectors, or a single more sophisticated central comparator or detector...|$|R

40|$|Due to the connection-oriented {{nature of}} the {{asynchronous}} transfer mode (ATM), {{one of the challenges}} in mobile wireless ATM (WATM) systems is the management of terminal handovers. When ATM connections are reestablished to follow terminals moving between areas covered by distinct base stations, seamless handover protocols are necessary to guarantee that ATM cells are delivered to terminals in the correct order, with <b>cell</b> loss <b>rate</b> and delay that satisfy the contracted quality of service (QoS). A promising approach to meet QoS requirements is based on the use of handover buffers at the (destination) base station, where transmitted cells are stored while the connection is being reestablished. Up to date, only simulation and experimental results are available to determine the performance of such protocols and buffering schemes. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an analytical modeling approach to estimate the performance of handover protocols making use of handover buffers at the base station. By incorporating several approximations, the proposed models allow designers to simultaneously take into account numerous system parameters, including handover buffer size, sustainable and <b>peak</b> <b>cell</b> <b>rates</b> of the ATM connection, terminal offered load, and time needed to reestablish the ATM connection. Analytical performance predictions are shown to closely match results of detailed simulation experiments, thus demonstrating the suitability of the proposed modeling framework for the selection of the most adequate solution to handle handover and provide the QoS required by end users...|$|R

In Long Term Evolution (LTE), MIMO technologies have been broadly used to get better downlink <b>peak</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>cell</b> coverage, as well as average cell throughput.

50|$|Burst {{transmission}} or burstiness, i.e. transmitting a {{burst of}} traffic at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower rate transmission, may {{also be seen as}} a form of jitter, as it represents a deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts is commonly seen a desirable feature, e.g. in variable bitrate transmissions. Usage/Network Parameter Control (UPC and NPC), as implemented in ATM networks, allows both a Maximum Burst Size (MBS) parameter on the average or Sustained Cell Rate (SCR), and a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) on the <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (PCR) at which the bursts are transmitted.|$|E

50|$|A burst or {{clump of}} packets can {{arrive at a}} higher rate than {{determined}} by the emission interval T. This may be the line rate of the physical layer connection when the packets in the burst will arrive back-to-back. However, as in ATM, the tolerance may be applied to a lower rate, in that case the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR), and the burst of packets (cells) can arrive {{at a higher rate}}, but less than the line rate of the physical layer, in that case the <b>Peak</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (PCR). The MBS may then be the number of cells needed to transport a higher layer packet (see segmentation and reassembly), where the packets are transmitted with a maximum bandwidth determined by the SCR and cells within the packets are transmitted at the PCR; thus allowing the last cell of the packet, and the packet itself, to arrive significantly earlier than it would if the cells were sent at the SCR: transmission duration = (MBS-1)/PCR rather than (MBS-1)/SCR. This bursting at the PCR puts a significantly higher load on shared resources, e.g. switch output buffers, than does transmission at the SCR, and is thus more likely to result in buffer overflows and network congestion. However, it puts a lesser load on these resources than would transmitting at the SCR with a limit value, τSCR, that allows MBS cells to be transmitted and arrive back-to-back at the line rate.|$|E

MIMO systems use more than one antenna configuration for sending and receiving radio signals of the same frequency. The concept of beam forming may be utilized by MIMO systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{propose a}} {{computational}} {{model of the}} CA 3 region of the rat hippocampus that is able to reproduce the available experimental data concerning the dependence of directional selectivity of the place cell discharge {{on the environment and}} on the spatial task. The main feature of our model is a continuous, unsupervised Hebbian learning dynamics of recurrent connections, which is driven by the neuronal activities imposed upon the network by the environment-dependent external input. In our simulations, the environment and the movements of the rat are chosen to mimic those commonly observed in neurophysiological experiments. The environment is represented as local views that depend on both the position and the heading direction of the rat. We hypothesize that place cells are intrinsically directional, that is, they respond to local views. We show that the synaptic dynamics in the recurrent neural network rapidly modify the discharge correlates of the place cells: Cells tend to become omnidirectional place cells in open fields, while their directionality tends to get stronger in radial-arm mazes. We also find that the synaptic learning mechanisms account for other properties of place cell activity, such as an increase in the place <b>cell</b> <b>peak</b> firing <b>rates</b> as well as clustering of place fields during exploration. Our model makes several experimental predictions that can be tested using current techniques. Hippocampu...|$|R

40|$|A {{perennial}} {{problem in}} recombinant protein expression is low yield {{of the product}} of interest. A strategy which {{has been shown to}} increase the production of baculovirus-expressed proteins is to utilise fed-batch cultures. One disadvantage of this approach is the time-consuming task of optimising the feeding strategy. Previously, a statistical optimisation routine was applied to develop a feeding strategy that increased the yield of beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal) by 2. 4 -fold (Biotechnol. Bioeng, 59 (1998) 178). This involves the single addition of nutrient concentrates (amino acids, lipids. glucose and yeastolate ultrafiltrate) into Sf 9 cell cultures grown in SF 900 II medium. In this study, it is demonstrated that this optimised fed-batch strategy developed for a high-yielding intracellular product beta-Gal could be applied successfully to a relatively low-yielding glycosylated and secreted product such as the dengue virus glycoprotein NS 1. Optimised batch infections yielded 4 mug/ml of NS 1 at a <b>peak</b> <b>cell</b> density of 4. 2 x 10 (6) cells/ml. In contrast. optimised fed-batch infections exhibited a 3 -fold improvement in yield, with 12 mug ml of NS 1 produced at a <b>peak</b> <b>cell</b> density of 11. 3 x 10 (6) cells/ml. No further improvements in yield were recorded when the feed volumes were doubled and the <b>peak</b> <b>cell</b> density was increased to 23 x 10 (6) cells/ml, unless the cultures were stimulated by the addition of 4 mug/ml of 20 -Hydroxyecdysone (an insect moulting hormone). In this case, the NS 1 yield was increased to 20 mug/ml. which was nearly 5 -fold higher than optimised batch cultures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
