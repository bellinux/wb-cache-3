50|$|During normal mitosis, the SAC {{is active}} {{for a short}} {{duration}} of minutes. During this period, spindle microtubules attach to chromosomes and rectify any improper attachments. High cyclin B levels are also maintained through inhibition of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that normally seeks out cyclin B for degradation. This particular ligase {{is referred to as}} (APC/C) anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome. When the APC/C is inhibited, cyclin B levels are kept high by the SAC and it ultimately protects cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1). Mitosis is prompted by the activation of (CDK1) by cyclin B. After confirmation of proper attachment of all chromosomes, the SAC is turned off and degradation of cyclin B occurs by way of the (APC/C). Spindle poisons, in contrast, inhibit kinetochores during mitosis and prevent them from forming proper attachments to spindle microtubules. <b>Permanent</b> <b>activation</b> of the SAC ensues along with a mitotic arrest that lasts several hours.

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) generates a diffusible protein complex that prevents anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to spindle microtubules. A key step in SAC initiation is {{the recruitment of}} MAD 1 to kinetochores, which is generally thought to be governed by the microtubule-kinetochore (MT-KT) attachment status. However, we demonstrate that the recruitment of MAD 1 via BUB 1, a conserved kinetochore receptor, is not affected by MT-KT interactions in human cells. Instead, BUB 1 :MAD 1 interaction depends on BUB 1 phosphorylation, which is controlled by a biochemical timer that integrates counteracting kinase and phosphatase effects on BUB 1 into a pulse-generating incoherent feedforward loop. We propose that this attachment-independent timer serves to rapidly activate the SAC at mitotic entry, before the attachment-sensing MAD 1 receptors have become fully operational. The BUB 1 -centered timer is largely impervious to conventional anti-mitotic drugs, and it is, therefore, a promising therapeutic target to induce cell death through <b>permanent</b> SAC <b>activation.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is {{the most}} {{effective}} microbial control agent for controlling numerous species from different insect orders. The main threat for the long term use of B. thuringiensis in pest control is the ability of insects to develop resistance. Thus, the identification of insect genes involved in conferring resistance is of paramount importance. A colony of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was selected for 15 years in the laboratory for resistance to Xentari (TM), a B. thuringiensis-based insecticide, reaching a final resistance level of greater than 1, 000 -fold. Around 600 midgut ESTs were analyzed by DNA-macroarray in order to find differences in midgut gene expression between susceptible and resistant insects. Among the differentially expressed genes, repat and arylphorin were identified and their increased expression was correlated with B. thuringiensis resistance. We also found overlap among genes that were constitutively over-expressed in resistant insects with genes that were up-regulated in susceptible insects after exposure to Xentari (TM), suggesting a <b>permanent</b> <b>activation</b> of the response to Xentari (TM) in resistant insects. Increased aminopeptidase activity in the lumen of resistant insects in the absence of exposure to Xentari (TM) corroborated the hypothesis of <b>permanent</b> <b>activation</b> of response genes. Increase in midgut proliferation has been proposed as a mechanism of response to pathogens in the adult from several insect species.

40|$|Macropinocytosis {{results from}} the closure of lamellipodia {{generated}} by membrane ruffling, thereby reflecting cortical actin dynamics. Both transformation of Rat- 1 fibroblasts by v-Src or K-Ras and stable transfection for expression of dominant-positive, wild-type phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) regulatory subunit p 85 alpha constitutively led to stress fiber disruption, cortical actin recruitment, extensive ruffling, and macropinosome formation, as measured by a selective acceleration of fluid-phase endocytosis. These alterations closely correlated with activation of PI 3 K and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), as assayed by 3 -phosphoinositide synthesis in situ and in vitro and inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate steady-state levels, respectively; they were abolished by stable transfection of v-Src-transformed cells for dominant-negative truncated p 85 alpha expression and by pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3 K and PI-PLC, indicating a requirement for both enzymes. Whereas PI 3 K activation resisted PI-PLC inhibition, PI-PLC activation was abolished by a PI 3 K inhibitor and dominant-negative transfection, thus placing PI-PLC downstream of PI 3 K. Together, {{these data suggest that}} <b>permanent</b> sequential <b>activation</b> of both PI 3 K and PI-PLC is necessary for the dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, resulting in constitutive ruffling and macropinocytosis...|$|R

40|$|For area reasons, NMOS {{transistors}} are preferred over PMOS for {{the pull-up}} path in gate drivers. Bootstrapping has to ensure sufficient NMOS gate overdrive. Especially in high-current gate drivers with large transistors, the bootstrap capacitor {{is too large}} for integration. This paper proposes three options of fully integrated bootstrap circuits. The key {{idea is that the}} main bootstrap capacitor is supported by a second bootstrap capacitor, which is charged to a higher voltage and ensures high charge allocation when the driver turns on. A capacitor sizing guideline and the overall driver implementation including a suitable charge pump for <b>permanent</b> driver <b>activation</b> is provided. A linear regulator is used for bootstrap supply and it also compensates the voltage drop of the bootstrap diode. Measurements from a testchip in 180 nm high-voltage BiCMOS confirm the benefit of high-voltage charge storing. The fully integrated bootstrap circuit with two stacked 75. 8 pF and 18. 9 pF capacitors results in an expected voltage dip of lower than 1 V. Both bootstrap capacitors require 70 % less area compared to a conventional bootstrap circuit. Besides drivers, the proposed bootstrap can also be directly applied to power stages to achieve fully integrated switched mode power supplies or class-D output stages...|$|R

40|$|The Aspergillus nidulans {{zinc finger}} {{transcription}} factor PacC is activated by proteolytic processing {{in response to}} ambient alkaline pH. The pH-regulated step is the transition of full-length PacC from a closed to an open, protease-accessible conformation. Here we show that {{in the absence of}} ambient pH signaling, the C-terminal negative-acting domain prevents the nuclear localization of full-length closed PacC. In contrast, the processed PacC form is almost exclusively nuclear at any ambient pH. In the presence of ambient pH signaling, the fraction of PacC that is in the open conformation but has not yet been processed localizes to the nucleus. Therefore, ambient alkaline pH leads to an increase in nuclear PacC by promoting the proteolytic elimination of the negative-acting domain to yield the processed form and by increasing the proportion of full-length protein that is in the open conformation. These findings explain why mutations resulting in commitment of PacC to processing irrespective of ambient pH lead to <b>permanent</b> PacC <b>activation</b> and alkalinity mimicry. A nuclear import signal that targets Escherichia coli b-galactosidase to the nucleus has been located to the PacC zinc finger region. A mutation abolishing DNA binding does not prevent nuclear localization of the processed form, showing that PacC processing does not lead to nuclear localization by passive diffusion of the protein made possible by the reduction in size, followed by retention in the nucleus after DNA binding.

Newborn mice with a {{ubiquitous}} deletion of IκBα develop a severe hematological disorder characterized by an increase of granulocyte/erythroid/monocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GEMM) and hypergranulopoiesis. Here, we report that this particular myeloproliferative disturbance is mediated by continuously deregulated perinatal expression of Jagged 1 in IκBα-deficient hepatocytes.

In contrast, in mice with a conditional deletion of IκBα only in the myeloid lineage (ikbaflox/flox × LysM-Cre) and in fetal liver cell chimeras (ikbaFLΔ/FLΔ), a cell-autonomous induction of the myeloproliferative disease was not observed. Coculture of IκBα-deficient hepatocytes with wild-type (wt) BM cells induced a Jagged 1 -dependent increase in CFUs.

40|$|Background. Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an {{autoimmune}} disease with neurodegeneration and inflammation, {{is characterized by}} several alterations of different T cell subsets. However, few data exist {{on the role of}} iNKT lymphocytes. Objective. To identify possible changes in the phenotype of iNKT cells in patients with different clinical forms of MS, and find alterations in their polyfunctionality (i. e., ability to produce simultaneously up to 4 cytokines such as IL‐ 17, TNF‐α, IFN‐γ, IL‐ 4). Methods. We studied a total of 165 patients, 91 with a Relapsing Remitting form [RR; 31 were treated with interferon (IFN) 1 ‐β, 25 with natalizumab (Nat), 29 with glatiramer acetate (Gla); 17 were newly-diagnosed RR without treatment, 19 not active RR without treatment]. Forty-four patients had a Progressive MS: 20 Primary Progressive (PP), 24 Secondary Progressive (SP). A total of 55 age- and sex-matched subjects represented healthy controls (CTR). Among fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) iNKT cells were identified by flow cytometry. Moreover, the capability of iNKT cells to produce different cytokines (IL‐ 17, TNF‐α, IFN‐γ, and IL‐ 4) after in vitro stimulation were evaluated in 18 RR (11 treated with Nat and 7 with IFN), 4 PP, 6 SP and 16 CTR. Results. No main differences were found in iNKT cell phenotype among MS patients with different MS forms, or during different treatments. However, the polyfunctional response of iNKT cells showed Th 1 and Th 17 profiles. This was well evident in patients with secondary progressive form, who are characterized by high levels of inflammation and neurodegeneration, and exhibited a sustained increase in the production of Th 17 cytokines. Patients treated with natalizumab displayed lower levels of iNKT cells producing IL‐ 17, TNF‐α and IFN‐γ. Conclusion. Our data suggest that the progressive phase of the disease is characterized by <b>permanent</b> iNKT <b>activation</b> and a skewing towards an inflammatory phenotype. Compared to other treatments, natalizumab was able to modulate iNKT cell function...|$|R
40|$|Factor I {{deficiency}} {{causes a}} <b>permanent,</b> uncontrolled <b>activation</b> {{of the alternative}} pathway resulting in an increased turnover of C 3 and consumption of factor B, factor H and properdin. Factor I deficiency is clinically associated with recurrent bacterial infections already in early infancy, mainly affecting {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tract, or presenting as meningitis or septicemia. We here report on a Brazilian family (rt = 9) with known consanguinity, where in 3 / 7 children, suffering from chronic otitis, meningitis, and respiratory infections, a complete factor I deficiency was recognized. One of the patients died after fulminant sepsis. Hemolytic activity of the alternative pathway was not detectable in the patients' sera due to decreased plasma concentrations of C 3, factor B and properdin. As a consequence of factor I deficiency, C 3 b could not be metabolized with the result that no C 3 -derived split products (C 3 dg/C 3 d) were detectable in the patients' sera. in vitro reconstitution with purified factor I restored the regulatory function in the patients' sera with the subsequent cleavage of C 3 b to C 3 c and C 3 dg. Factor H levels were decreased in all patients' sera and found to be tightly complexed with C 3 b resulting in a modified electrophoretic mobility. Upon factor I reconstitution, factor Fl was released from C 3 b regaining its beta(1) electrophoretic mobility. Complement-mediated biological functions like opsonization of bacteria, chemotactic activity and phagocytosis in these patients were impaired. the parents (cousins, 2 nd degree) and 3 / 4 siblings had significantly reduced factor I plasma levels without further alteration in their complement profile. 3 of these obviously heterozygously deficient family members suffered from recurrent bacterial infections of different frequency and severity.

We investigated the impact of epidermal growth factor receptor content, p 53 status and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling status on ZD 1839 sensitivity in a panel of human tumour cell lines: seven head and neck cancer cell lines and two colon cancer cell lines (LoVo, HT 29) with derivatives differing only by a specific modification in p 53 status (LoVo p 53 wt + p 53 mut cells, HT 29 p 53 mut + p 53 wt rescued cells). The antiproliferative activity of ZD 1839 was evaluated by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test. ZD 1839 concentrations ranged from 0. 2 – 200 [*]μM (48 [*]h exposure). Epidermal growth factor receptor expression, p 53 status and p 42 /p 44 (for testing a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway status) were determined by competition analysis (Scatchard plots), denaturing gradient cell electrophoresis and Western blot, respectively. Epidermal growth factor receptor levels ranged from 388 to 33794 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein, a range {{that is similar to}} that found in head and neck tumours. The IC 50 values for cell sensitivity to ZD 1839 ranged from 6 to 31 [*]μM and a significant inverse correlation (P= 0. 022, r= 0. 82) between IC 50 values and epidermal growth factor receptor levels was observed. There was no influence of p 53 status on the sensitivity to ZD 1839. In two head and neck cancer cell lines with comparably elevated epidermal growth factor receptor expression, a two-fold higher ZD 1839 IC 50 value was found for the one with a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase. In conclusion, ZD 1839 was active against cells with a range of epidermal growth factor receptor levels, although more so in cells with higher epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Activity was unaffected by p 53 status, but was reduced in cells strongly dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor signalling in the presence of an intrinsically activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway...|$|R
