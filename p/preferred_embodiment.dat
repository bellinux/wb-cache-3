50|$|This {{patented}} {{aircraft wing}} design (StratosLiner 2014) comprises backward and forward swept aircraft wing sections in a decagonal box wing configuration, {{as well as}} a pair of middle wings. Both the backward swept front and the forward swept rear wings are divided into root and tip sections, wherein the tip sections of the front wings are more backward swept than the root sections, and the tip sections of the rear wings are more forward swept than the root sections. The middle wing is divided into a backward swept root section and two tip sections, one forward and another backward swept. The four wingtips on each side are interconnected by a wingtip fence, obtaining seven strong and stiff closed frame structures, as well as seven aerodynamic channels for the stream flow. The <b>preferred</b> <b>embodiment</b> has one third smaller wingspan compared to a conventional cantilever aircraft with the same wing area, making it possible to build very large airliners (1000+ passengers) still manageable for our airports.

5000|$|Clarification/broadening of the {{independent}} claim: Independent claims are typically written with very broad terms, to avoid permitting competitors to circumvent the claim by altering {{some aspect of the}} basic design. But when a broad wording is used, it may raise a question as to the scope of the term itself. If a dependent claim is specifically drawn to a narrower interpretation, then, at least in the U.S., the doctrine of claim differentiation states that {{the independent}} claim must be different from, and therefore broader than, the dependent claim [...] The doctrine dictates that it [...] "is improper for courts to read into an independent claim a limitation explicitly set forth in another claim." [...] This means that if an independent claim recites a chair with a plurality of legs, and a dependent claim depending from the independent recites a chair with 4 legs, the independent claim is not limited to what is recited in the dependent claim. The dependent claim protects chairs with 4 legs, and the independent claim protects chairs with 4 legs as well as chairs having 2, 3, 5 or more legs. Similarly, it may be unclear whether a [...] "base" [...] includes a [...] "set of legs." [...] A dependent claim, including the phrase, [...] "wherein said base comprises a set of legs," [...] if allowed by the patent examiner, clarifies that the word base in the independent claim does not necessarily include legs. In practice, dependent claims are often used to home in on the inventor's <b>preferred</b> <b>embodiment</b> of the invention (e.g., the actual product design that the inventor intends to use.) The independent claim broadly describes the invention; dependent claim #1 describes the invention in a narrower aspect that more specifically describes the preferred embodiment; dependent claim #2 is narrower still; etc.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the patent}} Accordingly, {{it is an}} object of the present {{invention}} to provide a mechanism for selecting the optimal bearer for each data packet in varying situations. The object is achieved by a method and equipment which are characterized by what is disclosed in the attached independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the attached dependent claims. The invention {{is based on the}} idea that selecting the optimal bearer for a data packet between the MBN and the mobile node is based on a combination of 1) the quality-of-service requirement (traffic class) of the data packet in question, 2) the mobility data related to the mobile node, 3) the traffic data related to the multiple bearers, and 4) bearer preference information. The bearer preference information can be obtained from the mobile node, and optionally, from the operators of the home and visited MBN operators.In order to save the battery of a portable mobile node, it is preferable that the mobile node only monitors one bearer type (network) at a time. For example, the subscriber data related to the mobile node can include a default bearer type, such as GSM or UMTS. The mobile node should be paged on this bearer. The mobile node can be ordered to monitor the selected bearer type by sending a modified page message which indicates the selected bearer type, channel, possible decryption data, etc. Alternatively, such information can be sent in a separate message, such as a short message, USSD, (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), data call or the like. According to another <b>preferred</b> <b>embodiment</b> of the invention, as long as the mobile node is within a certain coverage area, all IP packets belonging to the same session (or flow if flow labels are used) are routed via the same interface unit. For example, if a mobile node is receiving IP packets from a DAB network, via a cell x, all IP packets of the same session should be routed via DAB cell x, unless the mobile node moves out of the coverage area of this cell.|$|E
