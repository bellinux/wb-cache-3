500|$|Heliade's most {{influential}} contributions {{are related to}} his interest in developing the modern Romanian language, in which he synthesized Enlightenment tenets and Romantic nationalist ideals of the 1848 generation. At a time when Romanian was being discarded by the educated in favor of French or Greek, he and his supporters argued in favor of adapting Romanian {{to the requirements of}} modernization; he wrote: [...] "Young people, <b>preoccupy</b> yourselves <b>with</b> the national language, speak and write in it; prepare yourselves for its study, for its cultivation,—and cultivating a language means to write in it about all sciences and arts, about all eras and peoples. The language alone unites, strengthens and defines a nation; <b>preoccupy</b> yourselves <b>with</b> it first and foremost, as, through this, you shall be carrying out the most fundamental of policies, you shall be laying the foundation of nationality".|$|R

By this time Bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters, and this new appointment gave him the power to act in an official capacity in any matter.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea.

He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this.

During the breathing space offered by her enemy, Austria assembled an army under the Prince of Coburg and struck back. After a French covering force was routed by Coburg at Aldenhoven, Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke.|$|E

Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> the three other wars he was engaged in to commit.

40|$|The fi ve Indonesian {{historical}} novels {{being the}} object of this research, reveal the western convention of the genre {{in a variety of}} forms and colours. Pramoedya’s and Mansur Samin’s use both “real” historical person as heroes and secondary character, while the others present imaginative characters as heros and historical persons as background. Pram’s Bumi Manusia, consisting of four books, shows the most complicated form and tends to be realistic in its narration. Arok Dedes, as complicated as the fi rst, is an ideological one. While Roro Mendut, in a very loose plot <b>preoccupies</b> <b>with</b> the psychological problem of the principal characters, and Subang Zamrud Nurhayati is erotic. The thinnest of the fi ve, Perlawanan Rakyat Sigi is heroic. About the writers: two of them are dead, the rest is above sixty years old.

They are preoccupied by the poor condition of the Indonesian people and the nation, and most of them supported actively the struggle of the oppressed...|$|R
