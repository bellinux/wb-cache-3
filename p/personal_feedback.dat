50|$|He {{was best}} known for his work on hope and forgiveness, and also {{developed}} theories explaining how people react to <b>personal</b> <b>feedback,</b> to the human need for uniqueness, and to the drive to excuse and forgive transgressions. His theory of hope emphasizes goal-directed thinking, where a person uses both pathways thinking (the perceived capacity to find routes to their desired goals) and agency thinking (the necessary motivation to use those routes). His analysis of the motivational forces - excuse-making and forgiveness - allowed individuals to disconnect themselves from past negative experiences and connect themselves to hope, the possibilities of the future. In 2000, he demonstrated his hope theory on Good Morning America by conducting a live experiment with the show's correspondents.|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2010, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb {{received}} more than 4000 reports from healthcare professionals (HCPs). All HCPs received individual <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> containing information about the reported drug-adverse drug reaction (ADR) association. It is unclear what type of information HCPs expect in this feedback letter. Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the expectations of the <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> of HCPs who reported an ADR to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted among a random sample of 1200 pharmacists, general practitioners (GPs) and medical specialists who reported an ADR to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb between 1 January 2009 and 27 January 2010. Responders and non-responders were compared on the basis of profession, number of reports submitted to the pharmacovigilance since 2007 and their last report being serious or not. Questions were asked about the importance of <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> and the type of information reporters would like to see in their <b>personal</b> <b>feedback.</b> Both linear and logistic regression analysis were performed, with correction for possible confounding factors. Results: The response rate to the questionnaire was 34. 6 % (n = 399). The type of information the respondents generally would like to see in their <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> is information about the time course of the ADR and information about the pharmacological mechanism. However, GPs were, in general, less interested in receiving feedback than pharmacists and medical specialists. Most of the respondents were (very) unsatisfied if they received only a confirmation letter instead of <b>personal</b> <b>feedback.</b> Personalized feedback was considered to be (very) important for reporting an ADR in the future. Most of the respondents (80. 3 %) stated that the <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> increased their knowledge. Only 0. 6 % of respondents had not read the personalized feedback. No differences were found between responders and non-responders, with the exception that responders had reported statistically more often to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb in the past 3 years. Conclusions: Most of the respondents would like <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> instead of a standard confirmation letter. In general, pharmacists and medical specialists would like more information than GPs. The information in this study is useful in generating more customized <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> in the future, and could be useful for other pharmacovigilance centres that are interested in writing personalized feedback to make available to reporters...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to see if evaluative feedback from students that includes reference values (students ' expectations on teaching quality) has an effect on acceptance by teachers and relevance for them.

Experimental group 2 (n- 11) received <b>personal</b> <b>feedback</b> without reference values, and the third group did not receive any feedback.

We hypothesize that group size and public feedback can engender apprehension and affect the learning of risk communication. Experiment 1 reproduced Erev et al.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{understand}} the influence of a contextual factor (role ambiguity) and <b>personal</b> characteristics (<b>feedback</b> seeking behaviour) on role performance. As interdependent team based work has become an inherent characteristic of the workplace, role ambiguity while working is quite inherent in such organisations. By gaining better clarity regarding individual roles, employees can impact their role performance significantly. Data were collected from 176 employees of a large information technology organisation using survey technique by physically administering the questionnaire with the help of the Human Resource department in two phases; first from the employees and co-workers and finally from the supervisors. Subsequent data analysis was performed using hierarchical multiple regression. Results showed that feedback seeking both from a supervisor and co-workers ameliorated the effects of role ambiguity on role performance. Specifically, compared to feedback seeking from coworkers, feedback seeking from a supervisor was found to be more useful in reducing the effects of role ambiguity on role performance. This study draws from social cognitive theory and self-regulation theories, and implications are discussed for practicing managers in the IT industry...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Smokers with {{respiratory}} {{diseases are}} less likely to quit than those without impaired lung function, yet few studies have investigated the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions with this population, and none have used a computer-tailored approach. Aims: This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring smokers’ experiences when trying to quit and their perceptions of a computer-tailored intervention. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 smokers recruited from six GP practices in North London. Thematic analysis was conducted to examine participants’ previous experiences of quitting and their perceptions of receiving <b>personal</b> tailored <b>feedback</b> reports to aid smoking cessation. Results: Participants discussed how their positive smoking experiences coupled with their negative cessation experiences led to conflicts with quitting smoking. Although the computer-tailored intervention was key in prompting quit attempts and participants valued its personal approach; it was not sufficient as a stand-alone intervention. Conclusion: The results highlight the difficulties that smokers experience when quitting and the need for a more personalised stop smoking service in smokers with respiratory diseases. The study also demonstrates the application and potential for computer tailored intervention as part of a wider programme of long-term smoking cessation...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} between school and university can be problematic for students. Understanding students’ {{expectations about the}} system they are entering into is crucial in effecting a smooth transition. The school system involves small classes, often with teachers who know their students well. In contrast university involves large class sizes and a degree of anonymity for the student. In the UK National Student Survey responses for universities show that students are generally less happy about feedback relative to most other issues. The current study investigates school students’ expectations about assessment and feedback practices at university. Students were surveyed across Great Britain in 2006 and 2013. There were some significantly different responses from students between the two years of study in how coursework would be handled, {{but there were also}} many areas of consistency, demonstrating a clear pattern of expectation. For example, in both years of study 80 % of students expected <b>personal</b> verbal <b>feedback</b> on their university assignments. This study discusses how student expectations may be based on their school experiences rather than considering the reality of the university system they are entering into.
