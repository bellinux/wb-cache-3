50|$|The <b>Parlamentarium</b> is the visitors' {{centre of}} the European Parliament and {{is located in the}} Parliament's Espace Léopold complex in Brussels. The {{official}} opening was on 14 October 2011 by President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek. The permanent exhibition contains hundreds of multimedia components, explaining the European Parliament and other European Union institutions. The entrance to the centre is located on the Parliament's esplanade.|$|E
50|$|Each visitor is {{provided}} with a personal multimedia guide (PMG) which guides them through the exhibition, location is used to display content relevant to each area. All content in the <b>Parlamentarium</b> {{is available in the}} 24 official EU languages. Tours are held for children, blind and deaf people. The PMG is needed to activate each installation and shows in-depth information, plays audio using an in-ear speaker and displays short films in the visitor's selected language.|$|E
40|$|The latest wave of European {{integration}} process, cultural Europeanization, includes complex processes, such as {{the attempts}} to create a shared European memory that would transcend national interpretations of the past. The cultural Europeanization can {{be perceived as a}} narrative operation: in it the EU, Europe, and Europeanness are given meanings and made sense of through narrativization. The article investigates the EU’s attempts to create a shared European memory by analyzing the exhibition narrative of the <b>Parlamentarium,</b> the visitors’ center of the European Parliament. The analysis indicates how the construction of an official shared European memory is operationalized through textual and narrative devices such as intertextuality and the pending narrative structure. I argue that the EU’s memory texts are performative narratives which do not only describe a shared European memory in a particular way but also position the receivers as active agents in the story of the EU–Europe and invite them to produce it on their own initiative...|$|E
40|$|The quartier Européen of Brussels was abuzz as Italy’s prime {{minister}} Mario Monti {{returned to his}} old stamping ground for a summit of European Union leaders, writes James Panichi in Inside Story [...] With {{a solution to the}} eurozone’s crisis still out of sight, journalists prepared to parse every sentence of a man who earned the nickname Super Mario a dozen or so years ago when, as Europe’s competition commissioner, he took on Microsoft. But a mere ten-minute walk away from the corridors of power it was very much business as usual – business in this case being the handing over of an audio guide to an international politics geek (not this correspondent) and a resentful group of students whose excursion budget didn’t stretch as far as Paris. Welcome to the Parlamentarium, a slightly naff multimedia exhibition free of charge to the general public. On most days it opens its doors at 9 am, yet even by mid morning its dark, echoey halls are usually still empty. Euro Disney it ain’t. But don’t be fooled: the <b>Parlamentarium</b> has a great story to tell – assuming you manage to get past the Gen Y shock-and-awe gimmicks (you can move a Dalek-like cylinder over a giant map of Europe or swipe a modified iPhone to trigger sound bites). Because what this exhibition has going for it is context: it tells you not just how European institutions developed, but why the European Union’s founding fathers bothered in the first place. It’s a ripping yarn. Read in full Image: Flickr /  Werner Kun...|$|E
