5|$|Three {{days after}} Parnell's speech in Ennis, a <b>process</b> <b>server</b> and {{seventeen}} {{members of the}} Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, {{they had to be}} delivered {{to the head of the}} household or his spouse within a certain time period. The <b>process</b> <b>server</b> successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the <b>process</b> <b>server</b> and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to providing policing, the sheriff's department controls the county jail, guards the courthouse, acts as the <b>process</b> <b>server</b> for court documents such as summonses, and oversees evictions, even inside municipalities with their own police forces.|$|E
500|$|The <b>process</b> <b>server</b> {{tried unsuccessfully}} to serve the notices the {{following}} day. News soon spread to the nearby Ballinrobe, from where many people descended on Lough Mask House, where, according to journalist James Redpath, they advised Boycott's servants and labourers to leave his employment immediately. Boycott said {{that many of his}} servants were forced to leave [...] "...under threat of ulterior consequences." [...] Martin Branigan, a labourer who subsequently sued Boycott for non-payment of wages, claimed he left because he was afraid of the people who came into the field where he was working. Eventually, all Boycott's employees left, forcing him to run the estate without help.|$|E
50|$|It is {{universal}} {{that the laws}} of service of process must follow the laws that apply to the court that issues the process. A bias or confusion occurs in many jurisdictions where service is made. In Florida, for example, <b>process</b> <b>servers</b> seem to suggest Florida laws apply to all service of process made within the territory of Florida. In this reference, section 48.195 implies an authority of Florida <b>process</b> <b>servers</b> to serve foreign process. This was added to allow sheriffs to serve foreign process within limitations as the section provides, but it does not, and cannot give exclusivity, to state sanctioned licensed approved <b>process</b> <b>servers</b> to foreign <b>process.</b> This interpretation, however prevalent and beneficial to Florida <b>process</b> <b>servers,</b> is false.|$|R

2500|$|The {{latter half}} of Callas's career was marked {{by a number of}} scandals. Following a {{performance}} of Madama Butterfly in Chicago in 1955, Callas was confronted by a <b>process</b> <b>server</b> who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy, who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed with her mouth turned in a furious snarl. The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a [...] "Tigress". In the same year, just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, Time ran a damaging cover story about Callas, with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Novell started diversifying {{and buying}} {{companies}} {{to add to}} their NetWare operating system. One of the companies they purchased was SoftCraft. Nancy Woodward became the Vice-President and General Manager of Novell's Austin operations while Doug Woodward became the Vice-President of Advanced Database Technologies. Early the next year, Btrieve 5.0 was released to run as a native NetWare application, or VAP (Value Added Process). According to Jim Kyle, [...] "it had auto-increment key types, the BROUTER network <b>process</b> <b>server,</b> data-only and key-only files, and optional data compression". Version 5.1 was released in 1990 with increased file-handling transaction capability, logging and roll-forward operations, along with several API enhancements. Several versions were created for DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. Version 6.0 was released in June 1992. However, it was not promoted extensively by Novell, and due to enhancements, (such as the change from pre-imaging to shadow-paging) it was incompatible with previous versions of Btrieve. The market did not increase much for Btrieve {{and it did not}} see wide adoption due to these issues.|$|E

5000|$|NLTSS was a capability-based {{client-server}} system. The {{two primary}} servers were the file server and the <b>process</b> <b>server.</b> The file server was a process privileged {{to be trusted}} by the drivers for local storage (disk storage,) and the <b>process</b> <b>server</b> was a process privileged to be trusted by the processor driver (software that switched time sharing control between processes in the [...] "alternator", handled interrupts for processes besides the [...] "communicate" [...] call, provided access to memory and process state for the <b>process</b> <b>server,</b> etc.).|$|E
50|$|As a {{substitute}} for personal service by a <b>process</b> <b>server,</b> some jurisdictions may allow voluntary acceptance of service, also called waiver of service.

The <b>process</b> <b>server</b> was an ordinary user mode process that was simply trusted to communicate with the CPU driver, just like the file server was trusted to communicate with the disk driver. The <b>process</b> <b>server</b> stored process state in files provided by the file server and in that regard appeared like any other user process to the file server.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} on the {{construction}} of a server subsystem in a client/server system in an application context where the number of potential clients can be arbitrarily large. The implementation of the server is based on the well-known Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) technique. The three <b>server</b> <b>processes</b> must process the client inputs in the same order to keep the server state consistent. While a client can fail by crashing and at least two <b>server</b> <b>processes</b> behave correctly, the third <b>server</b> <b>process</b> can behave in an arbitrary way. Moreover, the communication between clients and <b>server</b> <b>processes</b> is assumed reliable and the network can deliver the same client input to any two <b>server</b> <b>processes</b> within a known bounded time (D). There is also a known bound on the communication delay between every pair of correct <b>server</b> <b>processes</b> (d). In order to cope with client crash and <b>server</b> <b>process</b> failure, it is assumed that if a client input is deposited in the local memory of a <b>server</b> <b>process</b> at time t [...] ...|$|R

50|$|NSAPI can be {{compared}} to an earlier protocol named Common Gateway Interface (CGI). Like CGI, NSAPI provides a means of interfacing application software with a web server. Unlike CGI programs, NSAPI plug-ins run inside the <b>server</b> <b>process.</b> Because CGI programs run outside of the <b>server</b> <b>process,</b> CGI programs are generally slower than NSAPI plug-ins. However, running outside of the <b>server</b> <b>process</b> can improve <b>server</b> reliability by isolating potentially buggy applications from the server software and from each other.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{service of}} process has been effected, the {{responsible}} officer or <b>process</b> <b>server</b> must typically file a return of service or proof of service or [...] "Affidavit of Service" [...] with the court (or convey one to the plaintiff to file with the court). The return of service indicates {{the time and place}} at which service was effected, the person served, and any additional information needed to establish that service was properly made. It is signed by the <b>process</b> <b>server,</b> and operates as prima facie evidence that {{service of process}} was effectively made. Arizona Court Rules also require that any return or affidavit of service filed by a <b>process</b> <b>server</b> other than a sheriff or constable shall clearly state the county in which the <b>process</b> <b>server</b> is registered. Many Arizona process servers include their Certification Number on their returns/affidavits. Certification Numbers are assigned by the Clerk of the Superior Court in each county.|$|E
