Curved arrays divided into elements of dimension 1 - 2 with <b>pre-focusing</b> in the short-axis dimension In addition there is need to understand the properties of transducers of more complex shapes such as oval or elliptic ones, and to find the fields generated by 2 -dimensional transducers. For this reason a general purpose simulator tool has been made. Method and Examples In order to find the field it is common to assume that the Rayleigh integral applies: (1) where the velocity potential is given by the surface velocity integrated over the active source.

Current search systems {{usually do not}} provide support for these stages, but provide a static set of features predominantly focused on supporting micro-level search interactions.

A user study was designed, using simulated work tasks, to explicitly place users within different stages of a complex task: <b>pre-focus,</b> focus, and post-focus. Active use, passive use and perceived usefulness of features were analysed in order to derive when search features are most useful. Our results identify {{significant differences in the}} utility of SUI features between each stage.

A three-dimensional representation of the specimen is achieved by recording a series of images over a range of focal values. Optical depth sectioning in zone-axis crystals is explored computationally using a Bloch wave analysis to explain the form of the electron intensity in the crystal as a function of depth. We find that the intensity maximum deviates from that of the expected defocus value due to <b>pre-focusing</b> by the atomic column and also due to channelling pendellosung.

40|$|We {{have used}} a multiple-laser {{confocal}} microscope with lines 325, 442, 488, 514 and 633 nm to investigate optical sectioning of botanical specimens {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths. The 442 -nm line allowed efficient excitation of Chromomycin A 3, with minimal background autofluorescence, to visualize GC-rich heterochromatin as an aid to chromosome identification. Sequential excitation with 442 - and 488 -nm light enabled ratio imaging of cytosolic pH using BCECF. The red HeNe laser penetrated deep into intact plant tissues, being less prone to scattering than shorter blue lines, and was also used to image fluorescent samples in reflection, prior to fluorescence measurements, to reduce photobleaching. Chromatic corrections are more important in confocal microscope optics than in conventional microscopy. Measured focus differences between blue, green and red wavelengths, for commonly used objectives, were up to half the optical section thickness for both our multi-laser system and a multi-line single-laser instrument.

40|$|The {{contents}} of this thesis consider new methods for generating ultrasound beams for enhanced image quality in medical imaging. The results presented are produced through computer simulations. The thesis {{consists of an}} introductory chapter and four papers, which are all intended to be individually readable. Chapter 1 gives {{a brief overview of}} ultrasound and medical ultrasound imaging, as well as different aspects of ultrasound image quality and acoustic noise. A non-linear wave equation is presented and analyzed. This equation describes ultrasound propagation within, and interaction with tissue. In Paper A, a transducer annular array design method is presented. The method involves a geometric <b>pre-focusing,</b> which may vary between the array elements. This is useful for producing narrow receive beams within a large imaging depth window. It is advantageous for avoiding problems that occur when combining high frequencies and large receive apertures when utilizing the conventional equal-area design method. Paper B introduces a method to produce synthetic transmit beams that are useful for suppression of reverberation noise caused by multiple scattering of the forward-propagating imaging pulse. This is done through combination of two transmit pulse complexes denoted Second order UltRasound Field (SURF). Each such complex consists of a conventional high-frequency imaging pulse added to a low-frequency sound-speed manipulation pulse. The SURF transmit beam is generated by forming the difference between the propagated fields, filtered around the imaging frequency. This beam has suppressed amplitude near the transducer, where a reflection-generating body-wall is often present during in vivo imaging. Furthermore, a method to produce a combined second-harmonic pulse inversion (PI) and SURF beam is also presented, here denoted SURF-PI. Two imaging setups are defined for which the feasibility of the method is tested through simulations in case of propagation through homogeneous tissue. SURF beams and combined SURF-PI beams are compared to fundamental imaging and PI imaging beams for the two setups. The SURF-PI beams are the most suppressed in the near-field, followed by the approximately equally suppressed SURF and PI beams. The signal level within the imaging depth region becomes higher for SURF than for PI. In Paper C, two signal processing methods for further adjustment of the SURF beams are introduced. This is achieved through post-processing, either by application of a time-shift, or of a general filter, to one of the propagated fields. The processing is done prior to carrying out the subtraction that is done to form the SURF beam. This provides a flexible way of adjustment to choose the depth position where the scattering sources wished to be suppressed are located. Different adjustments may be realized without need for re-transmission or resumed propagation of the SURF pulse complexes. The post-processing methods are applied to a dataset generated for Paper B. Adjusted transmit beam examples are presented and their reverberation suppression abilities are compared to non-adjusted SURF. In Paper D, the feasibility study of the SURF beam generation as presented in Paper B, and its post-processing adjustment as presented in Paper C, are enlarged to include propagation within an inhomogeneous medium where a body-wall model producing severe aberration delays is present. It is shown that both the generation of the SURF beams and the post-processing adjustment are attainable under the modeled conditions. artikle I: "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

40|$|In this work, {{a new and}} {{improved}} SFM is presented. This SFM can measure many variables such as the individual dynamic and active temperature regulation of the sample and the cantilever, miscellaneous friction modes, x-, y-, z- linearization and an increased scan speed, simultaneous with high spatial resolution. The scan width is also laterally extended to 1 millimetre by 1 millimetre. This extension of the lateral scan range requires a larger tilt compensation. Therefore, the z-scanner has a range of more than 300 µm. Summary In this thesis, a novel scanning force microscope was presented. Other than the large scan range of approximately 1000 µm by 1000 µm, the thermal guidance of the cantilever and sample is the most labour-intensive component of the microscope. Detailed construction of the cantilever holder and sample holder, light beam guidance for the normal and lateral forces, the positioning and scan unit, and ECU, control software and communication software have been discussed. The entire microscope was constructed as symmetrically as possible using mechanical construction to avoid thermal drift. For thermal measurements and thermally assisted friction measurements, a concept for separately heating the cantilever holder and the sample holder was discussed. A simulation on the cantilever holder showed that a temperature difference of 150 °K could be reached after 40 s and that the cool down cycle took only 38 s, without any disturbance of the nearest piezo. The same analysis was performed for the sample holder. Only the junction temperature for unknown samples and the temperature behaviour of these samples was calculated. After 15 s of heating, the junction reached 150 °K above the ambient temperature. The thermal path to the next piezo element is more critical than the one for the cantilever holder setup, therefore, the thermal management is more complex. However, the analysis has shown a maximum rise of 32 K above the ambient temperature at the piezo element for the heating and cooling scenario described above. For the beam deflection setup, a single-mode glass fibre supply of the laser light beam was used. A special grinding technique was used to form fibre tips, which can be short-duration fused to form a small lens for <b>pre-focusing</b> the light beam (two patents have been submitted). A sample setup showed that the self-assembled laser beam has a diameter of approximately 60 µm. With 10 µW {{of light on the}} 4 Q-PD using a standard cantilever, the electronics produced a displacement equivalent to the noise of approximately 0. 1 nm with a 10 kHz low-pass filter. With the beam deflection system introduced here, even the first and second resonances, in addition to the basic one, were observable. The torsional basic mode and its first harmonic were also observed. The Z-drive was separated into low, mid-range and high-frequency components. This separation aids with the thermal management of the microscope to avoid and/or remove unwanted thermal heating in areas of the system where mechanical drift disturbs the scanning force measurements. The hydraulically driven low frequency Z-component fulfils this requirement. A European patent has been granted for the hydraulic cylinder design. While linearization in x-, y-, and z-direction is always desirable, it is a necessity for the scan range of the microscope introduced here. Each scan range could be assembled with a specially adapted linearization unit (fibre bundle and mirror) as the linear behaviour of each linearization unit is proportional to the numerical aperture of the guiding fibres. Finally, the ECU and the control, communication and visualisation software were presented. The centrepiece of the ECU is a Texas Instruments 6711 floating point DSP. This unit features the real-time capability that is necessary to drive such a microscope. The DSP communicates via a serial, insulated interface (FireWire®) with the PC in burst mode, while collecting data from the sensor channels in strict, fixed time-slices. Again, the data channels have to be precise and very fast due to the large scan range, to keep the scan times in a manageable regime. Six channels have 16 bit resolution at 1 MSPS, four channels have 16 bit resolution at 500 kSPS, and eight channels have 16 bit resolution at 250 kSPS. One time-slice was also used up to 128 times for multiplexing pre-selection for one arbitrary channel, which can be used to detect slowly changing signals. At this sample rate, a meander-shaped scan line could be achieved. Different types of deceleration and acceleration behaviour were calculated to obtain the largest possible linear scan range, resulting in cubical behaviour during deceleration and acceleration for even the smallest disturbance in the linear scan regime. The mixer electronics were designed with offset and zoom capabilities. This results in linear DAC sample steps within the chosen region, independent of the user-chosen region of interest (angle and size). ...|$|E
