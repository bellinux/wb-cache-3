5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different <b>processing</b> <b>equipment,</b> allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The <b>processing</b> <b>equipment</b> was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E

Remanufacturing of food <b>processing</b> <b>equipments</b> {{not only}} follows the demand of {{transforming}} economic growth mode, {{but also has}} great significance to China sustainable development that needs less investment and gets higher benefit. The remanufacturing approach of large-scale food <b>processing</b> <b>equipments</b> is analyzed in design requirements, including hygiene requirements, energy consumption requirements, reliability requirements and man- machine integration requirements. Then, technical and economic analysis of the remanufacturing is carried out through establishing the profit objective function: Whole life cycle profits Ez = R(multiple life cycle revenue) - C(whole life cycle cost). According to economic evaluation of life cycle and multi-life-cycle, remanufacturing of LEF can get best enterprise benefits and enhance the competitive power of enterprises...|$|R

That potential notwithstanding, the sub sector is facing several production constraints that have limited its potentials for contributing to poverty reduction. The constraints include poor tools of honey processing, poor packaging of honey products, poor marketing system and lack of appropriate knowledge on honey processing skills. As a result most of honey producers in rural and small town in Tanzania feel disappointed by large and big honey industries which apply its resources and catch both internal and external honey market. Poor tools are the major constraint and in particular honey <b>processing</b> <b>equipments</b> which causes low production of honey products, poor processing. Despite the mentioned constraints honey sub-sector is found in almost all pastoralist households in the rural areas and sub-urban which confirm that its potentials is yet to be utilized.
