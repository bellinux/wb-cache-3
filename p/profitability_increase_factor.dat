40|$|Using data on listed and {{unlisted}} {{firms in}} the U. K., this study documents that average profitability changes systematically with age. In their early years, firms realize substantial <b>profitability</b> <b>increases,</b> while mature firms face slow declines in profitability. A model of endogenous profitability changes arising from product development captures this pattern. Investment in product development generates <b>profitability</b> <b>increases</b> for young firms while competitive pressures from new entrants lead to profitability declines for mature firms. In addition, the model predicts that young firmsrealize profitability jumpsmorefrequently and {{that the effect of}} age on firms’policies would be stronger for young firms. Empirical tests support these predictions. Taken together, these findings show that changes in profitability influences the lifecycle of firms...|$|R

A total of 144 day old straight run strabro broiler chicks were fed ad libitum up to 42 days of age on 3 different iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic diets formed by replacing dietary fish meal (FM) by broiler offal (BO); T 1 (8 % FM+ 0 % BO), T 2 (4 % FM+ 4 % BO) and T 3 (0 % FM+ 8 % BO) to have its effect on performance of broilers. The growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion, survivability and <b>profitability</b> <b>increased</b> almost linearly on increasing level of dietary BO. Replacing FM by BO did not affect survivability of broiler. As costly FM was replaced by cheaper BO on increasing dietary levels of BO, the performance and <b>profitability</b> were <b>increased</b> up to 8 %.

But while innovation and complexity management are heavily discussed by the industry’s top managers, the most powerful lever to <b>increase</b> <b>profitability</b> is being ignored by many – value pricing.

Although a price increase of 1 % can lever the profit (EBIT) by 8 %, many companies focus on much weaker levers like reducing variable costs and sales volumes.

40|$|Abstract Prior {{research}} shows that firms generating earnings growth by improving profitability create shareholder value, while firms generating earnings growth through investment destroy value. This paper examines whether compensation committees consider this while determining CEO compensation. We first confirm prior results that growth from <b>increased</b> <b>profitability</b> is perceived by markets to add value while growth from investment does not. While growth from <b>increased</b> <b>profitability</b> is positively associated with compensation, so is growth from investment. The presence of institutional ownership increases the weight on growth from <b>increased</b> <b>profitability,</b> but does not reduce the weight on growth from investment. Further, value-oriented institutional ownership increases the sensitivity of compensation growth to growth from <b>increased</b> <b>profitability</b> and reduces the sensitivity to growth from investment. Contrarily, growth-oriented institutional ownership increases the sensitivity of compensation growth to growth from investment. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the nature of earnings growth in determining executive compensation...|$|R

When the quality difference between firms is relatively large, a high-quality firm shows a unique optimal capital structure, in which the debt-equity ratio is increased as the tax rate rises but is reduced as the firm's <b>profitability</b> <b>increases.</b> Corporate Income Taxation, Capital Structure, Asymmetric Information...|$|R
