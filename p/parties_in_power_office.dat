50|$|The Government of India was {{an object}} of {{criticism}} all over the world. Many world leaders put pressure on Indira Gandhi to withdraw the Emergency Rule. The result was another general election in India. Many leaders were still in jail. The opposition lacked adequate financial resources. The opposition leaders {{were not able to}} go to the people. The <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> thought that an Election at this time would be favourable. But just the opposite happened. Many important leaders of the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>power,</b> including Indira Gandhi, were defeated miserably. This was people’s mandate. Nabababu was really happy over this.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} inter-jurisdictional cooperation and law enforcement in Mexico. Exploiting a Regression Discontinuity Design in close municipal elections, we study how improved opportunities for cooperation in crime prevention among neighboring municipalities - proxied by their degree of political alignment - may result in lower rates of violent crime. We find that municipalities <b>in</b> which the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the majority of neighboring jurisdictions barely won experience significantly lower homicide rates during the mayor’s mandate than those in which it barely lost. This effect is sizeable and independent of which <b>party</b> is <b>in</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the neighboring municipalities...|$|R

30|$|We are {{interested}} in studying how the balance of <b>power</b> reflects <b>in</b> the NHK news. In modern democracies, there are often two main parties: a <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> and its main opposition. In the case of Japan, {{the leader of the}} <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>power</b> is the Prime Minister, and the leader of the main opposition (hereafter OL) {{is the president of the}} main <b>party</b> not <b>in</b> <b>power</b> (which is here either DPJ or LDP). However, this leader changes over time such as more than one politician may lead the opposition during a cabinet. To study the opposition, we created an artificial node entitled “Opposition leader” (visible in Fig. 13). We extracted from the different persons representing the OL all their detections during their leading mandate and unified them altogether in this abstract entity. This allows us to question the place of the Opposition leader in different the political networks.|$|R
