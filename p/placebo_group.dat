40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if fear of an increased risk of attempted suicide in <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> participating in placebo-controlled studies is an argument against the performance of placebo-controlled trials in studies of major depression. All short-term and long-term, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that were part of a registration dossier for the indication of major depression that were submitted to the Medicines Evaluation Board, the regulatory authority of the Netherlands, from 1983 to 1997 were reviewed for attempted suicide. In addition, all long-term, placebo-controlled studies from a MEDLINE search that were conducted in the last decade in patients with major depression were assessed for attempted suicide. In 77 short-term studies with 12, 246 patients in dossiers from the Medicines Evaluation Board, the incidence of suicide was 0. 1 % in both <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> and active compound groups. The incidence of attempted suicide was 0. 4 % in both <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> and active compound groups.

25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the <b>placebo</b> <b>group,</b> suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the <b>placebo</b> <b>group</b> in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E

40|$|This {{comprehensive}} review {{provides an overview}} about placebo and nocebo phenomena in antidepressant trials. Improvements in the <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> may partly be explained through methodological issues such as natural course of depression and regression to the mean, but also fundamentally reflect investigators' and participants' expectations. A meta-analysis by our group of 96 randomized placebo-controlled trials showed large placebo responses to antidepressant medication. Moderator analyses revealed substantially larger placebo responses in observer ratings compared with self-report. Effect sizes in observer ratings showed strong increase with publication year while this effect was not found for patients' self-ratings. This reflects the strong influence of investigators' expectations. The analysis of ‘nocebo effects’, e. g. adverse effects in <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of antidepressant trials also confirms the impact of expectations: nocebo symptoms reflected the typical side-effect patterns expected in the drug group, with higher symptoms rates in the <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of tricyclic antidepressant trials compared with <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> of trials testing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. While the placebo response seems to be similar for women and men, gender differences were found for nocebo rates. In the conclusion, we discuss potential implications for clinical trial designs and argue for interventions aimed at optimizing positive expectations of treatment benefit while minimizing the impact of adverse effects...|$|R

30|$|MI size {{is a key}} {{indicator}} for postischemic heart injury and cell death (Burns et al. 2002). Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the MI size of CsA treatment groups does not differ significantly from that of <b>placebo</b> <b>groups,</b> similar to the results reported by a previous meta-analysis (Song et al. 2015). Furthermore, compared with the <b>placebo</b> <b>groups,</b> the CsA treatment groups showed no significant improvement in LVEF during the short-term follow-up, whereas LVEF increased in the <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> during long-term follow-up. CsA cardioprotection against RI is effective only when cardiomyocyte apoptosis is highly prevalent (typically during the initial 3 – 4  h), after which cardiomyocyte necrosis becomes the predominant cardiomyocyte death mechanism; necrosis cannot be prevented by CsA because it is effective only against apoptosis. Moreover, CsA is effective against I/R only when applied during the initial 2 – 3  h after MI (Lonborg et al. 2012; Santos-Gallego and Badimon 2016). However, the time of CsA administration was inconsistent among the five RCTs in this meta-analysis, extending up to 12  h after chest pain {{in the study by}} Cung et al.; therefore, we cannot conclude whether CsA administered in the first 3  h after MI is clinically beneficial.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} 20 mg cisapride p. o. in reducing residual gastric volume and pH in adult ambulatory surgical patients. METHODS: Using a prospective randomised double-blind controlled design, we administered either 20 mg cisapride p. o. or placebo preoperatively to 64 ASA 1 - 2 ambulatory surgical patients. Following induction of anesthesia we measured volume and pH of residual gastric contents, using blind aspiration through an orogastric tube. Parametric data were analysed using unpaired, one tail Students' t test. Non-parametric data were analysed using Fishers Exact test and Chi square analysis. Statistical significance was accepted at the probability level of < 0. 05. RESULTS: Residual gastric volumes were similar {{in the two groups}} (19. 5 +/- 23. 8, 23. 9 +/- 24. 4 ml), in the cisapride and <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> respectively, P= 0. 24). Data shown are mean (+/- SD). The proportions of patients with a residual gastric volume exceeding 0. 4 ml x kg(- 1) were similar in the two groups (4 of 28, and 8 of 23 patients in the cisapride and <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> respectively, P= 0. 09). The pH of the residual gastric contents were similar in the cisapride and <b>placebo</b> <b>groups</b> (1. 6 +/- 0. 5, 1. 4 +/- 0. 5, respectively, P= 0. 26).
