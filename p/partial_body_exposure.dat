40|$|The aim of {{biological}} dosimetry is {{the calculation of}} the dose {{and the range of}} uncertainty to which an accident victim was exposed. This process requires the use of the maximum likelihood method for the proper fitting of an in vitro calibration curve, a procedure which is not implemented in popular, commercially available statistical computer programs. Several laboratories have produced their own curve fitting programs for internal use but these are frequently not user-friendly and not available to outside users. Consequently, a new freely available computer program for fitting a linear-quadratic dose-response relationship by the method of maximum-likelihood and estimating a dose from the number of aberrations observed has been developed by the authors. The program, called CABAS, consists of (i) the main curve-fitting and dose estimating module, (ii) a module for calculating the dose in cases of <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposure,</b> (iii) a module for estimating the minimum number of cells necessary to detect a given dose of radiation, and (iv) a module for calculating the dose {{in the case of a}} fractionated or protracted exposure.

These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of c-H 2 AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposures.</b> Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for c-H 2 AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure.

Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples.

40|$|Biological dosimetry, {{that is the}} {{estimation}} of the dose of an exposure to ionizing radiation by a biological parameter, {{is a very important}} tool in cases of radiation accidents. The score of dicentric chromosomes, considered to be the most accurate method for biological dosimetry, for low LET radiation and up to 5 Gy, fits very well to a linear-quadratic model of dose-effect curve assuming the Poisson distribution. The accuracy of this estimation raises difficulties for doses over 5 Gy, the highest dose of the majority of dose-effect curves used in biological dosimetry. At doses over 5 Gy most cells show difficulties in reaching mitosis and cannot be used to score dicentric chromosomes. In the present study with the treatment of lymphocyte cultures with caffeine and the standardization of the culture time, metaphases for doses up to 25 Gy have been analyzed. Here we present a new model for biological dosimetry, which includes a Gompertz-type function as the dose response, and also takes into account the underdispersion of aberration-among-cell distribution. The new model allows {{the estimation}} of doses of exposures to ionizing radiation of up to 25 Gy. Moreover, the model is more effective in estimating whole and <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposures</b> than the classical method based on linear and linear-quadratic functions, suggesting their effectiveness and great potential to be used after high dose exposures of radiation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The European Union's Seventh Framework Programme funded project "Multi-disciplinary biodosimetric {{tools to}} manage high scale {{radiological}} casualties" (MULTIBIODOSE) {{has developed a}} multiparametric approach to radiation biodosimetry, with a particular emphasis on triage {{of large numbers of}} potentially exposed individuals following accidental exposures. In November 2012, an emergency exercise took place which tested the capabilities of the MULTIBIODOSE project partners. The exercise described here had a dual purpose: Intercomparison of 1) three biodosimetric assays and 2) the capabilities of the seven laboratories, with regards to provision of triage status for suspected radiation exposed individuals. Materials and methods: Three biological dosimetry tools - the dicentric, micronucleus and gamma-H 2 AX (the phosphorylated form of member X of histone H 2 A, in response to DNA double strand breaks) foci assays - were tested, in addition to provision of the triage status results (low exposure: 2 Gy) by the MULTIBIODOSE software. The exercise was run in two modes: an initial triage categorisation of samples (based on the first dose estimates for each assay received from each laboratory) followed by collation of the full set of estimated doses (all the results from all modes of each assay carried out by the participating laboratories) calculated using as many modes of operation as possible of the different assays developed during the project. Simulated acute whole <b>body</b> and <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposures</b> were included. Results: The results of the initial triage categorisation and the full comparison of assays and methods within and between laboratories are presented here.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{influence}} of the metallic structures of a realistic car body frame on the specific absorption rate (SAR) produced by a cell phone when a complete human body model is placed at different locations inside the vehicle, and to identify the relevant parameters responsible for these changes. The modeling and analysis of the whole system was conducted by means of computer simulations based on the full wave finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical method. The excitation considered was an 835 MHz 2 dipole located as a handsfree communication device or as a hand-held portable system. We compared the SAR at different planes on the human model, placed inside the vehicle with respect to the free space situation. The presence of the car body frame significantly changes the SAR distributions, especially when the dipole is far from the body. Although the results are not conclusive on this point, this change in SAR distribution is not likely to produce an increase above the limits in current guidelines for <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposure,</b> but may be signifi- cant for whole-body exposure. The most relevant change found was the change in the impedance of the dipole, affecting the radiated power. A complementary result from the electromagnetic computations performed is the change in the electromagnetic field distribution inside a vehicle when human bodies are present. The whole vehicle model has been optimized to provide accurate results for sources placed inside the vehicle, while keeping low requirements for computer storage and simulation time.

40|$|In {{radiation}} accidents, it {{is common}} that only several {{parts of the body}} are exposed to radiation. As a consequence there is a mixture of exposed and unexposed lymphocytes in peripheral blood cells of the samples. This phenomenon will cause the dose value estimated using the exposed lymphocytes to be lower than the actual dose. In this study, an assessment of partial body exposures using micronucleus assay by estimating the partial body dose and fraction of irradiated blood was conducted. An optimal D 0 value also has been determined in this study to estimate the fraction of irradiated cells. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from three healthy donors were irradiated in vitro with 2 Gy of X-rays. Partial radiation exposure was simulated by mixing the irradiated and non-irradiated blood in different proportions. The proportions of mixtures of blood samples irradiated in vitro were 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 %. Blood samples were then cultured and harvested based on micronuclei assay protocol. At least 2000 binucleated cells with well-preserved cytoplasm were scored for the MN frequency. Dose Estimate 5. 1 software was used to calculate the dispersion index (σ 2 / y) and normalized unit of this index (U) in each proportion of bloods. The fractions of irradiated cells were calculated with CABAS (Chromosomal Aberration Calculation Software) for several different D 0 values (2. 7; 3. 8; 5. 4). The results showed that D 0 value at 5. 4 gave the closest results to the actual proportion of irradiated bloods, while for the dose estimation the estimated doses value from all proportions in all donors were higher than the actual dose. The factor that may cause this phenomenon was that the dose response calibration curve used to predict the radiation dose was not constructed in the laboratory used. Overall it can be concluded that a biodosimetry using MN assay can be used to estimate the radiation dose in <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposure.</b> In order to establish a biodosimetry using MN analysis the dose-response calibration curve MN analysis should be constructed first in the laboratory used.   </p...|$|E

40|$|Large scale {{radiological}} emergencies require high throughput {{techniques of}} biological dosimetry for population triage {{in order to}} identify individuals indicated for medical treatment. The dicentric assay is the gold standard technique for the performance of biological dosimetry, but it is very time consuming and needs well trained scorers. To increase the throughput of blood samples, semi-automation of dicentric scoring was investigated in the framework of the MULTIBIODOSE EU FP 7 project, and dose effect curves were established in six biodosimetry laboratories. To validate these dose effect curves, blood samples from 33 healthy donors (> 10 donors/scenario) were irradiated in vitro with Co- 60 gamma rays simulating three different exposure scenarios: acute whole body, partial body, and protracted exposure, with three different doses for each scenario. All the blood samples were irradiated at Ghent University, Belgium, and then shipped blind coded to the participating laboratories. The blood samples were set up by each lab using their own standard protocols, and metaphase slides were prepared to validate the calibration curves established by semi-automatic dicentric scoring. In order to achieve this, 300 metaphases per sample were captured, and the doses were estimated using the newly formed dose effect curves. After acute uniform exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 0 Gy, 0. 5 Gy, 2. 0, and 4. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001), and, in most cases, the dose estimates were within a range of +/- 0. 5 Gy of the given dose. After protracted exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 1. 0 Gy, 2. 0 Gy, and 4. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001), and here also a large number of the dose estimates were within +/- 0. 5 Gy of the irradiation dose. After simulated <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposure,</b> all laboratories were able to distinguish between 2. 0 Gy, 4. 0 Gy, and 6. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001). Overdispersion of the dicentric distribution enabled the detection of the partial body samples; however, this result was clearly dose-dependent. For partial body exposures, only a few dose estimates were in the range of +/- 0. 5 Gy of the given dose, but an improvement could be achieved with higher cell numbers. The new method of semi-automation of the dicentric assay was introduced successfully in a network of six laboratories. It is therefore concluded that this method {{can be used as a}} high-throughput screening tool in a large-scale radiation accident...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The light-adapted crayfish, Pacifastacus trowbridgii (Stimpson, 1957), {{displayed}} a behavioral response to exposure to 300 kV x-rays at exposure rates of 10 to 30 R/s. Within this range, {{the proportion of}} subjects that responded increased {{with an increase in}} exposure rate. The response latency was inversely proportional to the exposure rate. Ophthalmectomized animals exhibited a similar response with a significantly shorter latency than the intact animals at the same exposure rate (30 R/s). <b>Partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>exposure</b> of ophthalmectomized animals also elicited a behavioral response and indicated that a radiation-sensitive receptor was located in the abdomen. X-ray exposure of the dark-adapted compound eye evoked an electroretinogram (ERG) that was similar to the light evoked ERG. The x-ray evoked ERG amplitude was found to be dependent on total exposure for stimulus durations of 300 ms or less. With stimulus durations greater than 300 ms, the ERG amplitude increased in relation to the logarithm of the exposure rate. Similar responses with light, indicated that the mechanism of interaction may be the same for x-rays. The time course for maximal dark - adaptation, after a 500 ms exposure to 3. 85 ft-c of light, was comparable for both x-ray and light exposure (9 min). Differences observed in ERG amplitude between the light and x-ray evoked responses during the initial recovery period can be attributed to absorption of light by migrating accessory pigments or by differential interaction of light with photosensitive pigments in the eye. X-ray exposure (10 to 35 R/s) of the medial branch of the antennule and the cheliped of the first walking leg did not yield any significant chemoreceptor responses as judged by electrophysiological tests. The presence of chemoreceptors was indicated by responses elicited after administration of glutamic acid, glycine, and fish extract. X-irradiation of the dark-adapted sixth abdominal ganglion in both isolated and in vivo preparations elicited similar increases in neural impulse frequency. Significant increases occurred after ten seconds of exposure with an exposure rate of 25 R/s. The response latency decreased to five seconds with 30 and 35 R/s. It was observed that the spike potentials evoked with x-rays were similar to those evoked by light (75 - 100 microvolts). There was, however, a supplemental increase in spike potentials of lower amplitude (40 - 50 microvolts) during x-irradiation that was not observed with light. This indicated that neural elements other than the photo sensitive neurons of the ganglion were activated. It appears likely that the behavioral response in crayfish, subjected to abdomen-only exposure may be instigated by x-ray excitation of the sixth ganglion...|$|E

However, in the event a radiation-mass casualty scenario, many victims will have heterogeneous exposure due to partial shielding and it is unknown whether PB gene expression profiles would be useful in predicting the status of partially irradiated individuals. Here, we identified gene expression profiles in the PB that were characteristic of anterior hemibody-, posterior hemibody- and single limb-irradiation at 0. 5 Gy, 2 Gy and 10 Gy in C 57 Bl 6 mice. These PB signatures predicted the radiation status of partially irradiated mice with a high level of accuracy (range 79 – 100 %) compared to non-irradiated mice.

Both the boys and girls experienced issues with garment fit for athletic clothes due to their body size and shape; these experiences led to their <b>body</b> <b>exposure</b> concerns while participating in physical activities. If the athletic clothes were too tight, too short, or too revealing, the participants expressed concern or sometimes adopted coping techniques to cover parts of their bodies.

Within the MULTIBIODOSE EU FP 7 project a network is being established of 8 laboratories with expertise in dose estimations based on the dicentric assay. Here, the manual dicentric assay was tested in a web-based scoring mode. More than 23, 000 high resolution images of metaphase spreads (only first mitosis) were captured by four laboratories and established as image galleries on the internet (cloud). The galleries included images of a complete dose effect curve (0 - 5. 0 Gy) and three types of irradiation scenarios simulating acute whole <b>body,</b> <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> and protracted <b>exposure.</b> The blood samples had been irradiated in vitro with gamma rays at the University of Ghent, Belgium. Two laboratories provided image galleries from Fluorescence plus Giemsa stained slides (3 h colcemid) and the image galleries from the other two laboratories contained images from Giemsa stained preparations (24 h colcemid). Each of the 8 participating laboratories analysed 3 dose points of the dose effect curve (scoring 100 cells for each point) and 3 unknown dose points (50 cells) for each of the 3 simulated irradiation scenarios. At first all analyses were performed in a QuickScan Mode without scoring individual chromosomes, followed by conventional scoring (only complete cells, 46 centromeres).
