25|$|Just after 01:00, 3 April, the Japanese {{commenced}} a {{long day}} of aerial resistance. At 01:42, Prichett, having beaten off several attacks, was closed by two bogies. The first veered off, but the second pressed on and dropped a 500-pound bomb on the fantail. Exploding close under the counter, it holed the destroyer below the waterline, causing flooding aft and a fire in the 20 mm. clipping room. The crippled destroyer, maintaining a speed in excess of 28knots to minimize flooding and bringing the fire under control, remained in the area and continued to ward off enemy planes until relieved shortly before noon. She then retired to Kerama Retto for emergency repairs. On the 7th, she got underway for Guam where repairs were completed, and on 7 May she returned to Okinawa and radar picket duties. For almost 3 months she escaped further serious damage. However, on 29 July, while standing by a kamikaze victimshe became the target of a second suicide-minded Japanese pilot. Prichett took him under fire at 5,000 yards, but he bore on. Splashed into the sea approximately 6feet off the destroyer's port side, his mission was partially accomplished as his lethal cargo exploded on impact, bowing in the ship's hull and causing extensive damage to her superstructure, port depth charge racks, and radio and <b>power</b> <b>leads.</b> Prichett, despite her damage, remained in the area and for another two hours continued to pick up survivors from Callaghan.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} human evil forms a {{significant}} related theme through A Wizard of Earthsea {{as well as the}} other Earthsea novels. As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his <b>power</b> <b>leads</b> to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him. Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he does. When he accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions, and by accepting his own mortality he is able to free himself. His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the train}} entered the {{right-hand}} curve into the flying junction, the rear bogie of the <b>lead</b> <b>power</b> car derailed {{to the left}} (outside of the curve) at 15:04:42 at approximately KP404.003.

The rear of the <b>lead</b> <b>power</b> car struck a concrete parapet (KP404.209) on the leading abutment to the bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal.

50|$|In most {{photography}} and all telescopy, where {{the subject is}} essentially infinitely far away, longer focal length (lower optical <b>power)</b> <b>leads</b> to higher magnification and a narrower angle of view; conversely, shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with lower magnification and a wider angle of view. On the other hand, in applications such as microscopy in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens, a shorter focal length (higher optical <b>power)</b> <b>leads</b> to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer {{to the center of}} projection.|$|E
