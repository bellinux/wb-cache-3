25|$|The Rankine {{cycle is}} the most basic {{thermodynamic}} <b>power</b> <b>cycle.</b> The simplest cycle consists of a steam generator, a turbine, a condenser, and a pump.

The subcritical Rankine steam cycle is currently used in commercial power plants, with the newest plants utilizing the higher temperature, higher pressure, supercritical Rankine steam cycles. The work of ORNL from the 1960s and 1970s on the MSBR assumed the use of a standard supercritical steam turbine with an efficiency of 44%, and had done considerable design work on developing molten fluoride salt – steam generators.|$|E

Solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed. Some coal ash can be recycled for building materials.|$|E
25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine <b>power</b> <b>cycle.</b> ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E
2500|$|Development of the <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> - Developing a large helium or {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} turbine is needed for highest efficiency. These gas cycles offer numerous potential advantages for use with molten salt-fueled or molten salt-cooled reactors. These closed gas cycles face design challenges and engineering upscaling work for a commercial turbine-generator set. A standard supercritical steam turbine could be used at a small penalty in efficiency (the net efficiency of the MSBR {{was designed to be}} approximately 44%, using an old 1970s steam turbine). A molten salt to steam generator would still have to be developed. Currently, molten nitrate salt steam generators are used in concentrated solar thermal power plants such as Andasol in Spain. Such a generator could be used for an MSR as a third circulating loop, where it would also trap any tritium that diffuses through the primary and secondary heat exchanger ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{functional}} drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, {{called a}} TRIAC, {{is able to}} work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, reactive loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the AC <b>power</b> <b>cycle.</b> Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily inductive motor loads usually {{requires the use of}} a [...] "snubber" [...] circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power.

The industrial practice demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to obtain more power by using advanced heat exchangers with higher effectiveness. In building the Irreversible <b>Power</b> <b>Cycles</b> Design, they were identified firstly the second law effectiveness of the cycle heat exchangers by defining the concept of NTUS (number of transfer units per entropy variation rate of the working fluid). The Irreversible <b>Power</b> <b>Cycles</b> Design highlights the main way in designing new advanced power systems. The delivered power cannot be optimized mathematically, but can be increased systematically by using new heat exchangers with the second law effectiveness closer and closer to the unity. The second law effectiveness can make the difference between the heat transfers, at the hot and the cold reservoirs. Since the second law effectiveness also adds up the internal irreversibility by the intermediary of the NTUS and NTUS 0, the Irreversible <b>Power</b> <b>Cycles</b> Design might in fact judge the overall irreversibility, internal and external. The entropy generation caused by the internal irreversibility is put in storage in the entropy variation of the working fluid at the hot and the cold sinks.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new strategies}} {{for the design of}} <b>power</b> <b>cycles</b> to satisfy the heating and power demands of chemical processes. Methods for the design of efficient heat exchanger networks (HEN) have been extended to include the <b>power</b> <b>cycles</b> of utility systems and refrigeration systems. Because of the high energy and capital costs of these systems, their inclusion in the heat and power integration problem further reduces the energy consumption of the process by allowing heat integration between the <b>power</b> <b>cycles</b> and the heat recovery network of the process, and among the <b>power</b> <b>cycles</b> themselves. ^ The heat and power integration problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) model using an optimality criterion as a design objective that includes the energy-capital trade-offs for the <b>power</b> <b>cycles.</b> The strategies utilize the Temperature Interval method and permit the efficient use of negative heat deficits to obtain lower cost designs. Also, a technique for the lumping of temperature intervals is developed, which often increases the efficiency of optimization without adversely affecting the solution. ^ Initially, a NLP model is formulated for the integration of the heat engines and heat pumps with the process. The model permits an easy assessment of the alternatives for integration and the potential working fluids. Then, an algorithm is presented for the synthesis of cascade refrigeration systems, integrated with the process, with alternate working fluids, and optimized over a continuous range of operating temperatures. Finally, a nonlinear programming strategy is presented for the synthesis of utility systems that satisfy the heating and power demands of the process at 100 percent efficiency. The utility system is modelled as a cascade of heat engines that exchange heat with the process and among themselves. Mass exchange between the adjacent heat engines produces lower pressure designs and provides heat for the process over a broader range of temperatures for a given power demand. Through mass integration, it was discovered that simple Rankine cycles are adequate to generate the complex utility systems that characterize industrial practice. Process examples are presented to illustrate the utility of these models. ...|$|R
