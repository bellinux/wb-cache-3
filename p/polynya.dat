50|$|Latent heat <b>polynyas</b> are {{regions of}} high ice {{production}} and therefore are possible sites of dense water production in both polar regions. The high ice production rates within these <b>polynyas</b> {{leads to a}} large amount of brine rejection into the surface waters. This salty water then sinks and mixes to possibly form new water masses. It is an open question as to whether the <b>polynyas</b> of the Arctic can produce enough dense water to form a major portion of the dense water required to drive the thermohaline circulation.|$|R
30|$|Although {{bottom water}} is not {{considered}} to be formed in the Arctic Ocean, dense water originating from the high ice production in the coastal <b>polynyas</b> intrudes the subsurface and maintains the cold halocline layer, which is a major subsurface water mass in the Arctic Ocean (Aagaard et al. 1981; Winsor and Bjork 2000); Cavalieri and Martin (1994) showed the distribution of coastal <b>polynyas</b> as reduced ice concentration areas for the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea and discussed the contribution of the Chukchi, Bering, Beaufort, and Barents Sea <b>polynyas</b> to the cold halocline layer of the Arctic Ocean.

500|$|A study {{published}} in 2014 found, rapid grounding line retreat in the years 1992-2011. Based on a study from 2005, the greatest retreat was seen in Sjogren Glacier, which is now [...] further inland than where it was in 1953. There are 32 glaciers that were measured to have advanced; however, these glaciers showed only a modest advance averaging [...] per glacier, which is significantly smaller than the massive retreat observed. Thwaites Glacier, which has also shown evidence of thinning, {{has been referred to}} as the weak underbelly of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. A {{study published}} in 2014 found rapid grounding line retreat in the years 1992–2011. Totten Glacier, is a large glacier draining a major portion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. A study in 2008 concluded that Totten Glacier is currently losing mass. [...] A {{study published in}} 2015 concluded that Totten Glacier, [...] has the largest contribution of ice thinning rate on the East Antarctic continent, and that the thinning is driven by enhanced basal melting, because of ocean processes, and affected by <b>polynya</b> activity.

This level of visibility is seldom found in surface fresh water. Crater Lake, Oregon, is often cited for clarity, but the maximum recorded Secchi depth using a 2 m disc is 44 m. The Dry valley lakes of Antarctica and Silfra in Iceland have also been reported as exceptionally clear.|$|E
50|$|The Weddell <b>Polynya</b> or Weddell Sea <b>Polynya</b> is a <b>polynya</b> or {{irregular}} area of {{open water}} surrounded by sea {{ice in the}} Weddell Sea of the Southern Ocean off Antarctica and near the Maud Rise. The size of New Zealand, it re-occurred each winter between 1974 and 1976. These were the first three austral winters observed by the Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR). Since 1976, the <b>polynya</b> has never been seen again. Since the 1970s, the polar Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has freshened and stratified, likely a result of anthropogenic climate change.

40|$|International audiencePhytoplankton in Antarctic coastal <b>polynyas</b> has a {{temporally}} short yet spatially variant growthwindow {{constrained by}} ice cover and day length. Using 18 -year satellite measurements (1997 – 2015) of seaice and chlorophyll concentrations, we assessed the synchronicity between the spring phytoplankton bloomand light availability, {{taking into account}} the ice cover and the incident solar irradiance, for 50 circum-Antarcticcoastal <b>polynyas.</b> The synchronicity was strong (i. e., earlier ice-adjusted light onset leads to earlier bloom andvice versa) in most of the western Antarctic <b>polynyas</b> but weak in a majority of the eastern Antarctic <b>polynyas.</b> The west-east asymmetry is related to sea ice production rate: the formation ofmany eastern Antarctic polynyasis associated with strong katabatic wind and high sea ice production rate, leading to stronger water columnmixing that could damp phytoplankton blooms and weaken the synchronicity...|$|R
50|$|Leads and <b>polynyas</b> {{are areas}} of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air {{temperatures}} are below freezing, {{and provide a}} direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which {{is important for the}} wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear - they vary in width from meter to km scale. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes - even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path, and submarines to surface more easily. <b>Polynyas</b> are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger - two types are recognized: 1) Sensible-heat <b>polynyas,</b> caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) Latent-heat <b>polynyas,</b> resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.|$|R
40|$|High-level primary {{production}} (PP) sustainability in the Antarctic coastal <b>polynyas</b> {{has not been}} adequately addressed. We investigated {{the relationship between the}} Antarctic coastal <b>polynyas</b> phytoplankton biomass (as reflected by Chl-a) and the cloud cover, which dominantly influences the light conditions. Phytoplankton biomass in Antarctic coastal <b>polynyas</b> showed a robust correlation with the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the cloud fraction. However, a different relationship was observed between the phytoplankton biomass and the PAR. This relationship depended on both the ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the geographical location of the coastal <b>polynyas.</b> High intensity UV radiation is suspected to be an inhibitor of phytoplankton biomass. This indicates that the phytoplankton biomass is effectively limited by light intensity, which can be reduced by clouds, particularly mid- and high-level clouds, but it is not limited by light under high-level UV radiation exposure conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The North Water <b>Polynya</b> or Pikialasorsuaq in Greenlandic (NOW) is a <b>polynya</b> (area of year-round {{open water}} {{surrounded}} by sea ice) that lies between Greenland and Canada in northern Baffin Bay.

5000|$|A <b>polynya</b> [...] {{is an area}} of {{open water}} {{surrounded}} by sea ice. It is now used as geographical term for an area of unfrozen sea within the ice pack. It is a loanword from полынья (<b>polynya)</b> , which refers to a natural ice hole, and was adopted in the 19th century by polar explorers to describe navigable portions of the sea. In past decades, for example, some polynyas, such as the Weddell <b>Polynya,</b> have lasted over multiple winters (1974-1976).|$|E
50|$|Between May and July (sometimes April), a {{significant}} portion of navigable open water (<b>polynya)</b> forms at the extreme north of the bay, presumably due to the relatively warm Greenland Current. With an area of about 80000 km2 in summer, it is the largest <b>polynya</b> of the Canadian Arctic and covers the Smith Sound between the Ellesmere Island and Greenland. This <b>polynya</b> has a stable position and existed for at least 9,000 years. It was first described in 1616 by William Baffin and was named North Water by whalers of the 18-19th centuries.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>polynyas</b> and the atmospheric boundary layer is {{examined in the}} Laptev Sea using the regional, non-hydrostatic Consortium for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO) atmosphere model. A thermodynamic sea-ice model is used to consider the response of sea-ice surface temperature to idealized atmospheric forcing. The idealized regimes represent atmospheric conditions that are typical for the Laptev Sea region. Cold wintertime conditions are investigated with sea-ice ocean temperature differences of up to 40 K. The Laptev Sea flaw <b>polynyas</b> strongly modify the atmospheric boundary layer. Convectively mixed layers reach heights of up to 1200 m above the <b>polynyas</b> with temperature anomalies of more than 5 K. Horizontal transport of heat expands to areas more than 500 km downstream of the <b>polynyas.</b> Strong wind regimes {{lead to a more}} shallow mixed layer with strong near-surface modifications, while weaker wind regimes show a deeper, well-mixed convective boundary layer. Shallow mesoscale circulations occur in the vicinity of ice-free and thin-ice covered <b>polynyas.</b> They are forced by large turbulent and radiative heat fluxes from the surface of up to 789 W m- 2, strong low-level thermally induced convergence and cold air flow from the orographic structure of the Taimyr Peninsula in the western Laptev Sea region. Based on the surface energy balance we derive potential sea-ice production rates between 8 and 25 cm d- 1. These production rates are mainly determined by whether the <b>polynyas</b> are ice-free or covered by thin ice and by the wind strength. ...|$|R

50|$|The North Water <b>Polynya</b> (Saqvaaq) {{is closely}} {{connected}} to Lancaster Sound (Inuktitut ᑕᓪᓗᕈᑎᐅᑉ ᑕᕆᐅᖓ Tallurutiup Tariunga) and Baffin Bay {{by a powerful}} system of ocean currents that directly affect the region's climate and biology. In a sense the NOW <b>polynya</b> {{is a result of}} the merging of three smaller polynya's Smith Sound, Lady Ann Strait, and Lancaster Sound. The West Greenland Current follows that country's coastline and moves warm and salty Atlantic water north, reaching all the way to the North Water <b>Polynya.</b> An upwelling of warmer water in this <b>polynya</b> helps keep it partially ice-free throughout the year, even when the ocean directly north and south is frozen. Another arm of the West Greenland Current reaches into Lancaster Sound, delivering Atlantic waters into the Arctic Ocean and contributing to that area's rich ecology.|$|E
50|$|As {{sea water}} freezes, areas of open water become encircled by ice. These open patches, or <b>polynya,</b> {{continue}} to cool {{at the surface}} of the ocean. As the <b>polynya</b> reduces in size, frazil ice crystals begin to submerge. The increasing salinity from surrounding ice creates a column that is extremely cold and dense, causing the ice crystals to accumulate along the plume. These frozen stalactites are fragile during early stages, but as the <b>polynya</b> closes, the ice crystals fill in and harden. In calm waters, brinicles can reach the sea floor, freezing anything that it touches.|$|E
50|$|The water here {{is close}} to {{freezing}} throughout the year and is mostly covered by ice. Between 1973 and 1986, several polynyas have occurred in these waters, with the totally enclosed Cosmonaut <b>polynya</b> attaining a maximum size on July 25, 1980, with an open water area {{of as much as}} 137,700 km2.

50|$|Unlike <b>polynyas,</b> {{which tend}} to occur, and remain, at a given location, leads are {{transient}} features that can form anywhere in an ice-covered ocean.

Lead formation is therefore tied in with synoptic-scale weather patterns, typically lasting a few days. Also, because the open water within a lead tends to quickly refreeze, the contribution of leads to heat exchange and water vapour output to the atmosphere is significantly less than that of <b>polynyas,</b> where refreezing of the open water is prevented.|$|R
