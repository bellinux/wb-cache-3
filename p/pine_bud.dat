40|$|The {{effects of}} {{packaging}} materials on preserving the functional component of <b>pine</b> <b>bud</b> beverage stored under UV (ultraviolet) light exposure conditions were studied. The order of UV light blocking {{properties of the}} selected packages was: opaque can> opaque PET (polyethylene terepthalate) with green lamination=transparent PET with 10 % PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) blending> transparent PET, and did not depend on film thickness in specified range. At 20 oC, the order of preserving degree of original color and endobornyl acetate, which is quality index of <b>pine</b> <b>bud</b> beverage, {{was the same as}} above. Exposure to UV light can cause of deterioration of functional food components, but green color lamination and blending of PEN materials with transparent PET help to preserve the UV sensitive <b>pine</b> <b>bud</b> beverage components. However, the treated PET bottles have poorer preservation capa-bilities than the opaque cans. Transparent PET with PEN blending, in particular, will be very useful packaging material for colorful functional beverage preservation by helping to protect the ingredients while attracting consum-er attention...|$|E

40|$|Medicinal plant {{materials}} {{are not usually}} analysed for condensed tannins (CT). Thirty commercially available European medicinal plants and herbal products were screened for CT and fourteen CT samples were analysed in detail. This is also the first comprehensive CT analysis of <b>pine</b> <b>buds,</b> walnut leaves, heather flowers and great water dock roots. Acetone/water extracts contained between 3. 2 and 25. 9 g CT/ 100 g of extract, had CT with mean degrees of polymerisation of 2. 9 to 13. 3, procyanidin/prodelphinidin ratios of 1. 6 / 98. 4 to 100 / 0 and cis/trans flavan- 3 -ol ratios of 17. 7 / 82. 3 to 97. 3 / 2. 7. The majority of samples contained procyanidins, four contained A-type linkages (blackthorn flowers, heather flowers, bilberry leaves and cowberry leaves) and one sample also had galloylated procyanidins (great water dock roots) ...|$|R
50|$|The thick-billed parrot {{likes to}} nest in tree cavities, {{especially}} old woodpecker holes. In parts of its existing range, dead or living quaking aspens are the dominant tree selected for nesting. It mainly feeds on seeds from various pine species. Mexican white pine {{appears to be}} a preferred species but the seeds of Douglas fir, Apache pine, Chihuahua pine, and yellow pine are also taken. The species is strongly dependent on the supply of conifer cones, breeding at the peak of pine seed production. The species is nomadic, following the variations of cone abundance. To a much lesser extent, they also feed upon acorns and <b>pine</b> <b>buds.</b> They are adept fliers, and historical accounts describe the birds sleeping in one mountain range, and crossing vast distances to feed in another mountain range each day. They deal with deep snow by hanging upside-down and climbing on the bare underside of a snow-covered branch in order to access cones.|$|R
40|$|Glypta fumiferanae and {{two species}} of Apanteles parasitized 1 st- 4 th instar jack <b>pine</b> <b>bud</b> worm (Choristoneura pinus). Apparent {{parasitism}} of budworm in four Michigan populations ranged from 10. 6 to 30. 9 % for A. fumiferanae, 4. 3 - 16. 4 % for A. morrisi, and 2. 1 - 9. 1 % for G. fumiferanae. A. morrisi probably parasitized 3 rd- 4 th instar jack <b>pine</b> <b>bud</b> worm. Based on the results obtained, {{it is suggested that}} sampling overwintering budworm larvae is appropriate for estimating apparent parasitism by A. fumiferanae and G. fumiferanae.

40|$|A {{workshop}} {{held at the}} end of {{the symposium}} reviewed the need for future research and development. There is a need to develop our under-standing of insect population dynamics, the interaction of insect populations with the host and jack pine stands, and to improve the array of tools available for direct control of populations. The emerging need to view insect population irruptions in terms of ecosystem function has changed the outlook of forest managers. The consequences of this change have to be reflected in prescriptions used in managing the jack pine resource. The workshop concluded by recommending that a future meet-ing be held to explore management of the jack <b>pine</b> <b>bud</b> worm populations in jack pine ecosystems with participation of specialists from other disci-plines...|$|E
40|$|The {{winter frost}} {{hardiness}} level of Corsican <b>Pine</b> <b>buds</b> in northern England {{is found to}} range from — 16 ° C to — 200 C (+ 30 F to — 40 F). Buds in the lower parts of the tree {{are more susceptible to}} frost damage than those nearer the leader, and buds at a given position in the canopy on a north-facing slop * are less hardy than those in a corresponding position on a tree in a south aspect. The symptoms produced by artificial freezing are distinct from those found in dieback disease, and temperature measurements in diseased and healthy stands suggest that frosts are not severe enough to account for the disease. The lower hardiness levels in disease susceptible areas are therefore considered to be of secondary importance and are probably a result of a weakened physiological condition in the tree. Diseased slopes are chiefly characterized by high humidities, low light intensities, and only slightly reduced air and soil temperatures when compared with nearby healthy areas...|$|R
40|$|The Saratoga spittlebug, Aphrophora saratogensis (Fitch), is a {{destructive}} pest of young planted pines in the Lake States. The adults injure the pines by feeding on the sap of branches. However, nymphs {{feed on the}} sap of alternate host plants, which include many herbs and woody plants on the forest floor. Our {{studies show that the}} time of the eclosion and shortly thereafter {{is one of the most}} vulnerable periods in the insect 2 ̆ 7 s life cycle. During this period the nymphs must free themselves from the eggs that are on <b>pine</b> <b>buds,</b> vacate the <b>pines,</b> search out suitable host plants on the forest floor, initiate feeding, and cover themselves with masses of spittle. And they must do this before they desiccate (Ewan, 1961), starve, or are captured by predators. As part of a survival study we wanted to observe the nymphs at eclosion because their emergence and behavior pattern at that time would certainly affect their survival. In the Lake States area eclosion occurs from early April to late May, a period when weather varies greatly from cool and wet to warm and dry. Reported is the nymphal eclosion pattern during the peak of the eclosion periods in 1969 and 1970...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Although {{microbes}} {{are generally}} found as endophytes in many plant tissues, the plant shoot meristems {{have been considered}} virtually sterile. Plant tissue culture, which utilizes mostly the meristems, has nevertheless given numerous references to microbial existence in these tissues. Since the bud-derived tissue cultures of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) also become easily occupied by microbes, microbial presence {{was considered to be}} one potential cause of the low regeneration capacity of tissues from mature trees. The origin of the microbes occurring in tissue cultures of <b>buds</b> of Scots <b>pine</b> was established in this study. One of the microbes, classified as Hormonema dematioides (Ascomycota), was localized in the scale tissues of a bud. Several other microbes were detected, and were associated especially with the meristematic tissues of Scots <b>pine</b> <b>buds.</b> This group was comprised of the yeast Rhodotorula minuta, and bacteria belonging to Methylobacterium spp., the Pseudomonas fluorescens subgroup, and a Mycobacterium sp. These endophytes were located particularly in the outermost cells of meristems, in the epithelial cells of resin ducts, and in the cells of the developing stem, {{in the vicinity of the}} meristems. These endophytes were less frequently found in the vascular tissue or in the intercellular spaces of cells, which are typical locations for the previously known endophytic bacteria. The meristem-associated endophytes were discovered to affect growth of pine tissues, and some of them produced substances that are suitable as precursors for phytohormone synthesis. Additionally, pure cultures of both bacterial and fungal endophytes showed antagonism in vitro against pathogens. When the correlation between the presence endophytes and the degeneration of bud-derived tissue cultures of Scots pine was studied, it was discovered that the endophytes grew uncontrollably once a tissue culture was initiated from the bud. A high level of chitinase production was also detected in these tissue cultures, which was considered to be indicative of a defense reaction. However, the endophytes were not found to colonize excessively in every tissue, but all bud-derived tissue cultures of Scots pine eventually degenerate. Therefore, it was concluded that the endophytes may not exclusively be considered responsible for the degeneration of the cultures...|$|R
50|$|The Harris's sparrow {{generally}} {{feeds on}} the ground, scratching vigorously {{in the leaves}} and soil for food. Observed foraging during nesting was 85% ground-gleaning. During the breeding season individuals typically forage alone or with a mate. Primary in the diet (66% of stomach contents of breeding birds) are seeds, largely of Carex sedges, grasses and Scirpus bulrush. Also important in the breeding season diet are fruits, largely black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), mountain bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) and various Vaccinium species. <b>Pine</b> needles, flower <b>buds</b> and blossoms are eaten supplementally. Larval invertebrates are important from June to September in the diet, as available prey becomes more common at this point. The principal preferred animal prey includes beetles, flies, bees, ants, moths, butterflies, spiders, cicadas, aphids and leafhoppers. The diet of wintering Harris's sparrow is less well-known {{and has not been}} quantitatively studied.|$|R
