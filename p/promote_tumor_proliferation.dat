However, the mechanisms that regulate OIS in PDAC are poorly understood. Here, we have determined that nuclear RelA reinforces OIS to inhibit carcinogenesis in the Kras mouse model of PDAC. Inactivation of RelA accelerated pancreatic lesion formation in Kras mice by abrogating the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene transcription signature. Using genetic and pharmacological tools, we determined that RelA activation promotes OIS via elevation of the SASP factor CXCL 1 (also known as KC), which activates CXCR 2, during pancreatic carcinogenesis. In Kras mice, pancreas-specific inactivation of CXCR 2 prevented OIS and was correlated with increased tumor proliferation and decreased survival. Moreover, reductions in CXCR 2 levels were associated with advanced neoplastic lesions in tissue from human pancreatic specimens. Genetically disabling OIS in Kras mice caused RelA to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation,</b> suggesting a dual role for RelA signaling in pancreatic carcinogenesis.

The lncRNA HNF 1 A-antisense 1 (HNF 1 A-AS 1) is a 2455 -bp transcript on chromosome 12 with a potential oncogenic role in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Nevertheless, current understanding of the involvement of HNF 1 A-AS 1 in lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis remains limited. In this study, we analyzed the roles of HNF 1 A-AS 1 in 40 lung adenocarcinoma tissues and five lung cancer cell lines. Our results showed that HNF 1 A-AS 1 was significantly up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues, and its expression level was significantly correlated with TNM stage, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis. The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser’s Kaplan–Meier plot suggested that patients in the high HNF 1 A-AS 1 expression subgroup experienced worse overall survival compared to the low expression subgroup. Moreover, HNF 1 A-AS 1 was determined to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation</b> and metastasis, both in vitro and in vivo, by regulating cyclin D 1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and β-catenin expression.

Fe-S clusters within ABCE 1 are crucial for ribosome dissociation and translation reinitiation; however, whether these clusters <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation</b> and migration is unclear. Methods: The interaction between ABCE 1 and β-actin was confirmed using GST pull-down. The lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell line A 549 was transduced with lentiviral packaging vectors overexpressing either wild-type ABCE 1 or ABCE 1 with Fe-S cluster deletions (ΔABCE 1). The role of Fe-S clusters in the viability and migration of cancer cells was evaluated using clonogenic, MTT, Transwell and wound healing assays. Cytoskeletal rearrangement was determined using immunofluorescent techniques. Results: Fe-S clusters were the key domains in ABCE 1 involved in binding to β-actin. The proliferative and migratory capacity increased in cells overexpressing ABCE 1. However, the absence of Fe-S clusters reversed these effects. A 549 cells overexpressing ABCE 1 exhibited irregular morphology and increased levels of cytoskeletal polymerization {{as indicated by the}} immunofluorescence images. In contrast, cells expressing the Fe-S cluster deletion mutant presented opposing effects.

Moreover, the cancer and stromal interaction seems to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation.</b> In this study, L 49 H 37, a newly synthesized curcumin analog, was used as intervention to target the stromal compartment of pancreatic cancer. Methods In vitro cultures of human PSCs were exposed to curcumin and L 49 H 37. Cell viability as well as growth promoting and survival signaling pathways were monitored by MTT, fl ow cytometry and western blotting. Results Curcumin and L 49 H 37 eff ectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in PSCs. L 49 H 37 was found to be more potent at a lower concentration than curcumin in the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

40|$|Today, insulin analogs {{are used}} in {{millions}} of diabetic patients.

Modifications in the amino acid sequence of the insulin molecule change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the analogs in respect to human insulin. However, these changes can also modify the molecular and biological effects of the analogs. The rapid-acting insulin analogs, lispro, aspart and glulisine, have a rapid onset and shorter duration of action. The long-acting insulin analogs glargine and detemir have a protracted duration of action and a relatively smooth serum concentration profile. Insulin and its analogs may function as growth factors and therefore have a theoretical potential to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation.</b> A major question is whether analogs have an increased mitogenic activity in respect to insulin. These ligands can promote cell proliferation through many mechanisms like the prolonged stimulation of the insulin receptor, stimulation of the IGF- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R), prevalent activation of the ERK rather than the AKT intracellular post-receptor pathways. Studies on in vitro models indicate that short-acting analogs elicit molecular and biological effects that {{are similar to those of}} insulin. In contrast, long-acting analogs behave differently. Although not all data are homogeneous, both glargine and detemir have been found to have a decreased binding to IR but an increased binding to IGF- 1 R, a prevalent activation of the ERK pathway, and an increased mitogenic effect in respect to insulin. Recent retrospective epidemiological clinical studies have suggested that treatment with long-acting analogs (specifically glargine) may increase the relative risk for cancer.

40|$|Gliomas are {{the most}} common brain tumor and {{glioblastoma}} multiforme (GBM) is {{the most common type of}} glioma observed in patients. Prognosis with late stage glioma and GBM is very poor even with recent advances in treatment. Along with treating the tumor, manners of bypassing the blood brain barrier and ensuring the tumor uptakes the treatment is necessary. Because the treatments can harm regular brain cells there is concern about the viability and toxic side effects of many treatments. With all of these challenges posed it is important to understand how glial tumors can be so recurring and difficult to treat. One method employed by the tumors is utilizing the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism to suppress the immune system and <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Tryptophan is brought in to the cell by L-amino acid transporter (LAT 1) and catabolized in to tryptophan by indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase I/II (IDO- 1 /IDO- 2), tryptophan 2, 3 dioxygenase (TDO- 2), kynurenine- 3 -monoxygenase (KMO), and kynureninase (KYNU). Finally this kynurenine can interact with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to promote gene transcription that allows the tumor to further thrive. Immunohistochemical staining across all grades and types of gliomas reveals expression patterns for the enzymes involved in the tryptophan metabolism. The staining revealed high, near-ubiquitous expression for IDO- 2, TDO- 2, KYNU, and LAT- 1. KMO and IDO- 1 had staining in the majority of the tissues and AHR showed the least expression. A repeat of this experiment with more cases is required so that a statistical analysis may be done on the expression patterns for the proteins.

Positron emission tomography (PET) {{is a useful}} diagnostic method that enables noninvasive in vivo quantitative imaging of biofunctional molecules with probes labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes. Here a novel 18 F labeled probe for PET FABP 4 imaging developed through dedicated drug design from a radioiodinated probe we recently reported is evaluated in vitro and in vivo. 【Methods】We designed the [18 F]-labeled FTAP 1 and FTAP 3 probe, composed of a single or triple oxyethylene linker and a triazolopyrimidine scaffold derived from an FABP 4 inhibitor. FABP 4 binding affinities for chemically synthesized FTAP 1 and FTAP 3 were measured using FABP 4 and 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonic acid. Cell membrane permeability was measured using a commercially available plate assay system. After radiosynthesis, [18 F]FTAP 1 affinity and selectivity were evaluated using immobilized FABP 3, FABP 4, and FABP 5. Cell uptake was investigated using differentiated adipocytes expressing FABP 4 with inhibitor treatment. Following biodistribution studies in C 6 glioblastoma-bearing mice, ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry were performed using thin sliced tumor sections. PET/CT imaging was then performed on C 6 tumor bearing mice. 【[Results】FTAP 1 showed high FABP 4 affinity (Ki = 68 ± 8. 9 nM) and adequate cell permeability. [18 F]FTAP 1 with ≥ 98 % radiochemical purity was shown to selectively bind to FABP 4 (16. 3 - and 9. 3 -fold higher than for FABP 3 and FABP 5, respectively). [18 F]FTAP 1 was taken up by FABP 4 expressing cells, and this uptake could be blocked by an inhibitor, indicating very low non-specific cell binding. [18 F]FTAP 1 showed high tumor accumulation, which demonstrates its potential use for in vivo tumor PET imaging, and the intratumoral radioactivity distribution corresponded to the FABP 4 expression profile. 【Conclusion】][18 F]FTAP 1 is a promising PET probe to target FABP 4...|$|E

40|$|Malignant gliomas are {{the most}} common primary brain tumors with dismal prognosis. A growing line of {{evidence}} supports significant roles of immunosurveillance for prevention and regulation of cancer development. For example, tumor infiltrating T-cells are capable of killing tumor cells and are a positive prognostic factor for cancer patients. T-cell immune responses are classified into distinct effector cell types, type- 1 or type- 2, based on their cytokine-secreting profiles. We have demonstrated that tumor-specific type- 1 T-cells, but not type- 2 T-cells, can efficiently traffic into CNS tumor sites and mediate effective therapeutic efficacy via a type- 1 chemokine CXCL 10 and an integrin receptor VLA- 4. Despite the importance of the type- 1 T cell response, cancers, including GBMs, secrete numerous type- 2 cytokines that <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation</b> and immune escape. The hallmark cytokines of type- 1 and type- 2 immune responses are IFNs and IL- 4, respectively. We therefore sought to better understand the role of IL- 4 and IFN signaling in gliomas. We herein demonstrate that the miR- 17 - 92 cluster is down-regulated in T-cells in both human and mouse tumors, dependent on IL- 4 R signaling. Further, ectopic expression of miR- 17 - 92 cluster in T-cells resulted in enhanced IFN-γ and IL- 2 production and resistance to activation induced cell death (AICD) (Aim 1). We next examined IL- 4 Rα on immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Interestingly we found that IL- 4 Rα was up-regulated on human and mouse glioma infiltrating, but not peripheral, MDSCs. Additionally, IL- 4 Rα expression promoted arginase activity, T-cell suppressing abilities and glioma growth (Aim 2). As type I IFNs are important for anti-glioma type- 1 immunity, we further examined how type I IFNs impact glioma patient prognosis. As there are multiple type I IFNs, our collaborators assisted us to identify potentially important genes by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. We found that IFN-pathway genes IFN- alpha receptor- 1 (IFNAR 1) and the IFN-alpha- 8 (IFNA 8) promoter both had SNPs associated with glioma prognosis. By luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) we demonstrated that the A-allele, which is associated with better glioma patient survival, but not the C-allele of rs 12553612 in the promoter region of IFNA 8 allows for OCT- 1 binding and activity of the IFNA 8 promoter (Aim 3). Overall, our data suggests that type- 2 promoting has a dual role in suppressing glioma immunity through decreased T-cell functioning and enhanced MDSC function. Type- 2 promoted suppression of glioma immunity can thus lead to better glioma patient prognosis, a significant public health achievement...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB 1) is a prototypical receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that activates multi-kinase phosphorylation cascades to regulate diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, migration and differentiation. ErbB 1 heterooligomerizes with three close homologues: ErbB 2, ErbB 3 and ErbB 4. ErbB 1 - 3 receptors are frequently mutated, overexpressed or activated by autocrine or paracrine ligand production in solid tumors and have {{been the target of}} extensive drug discovery efforts. Multiple small molecule kinase inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies against ErbB receptors are in clinical use or development. Despite their importance as RTKs, oncogenes and drug targets, regulation of ErbB receptors by the interplay of conformational change, phosphorylation, phosphatases and receptor trafficking remains poorly understood, and the impact of these dynamics on physiological activity and cellular responses to anti-ErbB drugs is largely unknown. This thesis investigates the dynamic opposition of kinases and phosphatases within the ErbB pathway. By standard biochemical analysis, ErbB receptors and downstream proteins appear to become phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated in approximately 30 minutes. However, pulse chase experiments where cells are exposed to ligand and then to small molecule kinase inhibitors reveal that individual proteins must in fact cycle rapidly between being phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in seconds. We construct a succession of differential equation-based models of varying biochemical resolution, each model appropriate for analyzing a different aspect of ErbB regulation, to help interpret the data and gain quantitative insight into receptor and drug biology. Rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of receptors has important implications for the assembly dynamics of signalosomes. We find that signals are rapidly propagated through some downstream pathways but slowly through others, resulting in prolonged activation in the absence of upstream signal. We show that fast phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may provide cells with the flexibility necessary to rapidly detect and respond to changes in their extracellular environment. These fast dynamics also {{play a crucial role in}} determining the response to ErbB 1 -targeting cancer therapies, which we find to vary significantly between drugs with different mechanisms of action. We show that treatment with one class of these drugs results in sustained signaling, instead of inhibition, and thus may actually <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation</b> or invasion.

In our current study, the expression levels of microRNA- 211 (miR- 211) were measured in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines. We found that miR- 211 expression levels were increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines and that the overexpression of miR- 211 promotes cell proliferation and invasion.

However, what role antigen stimulation plays in its pathogenesis remains ill defined. The genetic hallmark is the chromosomal translocation t(11; 14) resulting in aberrant expression of cyclin D 1. Secondary genetic events increase the oncogenic potential of cyclin D 1 and frequently inactivate DNA damage response pathways.

We found that T-cell PTP (TC-PTP) was overexpressed in transformed B cells. We hypothesized that TC-PTP may be a tumor-promoting gene that is regulated by MYC overexpression in B cells. Knock-down of TC-PTP in murine tumors re-sulted in decreased cell viability in vitro because of an arrest in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, cells with reduced TC-PTP expression were unable to either engraft or expand in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that TC-PTP is required for B-cell tumor maintenance. Our data also suggested a correlation between TC-PTP expression and MYC overexpression. To investigate this fur-ther, we used malignant murine B cells that contain a doxycycline-repressible MYC transgene. We found that repression of MYC overexpression with doxycycline reduced TC-PTP expression. Moreover, enforced expression of TC-PTP showed partial rescue of the expansion of tumor cells after suppression of MYC overex-pression.

Agonists inhibit <b>tumor</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> and induce apoptosis, which is thought to be triggered by caspase-3 activity. Antagonists <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> cell <b>proliferation,</b> but this mechanism is less understood. Sigma receptor ligands have been conjugated to nanoparticles and peptides to deliver cancer treatment to tumor cells without targeting other tissues. The success with these methods have been limited to in vitro trials. Additionally, using sigma-2 receptors to target tumor cells allows for synergizing anti-cancer drug therapies. Some studies have shown that certain sigma receptor inhibitors increase cancer cells' susceptibility to chemotherapy. Other types of binding to sigma-2 receptors increases cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, antinomyocin, and other cancer cell killing drugs.|$|R
40|$|The 21 st century {{brought about}} a {{dramatic}} increase in knowledge about genetic and molecular profiles of cancer. This information has validated the complexity of tumor cells and increased awareness of “nodal proteins”, but has yet to advance the development of rational targeted cancer therapeutics. Nodal proteins are critical cellular proteins that collect biological inputs and distribute the information across diverse biological processes. Survivin acts as a nodal protein by interfacing the multiple signals involved in mitosis and apoptosis and functionally integrate proliferation, cell death, and cellular homeostasis. By characterizing survivin as a target of both Type 1 Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF- 1) and Notch developmental signaling, we contribute to the paradigm of survivin as a nodal protein. The two signaling systems, Notch and IGF- 1, regulate survivin by two independent mechanisms. Notch activation induces survivin transcription preferentially in basal breast cancer, a breast cancer subtype with poor prognosis and lack of molecular therapies. Activated Notch binds the transcription factor RBP-Jк and drives transcription from the survivin promoter. Notch mediated survivin expression increases cell cycle kinetics <b>promoting</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation.</b> Inhibition of Notch in a breast xenograft model reduced tumor growth and systemic metastasis. On the other hand, IGF- 1 signaling drives survivin protein translation in prostate cancer cells. Binding of IGF- 1 to its receptor activates downstream kinases, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p 70 S 6 protein kinase (p 70 S 6 K), which modulates survivin mRNA translation to increase the apoptotic threshold. The multiple roles of survivin in tumorigenesis implicate survivin as a rational target for the “next generation” of cancer therapeutics...|$|R
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} role of {{this gene}} {{lends itself to}} being involved {{in a variety of}} disease pathologies, including cancer. One metabolite, butyrate, induces hyperacetylation of the histones around the PDK4 gene. This is associated with a greater transcription level of PDK4 mRNA, thereby reversing the downregulation of PDK4 in colon carcinoma cells. In human colon cancer cells, targeting and inactivating the PDH complex limits the metabolic rate and regulates glutamine metabolism, thereby partially inhibiting cell growth. However, PDK4 has also been shown to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> genesis and <b>proliferation</b> through a different pathway, the CREB-RHEB-mTORC1 signaling cascade.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the role of {{carbonic}} anhydrase 9 (CA 9), a cancer-associated extracellular isoform of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in multicellular spheroid growths (radius of ∼ 300 μm) of human colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells. Spheroids were transfected with CA 9 (or empty vector) and imaged confocally (using fluorescent dyes) for both intracellular pH (pHi) and pH in the restricted extracellular spaces (pHe). With no CA 9 expression, spheroids developed very low pHi (∼ 6. 3) and reduced pHe (∼ 6. 9) at their core, associated with a diminishing gradient of acidity extending out to the periphery. With CA 9 expression, core intracellular acidity was less prominent (pHi = ∼ 6. 6), whereas extracellular acidity was enhanced (pHe = ∼ 6. 6), so that radial pHi gradients were smaller and radial pHe gradients were larger. These effects were reversed by eliminating CA 9 activity with membrane-impermeant CA inhibitors. The observation that CA 9 activity reversibly reduces pHe indicates the enzyme is facilitating CO 2 excretion from cells (by converting vented CO 2 to extracellular H+), rather than facilitating membrane H+ transport (such as H+ associated with metabolically generated lactic acid). This latter process requires titration of exported H+ ions with extracellular HCO 3 −, which would reduce rather than increase extracellular acidity. In a multicellular structure, {{the net effect of}} CA 9 on pHe will depend on the cellular CO 2 /lactic acid emission ratio (set by local oxygenation and membrane HCO 3 − uptake). Our results suggest that CO 2 -producing tumors may express CA 9 to facilitate CO 2 excretion, thus raising pHi and reducing pHe, which <b>promotes</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation</b> and survival. The results suggest a possible basis for attenuating tumor development through inhibiting CA 9 activity...|$|R
40|$|Increasing evidences {{suggest that}} bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are {{recruited}} into the stroma of developing tumors where {{they contribute to}} progression by enhancing tumor growth and metastasis, or by inducing anticancer-drug resistance. Although many experimental evidences exist supporting the therapeutic potential of MSCs, the mechanism of homing and recruitment of MSCs into tumors and their potential role in malignant tissue progression is still not well understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the role of BM-MSCs to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> and invasion. Therefore, we analyzed whether chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4) and water channel molecule, aquaporin 1 (AQP 1), both known to play a key role in cancer metastases, could affect MSCs mediated osteosarcoma and hepacarcinoma progression. We used human mesenchymal stem cell isolated from bone marrow aspirates by gradient centrifugation and seeded in standard cell culture conditions. MSCs were grown for 48 h in medium with 1...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Chinese {{medicine}} (TCM) is {{an important}} complementary strategy for treating cancer in China. The mechanism is related to regulating the internal environment and remodeling the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIM). Herein we illustrate how TIM is reformed and its protumor activity on <b>promoting</b> <b>tumor</b> cell <b>proliferation,</b> angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, tumor invasion, and the oncogenicity of cancer stem cells. Furthermore we summarize the effects and mechanism of TCM on regulating TIM via enhancing antitumor immune responses (e. g., regulating the expression of MHC molecules and Fas/FasL, attenuating cancerigenic ability of cancer stem cells) and remolding immunosuppressive cells (e. g., reversing immune phenotypes of T lymphocytes and <b>tumor</b> associated macrophages, <b>promoting</b> dendritic cells mature, restraining myeloid derived suppressor cells function, and regulating Th 1 /Th 2 factors). We also reveal the bidirectional and multitargeting functions of TCM on regulating TIM. Hopefully, it provides new theoretical basis for TCM clinical practice in cancer treatment and prevention...|$|R
40|$|Aberrant {{protein kinase}} {{activity}} <b>promotes</b> <b>tumor</b> survival and <b>proliferation,</b> and targeted kinase inhibitors that halt growth and promote apoptosis demonstrate some cancers are truly kinase addicted. Clinically, this is best exemplified by chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), {{driven by the}} fusion kinase BCR-ABL, where tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy can control the disease for years, perhaps indefinitely in many patients. For other cancers, however, the success of kinase inhibition has been more modest. Despite great strides in drug design and delivery, resistance invariably develops, typically limiting median progression free survival (PFS) to a period of months. Development of new-generation inhibitors therefore has focused on increasing potency, overcoming resistance-conferrin...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between tumor progression and {{innate immune system}} has been well established in the last years. Indeed, several lines of clinical evidence indicate that immune cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) interact with tumor cells, favoring growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis {{of a variety of}} cancers. In most tumors, TAMs show properties of an alternative polarization phenotype (M 2) characterized by the expression of a series of chemokines, cytokines, and proteases that <b>promote</b> immunosuppression, <b>tumor</b> <b>proliferation,</b> and spreading of the cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes have been traditionally linked to the regulation of cancer progression; however, a growing body of evidence indicates that these genes also play essential roles in the regulation of innate immunity pathways through molecular mechanisms that are still poorly understood. In this paper, we provide an overview of the immunobiology of TAMs as well as what is known about tumor suppressors in the context of immune responses. Recent advances regarding the role of the tumor suppressor ARF as a regulator of inflammation and macrophage polarization are also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Toll like {{receptor}} (TLR) signaling {{has been}} suggested {{to play an important}} role in the inflammatory microenvironment of solid tumors and through this inflammation-mediated tumor growth. Here, we studied the role of tumor cells in their process of self-maintaining TLR expression independent of inflammatory cells and cytokine milieu for autoregulative tumor growth signaling in pancreatic cancer. We analyzed the expression of TLR 2, - 4, and - 9 in primary human cancers and their impact on tumor growth via induced activation in several established pancreatic cancers. TLR-stimulated pancreatic cancer cells were specifically investigated for activated signaling pathways of VEGF/PDGF and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL expression as well as tumor cell growth. The primary pancreatic cancers and cell lines expressed TLR 2, - 4, and - 9. TLR-specific stimulation resulted in activated MAP-kinase signaling, most likely via autoregulative stimulation of demonstrated TLR-induced VEGF and PDGF expression. Moreover, TLR activation prompted the expression of Bcl-xL and has been demonstrated for the first time to induce <b>tumor</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> in pancreatic cancer. These findings strongly suggest that pancreatic cancer cells use specific Toll like receptor signaling to <b>promote</b> <b>tumor</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> and emphasize the particular role of TLR 2, - 4, and - 9 in this autoregulative process of tumor cell activation and proliferation in pancreatic cancer...|$|R
