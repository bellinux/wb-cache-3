40|$|Background: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the prevalence of edentulousness, patients perception on dietary changes resulting from tooth loss and to identify the disparity between actual and <b>patient</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> replace missing teeth in an elderly rural population in south India. Methods: A cross sectional study using the systematic cluster sampling method was used to select the study sample of 150 elderly men and women. Data were collected using questionnaires and oral examination. The data were statistically analyzed using chi square test and pearson correlation. Results: 15. 6 % of the rural elderly were completely edentulous and 54. 7 % were partially edentulous. Observed differences in distribution between the sampled elderly age groups were found to be statistically significant. Although 70. 3 % of the evaluated elderly actually required prosthodontic treatment, only 14. 4 % <b>perceived</b> the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> replace missing teeth. A small percentage of the elderly (18 %) perceived a severe change in their diets due to tooth loss. Thirty three percent of them perceived a moderate change and 28 % felt that there were no dietary changes because of tooth loss. Conclusions: It is essential to identify feasible strategies to provide primary dental health education and treatment to all rural elderly in the future. We suggest community dental health services as a general health need of the elderly rather than a special health need of the community...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 8630 The {{component}} {{features of}} pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) are interrelated but {{the development of}} a unified strategy to investigate and treat these problems has been slow; this has invariably affected the outcome of available treatment options. This lack of an integrated approach to the concept of PFD, stems from our inadequate understanding of its pathophysiology, and the traditional compartmentalisation of the pelvic floor. To improve our understanding of pelvic floor function, various investigative modalities have been employed but none of them has been able to offer sufficient explanation in this regard. There also exist difficulties with the establishment of objective parameters, which can be used in evaluating patients? response to therapy for PFD. The present situation where a response to treatment is based principally on the <b>patients?</b> <b>perceived</b> improvement, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be reviewed...|$|R

50|$|First, {{the growth}} of the slowing action causes growth of the <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> for {{investment}} (e.g. building additional manufacturing capacity). Another factor that can positively contribute <b>to</b> the <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> invest is the failure to uphold the performance standard (for example manufacturing error rate). The <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> invest positively translates into actually making the investment. The investment made then negatively influences the slowing action (e.g. removal of capacity limits).|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{fat intake}} has {{been implicated in}} the {{causation}} of major diseases including coronary heart disease and cancer. Hence, current recommendations to improve health emphasise the reduction of fat intake (COMA, 1991). The present study investigated the effect of <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reduce fat intake and past behaviour on peoples' expectations of reducing fat intake, using {{the framework of the}} Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985; 1991). The effects of estimated fat intake and body weight on <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reduce were also investigated. One hundred and fifty-two adults completed a four-day weighed dietary record and completed a questionnaire based on the TPB. <b>Perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reduce fat intake, cognitive and affective components of attitude and past behaviour were found to be significant predictors of expectation of reducing fat intake. Perceived body weight and estimated fat intake were significant predictors of <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reduce fat intake.

40|$|Abstract Background Increased {{physical}} activity is {{a cornerstone of}} type 2 diabetes prevention. The perception of a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change is considered essential in behaviour change processes. However, the existing literature on individuals’ <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change health behaviour is limited. In order to improve understanding of diabetes prevention through increased {{physical activity}} levels (PAL), we assessed factors associated with <b>perceiving</b> a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase PAL among adults {{at high risk of}} diabetes. Methods Opportunistic screening was used within a primary-care based lifestyle intervention covering 10 149 men and women at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Data were obtained at baseline visits. The explored determinants were demographic, anthropometric/clinical, behavioural and psychosocial characteristics, along with four categories of PAL awareness. Logistic regression was used in the analysis. Results 74 % of men (n[*]=[*] 2 577) and 76 % of women (n[*]=[*] 4 551) <b>perceived</b> a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase their PAL. The participants most likely <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> this <b>need</b> were inactive, had a larger waist circumference, rated their PAL as insufficient, and were at the contemplation stage of change. Smoking, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, and a family history of diabetes were not associated with this perception. The likelihood was also greater among women with less perceived fitness and less education. Demographic factors other than education did not determine participants’ <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase PAL. PAL overestimators were less likely <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase their PAL than realistic inactive participants. Conclusions Subjective rather than objective health factors appear to determine the perception of a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase PAL among adults at high risk of diabetes. Client perceptions <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be evaluated in health counselling in order to facilitate a change in PAL. Practical descriptions of the associations between metabolic risk factors, PAL, and diabetes are <b>needed</b> in order <b>to</b> make the risk factors concrete for at-risk individuals. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Two of {{the major}} factors leading up to China's {{eventual}} conflicts with Indian troops were India's stance on the disputed borders and perceived Indian subversion in Tibet. There was [...] "a <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet". The other was [...] "a <b>perceived</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border". John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based {{on the state of}} the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason for China's going to war. However, he argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be [...] "substantially accurate".|$|R
