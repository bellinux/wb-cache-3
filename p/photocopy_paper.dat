40|$|Abstract There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in management of MSW through micro-treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) in many cities of India. The OFMSW fraction is high (> 80 %) in many pockets within South Indian cities like Bangalore, Chikkamagalur, etc. and is largely represented by vegetable, fruit, packing and garden wastes. Among these, the last three have shown problems for easy decomposition. Fruit wastes are characterized by a large pectin supported fraction that decomposes quickly to organic acids (becomes pulpy) that eventually slow down anaerobic and aerobic decomposition processes.

50|$|Until December 2007 the {{technology}} behind {{the process of}} preparing each issue was unsatisfactory. Due to lack of funds, each page was prepared by hand; the infrastructure installed in the newspaper's office consisted of a 486 microprocessor-based PC, an inkjet printer and one photocopy machine. Text was written and printed, and then cut in a rectangle shape of physical width matching that of the newspaper's column. All the rectangles assembling the final columns would then be glued to a thin sheet A2 sized paper which would be photocopied and become the master copy for that page. The process would be repeated {{for each of the}} four daily pages of the newspaper, which would then be outsourced to a modern printing facility to be photographed and printed using a photo-offset printing method. Because of the use of <b>photocopy</b> <b>paper</b> (as opposed to using a film), the resulting contrast was too poor to allow any detail to be seen in photographs, thus banning them from the final print. After December 2007 and because of the widespread access to technology the newspaper's budget allowed the renewal of the equipment, and it is now being issued using modern digital methods.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the enzymatic deinking of various types of waste paper. Studies on the optimization of enzymatic deinking have been performed previously using commercially available enzyme preparations containing cellulase and hemicellulase. The enzymatic deinking of different types of waste paper demonstrated a high efficiency of 86. 6 % on laser-printed paper, but a low deinking efficiency of 12. 9 % was obtained with newspaper. All enzymatic treatments significantly improved the drainage rate of the deinked waste paper. Enzymatic deinking increased the tensile index of magazine paper but reduced the tensile index of bubble jet-printed paper, <b>photocopy</b> <b>paper</b> and newspaper. Enzymatic hydrolysis caused a 21. 1 % reduction in the tear index for bubble jet-printed paper, but a 3. 1 % increase in the tear index was obtained for laser-printed paper relative to respective blank. In addition, enzymatic hydrolysis increased the burst index by 4. 7 % relative to blank for laser-printed paper. However, <b>photocopy</b> <b>paper</b> showed the highest reduction (8. 3 %) in the burst index relative to blank. Taken together, these results suggest that enzymatic hydrolysis is both advantageous and detrimental to the mechanical properties of deinked paper. Thus, the proper regulation of enzymatic hydrolysis is crucial to improve the quality of recycled paper...|$|E

The presence of all components was found to be desirable for distinguishable development of fingerprint detail.

40|$|Evidence {{of reality}} {{had never been}} as {{pressing}} as in this slip toward disappearance’ (1) ‘At certain times {{it seemed to me}} this transparency was the only solid ground that remained to me, and, if I went forward, it was by resting on my own image thus reflected, while this reflection was perpetuated to infinity, indifferent to the ruins of time. A reflection that had no doubt attracted me by its fragility. The assurance that in resting on it, I would inevitably fall fast, but the fall was infinite, at each moment of the fall the reflection formed again under my steps indestructible’ (1) Scapelands is a reflection of sorts, where anomalies of spaces within the site have been studied, debated and in turn amplified, expanded upon and even imploded. Process-led and rule based Burgoyne is extending his exploration of repetition, duration and accumulation through drawing in the broadest sense. Scapelands is a term given by J. F Lyotard to suggest estrangement from a place, as though one is alien to it, the known of landscape becomes unknown. From <b>Photocopy</b> <b>paper,</b> dry-board markers to highlighters, the ubiquitous media of the office slides from a functional logic and clarity to another whilst paradoxically still bearing order and logic albeit of another kind. In doing so, magnify formal credentials of weight, colour and line. Scapelands pushes body and site relations proposing we re-negotiate generic space and enter a new and transformative dialogue with space that may both alienate yet offer greater potential than otherwise exists. Scapelands offers three propositions to navigate. Awkward concentrations of paper, both comical and absurd through process and rules have established themselves at odds with the seemingly clear geometry of the gallery site, having collapsed perhaps the very symmetries of the space. In doing so, pull together an infinite potential of space from a finite and bound sense of place. These rolled spaces are complemented by wall drawings at key points within this long narrow space. The wall works as schematic and playful games seek to debate the space we think we know with a reactivated space we might be now encountering. These, like all Burgoyne’s works, he sees as propositions only completed or brought into being as a context they are in, through what Deleuze calls their multiple entry and exit points of interpretation and representation. As drawings be they volumetric or spacial they aim to advance the notion of becoming where drawing and meaning is in constant transformation or as Jean Luc Nancy calls 'a truth [...] . showing the infinity of becoming visible; the movement through which appearance is possible cannot be finished thus it is about showing what does not show itself' (2). Absurd and ridiculous as it maybe, Scapelands is engaged in the serious play of drawing as it grapples with process and idea, thinking, body and space. Through markmaking, endurance and a tactile rapport with space, Scapelands is a contingent and speculative re-appraisal of limits and all that is fixed. Through gallery 2 the starting point was the irregularities of 2 doors- 1 whole, full, the other divided by a wall, part blocked – a space disunited from its forming. Burgoyne sought to bring this form/space anomaly together not represent it. Through rules of measurement and process he was keen to offer up an afterimage through an accumulation of experience of the markmaking, generate in one's mind the space lost. Highlighters draw our attention to things, the text we read, and an aide-memoire no less. In calculating the number of pairs of post-it notes required to make up the lost space Burgoyne offers a fugitive experience of the tension between the temporal and stable-that which exists but cannot be seen. The result both mentally and physically sees walls and floor shift in competing flux as one moves in and around the space. Indeed only in closing our eyes might we momentarily see the space lost. Scapelands is drawing as a reality of disappearance where neither inside nor outside may prevail. (1) Celui qui ne m’accompagnait pas / The one who was standing apart from me Blanchot.
