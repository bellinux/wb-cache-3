50|$|<b>Prurigo</b> <b>simplex</b> is a chronic, itchy, {{idiopathic}} {{skin condition}} characterized by extremely itchy skin nodules and lesions. Typically, {{there is no}} known direct cause of <b>prurigo</b> <b>simplex,</b> but some factors are known to trigger or aggravate it. This condition falls between chronic and acute, sometimes transitioning into a chronic condition. Many people experience a recurrence of the condition after periods of remission. Middle-aged patients are the most prone age group to this condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>prurigo</b> <b>simplex</b> {{symptoms}} are skin nodules resembling insect bites that are intensely itchy. These nodules are frequently scratched open, becoming lesions {{that continue to}} itch. Sometimes the skin thickens and becomes discolored around the nodules. The scalp, arms, legs and trunk of the body are the most frequent sites of the bumps and lesions. Itching can become severe and habitual, worsening the condition and possibly causing infections in the open sores.|$|E
50|$|The bites tend to {{be grouped}} {{together}} due to the piecemeal feeding behavior of these mites. They can occur anywhere on the body though commonly on the neck, head, extremities, abdomen and chest. The papules are generally 1 to 4 mm in diameter and sometimes vesicles appear. The symptoms of this disease are common or at least mistakable for many things that should be checked for as well in differential diagnosis such as <b>prurigo</b> <b>simplex,</b> allergies, mosquito or other insect bites, bacterial folliculitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, scabies, and pediculosis. Identification of the mite itself is required for definitive diagnosis. This can be collected by laying cellophane tape or “Sticky cards” (cardboard cards with a glue surface) in the area believed to be infested with the mite. A biopsy of the lesions only shows superficial and mid-dermal perivascular infiltrates and occasionally eosinophils. This method is so nonspecific as to be inconclusive in diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Background : Psoriasiform {{dermatitis}} is a frequently encountered terminology in a {{wide variety}} of inflammatory dermatoses. It often poses challenges to both dermatologists and pathologists alike. Clinical features when considered alone may not be reliable, as they vary with both disease duration and treatment. On the contrary, histopathological material constitutes definite hard evidence, which can be preserved and will continue to be available for future review. The objective of the study is to study the histopathological findings in Psoriasiform dermatitis. Materials and Methods : This is a retrospective study in a tertiary care centre in Kerala, South India. All cases diagnosed as Psoriasis or mentioned as one of the differential diagnosis were included. The material included 66 skin biopsies. Patients with a previous diagnosis of the same were excluded from the study. Results : The lesions comprised 9 % of the total number of skin biopsies. The age distribution pattern revealed that the highest percentage was in the 41 - 60 year age group (50 %) with a male preponderance of 65 %. Psoriasis was the most common lesion (60. 60 %) and Lichen simplex chronicus was the second most common lesion (10. 60 %), encountered in the study. Conclusion : Some of the histopathological features are specific and characteristic for each entity like Psoriasis, Pityriasis rubra pilaris, Pityriasis rosea and Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus whereas some overlap in lesions like <b>Prurigo</b> nodularis, Lichen <b>simplex</b> chronicus and Allergic contact dermatitis. Hence, combination of proper clinical observation and histopathological study will give a conclusive diagnosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pruritic papular eruptions (PPE) {{are common}} {{cutaneous}} manifestations in HIV-infected patients. Their frequencies, patterns and associated factors vary from region to region. There {{is no clear}} consensus on the etiology of PPE, the exact spectrum of the condition, the pathologic findings, or treatment. The present study is aimed at documenting the histopathological patterns of PPE, and their relation with CD 4, CD 8 counts in HIV-infected patients. Materials and Methods: The present study lasted for 12 months (September 2005 to August 2006). After informed consent, data on skin disorders, HIV status, CD 4 and CD 8 counts were obtained by physical examination and laboratory methods. Results: Of the 36 HIV-infected patients with clinical diagnosis of PPE, the most common histopathological patterns were <b>prurigo</b> <b>simplex</b> and eosinophilic folliculitis. The mean CD 4 count of PPE was 186. 49 cells/mm 3 with mean CD 8 count of 619. 60 cells/ mm 3, and the CD 4 :CD 8 ratio was 0. 32. Patients with <b>prurigo</b> <b>simplex</b> had significantly lower mean CD 4 counts (50. 36 &#x 00 B 1; 30. 67 cells/cmm 3, P < 0. 001) while in eosinophilic folliculitis, the mean CD 8 counts were higher (1239. 77 &#x 00 B 1; 402. 30 cells/cmm 3). Conclusion: We conclude that histopathology helps in specifying the pattern of PPE and also indicates underlying immunosuppression and can be a marker of advanced HIV infection. Thus, correlation between the histopathology and immunology findings helps to know the disease process...|$|E
