40|$|Background Family work {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{researched}} psychosocial interventions for patients with chronic psychosis. However, family work is less studied for patients with a first episode psychosis and the studies have revealed contradicting results. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined qualitatively group leaders’ experiences with family work. In the present study we wanted to explore challenges faced by mental health professionals working as group leaders for family interventions with first episode psychosis patients. Method A qualitative exploratory study was carried out based on digitally recorded in-depth interviews and a focus group interview with nine experienced mental health professionals. The interviews were transcribed in a slightly modified verbatim mode and analysed by systematic text condensation. Results Challenges faced by group leaders was classified into six categories: (1) Motivating patients to participate, encouraging potential <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> <b>demanding</b> and time-consuming; (2) Selecting participants by identifying those who can form a functional group and benefit from the intervention; (3) Choosing group format to determine whether a single or multi-family group is best for the participants; (4) Preserving patient independence, while also encouraging them to participate in the intervention; (5) Adherence to the protocol, while customizing adjustments as needed; (6) Fostering good problem-solving by creating a fertile learning environment and choosing the most appropriate problem to solve. Conclusions Group leaders face challenges related to recruitment and selection of participants for family work, as well as in conducting sessions. Awareness of these challenges could help health professionals more specifically to tailor the intervention to the specific needs of patients and their families...|$|R

However, {{in cases where the}} individual has previously engaged in the behavior the message also contains an implicit message of blame. To date, no experimental studies have been conducted to separate the influence of these two messages. The current study examined the impact of message characteristics on health cognitions related to binge drinking. The primary goal was to investigate the role of blame for previous excessive consumption and demand for future behavior change on health cognitions related to binge drinking. A secondary goal was to examine self-esteem as a moderator of the reactions to the messages. Participants completed initial measures of binge drinking behavior and self-esteem in an earlier mass-testing session. Specifically 178 undergraduates who reported frequently engaging in binge drinking behavior were assigned to either a blame or absolution message concerning past behavior followed by either a demand to change behavior or a suggestion to change future behavior. It was predicted that self-esteem would moderate the reactions to the messages such that participants with high self-esteem in the blame for past behavior and demand to change future behavior would exhibit the strongest amount of defensiveness (e. g., higher intentions to drink, higher willingness to drink, lower perceptions of vulnerability to liver damage). Results indicated that <b>participants</b> who <b>were</b> <b>demanded</b> to change their behavior reported lower intentions to binge drink than <b>were</b> <b>participants</b> who <b>were</b> suggested to change their behavior. Moreover, women with high self-esteem who were blamed for their past behavior and presented with a weak change message reported the highest willingness to binge drink. It is clear that both messages are impactful and more research is necessary to identify conditions that are likely to result in compliant and defensive cognitions concerning behavior change...|$|R

40|$|Countering {{claims that}} recency effects {{observed}} at different time scales arise {{from a common}} forgetting process, Davelaar et al. (2005) presented a number of experimental dissociations between short- and long-term recency. They used these dissociations to argue that separate mechanisms underlie short- and long-term recency. Here we show that the temporal context model (TCM), which assumes that both short- and long-term recency arise from the same contextual drift process, can account for the major recency dissociations at different time scales. Our version of TCM, which includes the Usher and McClelland (2001) leaky-accumulator model as a retrieval rule, captures the dynamics of immediate, delayed, and continual distractor free recall, and shows that dissociations between short- and long-term recency naturally arise from a model that uses an internal contextual state as the sole cue for retrieval across time scales. Davelaar, Goshen-Gottstein, Ashkenazi, Haarmann, and Usher (2005) recently argued that separate short-term and long-term memory mechanisms underlie the recall advantage for recently experienced items (i. e., the recency effect) when it is observed at shorter versus longer time scales. Specifically, they highlight several striking differences between the recency effects observed in immediate free recall (IFR) and continual-distractor free recall (CDFR). In IFR, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> asked to recall the list items, in any order, immediately following the last item presentation. In CDFR, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> given a <b>demanding</b> distractor task following each list item. After the last period of distraction {{they are asked to}} recall the items in any order (see Figure 1 for a graphical description of the free recall tasks).

Using a novel electronic approach, the Nurses and Midwives e-cohort Study (NMeS) aims to investigate longitudinally Australian and New Zealand nurses' and midwives' work/life balance and health. This paper describes NMeS participation; provides key baseline demographic, workforce and health indicators; compares these baseline descriptions with external norms; and assesses the feasibility of the electronic approach. Methods: From 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2008, nurses in Australia and New Zealand, and midwives in Australia were invited to participate. Potential <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> directed to a purpose-built NMeS Internet site, where study information was provided and consent sought. Once obtained, a range of standardized tools combined into one comprehensive electronic questionnaire was elicited. Results: Overall, 7633 (2. 3 %) eligible nurses and midwives participated (6308 from Australia and 1325 from New Zealand) from a total pool of 334 400. Age, gender, occupational and health profiles were similar between countries and to national figures.

40|$|Takaful is the Islamic {{counterpart}} of conventional insurance, where {{it relies on}} a combination of tabarru (donation) and agency or profit-sharing. The takaful fund is considered a musharaka (partnership) among participants (policyholders). The relationship between the takaful operator and participants’ fund is based on either wakala contracts to manage the underwriting activities, and/or a mudaraba contracts to manage the underwriting or investment activities. Participants (Policyholders) in the takaful scheme are the main stakeholders; their equity consists of ownership of the underwriting activities and the investment funds. Participants’ relationship with Takaful Operators (TOs) depends on the percentage of the contributions premium they pay. They have a claim on assets of these funds in case of liquidation and they are entitled to have their claim paid if there is enough underwriting funds to finance payout; they are also entitled to share in the distribution of any investment and underwriting surplus. However, the only right that participants can exert on the takaful scheme is to disconnect their contractual relationship with the company in case of dissatisfactions. Participants’ undeserved rights might be due to management prioritizing interest towards shareholders as they are the main stewards of the takaful company. In other words, one of the main challenges faced in the takaful industry is shareholders and management discretions, power and activities due to the unclear structure of the takaful operational scheme. The Takaful operational scheme should follow the two-tier hybrid structure (mutual and proprietorship) as it has been identified by the prominent regulatory bodies such as AAOIFI and IFSB. However, almost all regulators, of which the Saud Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) is one, treat the TOs as a proprietorship, as it can be easily regulated and supervised which requires an identified share capital and shareholders. The main aim of this study, hence, is to recommend proper protection channels for participants, by conducting two parallel ways research, (i) exploring participants’ perceptions, knowledge, preferences and satisfactions levels about the service and products presented by the TOs in Saudi Arabia (ii) reviewing and comparing the current directives and laws imposed by the Saudi insurance regulatory authorities with the standards and polices imposed by the international insurance and takaful bodies. In fulfilling the aim of the study, primary data collection research was adopted through a survey questionnaire technique. The questionnaire was structured with 4 main dimensions (Disclosure, Knowledge, Preference and Satisfaction) with a total of 26 variables to cover the research objectives and themes. The survey questionnaire was distributed to 9 TOs in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 300 out of 500 returned questionnaires were complete and found fit for analysis purposes. The data were analysed using various statistical analysis techniques ranging from simple frequency distribution analysis to the more advanced analyses such as non-parametric statistical analysis, Spearman’s correlation and multinomial logistic regression. In general, {{the results of the study}} show that participants’ overall perceptions and knowledge on TOs services and products <b>is</b> low, while <b>participants</b> reported high overall preferences which implies that <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> <b>demanding</b> more services from the TOs as they have more wants and needs. In term of satisfaction levels, participants reported a weak to moderate satisfaction levels, as a result of participants’ low perception, weak knowledge and high preferences which was obvious from the significant relationship between participants perceptions, knowledge and preferences as independent variables with participants’ satisfaction levels as dependant variables. In other words, in order for the TOs to satisfy their participants, they need to disclose more detailed information about different sorts of financial returns (investment return and underwriting surplus), as <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> financially motivated and there is no effect at all for religious motivation. The results of reviewing and comparing SAMA with the international insurance and takaful bodies, indicated that SAMA did not implement directive laws that address the takaful business nor any directive that address Shari’ah issues. Accordingly, it is highly recommended that SAMA adopts the well-established Corporate Governance and Market Conduct & Disclosure standards and polices that have been set by the international bodies such as AAOIFI and IFSB for better protection for the takaful participants in Saudi Arabia. The results of the research have established effective instrumental tools to measure the desired environment that should be available for the perspective policyholders and participants for their ultimate protection. These tools are based on participants’ perceptions, knowledge, preferences and satisfaction levels and based on the country’s regulatory assessments to support and protect participants’ and policyholders’ rights in the takaful fund. ...|$|R
