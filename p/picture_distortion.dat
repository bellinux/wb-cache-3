Effects due to the pionic currents and intermediate creation are implemented. The impact of the distortions due to the interaction of the outgoing nucleon waves with the (A- 2) core is examined. Hadronic form factors are introduced to regularize the πNN vertices and the sensitivity of the cross section to the pion cut-off mass is examined. The relative contribution of the (γ,pp) and the (γ,pn) channel to the total photoabsorption strength is discussed. Further, the photon energy dependence of the (γ,pp) /(γ,pn) ratio is investigated.

30|$|As Fig.  3 c, d shows, {{the degree}} of distortions (for both {{distances}} and angles) distinctly depends {{on the type of}} doping and has no evident correlation with the adsorbent structure. Only the GR-und- 2 configuration does not conform to the tendency since it is characterized by far different adsorption geometry (see Fig.  2 and accompanying text). When the anions are adsorbed on the B-doped adsorbents, they undergo weaker distortions as compared to adsorption on undoped structures. In turn, the distortions become stronger when the anions are adsorbed on the N-doped carbon nanostructures.

40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} performances in the television receivers to reproduce a picture faithfully from the broadcasting signal. Usually, in the direct view type television receiver, there exists a problem that an original picture is distorted by the change of the horizontal width. This problem is caused by the voltage change of the high voltage source to supply the color picture tube (anode voltage of the picture tube) with brightness of the video signal. Many circuits have been proposed to improve this problem. However in the conventional circuit, the horizontal width distortion seems to be not always improved sufficiently. This paper presents a novel horizontal output circuit, which has a function to correct the horizontal width distortion without any side effects such as a voltage change in the low voltage sources. In the proposed circuit the <b>picture</b> <b>distortion</b> is improved to less than one fourth of that in the conventional circuit when the white peak video signal is received. 1...|$|E

The video frame quality in the spatial domain is, therefore, jointly determined by coding distortion and packet loss.

Our algorithm is based on Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion algorithm, but it is modified {{in the part of}} the threshold modulation to improve over-blurring of Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion algorithm. Since our algorithm changes the quantizer thresholds according to the structure information and random noise, it preserves the details in the textured region. Simultaneously, it also reduces visual artifacts of the original error diffusion in the uniform region. Unlike existing error diffusion algorithms, the proposed algorithm preserves fine texture very well even in low contrast images. Our algorithm has been tested on various types of images including low contrast images and shows visually pleasing results both in the textured region, and in the uniform region. Plasma Display Panels (PDPs) suffer from motion artifacts such as motion <b>picture</b> <b>distortion</b> (MPD). To reduce MPD, PDPs use the limited gray levels instead of the whole 256 gray levels. Therefore we need multitoning to represent the absent gray levels among the whole gray levels. We extend our algorithm for multitoning in PDP...|$|E

Analogue video signals contain a frequency content from 25 Hz up to around 5 MHz, and so variations in frequency responses will affect the picture in various ways, depending on whether it is high frequency (>1 MHz) or low frequency (<1 MHz) distortion. Low frequency distortion will cause field-rate impairment, manifesting itself as luminance variation between {{the top and bottom}} of a <b>picture.</b> High frequency <b>distortion</b> causes problems with sharpness of the picture: high frequency roll-off causes loss of definition, while high frequency peaking emphasises edges and adds noise to the picture.|$|R

This task is considerably more challenging than general front-view road detection, as the associated challenges widely range from low <b>picture</b> quality, fisheye <b>distortion</b> and large objects, to the ab-sence of useful priors such as vanishing points and road struc-ture.

Therefore, we propose a novel conditional random field (CRF) model which includes hidden states indicating confident nodes and propagate their confidence to neighboring nodes.

For any given bit rate and intra refreshing rate, {{this model is}} capable of estimating the corresponding coding distortion even before a video frame is coded. We then present a theoretical analysis of the <b>picture</b> <b>distortion</b> caused by channel errors and the subsequent inter-frame propagation. Based on this analysis, we develop a statistical model to estimate such channel errors induced distortion for different channel conditions and encoder settings. The proposed analytic model mathematically describes the complex behavior of channel errors in a video coding and transmission system. Unlike other experimental approaches for distortion estimation reported in the literature, this analytic model has very low computational complexity and implementation cost, which are highly desirable in wireless video applications. Simulation results show that this model is able to accurately estimate the channel errors induced distortion with a minimum delay in processing. Based on the proposed source coding R-D model and the analytic channel-distortion estimation, we derive an analytic solution for adaptive intra mode selection and joint source-channel rate control under time-varying wireless channel conditions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that this scheme significantly improves the end-to-end video quality in wireless video coding and transmission...|$|E
40|$|A {{subjective}} {{assessment method}} is described to determine picture quality {{levels in the}} supra-threshold region for processed images, with reference to their original counterparts, based on just-noticeable difference (JND) detection experiment.

The experimental data obtained also reveal that relationship of JND levels in the supra-threshold region and the MSE (mean squared error) can be approximated by a linear function whose slope is modeled as a function of edge and texture contrast masking factors. The model is devised to predict JND levels which provide subjective picture quality rating discernible by human viewers and can be used for visual quality regulated image/video coding, as well as evaluating the capacity of existing objective metrics in predicting <b>picture</b> quality and/or <b>distortion</b> relative to JND based quality/distortion rating categories...|$|R

In the &#x 27;energy&#x 27; <b>picture,</b> the average <b>distortion</b> between codon message and protein structure, under constraints driven by evolutionary selection, serves as a temperature analog, so that low values limit the possible distribution of protein forms, producing the canonical folding funnel. A dual &#x 27;developmental&#x 27; perspective sees the rate distortion function itself as the temperature analog, and permits incorporation of chaperons or toxic exposures as catalysts, driving the system to different possible outcomes or affecting the rate of convergence. The rate distortion function appears constrained by the availability of metabolic free energy, with implications for prebiotic evolution, and a nonequilibrium empirical Onsager treatment provides an adaptable statistical model that can be fitted to data, {{in the same manner as}} a regression equation. |$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{projected image}} Distortion in a cinema setting.

This paper concentrates on inherent distortion values that typically affect the overall shape of the picture area and the relative shapes of all subjects being viewed as well as the audience’s perception of imaged <b>picture</b> quality. Since <b>distortion</b> changes only the shape of objects in the picture and not how well the viewer can see them, there is little basis for objectively derived design limits. Further, when viewing a real scene that does not contain a perfect rectilinear test grid, the eye accommodates small amounts of distortion, which is therefore not perceived. However, moderate to severe amounts of distortion, and particularly distortion in memory objects such as curved horizons and leaning or curved flagpoles, is disturbing to viewers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we explore}} H. 264 /AVC {{operating}} in intraframe mode to compress a mixed image, i. e., composed of text, graphics, and pictures. Even though mixed contents (compound) documents usually {{require the use}} of multiple compressors, we apply a single compressor for both text and <b>pictures.</b> For that, <b>distortion</b> is taken into account differently between text and picture regions. Our approach is to use a segmentation-driven adaptation strategy to change the H. 264 /AVC quantization parameter on a macroblock by macroblock basis, i. e., we deviate bits from pictorial regions to text in order to keep text edges sharp. We show results of a segmentation driven quantizer adaptation method applied to compress documents. Our reconstructed images have better text sharpness compared to straight unadapted coding, at negligible visual losses on pictorial regions. Our results also highlight the fact that H. 264 /AVC-INTRA outperforms coders such as JPEG- 2000 as a single coder for compound images.

50|$|One {{criticism}} of the two-by-two technique commonly used is that the resulting matrix results in four somewhat arbitrary scenario themes. If other key uncertainties had been selected, it might be argued, very different scenarios could emerge. How true this is depends on whether the matrix is viewed as just a starting point to be superseded by the ensuing blueprint or is considered as the grand architecture that nests everything else. In either case, however, the issue should not be which are the “right” scenarios but rather whether they delineate the range of possible future appropriately. Any tool that tries to simplify a complex <b>picture</b> will introduce <b>distortions,</b> {{whether it is a}} geographic map or a set of scenarios. Seldom will complexity decompose naturally into simple states. But it might. Consider, for example, the behavior of water (the molecule H2O) which, depending on temperature and pressure, naturally exists in just one of three states: gas, liquid or ice. The art of scenarios is to look for such natural states or points of bifurcation in the behavior of a complex system.|$|R
40|$|Interplay of Pomeranchuk {{instability}} (spontaneous symmetry {{breaking of}} the Fermi surface) and d-wave superconductivity is studied for the repulsive Hubbard model on the square lattice with the dynamical mean field theory combined with the fluctuation exchange approximation (FLEX+DMFT). We show that the four-fold symmetric Fermi surface becomes unstable against a spontaneous distortion into two-fold near the van Hove filling, where the symmetry of superconductivity coexisting with the Pomeranchuk distorted Fermi surface is modified from the d-wave pairing to (d+s) -wave. By systematically shifting the position of van Hove filling with varied second- and third-neighbor hoppings, {{we find that the}} transition temperature T_ c^ PI of Pomeranchuk instability is more sensitively affected by the position of van Hove filling than the superconducting T_ c^ SC. This implies that the filling region for strong Pomeranchuk instability and that for strong superconducting fluctuations can be separated, and Pomeranchuk instability can appear even if the peak of T_c^ PI is lower than the peak of T_c^ SC. An interesting observation is that the Fermi surface distortion can enhance the superconducting T_ c^ SC in the overdoped regime, which is explained with a perturbation <b>picture</b> for small <b>distortions.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
