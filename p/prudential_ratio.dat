We address this issue by analyzing the performance of aggregate <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> in systemic banking crises, drawing upon a large cross-country dataset. We caution against sole reliance on these indicators, and advocate supplementing them with other tools and techniques. Nonetheless, our findings offer evidence that some of the ratios can help identify systemic banking problems. Financial soundness indicators Banking crises Macroprudential analysis...|$|R

When runs of withdrawals had threatened building societies in the 1970s they got together to form an Australia-wide National Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect depositors, with standby credit and minimum <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> for member societies to observe. The Victorian government of the time had chosen {{not to participate in}} that scheme, believing the government could regulate and supervise societies.|$|R
40|$|The Benin {{financial}} system is multi compartments. In this system, the classical banks have excluded from their funding objectives the activities concerning small, medium and micro-sized enterprises that {{are forced to}} resort to the microfinance institutions. The scale of this phenomenon {{has led to a}} tremendous increase of decentralised financing activities to the extent that monetary authorities have had to put up a regulatory framework. The analysis of the results of these regulations shows that despite the non respect of some ?<b>prudential</b> <b>ratios?</b> by these institutions (PAPME and PADME), their financial and organizational performance has not been adversely affected. In view of the very strong correlation between the sustainability and the profitability of these institutions, the strategy recommended would rather consist in removing the framing of the lending rates, in order to make these neighbourhood credit institutions more profitable. ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the {{microfinance}} institutions’ (MFIs’) efficiency in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) after the reforms that were undertaken in the industry. Given the complementary role between MFIs and banks (where MFIs reach the population that the banks cannot), we ask whether these reforms have promoted sustainability or outreach. For this purpose, we use a data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure the social efficiency {{on the one hand}} and the financial efficiency on the other hand. Our results show that sustainability prevails. Indeed, we observe an increase in financial efficiency at the expense of social and financial efficiency. MFIs that stress outreach tend to be less efficient, when one considers their intermediation role. Moreover, reforms have a negative impact on social efficiency and a positive impact on financial efficiency. Indeed, <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> and accounting standards that were implemented, led MFIs to privilege their intermediation role. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the main {{advantages}} and disadvantages of using the fair value method to value assets and liabilities and the potential macroeconomic impact of the application of the IAS standards to financial institutions. Although valuation at historical cost does not of course provide all of the information necessary to assess risk exposure, there are some major drawbacks to the comprehensive application of fair value accounting. This change in accounting procedures will affect the measurement of bank earnings and capital and will also impact <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios.</b> On the macroeconomic level, indiscriminate application of the fair value principle risks increasing the volatility of earnings and capital in the banking industry. This would decrease financial security, which would be contrary to the objective of accounting standard setters. Its application could amplify credit cycles and could also transfer interest-rate risk to non-financial economic agents and possibly even reduce the total volume of lending.

40|$|The {{adoption}} in Europe of IFRS international accounting standards, which became mandatory for listed companies beginning 1 January 2005, brings undeniable benefits, {{most notably in}} improving the comparability of published financial statements. However, {{the potential impact of}} the IFRS on the behaviour of credit institutions, and the financial system as a whole, raises concerns from the perspective of financial stability. The new standards’ increased reliance on “fair value” may increase the volatility of balance sheets and income statements, and some of that increase may be artificial. The standards also complicate the application of the risk management techniques commonly used by credit institutions, and they often depart significantly from the principle of prudence. These uncertainties regarding the effect of the IFRS on the behaviour of institutions are reinforced by the absence of a body of interpretation – still to be constructed – which can provide answers to questions raised in the practical application of the new standards. Finally, the discretion provided to institutions by the “fair value option” may ultimately hamper the comparability of their fi nancial statements. These issues take on all the more importance from the perspective of bank supervisors, given that the IFRS have a direct impact on the calculation of the <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> that {{play a central role in}} the supervision of credit institutions. The rapid rate of change in the international accounting framework makes it necessary for bank supervisors to remain watchful in this area, as regards in particular the potential introduction of a full fair value model. In response to these concerns, bank supervisors, working together at the international level, have developed a set of adjustments, referred to as “prudential filters”, which are designed to correct certain accounting values determined in accordance with the IFRS before they are used to calculate <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios.</b> The adoption of prudential filters does not, however, resolve all of the financial stability issues raised by the introduction of the IFRS. The coexistence of the international framework with national accounting standards can create problems, particularly when the different frameworks call for disparate treatments of the same transaction, as is currently the case for securitisation operations. This situation can complicate the operational management of banking groups, and can also introduce accounting distortions between institutions subjected to different accounting frameworks. Most seriously, it can encourage arbitrage between the different accounting frameworks. These considerations have led bank supervisors to disconnect the prudential treatment of certain banking operations from their accounting treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission's {{decision}} {{to require the}} use of IAS for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of listed companies is motivated by the desire to improve the comparability of financial statements and to achieve a level playing field. However, it raises a number of issues of principle, and some major practical difficulties. Looking beyond technical implementation issues, central bankers and regulators are faced with two crucial questions : - Are the standards sufficiently prudent in today's climate of economic uncertainty and mistrust of the markets, and will they address the shortcomings that have recently been revealed ? - Is there not a risk of the standards introducing artificial volatility into financial statements, impairing a proper understanding of the true position of economic agents and likely {{to have an impact on}} <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> ? This article looks at the main changes proposed by the IASB in the light of these two questions and tries to identify the prudential consequences of these modifications.

40|$|The core {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} encompasses the impacts, magnitudes and possible treatments of Sovereign Debt valued at Fair Value within financial institutions. The European Sovereign Debt Crisis had heavily affected {{the economic and}} financial environment and consequently, the banking sector is facing some challenges to handle it. The accounting treatment and classification of Sovereign Debt is under the scope of IAS 39 – Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurements. Considering this scenario, {{the purpose of the}} case is to understand the effect of the Greek Sovereign Debt crisis in the three most exposed French banks. Actually, the critical theme is to apprehend how each bank embraced the international accounting standards and the fair value concept in their financial statements. The different adoptions taken by banks are justified by the <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> that banks are compelled to achieve, under the strictly regulated banking environment. All in all, from my analysis and considering that the three banks are under the same supervisor, and from the same country, Greek Sovereign Debt was classified under three different captions and almost in its entirely according to internal models - Fair Value Level 3. Notwithstanding, the mark-to-market approach is indeed the best solution for the financial sector, but regulators and standards policies must unravel the current shortfalls, under more mandatory disclosures, guided and exhaustive standards and stricter capital requirements in order to restore market’s confidence and reach a healthy banking sector...|$|R

Currency mismatches in corporate balance sheets have been singled out as an important factor underlying the severity of recent financial crises. We propose several structural models for measuring default risk for firms with currency mismatches in their asset/liability structure. The proposed models can be adapted to different exchange rate regimes, are analytically tractable, and can be estimated using available equity price and balance sheet data. The paper provides a detailed explanation on how to calibrate the models and discusses two applications to financial surveillance: the measurement of systematic risk in the corporate sector and the estimation of <b>prudential</b> leverage <b>ratios</b> consistent with regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice to}} adopt {{risk-sensitive}} measurement approaches for operational risks: {{the case of}} Advanced Measurement Approach under Basel II New Capital Accord This paper investigates {{the choice of the}} operational risk approach under Basel II requirements and whether the adoption of advanced risk measurement approaches allows banks to save capital. Among the three possible approaches for operational risk measurement, the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) is the most sophisticated and requires the use of historical loss data, the application of statistical tools, and the engagement of a highly qualified staff. Our results provide evidence that the adoption of AMA is contingent on the availability of bank resources and prior experience in risk-sensitive operational risk measurement practices. Moreover, banks that choose AMA exhibit low requirements for capital and, as a result might gain a competitive advantage compared to banks that opt for less sophisticated approaches. - Internal Risk Controls and their Impact on Bank Solvency Recent cases in financial sector showed the importance of risk management controls on risk taking and firm performance. Despite advances in the design and implementation of risk management mechanisms, there is little research on their impact on behavior and performance of firms. Based on data from a sample of 88 banks covering the period between 2004 and 2010, we provide evidence that internal risk controls impact the solvency of banks. In addition, our results show that the level of internal risk controls leads to a higher degree of solvency in banks with a major shareholder in contrast to widely-held banks. However, the relationship between internal risk controls and bank solvency is negatively affected by BHC growth strategies and external restrictions on bank activities, while the higher regulatory requirements for bank capital moderates positively this relationship. - The Impact of the Sophistication of Risk Measurement Approaches under Basel II on Bank Holding Companies Value Previous research showed the importance of external regulation on banks' behavior. Some inefficient standards may accentuate risk-taking in banks and provoke a financial crisis. Despite the growing literature on the potential effects of Basel II rules, there is little empirical research on the efficiency of risk-sensitive capital measurement approaches and their impact on bank profitability and market valuation. Based on data from a sample of 66 banks covering the period between 2008 and 2010, we provide evidence that <b>prudential</b> <b>ratios</b> computed under Basel II standards predict the value of banks. However, this relation is contingent on the degree of sophistication of risk measurement approaches that banks apply. Capital ratios are effective in predicting bank market valuation when banks adopt the advanced approaches to compute the value of their risk-weighted assets...|$|R
