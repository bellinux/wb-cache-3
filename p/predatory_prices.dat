40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the market-driven {{economic}} philosophies of successive New Zealand governments have transformed {{the structure of the}} economy. These changes have established favourable market conditions for the success of a particular type of anticompetitive organisational behaviour, <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> From the mid 1950 s to the early 1980 s, economic analyses of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> theories frequently concluded that this behaviour constituted economically irrational behaviour. This conclusion generated a widespread scepticism among antitrust commentators, policymakers and judges towards the prevalence of such behaviour. Recently, however, the basis for this conclusion has been undermined by the application of Game Theory to <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> Game-theoretic analysis has proven that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is rational under a range of market conditions and consequently, issues regarding the need for prohibition and the optimal method of proscription have again become relevant. This research investigates the contemporary developments in economic and judicial analysis of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> in order to evaluate the efficacy of section 36 of the Commerce Act 1986 in prohibiting this behaviour. A comprehensive survey of the game-theoretic <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> models concludes that these models refute a number of well-known irrationality arguments and that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cannot be regarded as irrational organisational behaviour. Prominent standards proposed in the literature for the existence of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> are then shown to be deficient in light of the insights provided by the application of game theory. A critique of the most recent <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Justice of the European Economic Community and the Australian Full Federal Court is then conducted and it is found that the form and content of the standard for any jurisdiction must be dictated by the specific objectives of the competition law legislation. Finally, the research concludes that, in all but one respect, the current drafting and judicial interpretation of section 36 enables the section to be effective in proscribing those types of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> which are inimical to the attainment of the objectives of the Commerce Act...|$|R

40|$|The Standard Oil case {{continues}} to inform {{many aspects of}} current antitrust policy. Part of Standard Oil’s significance, however, has been lost over time. The Supreme Court condemned a range of conduct by the Standard Oil Company as anticompetitive, including <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> occurs when a firm prices its product below cost in order to drive its competitors from the market. Once enough rivals have exited the market, the predator raises price and earns stream of monopoly profits. In the decades following the opinion, the conventional wisdom held that Standard Oil had engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> The Standard Oil opinion stood for the proposition that using <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> to acquire or maintain a monopoly violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The opinion did not define the contours of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing,</b> neither explicitly saying that a <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> is a price below cost nor specifying what measure of cost courts should use. Nevertheless, the opinion {{laid the groundwork for}} future federal courts to address these questions and to provide more structure to the <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cause of action. Based on a revisionist history of Standard Oil written by John McGee in 1958 article, the new conventional wisdom now holds that the Standard Oil Company never engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> and that the case stands for the proposition that monopolists do not use below-cost pricing as a mechanism to acquire or maintain monopoly power. The article challenges McGee’s thesis. After exploring how McGee’s work has affected antitrust jurisprudence, this article challenges McGee’s interpretation of the trial record in Standard Oil, showing several instances where the data shows the Standard Oil Company charging a price below its costs. McGee often ignored or misinterpreted evidence inconsistent with his thesis that the Standard Oil Company never engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> Finally, despite claims that McGee’s work is empirical proof of the irrationality and nonexistence of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing,</b> this article shows that McGee’s work is theoretical, not empirical, and has had undue influence...|$|R
40|$|<b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> [...] a {{deliberate}} strategy of pricing aggressively {{in order to}} eliminate competitors [...] {{is one of the}} more contentious areas of antitrust policy and its existence and efficacy are widely debated. The purpose of this paper is to formally characterize <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> in a modern industry dynamics framework. We endogenize competitive advantage and industry structure through learning-by-doing. We first show that predation-like behavior arises routinely in our model. Equilibria involving predation-like behavior typically coexist with equilibria involving much less aggressive <b>pricing.</b> To disentangle <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> from mere competition for efficiency on a learning curve we next decompose the equilibrium pricing condition. Our decomposition provides us with a coherent and flexible way to develop alternative characterizations of a firm’s <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives, some of which are motivated by the existing literature while others are novel. We finally measure the impact of the <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives on industry structure, conduct, and performance. We show that forcing a firm to ignore these incentives in setting its price can have a large impact and that this impact stems from eliminating equilibria with predation-like behavior. Along with the predation-like behavior, however, a fair amount of competition for the market is eliminated. Overall, the distinction between <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> and pricing aggressively to pursue efficiency is closely related to the distinction between the advantage-building and advantage-denying motives that our decomposition of the equilibrium pricing condition isolates and measures. competition policy; industry dynamics; <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing...</b>|$|R

In the transatlantic comparison that accompanies the review, it has been observed that in the US, the tests for identifying anti-competitive single-firm conduct under Sec. 2 Sherman Act are frequently more narrowly construed than the tests applied in the EU under Art. 82 EC. A standard explanation for the divergence is an in-built regulatory tendency of EU competition law which is frequently ascribed to German ordoliberal influence – a theory supposedly antagonistic to sound economic analysis. This paper challenges this view.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of why making a catch-up is even more difficult in capital goods industries that are usually led by small or middle-sized companies. It relies upon the sectoral systems of innovation as a theoretical framework for analysis. From the findings, the paper has identified three sources of difficulties in the catch-up of the capital goods industry, particularly in machine tools. First, while small firms in the capital goods industry are usually specialized suppliers to big final goods assembly firms in the consumer goods industry or other industries, and thus the tacit knowledge accumulated from the interface between the producer and the customer firms is very important, a serious difficulty {{lies in the fact that}} local client firms are reluctant to use locally made capital goods due to their poor quality and low precision level. Second, while a successful catch-up first requires the ability to produce goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms from advanced countries, a typical difficulty arises because incumbent foreign firms often react by charging <b>predatory</b> <b>prices</b> upon news of the local development of capital goods by latecomers. Third, if the catch-up firms overcome this barrier, then the next strategy used by incumbent firms is to charge latecomers with legal actions for patent violations. Despite these intrinsic difficulties, the Korean economy has achieved a very slow but gradual catch-up in the capital goods industry. The paper has attributed such achievement to several factors, including the strenuous efforts of the government, niche markets in general-purpose machine tools and emerging economies, and finally, the increasing introduction and adoption of information technology (IT) or digital technologies in machine tools. Furthermore, the three sources of barriers to catch-up imply that any latecomer firms that wish to record a successful catch-up should have these barriers in mind from the beginning of the road towards catch-up. We observe that a successful catch-up requires the ability to produce goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms from advanced countries. After the initial success, they should also be well prepared against eventual or possible attacks by the incumbent firms in the forms of predatory pricing and intellectual property rights (IPR) charges.

40|$|<b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is a two-step {{strategy}} for securing monopoly profits. During {{the first step}} [...] the predation stage [...] a firm charges a price below its costs {{in the hope of}} driving its competitors out of the market by forcing them to sell at a loss as well. If it succeeds, the firm can proceed to the second step [...] the recoupment stage. After it has the market to itself, the now-dominant firm charges a monopoly price in an effort to recoup the losses it sustained in the predation stage and to earn a steady stream of monopoly profits into the future. <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> violates section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits the use of anticompetitive conduct to acquire or maintain monopoly power. <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is one form of anticompetitive conduct. Many judges and scholars, however, believe that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> does not occur because the two-step strategy combines significant up-front costs with a low probability of success. This skepticism has led courts to impose a recoupment element for section 2 <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> claims. The recoupment element requires an antitrust plaintiff bringing a <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> claim to prove that the defendant will be able to acquire monopoly power and to charge a monopoly price for long enough to make the whole scheme profitable. Antitrust liability becomes a function of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s profitability. This Article discusses the evolution of and rationale for the recoupment requirement. It shows how recoupment analysis by courts is often flawed, largely because judges incorrectly assume that market entry, which can prevent recoupment, is easy. This Article then illustrates the many ways in which recoupment can occur, including recoupment in other markets and recoupment through cartel or oligopoly pricing. Despite these various modes of recoupment, federal courts have sometimes structured the recoupment requirement {{in a way that is}} literally impossible to satisfy.

Bromkonvention retaliated by flooding the US market with below-cost bromine, at an even lower price than Dow's. However, Dow simply instructed his agents to buy up at the very low price and then sell it back in Germany at a profit but still lower than Bromkonvention's price.
