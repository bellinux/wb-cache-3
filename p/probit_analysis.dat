5000|$|The method {{introduced}} by Bliss was carried forward in <b>Probit</b> <b>Analysis,</b> an important text on toxicological applications by D. J. Finney. Values tabled by Finney {{can be derived}} from probits as defined here by adding a value of 5. This distinction is summarized by Collett (p. 55): [...] "The original definition of a probit 5 added was primarily to avoid having to work with negative probits; ... This definition is still used in some quarters, but in the major statistical software packages for what is referred to as <b>probit</b> <b>analysis,</b> probits are defined without the addition of 5." [...] It should be observed that probit methodology, including numerical optimization for fitting of probit functions, was introduced before widespread availability of electronic computing. When using tables, it was convenient to have probits uniformly positive. Common areas of application do not require positive probits.|$|E
40|$|Beginning in 1999, Curtis Signorino {{challenged}} {{the use of}} traditional logits and <b>probits</b> <b>analysis</b> for testing discrete-choice, strategic models. Signorino argues that the complex parametric relationships generated by even the simplest strategic models can lead to wildly inaccurate inferences if one applies these traditional approaches. In their stead, Signorino proposes generating stochastic formal models, from which one can directly derive a maxi-mum likelihood estimator. We propose a simpler, alternative methodology for theoretically and empirically accounting for strategic behavior. In particular, we propose carefully and correctly deriving one’s comparative statics from one’s formal model, whether it is stochastic or deterministic does not particularly matter, and using standard logit or probit estimation techniques to test the predictions. We demonstrate that this approach performs almost identically to Signorino’s more complex suggestion. ...|$|R

50|$|In statistics, ordered probit is a {{generalization}} of the widely used <b>probit</b> <b>analysis</b> {{to the case}} of more than two outcomes of an ordinal dependent variable (a dependent variable for which the potential values have a natural ordering, as in poor, fair, good, excellent). Similarly, the widely used logit method also has a counterpart ordered logit. Ordered probit, like ordered logit, is a particular method of ordinal regression.|$|E
5000|$|A 1999 RAND report {{funded by}} the U.S. Air Force (USAF) [...] "explored the role of air power as a coercive instrument", {{attempting}} to rebut Pape's claim. [...] They concluded that, [...] "Although the United States and the USAF have scored some notable successes, the record is mixed." [...] Horowitz and Reiter applied [...] "multivariate <b>probit</b> <b>analysis</b> to all instances of air power coercion from 1917 to 1999". Their quantitative analyses essentially matched Pape's qualitative assessment that attacking military targets has improved the chances of success, but [...] "higher levels of civilian vulnerability {{have no effect on}} the chances of coercion success".|$|E
5000|$|The psychometric {{function}} is an inferential model applied in detection and discrimination tasks. It models {{the relationship between}} a given feature of the physical stimulus, e.g. velocity, duration, brightness, weight etc., and the forced-choice responses of the subject. The psychometric {{function is}} a specific application of the generalized linear model (GLM) to psychophysical data. The probability of response is related to a linear combine of predictors by means of a sigmoid link function (e.g. probit, logit, etc.). Depending on the number of choices, the psychophysical experimental paradigms classify as simple forced choice (also known as yes-no task), two-alternative forced choice (2AFC), and n-alternative forced choice. The number of alternatives in the experiment determine the lower asymptote of the function. Two different types of psychometric plots are in common use. One plots the percentage of correct responses (or a similar value) displayed on the y-axis and the physical parameter on the x-axis. If the stimulus parameter is very far towards one end of its possible range, the person will always be able to respond correctly. Towards {{the other end of the}} range, the person never perceives the stimulus properly and therefore the probability of correct responses is at chance level. In between, there is a transition range where the subject has an above-chance rate of correct responses, but does not always respond correctly. The inflection point of the sigmoid function or the point at which the function reaches the middle between the chance level and 100% is usually taken as sensory threshold. The second type plots the proportion of [...] "yes" [...] responses on the y-axis, and therefore will have a sigmoidal shape covering the range 1, rather than merely 1, and we move from a subject being certain that the stimulus was not of the particular type requested to certainty that it was. This second way of plotting psychometric functions is often preferable, as it is more easily amenable to principled quantitative analysis using tools such as <b>probit</b> <b>analysis</b> (fitting of cumulative Gaussian distributions). However, it also has important drawbacks. First, the threshold estimation is based only on p(yes), namely on [...] "Hit" [...] in Signal Detection Theory terminology. Second, and consequently, it is not bias free or criterion free. Third, the threshold is identified with the p(yes) = [...]5, which is just a conventional and arbitrary choice.|$|E

40|$|With {{computer}} simulations, {{we examined}} {{the performance of the}} Spearman–Kärber method for analyzing psychometric functions and compared this method with the standard technique of <b>probit</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Spearman–Kärber method was found to be superior in most cases. It generally yielded less biased and less variable estimates of the location and dispersion of a psychometric function, and it provided more power to detect differences in these parameters across experimental conditions. Moreover, the Spearman– Kärber method provided information about the skewness and higher moments of psychometric functions that {{is beyond the scope of}} <b>probit</b> <b>analysis.</b> These advantages of the Spearman–Kärber method suggest that it should often be used in preference to <b>probit</b> <b>analysis</b> for the analysis of observed psychometric functions. One of the most important tools in psychophysics is the psychometric function. This function can be used to estimate both absolute thresholds and difference limens (dls) (e. g., Gescheider, 1997; Woodworth & Schlosberg, 1954), and it is also sometimes used to test specific psychophysical models (e. g., Falmagne, 1985; Sternberg & Knoll, 1973).
