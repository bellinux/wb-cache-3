Hillenburg dedicated {{the film to}} him: [...] "He truly was the most influential artistic <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I consider him my 'Art Dad.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{told her}} parents {{that she would}} try acting for a few years, and if that failed, return to school. Reflecting on {{forgoing}} university, Oh said: [...] "I’m the only <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> family who doesn’t have a master's in something." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Jenny was {{gambling}} in Cannes one evening, Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness saw her and remarked, [...] "I {{have never seen}} so many jewels on any one <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. Her bracelets reached almost to her elbows. The necklace she wore must have cost a king's ransom, and the ring on her right hand was the size of an ice cube." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{has stated}} that despite his blood {{relationship}} with his father Mike, his stepfather Bill Leonard had far more of an impact on his life. Wallace said that Leonard was [...] "the single most important <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] Wallace first developed a relationship with his father in his teens, after his older brother Peter died in 1962 climbing a mountain in Greece.|$|E
2500|$|They {{separated}} on 5 August 1972. It is {{not clear}} what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O P Nayyar once said, [...] "I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened that upset me, so I left her." [...] Nevertheless, he also said [...] "...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that the most important <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met." ...|$|E
2500|$|He asked Mather to be {{his studio}} assistant, {{and for the next}} decade they worked closely together, making {{individual}} and jointly signed portraits of such luminaries as Carl Sandburg and Max Eastman. A joint exhibition of their work in 2001 revealed that during this period Weston emulated Mather's style and, later, her choice of subjects. On her own Mather photographed [...] "fans, hands, eggs, melons, waves, bathroom fixtures, seashells and birds wings, all subjects that Weston would also explore." [...] A decade later he described her as [...] "the first important <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, and perhaps even now, though personal contact has gone, the most important." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must be aware," [...] {{pursued the}} magistrate, [...] "that <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{situation}} are often obliged to make painful and disagreeable inquiries of individuals, merely {{because it is}} their bounden duty." ...|$|R

2500|$|The demonstrations raised {{questions}} for Harvard students {{about their own}} role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called [...] "1%". Even participants struggled {{with the question of}} how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world. Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers." [...] One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the Boston Globe that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: [...] "I’m the first <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> family to go to college, and I worked hard to go to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’" [...] Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting [...] "We are the one percent" [...] and yelling insults.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, [...] "I {{did not say}} she was innocent" [...] and [...] "I {{just said}} {{there was not enough}} evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot {{determine}} what the punishment should be." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," [...] but that [...] "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" [...] via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was [...] "dishonest." [...] She said the jury [...] "was sick to [...] stomachs to get [...] verdict" [...] and that the decision process overwhelmed them {{to the point where they}} did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that [...] "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [...] was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: [...] "I just swear to God... I wish we had more evidence to put her away. I truly do... But it wasn't there." [...] He also said that Anthony was [...] "not a good <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed [...] "so long as the opportunities are paid".|$|E

"Indeed, sir, as a {{time may}} soon come {{for me to go}} upon Pilgrimage, I am desirous to note what is {{commonly}} done by <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> case, and where are the ugliest Sloughs and Thickets on the Road; as also, what manner of Staff is of the best service. Moreover, I lie here, by this water, to learn by root-of-heart a lesson which my master teaches me to call Peace, or Contentment." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stood and}} looked through the grating at my new secretary. I am not {{generally}} a diffident man, and have never been so with <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> employment; but now, I must admit, I did not feel at my ease. The nun sat perfectly motionless; her hands were folded in her gray lap, and her gray bonnet was slightly bowed, so that I {{did not know whether}} she was gazing down at the table or out of the window.|$|R

60|$|I did {{not choose}} to repeat the question, and perhaps provoke an impertinent reply. It was in every respect more {{becoming}} to a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> position to present myself immediately in Lady Glyde's room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Biggs or Briggs, madam, {{it is not}} of the {{slightest}} consequence. I presume that <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rank of life are not expected to know everybody's name in Magdeburg Square?" [...] (Lady Gorgon had a house in Baker Street, and a dismal house it was.) [...] "NOT here," [...] continued she, rightly interpreting Lucy's silence, [...] "NOT here?--and may I ask how long is it that young ladies have been allowed to walk abroad without chaperons, and to--to take a part in such scenes as that which we have just seen acted?" ...|$|R
60|$|My first {{proceeding}} was {{to avail}} myself {{of the sublime}} devotion of my wife. I had arranged with Mrs. Clements that she should communicate her London address, in Anne's interests, to Lady Glyde. But this was not enough. Designing <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> absence might shake the simple confidence of Mrs. Clements, and she might not write after all. Who could I find capable of travelling to London by the train she travelled by, and of privately seeing her home? I asked myself this question. The conjugal part of me immediately answered--Madame Fosco.|$|R
5000|$|Throuhgout the relationship, Britten and Scherchen corresponded. [...] "The one <b>person</b> {{constantly}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts and}} on my mind without fail was you. No one else occupied my heart, my mind or my body,” wrote Scherchen to Britten in 1941.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} think it was a delusion," [...] he answered. [...] "You ought not to {{interpret}} too literally what a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dreadful situation may say. The stain of another man's blood is on me--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You need have no fear, Meekins," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{am quite}} sure that you are mistaken. I think that Mr. Dunster is {{incapable}} of any act of violence towards a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> unfortunate position. I am willing to trust myself with him--perfectly willing, Meekins." ...|$|E
60|$|One thing, however, I did do, {{and that}} was to make a note of Mr. Chris Holtzmann's address. He was the man Stumpy had written to just {{previous}} to the robbery, and he was perhaps one of the <b>persons</b> concerned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> father's downfall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] I replied, in as dry a {{monotone}} as I could assume, [...] "I {{was kidnapped}} by the connivance of some unscrupulous <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> colony, who had designs upon my grandfather's fortune. I was taken abroad in a slaver and carried {{down to the}} Caribbean seas, when I soon discovered that the captain and his crew were nothing less than pirates. For one day all hands got into a beastly state of drunkenness, and the captain raised the skull and cross-bones, which he had handy in his chest. I was forced to climb the main rigging in order to escape being hacked to pieces." ...|$|R
