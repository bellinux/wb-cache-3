40|$|ABSTRACT: Room-temperature {{dehydration}} of aqueous coal slurries, {{coal extraction}} residue, or coal ash results in spontaneous l minescence. The phenomenon {{is characterized by}} a monotonic decay in photon activity which precedes a harp rise in <b>photon</b> <b>release.</b> A maximum is reached within several minutes but subsequent decay isslower and photon emission continues {{for an extended period of}} time. The magnitude ofphoton activity is severely imited by the thickness of the strongly absorbing coal slurry. Prior removal of mineral matter f om the coal appears to curtail the dehydration-induced phenomena, suggesting that clays or clay-organic interactions are responsible. Data also suggest that air is required as a medium for discharging the excited species. Pioneering work by Coyne et al. (1981 a,b, 1984) has demonstrated that luminescence is induced in clay minerals during dehydration at room temperature with mild heating, and with displacement ofwater by amine solvents. These studies proposed that <b>photon</b> <b>release,</b> which was often observed as a delayed burst of light, was related to stresses generated within the crystal structure of the various clay minerals.

40|$|Recent {{simulations}} on super-Eddington accretion flows {{have shown}} that, {{apart from the}} diffusion process, the vertical advection based on magnetic buoyancy can be a more efficient process to <b>release</b> the trapped <b>photons</b> in the optically thick disk. As a consequence, the radiative luminosity from the accretion disk can be far beyond the Eddington value. Following this spirit, we revisit the structure and radiation of hyper-accretion disks with mass accretion rates in the range 10 ^- 3 ∼ 10 M_ s^- 1. Our results show that, due to the strong cooling through the vertical advection, the disk temperature becomes lower than that in the classic model without the vertical advection process, and therefore the neutrino luminosity from the disk is lower. On the other hand, the gamma-ray <b>photons</b> <b>released</b> through the vertical advection can be extremely super-Eddington.

50|$|The sun's rays {{can be used}} {{to produce}} {{electrical}} energy. The direct user of sunlight is the solar cell or photovoltaic cell, which converts sunlight directly into electrical energy without the incorporation of a mechanical device. This technology is simpler than the fossil-fuel-driven systems of producing electrical energy. A solar cell is formed by a light-sensitive p-n junction semiconductor, which when exposed to sunlight is excited to conduction by the photons in light. When light, in the form of photons, hits the cell and strikes an atom, photo-ionisation creates electron-hole pairs. The electrostatic field causes separation of these pairs, establishing an electromotive force in the process. The electric field sends the electron to the p-type material, and the hole to the n-type material. If an external current path is provided, electrical energy will be available to do work. The electron flow provides the current, and the cell's electric field creates the voltage. With both current and voltage the silicon cell has power. The greater the amount of light falling on the cell's surface, the greater is the probability of <b>photons</b> <b>releasing</b> electrons, and hence more electric energy is produced.|$|R

We follow the evolving H II region within the gas density field from a cosmological simulation of primordial star formation. The H II region evolves a ``champagne flow,'' once the D-type I-front, preceded by a shock, moves outward down the density gradient inside the minihalo until it detaches from the shock as a weak R-type I-front. A ray-tracing calculation tracks the I-front during this ``champagne phase,'' taking account of the hydrodynamical back-reaction of the gas by an approximate model of the ionized wind. We find that the escape fraction increases with stellar mass, 0. 7 80 M_sun, this ratio is ~ 60, 000, roughly half the number of ionizing <b>photons</b> <b>released</b> per stellar baryon during the their lifetimes, independent of stellar mass.

METHODS: Radiation spectra were based on the nuclear decay data from the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) RADTABS program and the BrIccEmis code, assuming both an isolated-atom and condensed-phase approach. DPKs were simulated with the PENELOPE Monte Carlo (MC) code using event-by-event electron and photon transport. S -values for concentric spherical cells of various sizes were derived from these DPKs using appropriate geometric reduction factors. RESULTS: The number of Auger and Coster Kronig (CK) electrons and X-ray <b>photons</b> <b>released</b> per nuclear decay (yield) from MIRD-RADTABS were consistently higher than those calculated using BrIccEmis. DPKs for the electron spectra from BrIccEmis were considerably different from MIRD-RADTABS in the first few hundred nanometres from a point source where most of the Auger electrons are stopped. S -values were, however, not significantly impacted as the differences in DPKs in the sub-micrometre dimension were quickly diminished in larger dimensions. CONCLUSION: Overestimation in the total AE energy output by MIRD-RADTABS leads to higher predicted energy deposition by AE emitting radionuclides, especially in the immediate vicinity of the decaying radionuclides. This should be taken into account when MIRD-RADTABS data are used to simulate biological damage at nanoscale dimensions...|$|R

Normal fluorescence occurs by exciting an electron from the ground state into an excited electronic state of a different fundamental energy level (S0 goes to S1) which, after relaxing {{back to the ground}} state (of S1), emits a photon by dropping from S1 to a vibrational energy level on S0.
