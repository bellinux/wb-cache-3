40|$|ABSTRACT Melon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops in the world. With short cycle in a system of <b>phased</b> <b>planting,</b> phytosanitary control is compromised, and a great volume of agricultural chemicals is used to control vegetable leafminer. Genetic control is an ideal alternative to avoid the damage caused by this insect. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate Cucumis accessions in regard to resistance to leafminer and correlate the variables analyzed. Fifty-four accessions and four commercial hybrids of melon were tested. The study was divided into two experiments: with and with no choice. The following characteristics were evaluated: with choice, in field - subjective score based on the infestation and the number of mines per leaf; and with no choice, in cage - number of mines per leaf, chlorophyll content, and leaf colorimetry. The results showed variability among the accessions and some genotypes showed favorable results for resistance in both experiments. There was correlation between the two variables in the experiment in the field. The accessions CNPH 11 - 282, CNPH 06 - 1047, and CNPH 11 - 1077 are the most recommended for future breeding programs with aim on introgression of resistance to vegetable leafminer in melon...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{feasibility}} {{and financial}} return are two key issues that farmers and land owners consider when deciding between alternative land uses such as arable farming, forestry and agroforestry. Moreover regional variations in yields, prices and government grants {{mean that the}} relative revenue and cost of such systems can vary substantially within Europe. To aid our understanding of these variations, the European Commission sponsored a research project called “Silvoarable Agroforestry For Europe” (SAFE). This paper describes {{the process of developing}} a new economic model within that project. The initial stages included establishing criteria for the model with end-users and reviewing the literature and existing models. This indicated that the economic model needed to allow comparison of arable farming, forestry and agroforestry systems at a plot- and a farm-scale. The form of comparisons included net margins, net present values, infinite net present values, equivalent annual values, and labour requirements. It was decided that the model would operate in a spreadsheet format, and the effect of <b>phased</b> <b>planting</b> patterns would be included at a farm- scale. Following initial development, additional user feedback led to a final choice on a model name, a final method of collating input data, and the inclusion of field-based operations such as varying the cropped area, replacing dead trees, and pruning. In addition options in terms of improved graphical outputs and the ability to undertake sensitivity analysis were developed. Some of the key lessons learnt include the need to establish clear model criteria and the benefits of developing a working prototype at an early stage to gain user- feed...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{statement in}} Quantitative Feedback Theory(QFT) {{is that the}} nominal plant can be chosen arbitrarily {{whether or not it}} is a member of the plant set. Based on this statement, a design method for non-minimum <b>phase</b> and unstable <b>plants</b> proposed by Horowitz is to choose the stable minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plant</b> as the nominal plant. This report shows this statement is incorrect by several counterexamples including non-minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plants,</b> unstable plants and even stable minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plants.</b> When the nominal case is chosen out with the plant set, an improved design procedure is presented.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a new {{technique}} is proposed to design an online control algorithm using the Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN). The controller is an RBFNN based direct self-tuning regulator (STR) that overcomes several shortcomings of the inverse control design using the neural networks. The control algorithm performs equally good to both minimum phase and non-minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plants.</b> The plant parameters are estimated online and are used to update the weights of the RBFNN. The weight update equations are derived based on the well known least mean squares principle. The RBFNN virtually models the inverse of the plant and thus the output tracks the reference trajectory.

40|$|Non-minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plants</b> cause {{fundamental}} design constraints, such as bandwidth limitation, in the feed-back {{control systems}} {{due to their}} peculiar phase characteristics. Therefore, the control problem of non-minimum phase systems is quantifiably harder than the minimum phase 2 ̆ 7 s one. Furthermore, the control problem becomes more severe {{in the presence of}} system uncertainties and external disturbances. In this paper, we propose a disturbance observer (DOB) based solution for the robust control problem of non-minimum phase systems. This paper shows that non-minimum phase systems limit the DOB 2 ̆ 7 s bandwidth, {{which is one of the}} most significant design parameters in the DOB based robust control systems, to satisfy robustness. The Poisson integral formula is utilized so that the bandwidth limitations are derived analytically. As a result, a new analysis and design tool is proposed for the robust control problem of non-minimum phase systems by using the DOB. The proposed method is implemented into two different non-minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plant</b> models, which have right half plane (RHP) zero and pole, and its validity is shown by given simulation results...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose for scalar plants an {{adaptive}} LQG controller with adaptive input sensitivity function/loop transfer recovery of an associated adaptive LQ design. The sensitivity recovery {{can be viewed as}} a frequency-shaped loop recovery where the weights involve a sensitivity function. The adaptive loop/sensitivity recovery is achieved by feeding back the estimation residuals to the control through a stable bounded input, bounded output (BIBO) adaptive filter Q~. For simplicity we consider fixed but uncertain plants in the model set and identification schemes where there are consistent parameter estimates. For non-minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plants</b> an asymptotic partial recovery is achieved via a recursive least squares update of the BIBO filter Qk. The degree of recovery can be prescribed a priori between zero and the maximum possible. For the case of minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plant</b> estimates, full loop recovery may be achieved asymptotically by prescribing a maximum degree of recovery. The motivation for proposing the new adaptive control algorithm is to enhance robustness of adaptive LQG designs, taking advantage of the robustness enhancement properties of sensitivity/loop recovery for off-line designs. The robustness properties of the new algorithm are demonstrated by simulation results. KEY WORDS Adaptive control Optimal control Loop transfer recovery Robust controller design 1...|$|R
40|$|There has {{recently}} been significant interest in feedback stabilization problems with communication constraints including constraints on the available data rate. Signal to noise ratio constraints are {{one way in which}} data-rate limits arise, and are the focus of this paper. In both continuous and discrete-time settings, we show that there are limitations on the ability to stabilize an unstable plant over a signal-to-noise ratio constrained channel using finite dimensional linear time invariant (LTI) feedback. In the case of state feedback, or output feedback with a delay-free, minimum <b>phase</b> <b>plant,</b> these limitations in fact match precisely those that might have been inferred by considering the associated ideal Shannon capacity data rate over the same channel. In the case of LTI output feedback, additional limitations are shown to apply if the <b>plant</b> is nonminimum <b>phase.</b> In this case, we show that for a continuous-time nonminimum <b>phase</b> <b>plant,</b> a periodic linear time varying feedback scheme with fast sampling may be used to recover the original signal-to-noise ratio requirement at the cost of robustness properties. The proposed framework inherently captures channel noise effects in a simple formulation suited to conventional LTI control performance and robustness analysis, and has potential to handle time delays and bandwidth constraints in a variety of control over communication problems. ...|$|R
