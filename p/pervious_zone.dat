40|$|Waste {{production}} {{is not a}} modern concept. It {{has always been a}} byproduct of human beings use of the earth s natural resources for survival. The safe and reliable long-term disposal of solid waste residues is an important component of integrated waste management. Solid waste residues are waste components that are not recycled, that remain after processing at a material recovery facility, or that remain after the recovery of energy. Historically, solid waste was placed in depressions in the soil of the earth s crust through a process called landfilling. In South Africa, most waste produced by households and industries is disposed of on landfill sites. By law, all landfills and waste containment structures are required to have an engineered containment barrier installed that adheres to the minimum standards described in the waste classification and management regulations of the South African National Environmental Management: Waste Act (Act 59 of 2008). When waste materials in a landfill or any other waste body is exposed to the chemicals and heat generated over time, they produce harmful fluids in the form of leachate or landfill gas that migrate from the landfill towards the liner or capping, and include organic contaminants. These organic contaminants include a group commonly referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been known to migrate to and pollute the underlying groundwater (Prosser & Janechek, 1995). The High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Geomembrane is often believed to be the primary barrier to contaminant transport, but the clay component in the composite liner usually controls the rate of transport of VOCs since researchers like Edil (2003) have shown that VOCs diffuse through geomembranes at appreciable rates. Therefore, the effectiveness of modern landfill liner systems in minimising the migration of VOCs merits scrutiny. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain reliable data on the reduction in diffusion of VOCs through the HDPE geomembranes (GM) component in the composite liner systems of landfills by extracting air through the leakage detection layer or drainage layer of the composite liner. The objective was to undertake tests in three phases: Phase 1 aimed to prove that the chosen VOCs diffuse from source to receptor through a GM layer and to compare this to the results obtained from the literature. Phase 2 aimed to prove that, even if the separation between the source and receptor consisted of two GMs separated by an air-filled <b>pervious</b> <b>zone,</b> diffusion of the VOCs would still occur from the source to the receptor volumes. Phase 3 aimed to prove that, by introducing airflow into the <b>pervious</b> <b>zone</b> between the two GMs, the concentration of VOCs in the receptor volume (due to diffusion through the GM) could be reduced significantly. The testing in this phase also aimed to determine if the rate of air removal would play a role in the diffusive process and the resultant VOC concentrations in the receptor. Laboratory tests were carried out at the South Campus of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. The tests undertaken were based on the methods used by Prof Kerry Rowe at the Geo-Engineering Centre at the Queens University in Kingston, Canada as demonstrated during a visit to their facility. To undertake these tests it would be required to calculate the Sorption (Sgf) and Diffusion (Dg) coefficients for the compound and GM in question. Sorption/Immersion, Diffusion and Weight Gain tests were done to determine the sorption coefficient for the GM and permeant in question. The Diffusion coefficient (Dg) was inferred using the variation in source and receptor concentrations with time (Fick s second law) at the given boundary conditions. This was done using POLLUTEv 7 ®, which solves the one-dimensional contaminant migration equation subject to boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the GM being modelled. The data entry into POLLUTEv 7 ® includes information such as thickness and density on the layers to be modelled as well as the boundary conditions to be used for modelling. Phase 1 testing had challenges and limitations but it met its objective of proving that the VOCs in question diffuse from the source, through the 2 mm GM, into the receptor that represents groundwater, at rates that were comparable to those found in literature. Phase 2 tests took longer to reach equilibrium since the sorption and diffusion process had to take place over two GMs and the 0. 8 cm air-filled <b>pervious</b> <b>zone.</b> The temperature under which phase 2 tests were undertaken was higher than that of phase 1 and, as indicated by literature, diffusion occurs faster at elevated temperatures. Undertaking the tests at different temperatures was not on purpose but rather a factor of laboratory conditions and setup. Data on the diffusion across two GMs separated by air, was not readily available to compare the difference that the increased temperature had on the system, but Phase 2 testing successfully met its aim of proving that the diffusion of BTEX and Chloroform takes place from source to receptor across a divide consisting of two 1 mm GMs separated by an air filled <b>pervious</b> <b>zone.</b> Phase 3 testing showed that, even though the optimal rate of airflow would require additional testing, introducing a flow of air through a <b>pervious</b> <b>zone</b> adjacent to the GM layer in a landfill liner would significantly reduce the concentrations of VOCs in the groundwater beneath landfills and waste containment facilities.

40|$|Ultramafic {{rocks of}} New Caledonia present {{extensive}} pseudokarstic features: undulations {{of the base}} of the weathering profile, fractures enlarged by dissolution, dolines. Possible influence of the infiltrative instability on differential weathering of ultramafic rocks in tropical climate is investigated here, starting from the Tiebaghi case for which a groundwater model is available. Infiltration instability is governed by nondimensional numbers, i. e. the Damkohler and Peclet numbers, and by the permeability contrasts between the bedrock and the different layers of the weathering profile. These numbers are firstly estimated for the Tiebaghi case, and secondly a sensitivity study of the weathering style is achieved through numerical modeling. Computations are firstly carried out without the impervious laterite cover, and then the effect of this cover is considered. The characteristic time constant for weathering of peridotites is directly estimated at around 7 yrs from the thickness of the weathering front and the fluid velocity. The results show that a permeability contrast of at least 100 between the most pervious layer in the weathering front and bedrock and a diffusivity of chemical species lower than 2. 5 x 10 - 8 m(2) /s are required to allow instability. The Tiebaghi case lies at the limit of instability and dissolution fingers develop in a time lapse of 1 Ma. However, this requires the infiltration of nearly 800 mm of rainfall yearly, which is not the case presently. The development of dissolution fingers is promoted by any initial <b>pervious</b> <b>zone</b> such as fracture concentration around a faulted zone and the characteristic time for instability development drops to 0. 1 - 0. 3 Ma. Extension of these results to other peridotite massifs in the tropical zone submitted to different temperatures and rainfalls is finally discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{documentation}} {{existing on}} both {{land use and}} the delineation of <b>pervious</b> and impervious <b>zones</b> in urban areas tends to be rather complete. In addition, topographical information (altitudes, slopes) is generally available, although contours are not drawn in detail on urban-area maps. The development of urban databases has provided a convenient means of accessing this information {{for the purpose of}} hydrological modelling. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate a recent model, 'SURF' (semi-urbanized runoff flow), specifically developed for coupling with a GIS based on a digital terrain representation. This model was evaluated by use of an original approach from the field of urban hydrology. A 7 -year continuous data series, which includes the dry periods, has been used as input to run the model. The principles behind the SURF model are briefly described herein. A sensitivity analysis is then performed in order to select the most influential parameters. Following the calibration stage, the model's validation is discussed. This validation is conducted not only by comparing observed and simulated hydrographs, but also by comparing the SURF model with a more conventional model in urban hydrology, called the URBAN model. It is demonstrated that the SURF model provides useful simulation results and does outperform the URBAN model. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
