In order to inspect these components with ultrasonic imaging techniques optimizations of pulse parameters {{have been carried}} out. The know how of the laboratory inspections was successfully employed to field inspections of a specially prepared tail unit of the EH 101.

40|$|The {{application}} of such high-speed CMOS-logic circuits as the 54 HC/ 74 HC family (as compared with CD 4000 metal-gate logic) requires {{special attention to}} <b>pc-board</b> design to minimize conducted and radiated noise.

40|$|Logic {{emulation}} enables {{designers to}} functionally verify complex integrated circuits prior to chip fabrication. However, traditional FPGA-based logic emulators have poor inter-chip communication bandwidth, commonly limiting gate utilization {{to less than}} 20 percent. Global routing contention mandates the use of expensive crossbar and <b>PC-board</b> technology {{in a system of}} otherwise low-cost, commodity parts. Even with crossbar technology, current emulators only use a fraction of potential communication bandwidth because they dedicate each FPGA pin (physical wire) to a single emulated signal (logical wire). Virtual Wires overcome pin limitations by intelligently multiplexing each physical wire among multiple logical wires and pipelining these connections at the maximum clocking frequency of the FPGA. The resulting increase in bandwidth allows effective use of low dimension, direct interconnect. The size of the FPGA array can be decreased as well, resulting in low cost logic emulation...|$|E

40|$|Wireless handsets, PDAs, {{and other}} {{portable}} electronic devices continue to shrink while increasing in complexity. As a result, engineers face design challenges with battery life, <b>PC-board</b> space, and power dissipation. These problems can be overcome by increasing {{the efficiency of the}} dc/dc converters used in these products. Efficiency is often the primary design goal when using a dc/dc converter. Many design requirements involve converting the battery voltage to a low supply voltage. Although a linear regulator can be used, it cannot achieve the efficiency of a switching-regulator design. This article covers some of the common issues designers face when balancing circuit size, performance, and cost. Large-Signal vs Small-Signal Response Switching converters employ complex regulation schemes to keep efficiency high at both heavy and light loads. Modern CPUs require fast large-signal response from the regulator. For instance, when a processor is switching from idle to full-speed operation, the current drawn by the core can quickly rise from a few tens of microamps to hundreds of milliamps...|$|E
40|$|With feature sizes {{decreasing}} {{and chip}} area increasing {{it becomes more}} and more time consuming to transport signals over long distances across the chip [5]. Designers are already introducing more levels of metal connections, using wider and thicker paths for longer distances. Another recent development is the introduction of an additional level of connections between the chip and the <b>pc-board,</b> multilayer ceramic chip carriers. The trend is undoubtedly towards even more connecting levels. In this paper we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} achieve propagation delays that are logarithmic in the lengths of the wires, provided the connection pattern is designed to meet rather strong constraints. These constraints are, in effect, satisfied only by connection patterns that exhibit a hierarchical structure. We also show that, even at the ultimate physical limits of the technology, the propagation for reasonably sized VLSI chips is dominated by these considerations, rather than by the speed of light...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a software library (KVTP-lib) for VLBI data transmission over the network with the VDIF (VLBI Data Interchange Format), which is the newly proposed standard VLBI data format designed for electronic data transfer over the network. The software package keeps the application layer (VDIF frame) and the transmission layer separate, so that each layer can be developed efficiently. The real-time VLBI data transmission tool sudp-send is an application tool based on the KVTP-lib library. sudp-send captures the VLBI data stream from the VSI-H interface with the K 5 /VSI <b>PC-board</b> and writes the data to file in standard Linux file format or transmits it to the network using the simple- UDP (SUDP) protocol. Another tool, sudp-recv, receives the data stream from the network and writes the data to file in a specific VLBI format (K 5 /VSSP, VDIF, or Mark 5 B).

40|$|Abstract—Logic {{emulation}} enables {{designers to}} functionally verify complex integrated circuits prior to chip fabrication. How-ever, traditional FPGA-based logic emulators have poor inter-chip communication bandwidth, commonly limiting gate utiliza-tion {{to less than}} 20 %. Global routing contention mandates the use of expensive crossbar and <b>PC-board</b> technology in a sys-tem of otherwise low-cost commodity parts. Even with crossbar technology, current emulators only use a fraction of potential communication bandwidth because they dedicate each FPGA pin (physical wire) to a single emulated signal (logical wire). Virtual wires overcome pin limitations by intelligently multiplexing each physical wire among multiple logical wires, and pipelining these connections at the maximum clocking frequency of the FPGA. The resulting increase in bandwidth allows effective use of low-dimension direct interconnect. The size of the FPGA array can be decreased as well, resulting in low-cost logic emulation. This paper covers major contributions of the MIT Virtual Wires project. In {{the context of a}} complete emulation system, we analyze phase-based static scheduling and routing algorithms, present virtual wires synthesis methodologies, and overview an operational prototype with 20 K-gate boards. Results, including in-circuit emulation of a SPARC microprocessor, indicate that virtual wires eliminate the need for expensive crossbar technol-ogy while increasing FPGA utilization beyond 45 %. Theoretical analysis predicts that virtual wires emulation scales with FPGA size and average routing distance, while traditional emulation does not. I...|$|E
40|$|Unlike low-power, metal-gate CMOS, {{high-speed}} 54 HC/ 74 HC devices readily drive {{long cable}} runs and backplanes. While the family maintains CMOS’s traditional noise immunity, you must watch transmission-line effects in such applications. Because of 54 HC/ 74 HC high-speed CMOS’s short propagation delays and fast {{rise and fall}} times, you must understand its transmission-line behavior when driving lines as short as even a foot or two, whether those lines are coaxial cables, twisted pairs or backplanes. Moreover, the devices ’ fast edge rates {{increase the likelihood of}} crosstalk among interconnecting cables. Despite the need, however, to take design precautions that minimize adverse effects related to high-speed operation, 54 HC/ 74 HC logic—unlike slower metal-gate CMOS—includes many features that suit it to driving transmission lines. For example, its symmetrical push-pull outputs result in stiff logic levels, and its high output drive allows fast bit rates. Another advantage of high-speed-CMOS designs is that they don’t prove to be as difficult as those based on other high-speed logic families. In general, high-speed CMOS doesn’t require the detailed attention to <b>pc-board</b> layout and transmission-line characteristics that Schottky TTL or ECL designs do. Furthermore, controlling unwanted reflections is easier in the CMOS designs, because 54 HC/ 74 HC devices’ electrostatic-protection diodes tend to clamp the reflected voltages to the power-supply levels...|$|E
