50|$|The Harriet Irving Botanical Gardens {{consists}} of six acres divided into nine unique habitats of the Acadian Forest Region. The native plants are labelled with their botanical name and common name. Like all botanical gardens, the HIBG maintains a collection consisting of native plants to the Acadian Forest for conservational, educational, and scientific reasons. The HIBG have three living specimens {{of endangered species}} that are protected under the Nova Scotia Endangered Species Act. The <b>Pink</b> <b>coreopsis</b> (Coreopsis rosea), Water-pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata), and Thread-leaved Sundew (Drosera filiformis) are all {{on display at the}} gardens to help educate future generations on the importance of environmental conservation and facilitate further research into the conservation of these species.|$|E

Some, like the Plymouth Gentian (Sabatia kennedyana) and <b>Pink</b> <b>Coreopsis</b> (Coreopsis rosea) occur {{nowhere else in}} Canada. These species occur on gently-sloping sand and gravel shorelines lower in the watershed. There is an online guide to assist with identifying all these species. Wilson's Lake {{has one of the}} largest populations of Atlantic Coastal Plain plants in Canada, and is the site of the small but highly significant Tusket River Nature Reserve. In 2011 botanists exploring a newly acquired protected area, the Jack and Darlene Stone Conservation Lands, discovered another rare plant species, Maleberry (Lyonia ligustrina), the first time this species has been found growing in Canada.|$|E
