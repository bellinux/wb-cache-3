A 3-0 victory at home to Orange County Blue Star at the beginning of June was followed by a 2-0 win over their local rivals Fresno Fuego, and it looked as though a brief resurgence may have been on the cards, but Bakersfield failed to win another game all season, and were out of playoff contention {{before the end of the}} month. The pair losses to perennial whipping boys Lancaster Rattlers were hard to take for the men from Kern County; the 6-0 drubbing at the hands of their closest rivals, Ogden Outlaws, on the final day of the season was the final straw, and consigned Bakersfield to the basement for the first time in the team's PDL history.

40|$|Protection {{may be a}} second-best policy {{when the}} {{domestic}} sector is imperfectly competitive. But the optimal tariff depends on labor market institutions too. The author considers two theoretical settings. The first is fully centralized wage bargaining, where all workers are unionized and wage differentials are redistributed among workers (the Scandinavia case). The second is negotiation at the firm level, where workers are unionized in imperfectly competitive sectors only, and wages may differ from sector to sector (the Latin America case). He uses {{the case of the}} competitive labor market as a benchmark. In Scandinavia, free trade maximized welfare. The central trade union internalizes the consequences of imperfect competition in the domestic sector. Since prices in this sector are a mark-up over labor costs, there is a wedge between the sectoral productivities of labor and, therefore, an inefficient allocation of manpower. By choosing a moderate wage, the central trade union replicates the effects of a subsidy to the imperfectly competitive sector so that no government intervention is required. In Latin America, decentralized wage bargaining increases the wedge between the sectoral productivities of labor. While wages in the export sector are constrained by harsh competition in world markets, trade unions in the domestic sector can get higher wages without completely squeezing labor demand. An import tariff improves manpower allocation by reorienting demand toward the domestic sector. Since the second-best tariff is strictly <b>positive,</b> <b>opening</b> the economy leads to a drop in welfare. The author's analysis sheds some light on the political economy of protection. Particularly, it suggests that trade liberalization is more likely to raise welfare in the Latin America case when its accompanied by changes in labor market institutions.

40|$|From {{a safety}} {{point of view}} it is {{important}} that a concrete structure, apart from necessary load capacity, also is able to show ductile behaviour that allows redistribution of forces so that a local failure not lead to total collapse of the structure. A structure's ability to exhibit such behaviour is highly dependent on the reinforcement detailing of the joint connections between its independent members. Accordingly, to obtain sound structural behaviour, the joints should ideally be as strong as the structural members connected to them and show ductile behaviour in the ultimate limit state. Even though fulfilling these requirements, the reinforcement detailings in frame corners previously prescribed in the Swedish Shelter Regulations for the design of civil defence shelters were difficult to apply correctly. Therefore, a simpler method, by which all reinforcement bars are spliced within the corner region, was proposed and evaluated. To examine the effectiveness of the new detailing when subjected to a <b>positive</b> (<b>opening</b> of the corner) or a negative (closing of the corner) moment, a combination of a literature survey, static full-scale tests and static non-linear finite element analyses has been carried out. The main parameters varied were the reinforcement detailing and the reinforcement ratio, and {{it was found that the}} new alternative is suitable to use. However, since a civil defence shelter is designed to withstand transient loading, such as blast waves from a nearby explosion or the impact of falling masses from a collapsing building, this also has to be taken into consideration. When subjected to such loads, the response of a structure may be quite different from that of static loading. The peak load for transient loads is often several times higher than the "equivalent" static load used in the design of the shelter. Further, if the load is applied fast enough, it is possible that part of the structure will still "not be aware" of the loading when another part reaches failure. Therefore, non-linear finite element analyses based on explicit integration were carried out to increase the knowledge of how a structure behaves when subjected to such transient loads. It was found that even though the global structural behaviour may differ widely there are still large similarities in the local behaviour between a static and a transient load case. The results imply that the conclusions made in the previous static studies are valid also for a transient loaded structure...|$|E

Empirical examples are provided from case studies on renewable energy technologies.

The present {{research is part of}} the broad range of studies on “Social Representations” (SR, Moscovici 1984) and has its origins in the research planned within the 2006 “European Week”, promoted by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. The study’s main aim was to define the “images” or shared Representations by the people interviewed on the topic of the “work world”, using a particular non-verbal (icons/visual) technique {{as a part of the}} method. Two hundred young people aged between 18 and 24 were interviewed, approximately balanced for sex, not yet working or with little or minor work experience. In order to study reliable SR, interviewees were asked to make a drawing illustrating how they “visualized” themselves in the work world. The content was then analyzed by assigning them to specific categories, established beforehand by independent judges. This marked out attributes and qualities of the work world, which were then applied in the next stage, in which independent judges assessed (Cohen’s K 0. 84) the various representations. Results show that eight main categories of SR emerged, differently oriented according to two main dimensions: (a) <b>positive</b> (socialization, <b>opening</b> to others, well-being, usability) and (b) negative (precariousness, disorientation, isolation, withdrawn behaviour) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the mechanism of opening of tight junctions in Caco- 2 cell monolayers using superporous hydrogel (SPH) and SPH composite (SPHC) polymers as permeation enhancers for peptide drug delivery. Moreover, the transport of octreotide across Caco- 2 cell monolayers was assessed by application of SPH and SPHC polymers on Caco- 2 cell monolayers. In these experiments, N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan chloride with 60 % quaternization (TMC 60) was used as a <b>positive</b> control for <b>opening</b> of tight junctions. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) studies showed that all three polymers (TMC 60, SPH, and SPHC) were able to decrease TEER values to approximately 30 % of the initial values, indicating the ability of these polymers to open the tight junctions. Recovery TEER studies showed that the effects of the polymers on Caco- 2 cell monolayers were reversible, indicating viability of the cells after incubation with polymers. Both SPH and SPHC (compared with TMC 60) were able to increase the paracellular transport of octreotide by their mechanical pressures on tight junctions. The mechanistic studies showed that junctional proteins, including actin, occludin, and claudin- 1, were influenced by application of SPH and SPHC polymers to the Caco- 2 cell monolayers. SPH and SPHC induced clear changes in the staining pattern of all three proteins compared with the control, indicating that the expression of these proteins in the tight junctions was increased, most likely due to the mechanical pressure of the polymers on the junctional protein...|$|R

The evidence also tentatively suggests that the size of the steady-state gap in the levels of TFP between New Zealand and the US decreased in the early 1990 s. Although the evidence presented here is encouraging, it should be interpreted with considerable caution given that the post-reform sample period is very short and the method used to measure the steady-state levels gap is preliminary.

As a consequence, New Zealand’s productivity performance should have improved as competitive pressures encourage domestic firms to adopt superior production technologies from the world’s most advanced countries. Consistent with this prediction, the measure of productivity considered here does display a marked improvement at the beginning of the 1990 s. If, as the evidence suggests, this improvement is the result of technology diffusion, then the <b>positive</b> impact of <b>opening</b> the economy to competitive forces should be ongoing for a considerable time into the future. 1...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{potential}} {{was recorded}} by micro-electrode in segments of small (200 - 500 microns o. d.) mesenteric arteries of guinea-pig. Isotonic shortening {{was recorded in}} helical strips cut from these arteries. Raising the external potassium concentration, [K+]o, caused shortening and substantial depolarization. The threshold for contraction was about 30 mM which corresponded to a membrane potential of about - 45 mV. Since high-potassium contractions were abolished in calcium-free solution {{it was suggested that}} they occur due to potential-sensitive calcium channels <b>opening</b> <b>positive</b> to about - 45 mV. Noradrenaline weakly depolarized the muscle and produced contractions resistant to calcium-free conditions. It was suggested that noradrenaline contractions are mainly caused by mechanisms other than the opening of potential-sensitive calcium channels, namely entry of calcium via other channels and release of stored calcium. Carbachol had no effect on basal tension but inhibited shortening by noradrenaline or by raising [K+]o. The inhibitory effect of carbachol on tension under various conditions was associated with hyperpolarization or depolarization in a range negative to - 45 mV, or no effect on potential, so that modulation of the number of open potential-sensitive calcium channels could not be evoked to explain its relaxant action. Removal or destruction of the endothelium by rubbing or by distilled water perfusion left tension responses to noradrenaline or raised [K+]o essentially unchanged. However, the inhibitory effect of carbachol on tension was attenuated and hyperpolarization of the resting artery was converted to a depolarization. It was concluded that carbachol has both a strong inhibitory and a weak excitatory effect on these vascular smooth muscle cells. Membrane potential changes are not essential to its inhibitory action but may, by closing potential-sensitive calcium channels, sometimes reinforce it. Hyperpolarization by carbachol may be caused by a factor released by the action of carbachol on endothelial cells: in its absence carbachol may weakly depolarize but this alone is normally insufficient to generate tension...|$|R
