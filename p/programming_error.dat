5000|$|When a <b>program</b> <b>error</b> {{occurs in}} Windows, the system {{searches}} for a <b>program</b> <b>error</b> handler. A <b>program</b> <b>error</b> handler deals with errors as they arise during {{the running of}} a program. If the system does not find a <b>program</b> <b>error</b> handler, the system verifies that the program is not currently being debugged and considers the error to be unhandled. The system then processes unhandled errors by looking in the registry for a <b>program</b> <b>error</b> debugger for which Dr. Watson is the default. A third-party debugger {{can also be used}} in place of Dr. Watson. The Watcom C Compiler includes a similar crash-analysis tool named [...] "Dr. Watcom".|$|R
40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{challenges}} in software development {{is to ensure that}} the software is correct. Almost all software that is complex enough to accomplish a useful task contains <b>programming</b> <b>errors.</b> Unfortunately, developers must allocate their time to various activities and often, they do not have enough time for searching <b>programming</b> <b>errors.</b> The goal of this dissertation is to support developers in finding <b>programming</b> <b>errors</b> despite a limited time budget. Therefore, we focus on program analyses with three properties. First, the analyses are automatic, that is, the only input required to analyze a program is the source code (or byte code) of the program itself. In particular, an automatic analysis does not rely on formal specifications or manually written test suites. Second, the analyses are precise, that is, they report warnings that are guaranteed to point to <b>programming</b> <b>errors</b> or that have a high chance of pointing to <b>programming</b> <b>errors,</b> instead of false positives. Third, the analyses can be applied to real-world software with low human and computational effort, that is, they provide developers a push button approach for existing code. Thi...|$|R

2500|$|The worm was {{at first}} {{identified}} by the security company VirusBlokAda in mid-June 2010. Journalist Brian Krebs's blog posting on 15 July 2010 was the first widely read report on the worm. The original name given by VirusBlokAda was [...] "Rootkit.Tmphider"; Symantec however called it [...] "W32.Temphid", later changing to [...] "W32.Stuxnet". Its current name is derived {{from a combination of}} some keywords in the software (".stub" [...] and [...] "mrxnet.sys"). The reason for the discovery at this time is attributed to the virus accidentally spreading beyond its intended target (the Natanz plant) due to a <b>programming</b> <b>error</b> introduced in an update; this led to the worm spreading to an engineer's computer that had been connected to the centrifuges, and spreading further when the engineer returned home and connected his computer to the internet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem was}} not a <b>programming</b> <b>error</b> in the AGC, nor was it pilot error. It was a {{peripheral}} hardware design bug that was already known and documented by Apollo 5 engineers. However, because the problem had only occurred once during testing, they concluded that it was safer to fly with the existing hardware that they had already tested, than to fly with a newer but largely untested radar system. In the actual hardware, {{the position of the}} rendezvous radar was encoded with synchros excited by a different source of 800Hz AC than the one used by the computer as a timing reference. The two 800Hz sources were frequency locked but not phase locked, and the small random phase variations made it appear as though the antenna was rapidly [...] "dithering" [...] in position, even though it was completely stationary. These phantom movements generated the rapid series of cycle steals.|$|E

Nissan said the problem does not pose any accident risk. On April 15. Nissan {{announced that}} the problem only affected {{a small proportion of}} Leafs. Nissan engineers identified a <b>programming</b> <b>error</b> in an air conditioning system sensor that sometimes triggers an erroneous high voltage alert when the air conditioning unit is switched on, due to the increased demand for power. The system issues an Inhibit Restart command, which does not prevent driving the vehicle, but does prevent it restarting after it is turned off. [...] The solution requires reprogramming of the Vehicle Control Module by a Nissan dealer. Nissan announced a [...] "service campaign" [...] to apply the software fix to all 5,300 Nissan Leafs in operation around the world, but it was not an official recall because it was not a safety issue. The applied software update also improves the car’s on-board range calculation system, which several Leaf owners reported was overestimating the number of miles left. In addition, the update changes the state-of-charge bars display to provide a true reserve capacity; the driver now has up to five miles to find a charging spot after the car reaches the zero miles remaining mark.|$|E
