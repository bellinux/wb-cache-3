5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking his collar bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, {{many aspects of the}} offense were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts.

5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back.

5|$|With Duncan being {{healthy for}} 78 games and posting typical 20/10 numbers, San Antonio {{concluded}} the 2007–08 regular {{season with a}} 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs {{in three of the}} past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare three-pointer that sent the game into double overtime.

In the first game of the next round against the Chris Paul-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds. The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series. Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6, and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7. However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E
