40|$|This study {{deals with}} the factors which were {{responsible}} for the origin of <b>personnel</b> <b>functions</b> in a selected group of industrial organizations in the State of Utah. Although material is available concerning the factors which affected the establishment of <b>personnel</b> <b>functions</b> in the United States in general, there is little information regarding these factors in any one region. For this reason, an area study should be of value. The purpose of this survey was to study the personnel departments in some of the more highly developed industrial organizations of the state of Utah and determine: (1) the factors responsible for the establishment of personnel functions; (2) when these functions were introduced; and (3) what general conclusions could be drawn regarding the factors affecting the origin of <b>personnel</b> <b>functions</b> in the State of Utah {{on the basis of this}} survey and background material. The factors affecting the establishment of <b>personnel</b> <b>functions</b> in a particular region need to be carefully considered because industries tend to cluster within a certain region. If data are available as to what factors affect personnel practices within that particular area, then efforts can be made to encourage and direct the initiation and expansion of the activities which are more important to industries needing these services...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the links between}} imagination and human resource management. The concept imagination has received little scholarly attention {{within the field of}} management, despite its potential to inform a number of lines of inquiry. At the present time, much of the research literature on imagination is confined to the visual arts, literature, and education. Human resource (HR) professionals could play a part in aligning employees with organizational goals and bring about organizational change if they developed their thinking in a more imaginative way. Developing managerial imagination can help solve the dilemmas and contradictions they face. A diagram is developed, which maps the development of the <b>personnel</b> <b>function</b> and offers four possibilities within a framework. They are biography, personal framing, history, and social structure. The outcome of this analysis provides a development of the <b>personnel</b> <b>function</b> one of which is a globally imaginative HR management. Within such a framework, the concept of “the imaginative performer” is discussed.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in personnel research concerns {{the assessment of}} the efficacy of such human resources functions as selection, training, and performance appraisal. Traditionally used measures such as correlation coefficients and subjective reactions have been heavily criticized for their inadequacy in accurately describing the value of a given human resources function. The regression-based general utility function from decision theory, proposed as an alternative, represents a major improvement, as it is intended to allow assessment of virtually any <b>personnel</b> <b>function</b> in monetary terms. It is also intended to account for such factors as the number of employees involved, the costs of the <b>personnel</b> <b>function,</b> the validity of the <b>personnel</b> <b>function,</b> and the variability of job performance. Two important variables of the utility function [...] SD(,y), the standard deviation of performance, and (phi) /p, the selection ratio [...] were examined in terms of their sensitivity to departures from underlying mathematical assumptions. Because job performance is assumed to be normally distributed, the effects of progressive truncation of a standard normal distribution were assessed. It was found that this term is relatively robust, unless the truncation was extreme. The robustness of the (phi) /p term was assessed by replacing the normal distribution of predictor performance with a reflected gamma distribution. It was found that this term is more affected by a departure from normality. The combined effects of these two terms were assessed by simultaneously examining the effects of varying selection standards and varying job performance on the expected per-person increase in standardized job performance. It was found that such effects were nonsymmetrical and depended on base rates of job performance. Implications for the implementation of the function and directions for further research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Roughly {{a century}} ago, American cities were the fulcrum of {{development}} of professional public personnel administration. Although {{the federal government}} had enacted the Pendleton Act in 1883, the principal components of the merit system [...] job testing, selection rules, classification, and pay [...] were forged in municipal research bureaus in many large cities (Finegold, 1995). These bureaus provided the intellectual organization for Progressive reformers, who battled political machines and machine politics in countless locales. The reforms they devised dominated the principal <b>personnel</b> <b>functions</b> in most cities for well over six decades. During the past thirty-five years, cities have found it necessary to modernize their personnel systems and to augment the functions of HRM. Civil rights laws and the impetus to create a representative workforce as well as the government reinvention movement and the growth of information systems technology have all stimulated a reexamination of and recreation of basic practices. This chapter will examine the history and the present state of traditional <b>personnel</b> <b>functions,</b> as well as new functions caused by workforce diversity, technology, and the rise of e-government.
