5|$|The {{house was}} altered again in 1837–42 by Edward Blore for Hungerford Crewe. Blore {{replaced}} a local architect, George Latham, {{who had been}} commissioned in 1836. Many of Blore's working drawings survive in the Royal Institute of British Architects archive. He carried out decorative work to the interior in the Jacobethan style and made major changes to the plan of the ground floor, which included replacing the screens passage with an entrance hall and covering the central courtyard to create a single-storey central hall. He also fitted <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> windows throughout and installed a warm-air heating system. The total cost, including his work on estate buildings, was £30,000 (£ today).|$|E

50|$|Photographic plates preceded {{photographic}} {{film as a}} capture medium in photography. The light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was coated on a <b>glass</b> <b>plate,</b> typically thinner than common window glass, instead of a clear plastic film. <b>Glass</b> <b>plates</b> were far superior to film for research-quality imaging because they were extremely stable {{and less likely to}} bend or distort, especially in large-format frames for wide-field imaging. Early plates used the wet collodion process. The wet plate process was replaced late in the 19th century by gelatin dry <b>plates.</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>plate</b> photographic material largely faded from the consumer market {{in the early years of}} the 20th century, as more convenient and less fragile films were increasingly adopted. However, photographic plates were reportedly still being used by one photography business in London until the 1970s, and they were in wide use by the professional astronomical community as late as the 1990s. Workshops on the use of <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> photography as an alternative medium or for artistic use are still being conducted.|$|R

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base {{continued to grow}} in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh <b>Plate</b> <b>Glass,</b> Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh.

5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including <b>plate</b> <b>glass,</b> and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The LaSalle Street {{canyon is}} home to other {{historic}} buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark {{considered to be the}} oldest standing high-rise. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style. The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons. The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings. Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings {{at the north end of}} the canyon. The current Chicago City Hall, built in a Classical Revival style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, and vigor of the government.

40|$|Achieving high {{fidelity}} chemical synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> {{has become increasingly}} important, since <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> are substrates widely used for miniaturized chemical and biochemical reactions and analyses. DNA chips can be directly prepared by synthesizing oligonucleotides on <b>glass</b> <b>plates,</b> but the characterization of these micro-syntheses has been limited by the sub-picomolar amount of material available. Most DNA chip syntheses have been assayed using in situ coupling of fluorescent molecules to the 5 ′-OH of the synthesized oligonucleotides. We herein report a systematic investigation of oligonucleotide synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> with the reactions carried out in an automated DNA synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The analyses were performed using 32 P gel electrophoresis of the oligonucleotides cleaved from <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> to provide product distribution profiles according to chain length of oligonucleotides. 5 ′-Methoxythymidine {{was used as the}} chain terminator, which permits assay of coupling reaction yields as a function of chain length growth. The results of this work reveal that a major cause of lower fidelity synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> is particularly inefficient reactions of the various reagents with functional groups close to <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> surfaces. These problems cannot be detected by previous in situ fluorescence assays. The identification of this origin of low fidelity synthesis on <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> should help to achieve improved synthesis for high quality oligonucleotide microarrays...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{news of the}} storm, {{businesses}} in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> windows. Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200–5,000 residents, {{most of whom were}} black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds. Aday before the storm, the lake level reached , heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake. The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and coffee to evacuees. On the west coast of the state, some residents covered their windows, but many others did not, anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm. Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left their homes for safety, while boaters secured their vessels.|$|E
