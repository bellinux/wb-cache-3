25|$|Since its inception, the SAP-FL {{has focused}} on raising global {{awareness}} of forced labour in its different forms, and mobilizing action against its manifestation. Several thematic and country-specific studies and surveys have since been undertaken, on such diverse aspects of forced labour as bonded labour, human trafficking, forced domestic work, rural servitude, and forced <b>prison</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1851, an ad-hoc {{group of}} {{structures}} built by <b>prison</b> <b>labour</b> using local materials existed. None of these structures survived, {{other than the}} boundaries of the prison that were established. The second phase of construction, undertaken in the late 1850s and early 1860s, was the construction of Inspector General William Champ's model prison complex, based on British and American precedents.|$|E
25|$|Francia outlawed all opposition, and {{established}} a secret police force. His underground prison {{was known as the}} 'chamber of truth', and most of Paraguay's manufactures were made with <b>prison</b> <b>labour.</b> He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a banquillo ("stool") under an orange tree outside his window. So as not to waste bullets, most victims were bayoneted, while their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day, {{to make sure they were}} dead.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{analysis}} of the types of <b>prisons</b> and <b>labour</b> camps, their structure and organization as well as the position of convicted persons while serving the punishment of imprisonment in Albania during the communist dictatorship period. During this time-period and up to the triumph of democracy in Albania (1944 - 1991) a large number of <b>prisons</b> and <b>labour</b> camps functioned and operated for the serving of punishment for a large number of convicted persons, the majority part of whom where political prisoners. The large number of prisoners during this time-period as well as of <b>prisons</b> and <b>labour</b> camps was most of all a consequence of cruel punitive policy lead by the Albanian communist state, which as such was directed solely against the opposers of the communist regime. In this line, a well deserved place will be allocated to the organization of <b>prisons</b> and <b>labour</b> camps, the purpose of punishment with imprisonment and the position of convicted persons while serving their punishment. The scope {{of this article is to}} separately shed light upon the types and purpose of establishment of <b>prisons</b> and <b>labour</b> camps, the harsh positions of convicted persons, the limitation of their rights and inhuman treatment during the monist Albanian state period...|$|R

25|$|During the Otago Gold Rush in the 1860s {{pleasure}} gardens {{were established}} at Vauxhall; George Grey Russell built his house at Glenfalloch and William Larnach acquired {{the land for}} his big house at Pukehiki, 'Larnach Castle'. A lighthouse was built at Taiaroa Head in 1864 and work began using <b>prison</b> <b>labour,</b> sometimes including Maori prisoners of war, to build the winding harbourside road, with its distinctive seawalls of the local stone. Across the cleared land settlers built dry stone walls, following the pattern of 'Galloway Dykes', another conspicuous and distinctive feature of the landscape whose only other examples in New Zealand are across the harbour on the opposite heights. Stone lime kilns were built near Sandymount in 1864.|$|E
25|$|The USSR {{experienced}} a major famine from 1946 to 1947. As many as 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result. The conditions {{were caused by}} drought, the effects of which were exacerbated by the devastation caused byWorld War II. British economist Michael Ellman argues {{that it could have}} been prevented if the government had not mismanaged its grain reserves. The famine cost an estimated 1 to 1.5million lives as well as secondary population losses due to reduced fertility. In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities. While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north. Much of this was constructed by <b>prison</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} property, Hokutan also bought the rights for prison labor, so the miners mostly {{consisted}} of prisoners. It continued until 1894, when the Meiji government {{under the pressure}} of the public opinion led by Protestant prison director Ōinoue Terusaki (1848-1912), decided on the abolition of <b>prison</b> <b>labour.</b> The prisoners were substituted by other forms of recruitment as that of subcontractors (飯場制度, hanbaseidō) and direct recruitment as well as a thorough mechanization. In 1938, the Tokiwakō (常磐坑), two inclined shafts were mined. Along these the coal was transported towards the coal preparation plant. In 1952, these shafts were equipped with conveyor belts. When in 1967, the Horonai mine merged with the Shin-Horonai mine (新幌内炭鉱, shin Horonai tankō), these belts transported coal from a depth of 520 meters, over a distance of 2.720 meters towards the plant. The merged Hokutan Horonai mine was equipped with two modern deep shafts and used drum cutters since 1968, which made {{it one of the most}} modern mines of Japan.|$|E

500|$|In 1867, <b>prison</b> <b>labour</b> from Adelaide Gaol {{was used}} to build a wooden dam {{near the site of}} the current weir. The dam was poorly {{constructed}} and almost immediately the Torrens washed it away. Construction of a permanent concrete weir was begun in November 1880 and completed, at a cost of £7,000, in 1881. The sluice gates were closed to begin filling the [...] Torrens Lake on 1 July 1881. At the lake's official opening on 21 July 1881 an estimated 40,000, almost the entire population of Adelaide, attended. During the 1889 flood, the weir was overwhelmed, its gates jammed, and in trying to free them the weir's designer John Langdon was crippled. The weir was rebuilt from 1928 to 1929 with its footbridge relocated and the centre section replaced. The gates can now be fully raised and the river allowed to flow unimpeded.|$|E

Swan and sister ship [...] were stripped down, and their hulks were sold to New South Wales Penal Department and towed to Cowan Creek, where {{they were used to}} house prisoner labourers working on roads along the Hawkesbury River. Public outcry opposed this use of <b>prison</b> <b>labour,</b> so two hulks were sold in 1933 for 12 pounds each to George Rhodes of Cowan, New South Wales, who intended to use them as accommodation for fishers. Rhodes' plan did not gain government approval, and the ships were sold on to a pair of fishermen, who used them to transport blue metal to Milson and Peat Islands.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Nelson Provincial Council {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} with the government for the extension to be built and had committed £8,000 to the project, the issue of widening Haven Road meant that there were insufficient funds to complete the work. [...] Negotiations to overcome the impasse continued through 1877 until May 1878 when it was announced that the project was to be suspended indefinitely. [...] In response, a local deputation left for Wellington on 4 June to prevail upon the authorities the need for the extension and were rewarded the following day when a contract was awarded for the [...] of formation. [...] The government subsidised the work to help cover the cost of widening the road and allowed the use of <b>prison</b> <b>labour.</b> [...] Work began in July and the line was ready for use on 17 May 1880, coinciding with control of the Government Wharf passing to the Railways Department.|$|E
