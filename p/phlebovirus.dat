40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{presented}} virus sequences which suggest {{the existence of}} a variety of putative new <b>phleboviruses</b> transmitted by sandflies in the Old World. However, in most of these studies, only partial sequences in the polymerase or the nucleoprotein genes were characterised. Therefore to further our understand of the presence and potential medical importance of sandfly-borne <b>phleboviruses</b> that circulate in southern Anatolia, we initiated field campaigns in 2012 and 2013 designed to identify, isolate and characterise <b>phleboviruses</b> in sandflies in this region. An entomological investigation encompassing 8 villages in Adana, Mediterranean Turkey was performed in August and September 2012 and 2013. A total of 11, 302 sandflies were collected and grouped into 797 pools which were tested for the presence of <b>phleboviruses</b> using specific primers for RT-PCR analysis and also cell culture methods for virus isolation. Seven pools were PCR positive, and viruses were isolated from three pools of sandflies, resulting in the identification of two new viruses that we named Zerdali virus and Toros virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genomic sequence showed that Zerdali virus was most closely related with Tehran virus (and belongs to the Sandfly fever Naples species), whereas Toros virus was closest to Corfou virus. The results indicate that a variety of <b>phleboviruses</b> are co-circulating in this region of southern Anatolia. Based on our studies, these new viruses clearly belong to genetic groups that include several human pathogens. However, whether or not Toros and Zerdali viruses can infect humans and cause diseases such as sandfly fever remains to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBunyaviruses {{represent}} a growing threat to humans and livestock globally. The receptors, cellular factors and endocytic pathways used by these emerging pathogens to infect cells remain largely unidentified and poorly characterized. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin highly expressed on dermal dendritic cells {{that has been}} found to act as an authentic entry receptor for many <b>phleboviruses</b> (Bunyaviridae), including Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Toscana virus (TOSV) and Uukuniemi virus (UUKV). We found that these <b>phleboviruses</b> can exploit another C-type lectin, L-SIGN, for infection. L-SIGN shares 77 % sequence homology with DC-SIGN and is expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. L-SIGN is required for UUKV binding but not for virus internalization. An endocytosis-defective mutant of L-SIGN was still able to mediate virus uptake and infection, indicating that L-SIGN acts as an attachment receptor for <b>phleboviruses</b> rather than an endocytic receptor. Our results point out a fundamental difference {{in the use of the}} C-type lectins L-SIGN and DC-SIGN by UUKV to enter cells, although both proteins are closely related in terms of molecular structure and biological function.

40|$|Evolutionary {{insights}} into the <b>phleboviruses</b> are limited because of an imprecise classification scheme based on partial nucleotide sequences and scattered antigenic relationships. In this report, the serologic and phylogenetic relationships of the Uukuniemi group viruses and their relationships with other recently characterized tick-borne <b>phleboviruses</b> are described using full length genome sequences. We propose that the viruses currently included in the Uukuniemi virus group be assigned to five different species as follows: Uukuniemi virus, EgAn 1825 - 61 virus, Fin V 707 virus, Chiz√© virus, and Zaliv Terpenia virus would be classified into the Uukuniemi species; Murre virus, RML- 105 - 105355 virus, and Sunday Canyon virus would be classified into a Murre virus species; and Grand Arbaud virus, Precarious Point virus, and Manawa virus would each be given individual species status. Although limited sequence similarity was detected between current members of the Uukuniemi group and Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Heartland virus, a clear serological reaction was observed between some of them, indicating that SFTSV and Heartland virus should be {{considered part of the}} Uukuniemi virus group. Moreover, based on the genomic diversity of the <b>phleboviruses</b> and given the low correlation observed between complement fixation titers and genetic distance, we propose a system for classification of the Bunyaviridae based on genetic as well as serological data.

We examined various species of phlebotomus present in Tunisia {{to determine whether or}} not a direct relationship exists between cases of meningitis and the viruses circulating in the insect vectors. Methods: Patients with the meningeal syndrome were tested for anti-TOSV IgM and IgG using an indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and for the presence of TOSV and other <b>Phleboviruses</b> using a RT-PCR test. An entomological study was carried out using CDC light traps to trap sandflies in different bioclimatic zones of Tunisia. Collected sandflies were tested by RT-PCR for the presence of TOSV and other <b>Phleboviruses</b> and subsequently by viral isolation on Vero cells. Results: Of 263 patients were tested using ELISA of which 12. 16 % (n = 32 / 263) were IgM positive for anti TOSV. Of these 32 patients, 78 % (n = 25 / 32) were IgG positive. 12. 86 % (n = 18 / 140) of the CSF samples tested by RT-PCR were positive for the Toscana virus. One CSF sample tested by RT-PCR revealed the presence of Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus (SFSV). The Punique virus was identified in one sandfly pool. Conclusions: This study confirms, for the first time, that TOSV is involved in a neurological disorder in North Africa. The incidence of this involvement in Tunisia conforms with observations made in other Mediterranean countries.

40|$|Background: In {{northern}} Tunisia, the co-circulation of {{two related}} sand fly-borne <b>phleboviruses,</b> Toscana virus (TOSV) and Punique virus (PUNV) was previously demonstrated. In contrast to TOSV, a prominent human pathogen, {{there is no}} data supporting that PUNV is capable to infect and cause disease to humans. We studied the respective involvement of TOSV and PUNV in human infections in northern Tunisia through a seroprevalence study. Methods: The presence of TOSV and PUNV neutralising antibodies (NT-Ab) was tested in human sera collected from 5 districts of the governorate of Bizerte, and the titres of NT-Ab were estimated by microneutralisation (MN) assay. Principal Findings: A total of 1, 273 sera were processed. TOSV and PUNV NT-Ab were detected in 522 (41 %) and 111 sera (8. 72 %) respectively.

Reactions of identity occurred in all tests between LUN and the Zimbabwean strains of RVF and between the two strains of AMT virus. Otherwise, cross-reactions occurred between all the <b>phleboviruses</b> in HAI tests, while reactions in CF, ID and neutralization tests were monospecific for virus serotypes, except that weak cross-reaction occurred between GOR and SAF viruses in CF and ID tests. Four sheep infected subcutaneously with the Zimbabwean strain of RVF virus developed transient fever, viraemia, leucopaenia, relative thrombocytopaenia, haemoconcentration and raised serum enzyme levels, which indicated that the sheep had developed necrotic hepatitis. Disseminated focal necrotic hepatitis was confirmed in a sheep killed for examination on day 4 post-infection. The other three sheep recovered uneventfully after only mild depression and anorexia. Groups of three sheep infected with SAF, GOR, AMT and GF viruses had no demonstrable viraemia or other sign of infection or illness, except that the sheep infected with AMT developed mild fever lasting less than 24 h. Antibody responses were monitored at intervals {{over a period of}} 24 weeks in all sheep by homologous and heterologous HAI, CF and cell culture neutralization (CPENT) tests. Homologous antibody responses were marked in the RVF-infected sheep and their sera cross-reacted strongly in HAI tests with antigens of the other viruses. The sera of the RVF-infected sheep cross-reacted less markedly in CF and CPENT tests. Homologous antibody responses were poor in all the sheep infected with <b>phleboviruses</b> other than RVF, and the cross-reactivity of their sera for RVF antigen or virus was negligible. All sheep were challenged with RVF virus 48 weeks after their initial infection. The sheep which had originally been infected with RVF virus were immune and developed neither fever nor viraemia.

40|$|The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is {{responsible}} for numerous, explosive epizootics throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The virus causes disease predominantly in humans and livestock, with sheep and cattle being particularly susceptible. In humans, the disease generally manifests as a flu-like illness; however, in {{a small percentage of}} cases, severe symptoms develop, such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever disease. In these severe cases, mortality rates are high. Livestock often succumb to the viral infection, and case-fatality rates are particularly high among young animals. Outbreaks are devastating to the public health and regional economies, and the development of antiviral therapies is difficult due to the limited understanding of the RVFV replicative cycle. We have developed a system for the generation of Rift Valley fever virus-like particles (RVF-VLPs). The RVF-VLPs are antigenically and morphologically indistinguishable from virulent RVFV virus, but can only perform a single round of infection. Using the virus-like particle system for RVFV, in combination with biochemical and crystallization techniques, we have elucidated the roles of the viral proteins in multiple steps of the viral replicative cycle. Specifically, we describe crucial interactions necessary for replication and transcription, elucidate the structure of the nucleocapsid protein, identify the envelope glycoprotein, Gn, as necessary and sufficient for the recruitment and packaging of the RdRp and encapsidated genome into virus particles, determine that the encapsidated genome triggers the efficient release of virus, and ascertain the limitations governing RVFV reassortment with other <b>phleboviruses.</b> Based on our results, we suggest targets for the development of therapeutics directed against RVFV and other <b>phleboviruses...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} decade, novel tick-borne {{pathogenic}} <b>phleboviruses</b> {{in the family}} Bunyaviridae, all closely related to Uukuniemi virus (UUKV), have emerged on different continents. To reproduce the tick-mammal switch in vitro, we first established a reverse genetics system to rescue UUKV with a genome close {{to that of the}} authentic virus isolated from the Ixodes ricinus tick reservoir. The IRE/CTVM 19 and IRE/CTVM 20 cell lines, both derived from I. ricinus, were susceptible to the virus rescued from plasmid DNAs and supported production of the virus over many weeks, indicating that infection was persistent. The glycoprotein GC was mainly highly mannosylated on tick cell-derived viral progeny. The second envelope viral protein, GN, carried mostly N-glycans not recognized by the classical glycosidases peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and endoglycosidase H (Endo H). Treatment with Œ≤-mercaptoethanol did not impact the apparent molecular weight of GN On viruses originating from mammalian BHK- 21 cells, GN glycosylations were exclusively sensitive to PNGase F, and the electrophoretic mobility of the protein was substantially slower after the reduction of disulfide bonds. Furthermore, the amount of viral nucleoprotein per focus forming unit differed markedly whether viruses were produced in tick or BHK- 21 cells, suggesting a higher infectivity for tick cell-derived viruses. Together, our results indicate that UUKV particles derived from vector tick cells have glycosylation and structural specificities that may influence the initial infection in mammalian hosts. This study also highlights the importance of working with viruses originating from arthropod vector cells in investigations of the cell biology of arbovirus transmission and entry into mammalian hosts. Tick-borne <b>phleboviruses</b> represent a growing threat to humans globally. Although ticks are important vectors of infectious emerging diseases, previous studies have mainly involved virus stocks produced in mammalian cells. This limitation tends to minimize the importance of host alternation in virus transmission to humans and initial infection at the molecular level. With this study, we have developed an in vitro tick cell-based model that allows production of the tick-borne Uukuniemi virus to high titers. Using this system, we found that virions derived from tick cells have specific structural properties and N-glycans that may enhance virus infectivity for mammalian cells. By shedding light on molecular aspects of tick-derived viral particles, our data illustrate the importance of considering the host switch in studying early virus-mammalian receptor/cell interactions. The information gained here lays the basis for future research on not only tick-borne <b>phleboviruses</b> but also all viruses and other pathogens transmitted by ticks...|$|R
