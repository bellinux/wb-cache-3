40|$|Introduction: The {{reliable}} bond at the root-post-core interface {{is critical}} for the clinical success of post-retained restorations. To decrease the risk of fracture, {{it is important to}} optimize the adhesion. Therefore, various post surface treatments have been proposed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of various surface treatments of fiber posts on the bond strength to composite core. Materials & Methods: In this study, 40 fiber reinforced posts were used. After preparing and sectioning them, resulting specimens were divided into four groups (N= 28). The posts received different surface treatments such as no surface treatment (control group), <b>preparing</b> <b>with</b> hydrogen peroxide 10 %, <b>preparing</b> <b>with</b> silane, <b>preparing</b> <b>with</b> HF and silane). Then, posts were tested in micro tensile testing machine. The results were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA and Dunnett T 3 test. Results: The greatest bond strength observed was in treatment with hydrogen peroxide 10 % (19. 84 ± 8. 95 MPa), and the lowest strength was related to the control group (12. 44 ± 3. 40 MPa). The comparison of the groups with Dunnett T 3 test showed that the differences between the groups was statistically significant (α= 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, <b>preparing</b> <b>with</b> H 2 O 2 - 10 % and silane increases the bond strength of FRC posts to the composite core more than the other methods. Generally, the bond strength of posts to the composite core increases by surface treatment...|$|R
