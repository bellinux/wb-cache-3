500|$|M-21 was {{designated}} {{along the highway}} by July 1, 1919 between Ionia and Goodells near Port Huron. Changes made in the 1920s extended it on the west end to Holland and on the east end to Port Huron. [...] M-21 was truncated at both of its current termini as two Interstate freeways were completed. [...] I-196 functionally replaced M-21 between Holland and Grand Rapids with a <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> under state maintenance as Old M-21, now M-121. I-69 replaced M-21 from Flint to Port Huron. A section of M-21 through Flint became M-56. That designation was decommissioned in the 1980s when M-21 was returned to its former routing in Flint.|$|E
500|$|East of the Vistulans, eastern Lesser Poland was the {{territory}} of the Lendian tribe (Lędzianie, the Bavarian Geographer's [...] "Lendizi"). In the mid-10th century Constantine VII wrote their name as Lendzaneoi. The Lendians had to be a very substantial tribe, since the names for Poland in the Lithuanian and Hungarian languages and for the Poles in medieval Ruthenian all begin with the letter [...] "L" [...] and are derived from the name of this tribe. The Poles historically have also referred to themselves as [...] "Lechici". After the fall of Great Moravia, the Magyars controlled at least part of {{the territory}} of the Lendians. They were conquered by Kievan Rus' during 930–940. At the end of the 10th century, the Lendian lands became divided; the western part was taken by Poland, the eastern <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> by Kievan Rus'.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Rolls-Royce {{acquired}} Vickers plc for its marine businesses. [...] The <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> is now Vinters Engineering Limited.

50|$|In 2012 ConocoPhillips {{split into}} two {{separate}} companies, with the upstream <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> the ConocoPhillips name and the refining and transportation portions taking the name Phillips66.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, it {{was reduced}} to its current size in a {{three-way}} split with the western <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> area code 915, the eastern portion (Abilene, San Angelo, etc.) becoming 325, and the central portion (the Permian Basin) becoming 432.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the island}} remains unincorporated, with the western portion known as Harbor Island, and the northeastern <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> the name Barnum Island. However, all three make up the {{original}} Hog Island/Barnum Island, and {{are part of the}} Town of Hempstead.|$|R
2500|$|One {{year later}} in 1686, Albany was {{chartered}} {{as a city}} under the Dongan Charter, authored by Governor Dongan. During Kiliaen's tenure as patroon, he served in many political appointed positions in Albany, including assessor, justice, and supervisor, and represented Rensselaerswyck in the New York General Assembly. In 1704, Kiliaen split Rensselaerswyck into two portions, the southern portion, or [...] "Lower Manor" [...] (comprising Greenbush and Claverack), placed under the eye of his brother Hendrick. The northern <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> the title Rensselaerswyck.|$|E

50|$|The five-mile segment between David Road in Kettering, Ohio and State Route 725 in Centerville, Ohio {{that runs}} through Washington Township is the last {{remaining}} traceable <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> the original name and following the original route. It is still in daily use more than 200 years later.|$|R
5000|$|St Mary the Virgin Church was {{the place}} of worship for the ancient parish of Latton. Following the {{creation}} of Harlow New Town in 1947 and the subsequent expansion in population the parish was divided in three with the northern <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> the name of Latton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{property}} comprising 40000 acre {{had been}} established in 1852 and was owned by John S. Davis, J. P. Walcott and M. Logue who dissolved their partnership in 1854. The land was divided with Davis' <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> the name of Tibradden [...] comprising approximately 25000 acre, Walcott naming his Miininooka and Logue calling his Ellendale.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, {{the riding}} was {{subdivided}} into three parts. The northern portion became the new riding of York Mills, the middle portion became the riding of Don Mills {{and the southern}} <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> the name York East.|$|E

50|$|In 1929 Ontario Hydro {{constructed}} a dam at Ear Falls {{to control the}} level of the lake to produce hydroelectricity. The flooding from turning the lake into a reservoir caused the area known previously as Kejick Bay to become an island, permanently separating it from the mainland and splitting the community into two parts. The island <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> the name Kejick Bay and the portion of the community on the mainland became Whitefish Bay.|$|E
25|$|The Sexton Cup is {{presented}} to {{the winner of the}} varsity heavyweight race. The trophy is actually a combination of two former rowing trophies: The bottom is the original base of the Sexton Cup, with year-by-year results of race winners, while the upper <b>portion</b> <b>retains</b> the Yale and Harvard seals from the trophy which was awarded to the winner of the (now discontinued) graduate eights race.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1616 by the Kingdom of Portugal, Belém was {{the first}} European colony on the Amazon but did not become part of Brazil until 1775. The newer {{part of the city}} has modern {{buildings}} and skyscrapers. The colonial <b>portion</b> <b>retains</b> the charm of tree-filled squares, churches and traditional blue tiles. The city has a rich history and architecture from colonial times. Recently it witnessed a skyscraper boom.|$|R
2500|$|Towering over {{everything}} else in the town, is the former monastery of San Juan Baustista (John the Baptist). This monastery is part of the series of monasteries near the Popocatepetl volcano which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1994. [...] Today only the church <b>portion</b> <b>retains</b> its original function and serves as the parish church for the municipality. The patron saint of the town is John the Baptist, whose feast day is celebrated on 24 June.|$|R
50|$|Dundas {{was created}} when Parramatta was split almost in half. The western <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> the Parramatta name, while the eastern portion became Dundas. The new seat {{included}} {{nearly all of}} the Liberal-friendly areas of the old Parramatta, and was thus a natural choice for Parramatta's former member, Philip Ruddock, to transfer before the 1977 election. Ruddock held it without serious difficulty until 1993, when the seat was abolished. Its territory was split between Parramatta, Bennelong and Berowra. Ruddock opted to transfer to Berowra.|$|E

50|$|The Mexican {{governors}} carved {{the area}} around the mission into three large ranchos: Rancho Trabuco, Rancho Mission Viejo, and Rancho Santa Margarita. James L. Flood and his partner Jerome O’Neill purchased the combined ranchos in 1882. The huge estate was run as a working ranch into the 1920s. In 1940, the ranch was divided, with the Flood family taking the lower portion, in today's San Diego County, with the upper <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> by the O'Neill family. In 1942, the Navy annexed the Flood family’s portion of the ranch for use as Camp Joseph H. Pendleton.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper level}} {{verandah}} runs {{the length of}} the northern side providing access to south-facing classrooms. The verandah is enclosed with aluminium-framed sliding windows, has a balustrade of bag racks, and a raked ceiling lined with sheet material and rounded cover strips. The verandah wall of the western <b>portion</b> <b>retains</b> chamferboard lining and banks of original timber-framed, double-hung sash windows with pivot-hung fanlights (all with original hardware), but modern doors. The verandah wall of the eastern portion has been altered by the insertion of large openings, removing all windows and doors.|$|R
50|$|Conventional wisdom {{would have}} {{suggested}} that Lexington and Northern Kentucky would have retained 606 in the 1999 split. Lexington {{was by far the}} largest city in the old 606 territory, and it and Northern Kentucky accounted for two-thirds of the old 606's population. However, several counties in eastern Kentucky are among the poorest in the nation. The Kentucky Public Service Commission and BellSouth (now part of AT&T), then the region's main telephone carrier, decided to let the rural <b>portion</b> <b>retain</b> 606 in order to spare a notoriously impoverished area the added expense and burden of switching to a new area code.|$|R

50|$|SPE {{uses the}} {{affinity}} of solutes dissolved or suspended in a liquid (known as the mobile phase) for a solid {{through which the}} sample is passed (known as the stationary phase) to separate a mixture into desired and undesired components. The result is that either the desired analytes of interest or undesired impurities in the sample are retained on the stationary phase. The portion that passes through the stationary phase is collected or discarded, depending on whether it contains the desired analytes or undesired impurities. If the <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> on the stationary phase includes the desired analytes, they can then {{be removed from the}} stationary phase for collection in an additional step, in which the stationary phase is rinsed with an appropriate eluent.|$|E
50|$|The region {{currently}} {{belonging to}} Area code 863 was originally part of Area code 305, which covered {{the entire state}} of Florida. In 1953, the southwest Florida coast split off into area code 813, while all of north Florida split off into the area code 904 in 1965, and the southeast <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> 305. The 813 area code was untouched for 43 years until 1996 when the 13 counties outside of the immediate Tampa Bay area (all but Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Pasco counties) were given the Area code 941. In 1999, the 863 area code took its current form as the coastal counties of the 941 Area code kept 941, while the rest were given the new 863 area code.|$|E
60|$|This book is {{more than}} a mere reprint of Birds in a Village first {{published}} in 1893. That was my first book about bird life, with some impressions of rural scenes, in England; and, {{as is often the case}} with a first book, its author has continued to cherish a certain affection for it. On this account it pleased me when its turn came to be reissued, since this gave me the opportunity of mending some faults in the <b>portions</b> <b>retained</b> and of throwing out a good deal of matter which appeared to me not worth keeping.|$|R
50|$|E. W. Marland {{built the}} Ponca City {{refinery}} in 1918 and founded the Marland Oil Company. In 1929, the Continental Oil Company merged with Marland, {{and the two}} became Conoco Inc. The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company, whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips. In 2012 ConocoPhillips split into two separate companies, with the upstream <b>portion</b> <b>retaining</b> the ConocoPhillips name and the refining and transportation portions taking the name Phillips66. The Ponca City Refinery, operated by Phillips66, is the largest refinery {{in the state of}} Oklahoma.|$|R

40|$|Some {{thiophene}} analogues of bifonazole {{have been}} synthesized by standard procedures and their antifungal activity {{has been tested}} against Candida albicans. Among test derivatives bipbenyl- 4 -yl- 5 -chloro-thien- 2 -ylimidazol- 1 -ylmethane and its 5 -deschlorothien- 2 -yl analogue resulted {{to be the most}} active. Their antifungal potency was almost comparable to that of control substances, such as miconazole, ketoconazole, and bifonazole. Replacement of benzene by the Pyrrole ring in the biphenyl <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> almost quantitatively the antifungal activity, whereas substitution with other azoles and with nitrogen alicyclic rings led always to less potent derivatives...|$|E
40|$|The {{partition}} of South Sudan from the largest {{country on the}} African continent – Sudan, took place on July 9, 2011. 1 The northern <b>portion</b> <b>retained</b> the name Sudan while the newly formed southern state would be known as South Sudan. South Sudan became {{the newest member of}} the United Nations (UN) with comparatively little infrastructure and limited arrangements for shared sovereignty by the international community. The partition process was undertaken with oversight from the United Nations and the African Union. It was rather idealistically considered a prelude to an enduring peace within this traditionally troubled African region. The former unitary state of Sudan had been plagued by bitter internecine conflict {{for more than half a}} century, and as a result, an estimated 2. 5 million people lost their lives and over five million were internally displaced...|$|E
