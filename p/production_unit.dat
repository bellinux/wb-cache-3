5|$|Kurosawa, with {{producer}} Sōjirō Motoki {{and fellow}} directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi, formed a new independent <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai).

40|$|Full-cost {{transfer}} pricing {{has been criticized}} for providing <b>production</b> <b>units</b> with insufficient incentives to economize. Our empirical study based on data from a large producer of consumer goods shows that charging fullcost transfer prices to downstream sales units can send upstream <b>production</b> <b>units</b> into a death spiral. However, our results also suggest that <b>production</b> <b>units</b> reduce costs to prevent the death spiral. We observe that managers focus their cost-cutting efforts on unit variable costs and on products with the best sales prospects. These results also suggest that, when <b>production</b> <b>units</b> are at risk of falling into a death spiral, full-cost {{transfer pricing}} can serve as a credible commitment device to motivate managers to reduce costs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPresently, DCS {{is not a}} just {{technical}} tool of control of <b>production</b> <b>units,</b> but it's developed to be placed at {{the centre of the}} process as an essential tool for mastering and managing of <b>production</b> <b>units.</b> These technological advances are transforming DCS strategic equipment in plants and companies in general. It's necessary to properly develop and highlight the minimum requirements to be imposed when choosing of DCS, especially for <b>production</b> <b>units</b> of phosphate derivatives having specificities and particular constraints, in order to achieve the required performance and take account of the requirements of the processes operated. OCP has introduced the DCS and their new technologies since 1997 in the <b>production</b> <b>units</b> of Phosphoric Acid and Fertilizers. Now, a perfect mastering of the development of specifications and a confirmed knowledge on the functioning of DCS are certainly acquired by the local skills of OCP. As a result, the need to take benefit and exploit more resources and new features of DCS is logically emerged. This has given rise to development of other increasing axes of improvement in the <b>production</b> <b>units.</b> OCP included two main lines: the opening of DCS to other networks of the Company and the operating fully automatic and smart of <b>production</b> <b>units</b> through the use of advanced controls such as predictive control, fuzzy logic, optimal neural [...] ...|$|R
