There is also agricultural land, especially in the northwestern and southern parts of {{the watershed}} and small areas of developed land in the watershed's southern section. 64.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in the watershed upstream of Eyers Grove is forested land and 34.7 percent is agricultural land. 0.7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> is developed and the remaining 0.2 percent has other uses.|$|E
5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E

The rush was also slowed by the legislature deciding that no borough created thereafter could maintain a separate school system unless {{there were at least}} 400 children living within its limits. With the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders by then at 28 members, divided evenly between the parties, the legislature passed a bill setting the number of members of such boards in third-class counties (including Bergen) at 9, with the freeholders elected from the Delford-style boroughs to go out of office on May 8. Nevertheless, on May 9, electors in what became the borough of Englewood Cliffs voted to secede from Englewood, 34–1.|$|E
