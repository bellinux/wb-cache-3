5|$|When his {{re-election}} in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic Party should form a coalition with the Freedom Party, headed by Friedrich Peter.

He decided not to reveal this information to the press until after the election, but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger.

5|$|A year passes.

Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and <b>Peter</b> <b>had</b> an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E

5|$|After sending Meg out on {{an errand}} {{to pick up her}} grandfather, Lois {{continues}} to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since <b>Peter</b> <b>had</b> begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to the Jolly Farm studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to recognize him, he forgets that he is not dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona. A similar scene is featured in the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, starring actor Robin Williams. Stewie and Jolly Farm make a reference to Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747–100 destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 occupants. Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270. A song features on Jolly Farm that explicitly describes debris from the newly disintegrated plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of that of a nursery rhyme.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh was educated, {{along with}} his younger brother Charles, at Trinity College, Oxford. Although Charles was a studious young man, who planned to enter the church on graduation, <b>Peter</b> <b>had</b> an active social life in both Oxford and London. He holidayed in {{southern}} resorts including St Leonards-on-Sea, a new development in Sussex, where he admired the work of architect James Burton. He became close friends with Burton's son Decimus, who was also an architect. The two men {{were involved in the}} formation of London's Athenaeum Club and Burton designed the club's building in Pall Mall. Hesketh received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1823 and his Master of Arts degree in 1826. That same year, he married Eliza Debonnaire Metcalfe, the daughter of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, 2nd Baronet, commonly known by her middle name. Debonnaire's father gave the couple a house in Dover, but they also spent time at the Rossall estate. The couple were very close to Charles and his new wife Anna, and their sister Anna, and her husband Thomas Knowlys. Charles was ordained in 1828 and as patron of St Chad's Church in Poulton-le-Fylde, Peter presented his brother with that curacy.|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but <b>Peter</b> <b>had</b> little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E

5|$|Their engagement, {{announced}} in May 1901, was unexpected {{by family and}} friends, as <b>Peter</b> <b>had</b> shown no prior interest in women, and members of society assumed he was homosexual. At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning. Their marriage remained unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, or avoid marriage into a foreign court. The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. It was not an harmonious arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Eugénie, {{a close friend of}} the Dowager Empress, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law. A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.|$|E
