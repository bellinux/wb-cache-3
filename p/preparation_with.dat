5|$|The Australians {{crossed the}} border into South Africa and Davidson scored 100 and took a total of 4/62 against Transvaal as Craig's men started with a nine-wicket win. The next match was against a South African XI, and was {{effectively}} a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Davidson scored 34 and took a total of 7/103 as the Australians crushed the hosts by an innings.

After a game in Palermo with Inter Milan on 21 July, Benfica returned to Portugal the next day, meeting up with Sporting in the Superbola Trophy on the 28th.

5|$|Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues (based on Giuseppe Chiara, {{who later}} in the film {{goes by the name}} Okada San'emon). In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the <b>preparation</b> <b>with</b> Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle and frame of mind which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E
40|$|Dried <b>preparations</b> <b>with</b> Streptococcus faecium, strain A 21, and spores of Bacillus sphaericus, strain CIA, {{normally}} used {{for control of}} the microbiological efficiency of radiation sterilization plants and <b>preparations</b> <b>with</b> spores of Bacillus subtilis, {{normally used}} for control of sterilization by dry heat, formalin, and ethylene oxide, as well as similar <b>preparations</b> <b>with</b> Micrococcus radiodurans, strain R 1, and spores of Bacillus globigii (B. subtilis, var. niger) were gamma irradiated with dose rates from 16 to 70 krad/h at temperatures from 60 to 100 C. At 80 C the radiation response of the spore preparations was the same as at room temperature, whereas the radiation resistance of the <b>preparations</b> <b>with</b> the two vegetative strains was reduced. At 100 C the radiation response of <b>preparations</b> <b>with</b> spores of B. subtilis was unaffected by the high temperature, whereas at 16 and and 25 krad/h the radiation resistance of the radiation-resistant sporeformer B. sphaericus, strain CIA, was reduced to the level of radiation resistance of <b>preparations</b> <b>with</b> spores of B. subtilis. It is concluded that combinations of heat and gamma irradiation at the temperatures and dose rates tested may have very few practical applications in sterilization of medical equipment...|$|R

5|$|Feyenoord had {{its first}} {{training}} {{session in the}} Kuip on 26 June 2013 in front of 5,000 fans.

Feyenoord played Eerste Divisie side FC Dordrecht to close out their Dutch summer friendlies and drew the game away in Dordrecht. On 21 July Feyenoord had its annual Open Dag (Open Day) which was visited by 40,000 fans. Four new players were flown into the Kuip per helicopter and the full team was officially presented to the fans. Feyenoord then went on a training camp in Levico Terme and played the Italian side Hellas Verona there, a game that ended in a defeat. Feyenoord ended the pre-season <b>preparation</b> <b>with</b> a 3–1 home win over Getafe.|$|E
5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of <b>preparation</b> <b>with</b> every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E

500|$|By then, {{war between}} the Poles and the Ottomans was in <b>preparation,</b> <b>with</b> clashes {{between the two sides}} {{occurring}} in 1484. Scholar Șerban Papacostea notes that Casimir IV had always remained neutral during Stephen's conflicts with the Ottomans, but the Ottoman control of the mouths of the Dnieper and the Danube threatened Poland. The king, Papacostea argues, also wanted to strengthen his suzerainty over Moldavia, which helped him decide to intervene in the conflict on Stephen's behalf. Casimir formed or joined with an anti-Ottoman league, which, in 1485, had also gathered reluctant support from the Teutonic Knights. Historians provide different readings of the issue: according to Robert Nisbet Bain, Casimir's intervention also drove the Ottomans out of Moldavia; Veniamin Ciobanu however argues that the Polish involvement remained non-military, purely diplomatic.|$|E
500|$|Prawer {{found that}} he was unhappy with mathematics, and his father {{suggested}} he study history instead since he had always enjoyed history in high school. His professor, Richard Koebner, an Anglophile historian of imperialism, set him on the course of studying the crusader colonies in the Holy Land. The close ties to Koebner were likely to have instilled in Prawer his interest in the history of settlements and colonialization. Prawer began his teaching career at the Hebrew University in 1947 and (after fighting in the 1948 siege of Jerusalem) soon rose through the faculty ranks. He became deputy dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1953–55, was made professor and chair of medieval history in 1958, was dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1962–66, and served as prorector at the university in the years 197578. In the process, he succeeded in making the [...] university into a [...] "global center" [...] for Crusade Studies, and trained many future Israeli historians in that specialty. [...] Prawer has been described as an outstanding teacher and lecturer who combined thorough <b>preparation</b> <b>with</b> a charismatic style. He was often invited to lecture abroad.|$|E
