5|$|In a {{significant}} difference from other woodswallows, dusky woodswallows have a distinctive white <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the outer wing. Dusky woodswallows also seem to typically be more smoky brown than other species of woodswallow. The little woodswallow, a smaller, darker woodswallow is also slightly more smoky brown that other woodswallows, {{but that is the}} only similarity that the latter has with the dusky woodswallow; the little woodswallow does not share a white <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the outer wing.|$|E

5|$|A. c. woodwardi Mathews, 1912 – {{southwest}} and south-central Australia {{west of the}} Mount Lofty Ranges. This subspecies is a little smaller than the nominate subspecies and has shorter wings. Its plumage is similar though the yellow <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the belly is more prominent.|$|E
50|$|Two {{generations of}} this boot were produced: The '98 version can be {{distinguished}} by two red <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> the heel, whereas the '99 version does not have these red <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> the heel.|$|R
50|$|Rostanga dentacus {{is a red}} dorid nudibranch; the dorsum {{covered with}} caryophyllidia. There are a few rounded brown <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> the back, and {{scattered}} white specks both {{at the edge of}} the mantle and in <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> the back. The rhinophore club is translucent, and speckled with brown pigment.|$|R

5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes have less {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble those of the adult female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly.|$|E
5|$|Millipede eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of the}} head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.|$|E

5|$|The mammary glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the mother's belly.|$|E
40|$|Positively charged {{electrostatic}} <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> protein {{surfaces are}} usually indicative of nucleic acid binding interfaces. Interestingly, many proteins {{which are not}} involved in nucleic acid binding possess large positive <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> their surface as well. In some cases, the positive <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> the protein are related to other functional properties of the protein family. PatchFinderPlus (PFplus) [URL] is a web-based tool for extracting and displaying continuous electrostatic positive <b>patches</b> <b>on</b> protein surfaces. The input required for PFplus is either a four letter PDB code or a protein coordinate file in PDB format, provided by the user. PFplus computes the continuum electrostatics potential and extracts the largest positive patch for each protein chain in the PDB file. The server provides an output file in PDB format including a list of the patch residues. In addition, the largest positive <b>patch</b> is displayed <b>on</b> the server by a graphical viewer (Jmol), using a simple color coding...|$|R

5|$|Three other, {{significantly}} smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, {{but none}} has white plumage completely surrounding the eye. Further distinctions {{are that the}} red-breasted nuthatch has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the brown-headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap, and a white <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the nape of the neck.|$|E
5|$|A {{demonstration}} of the game was released on 26 June 2002, featuring tutorial missions and a full single-player mission. The game was released on 19 August in North America and on 30 August in Europe. The Creative Assembly released a <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> 5 November 2002, which was targeted to fix the several bugs that were still present in the game. A new historical battle based on the Battle of Stamford Bridge was later released by The Creative Assembly, made available through Wargamer.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

5|$|Gestation is {{typically}} six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males {{may have a}} black <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the head and the neck. Young are precocial - they can {{stand on their own}} soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of parturition. Juveniles remain active and playful throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan {{is typically}} 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed {{these issues in}} two patches. The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second patch did not contain the first's fixes.|$|E
5|$|The snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni) {{also known}} as the Celebes rail or Platen's rail is a large flightless rail, {{the only member of the}} genus Aramidopsis. It is an Indonesian endemic found in dense {{vegetation}} in wet areas of Sulawesi and nearby Buton. The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a rufous <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> the hindneck. The sexes are similar, but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris. The typical call is the snoring ee-orrrr sound that gives the bird its English name.|$|E

5|$|Three {{franchise}} {{records were}} set during the season. Henrik Sedin became the Canucks all-time leading scorer, surpassing Markus Naslund. Alexandre Burrows scored six seconds {{into a game}} making it the fastest goal to start a game for Vancouver. Vigneault became the all-time leader in games coached. As a way of celebrating 100 years of hockey in British Columbia, the Canucks wore a special <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> their jerseys with the logo of the Vancouver Millionaires, the first professional team in the city. They also wore replica jerseys of the Millionaires for one game.|$|E
5|$|Crex {{is a small}} genus {{of birds}} in the rail family. It {{contains}} two species, the corn crake, C. crex, which breeds across Europe and Asia and winters in southern Africa, and the African crake, C. egregia, which migrates within Africa. Both are short-billed rails with blackish-brown upperparts, mainly blue-grey underparts, and barring on the flanks. The corn crake is significantly larger than its relative, and has a distinctive chestnut <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> its wings. Unusually for their family, these are birds of dry habitats rather than wetlands; the Eurasian species mainly breeds in hay meadows, and the African crake in dry grassland. The African crake is sometimes given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2007, the brigade was mobilized to Fort Dix for {{training}} along with the 72nd Field Artillery Brigade from April until September. Soldiers of the 174th Infantry Brigade trained other units in land navigation, area security, urban operations, marksmanship, and live fire exercises. Most of the soldiers being trained {{were members of the}} Army National Guard. The brigade received distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia in September 2007. These items contained allusions to the brigade's honors during World War I and II, and its history with the 78th Infantry Division. However, as it is subordinate to the First Army, soldiers of the brigade wear that <b>patch</b> <b>on</b> their shoulders instead. Later that month, the brigade was again mobilized to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for another training mission.|$|E
