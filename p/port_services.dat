40|$|Abstract. The {{increase}} of ships crossing {{encounter in the}} intersection water of bidirectional navigation Y-fairway (YF) seriously decreases the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> level. So {{it is necessary to}} study the ship traffic rules in YF intersection water to improve this phenomenon. This paper first analyzes the ship navigation characteristics in YF intersection water. Then a simulation model for ship sailing operation system of YF is built to study the influence of different traffic rules on <b>port</b> <b>service</b> level. Traffic rules separately are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Larger Ship Priority (LSP) and Ship Leaving Port Priority (SLPP). Finally, a case study is introduced to analyze the influence of each rule on <b>port</b> <b>service</b> level. The results show that traffic rules have little effect on <b>port</b> <b>service</b> level for smaller scale ports. But LSP maintains higher <b>port</b> <b>service</b> level with the {{increase of}} port scale, while SLPP reveals obvious advantage if port scale continues increasing.

2500|$|These HX convoys {{had been}} {{established}} shortly after declaration of war; and the first sailed on 16 September 1939. Ships in convoy were less vulnerable to submarine attack than ships sailing independently, but the Allies had difficulty providing an adequate number of escorting warships to establish a protective perimeter for detecting and defeating approaching submarines. British Admiralty operations research scientists evaluating convoy battles of 1941 and 1942 determined losses of ships in convoy were independent of convoy size, but varied {{with the number of}} attacking submarines and, when patrol aircraft were unavailable, with the number of escorting warships. They suggested convoy losses could be reduced by 64 percent by decreasing the frequency of convoys to increase the average number of merchant ships in each convoy from 32 to 54 and the number of escorting warships from 6 to 9. Additional reduction of losses was theoretically possible with even larger convoys, but difficulties maneuvering large formations of ships and providing <b>port</b> <b>services</b> for simultaneous arrival of so many ships discouraged very large convoys until trade convoy escort warships were required to support the Invasion of Normandy. More than one hundred ships sailed in each of 7 ON convoys and 9 HX convoys during the summer of 1944. HX 300 was the largest of these with 166 merchant ships arranged in 19 parallel columns to produce a formation approximately [...] wide and [...] long. Ships sailing from New York City on 17 July 1944 were joined by 30 merchant ships sailing from Halifax Harbour on 19 July, 24 sailing from Sydney, Nova Scotia on 20 July, and 3 from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador to form the largest trade convoy of the war.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>port</b> <b>service</b> quality (PSQ) {{has become a}} critical issue in port management. However, previous studies neglect the difficulties in so doing by relying on the resources and capability available at the shipping companies. This study proposes and reports on the testing of a 3 D model for prioritising PSQ attributes by introducing a novel dimension called &# 039;goal difficulty&# 039; into the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> contributory improvement index. The index represents the composite satisfaction index derived from Kano&# 039;s model and the standardised weight derived from IPA. The data for testing the proposed 3 D model were collected from the managers of five major container ports in Asia. The test results were compared against those acquired using 2 D methods (e. g., IPA), and managerial implications were drawn. The newly developed model is expected to help port managers allocate their limited resources efficiently in their prioritisation of PSQ improvement and in optimising <b>port</b> <b>service</b> user needs...|$|R

It is important for ports to enhance intangible as well as tangible resources to obtain sustainable competitive advantage. In this connection, this study aims to identify port intangible resources which {{may contribute to the}} delivery of <b>port</b> <b>service</b> quality and to propose a fuzzy TOPSIS approach to solve the port choice problem focusing on intangible resources. Fuzzy TOPSIS is appropriate to assist decision making with ambiguous and uncertain problems such as port choice with respect to intangible resources. In this paper, five port intangible resources were identified and evaluated and five leading container ports in the Asia-Pacific region were assessed in terms of their intangible resources. A survey questionnaire was sent to 21 experts who are working in shipping companies in Korea and involved in the selection of ports. It was found that customer and relational resource contributes most to the delivery of <b>port</b> <b>service</b> quality while Hong Kong appeared to be the port where intangible resources were most highly evaluated. This research helps to enrich the literature on <b>port</b> <b>service</b> quality and <b>port</b> choice evaluation.
