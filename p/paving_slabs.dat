2500|$|The Wellington Iron and Coal Company built Randlay Chimney in 1873 however, due to {{bankruptcy}} in 1877, the furnace seen today was never fired. This site {{was bought by}} the Wrekin Chemical Company in 1886 and used to manufacture naphtha charcoal and lime salts until the locals complained about the smell. The last mine, Grange Pit, closed in 1894 however, new industries soon arrived to produce kerbstones and <b>paving</b> <b>slabs.</b> By the 1960s industries had moved from the area leaving behind a trail of derelict remains soon to be reclaimed by nature. Despite all this industrial activity plants and animals soon returned and as you follow the paths you will find mining and factory remains amongst the trees and meadows. [...] The pit mounds evolved into small heathland and woodlands and hedgerows grew alongside the old canal and railway tracks and the quarries became pools.|$|E

50|$|The episode aired 13 February 2011 {{contained}} {{a challenge for}} a 4-seat convertible costing under £2000. All 3 presenters purchased E30 325i convertibles. Modifications to the cars included Clarkson's car (the only car with an automatic gearbox) having a large <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> in the boot to improve handling, and Hammond's car (which handled the worst) having aftermarket wheels and lowered suspension. May's car was un-modified, and subsequently won the challenge by a significant margin.|$|R

2500|$|Violence {{continued}} sporadically on O'Connell Street {{for another}} hour or so. The Gardaí, advancing from {{the northern end of}} the street gradually pushed the rioters back southwards. The most sustained violence took place around the General Post Office building, where the rioters initially sat down in protest and then, several of them having been batoned, regrouped behind burning barricades and threw rocks, <b>paving</b> <b>slabs</b> and one or possibly two petrol bombs at Gardaí. Several Gardaí, protesters and a number of journalists from RTÉ and TV3 were injured. RTÉ's chief news correspondent, Charlie Bird was singled out for attack by some rioters and was kicked and punched while being called an [...] "Orange bastard" [...] before being rescued by the Garda SDU officers. Charlie Bird {{had been a member of}} the Workers' Party of Ireland which had split from Sinn Féin in 1970 and was seen as highly critical of the Republican Movement. However some of the violence appeared to be entirely random in its targets. For instance several bystanders were attacked and a woman who was five months pregnant was punched in the stomach. The woman later sent a text message to NewsTalk 106 to thank the Gardaí and ambulance service who looked after her after the incident. In addition, the windows of several businesses, including Foot Locker, Schuh, and Ulster Bank near O'Connell Bridge, were smashed and at least one shop (Footlocker shoe shop) was looted. Among those arrested for looting this shop were a number of foreign nationals as well as locals – indicating that in the latter stages of the riot, much of the disturbances were opportunistic – inspired by vandalism or desire for theft rather than politically motivated.|$|E

The prints from all the sites are referred to Broomichnium permianum Kuhn 1958, of which Quadrispinichna parvia of Anderson 1974 is a synonym.

Shields was arrested and subsequently convicted for the attack. Shields launched two appeals against his conviction amid a high-profile campaign, in 2005 and 2006, but they both failed and the original verdict was affirmed.

50|$|The {{three were}} given £2,000 {{to buy a}} {{four-seater}} convertible car. However, they all buy the same car: a BMW 325i. Hammond bought a 1987 model for £1,600 which had done 94,318 miles according to the odometer, and had aftermarket wheels, aftermarket alarm, a lower suspension and extra locks fitted. Clarkson bought a 1988 model for £1,950 which had done 137,488 miles and had a <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> in the boot (to improve handling) and May a 1989 model for £1,900 with no modifications. Clarkson decided to turn the challenge into a test to see how different the three supposedly identical cars had become over time, so the trio ignored the producers' challenges and devised their own.|$|R

50|$|Shields {{conducted}} two unsuccessful appeals under Bulgarian {{jurisdiction in}} 2005 and 2006 on procedural grounds {{relating to the}} original trial. The 2006 appeal saw his prison sentence cut from 15 to 10 years, but his fine increased to £71,000 and his challenge for a retrial denied. No new evidence was introduced during the appeal and {{the facts of the}} original case were supported by existing evidence. The testimony of number of friends of Shields and the confession of Graham Sankey were dismissed as being biased towards helping to free Shields regardless of facts, inconsistent and inaccurate with Sankey incorrectly describing the weapon used in the attack as a <b>paving</b> <b>slab</b> (...a stone with irregular shape and not a pavement slab... according to police forensic reports).|$|R

From these detection heights it was determined that: (1) obstacle detection was influenced by illuminance, the 50 % detection height being lower at 20 lux than at 0. 2 lux, (2) the young observers (60 years old) age groups, and (3) obstacle detection was affected by lamp type at 0. 2 lux, with the 50 % detection height decreasing as lamp S/P ratio increased, but at 2. 0 and 20 lux {{there was no significant difference}} between the three test lamps...|$|R
