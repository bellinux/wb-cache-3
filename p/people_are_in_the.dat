5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans of the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains {{that she used to}} live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that global warming is causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E

500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of regime change in San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros is astonishing. There is no talk of revolution; the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, {{takes the place of}} a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see everywhere. You can give as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want." [...] In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen's launch of the story's English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.|$|E

2500|$|Callum Marsh of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} film 1 star, and wrote: [...] "Flaws—and {{there are a}} great many that would have never made the cut were this a perfectible studio recording—are {{conveniently}} swept under the rug of candid expression ... the worst quality of Les Misérables's live singing is simply that it puts too much pressure on a handful of performers who frankly cannot sing.... Fisheye lenses and poorly framed close-ups abound in Les Misérables, nearly every frame a revelation of one man's bad taste ... One would be hard-pressed to describe this, despite the wealth of beauty on display, as anything but an ugly film, shot and cut ineptly. Everything in the film, songs included, is cranked to 11, the melodrama of it all soaring. So it's odd that this kind of showboating maximalism should be ultimately reduced to a few fisheye'd faces, mugging for their close-up, as the people sing off-key and broken." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Philips gave the film only one and a half stars, writing: [...] "The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk, frantically. So you have hammering close-ups, combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frame. ...too little in this frenzied mess of a film registers because Hooper is trying to make everything register at the same nutty pitch." ...|$|E

Social media integration as an access point is a very useful and mutually beneficial tool for users and providers. All major news providers have visibility and an access point through networks such as Facebook and Twitter maximizing their breadth of audience. Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know. The ability to [...] "share, like, and comment on...content" [...] increases the reach farther and wider than traditional methods. People like to interact with information, they enjoy including the people they know in their circle of knowledge. Sharing through social media has become so influential that publishers must [...] "play nice" [...] if they desire to succeed. Although, it is often mutually beneficial for publishers and Facebook to [...] "share, promote and uncover new content" [...] to improve both user base experiences. The impact of popular opinion can spread in unimaginable ways. Social media allows interaction through simple to learn and access tools; The Wall Street Journal offers an app through Facebook, and The Washington Post goes a step further and offers an independent social app that was downloaded by 19.5 million users in 6 months, proving how interested <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new way of being provided information.|$|E
