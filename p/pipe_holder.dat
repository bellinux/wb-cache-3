50|$|The Dorchester Pot was a metal vase-like {{object that}} was {{recovered}} in two pieces after an explosion used {{to break up}} rock at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1852. According to text reprinted from the Boston Transcript, a local paper, in the June 5, 1852 Scientific American, the two pieces were found, loose among debris thrown out by the explosion. Apparently, it was inferred from {{the locations of the}} two pieces of this pot among the explosion debris that this pot had been blasted from solid puddingstone (conglomerate), {{which is part of the}} Roxbury Conglomerate, from about 10 feet below the surface of Meeting House Hill. The story has been used by creationists and fringe theorists as evidence that conventional models of geology or the length of the human presence on earth are wrong. Mainstream commentators identify it as a Victorian era candlestick or <b>pipe</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two Leggings {{resided in}} the Crow Nation with the rank of <b>Pipe</b> <b>Holder,</b> equal to platoon lieutenant.Once the {{extermination}} of the American bison began, the competition among the Plains Indians was at its fiercest. War became a struggle {{of life and death}} in the many plains societies. War was no trivial matter, in the societies it was a very spiritual matter. War required the proper ceremonies and occult assistance. Triumph in war was contingent on divine arrangements, war medicine, the bravery of the warrior, and the expertise they possessed. Owing to the constant state of war found in the Great Plains, death in conflict was a special honor, people who died young were thought to have had a weak sacred helper or that they did not abide by their sacred father. Warriors who lived into old age were believed to have very formidable spiritual helpers.Two Leggings lived to be quite old, though it was deemed {{that he did not have}} a very strong spiritual helper due to the inadequacy of his spiritual manifestations. He eventually went onto buy War Medicine from Sees the Living Bull, but ultimately it did little to help him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The main aim of any {{design process}} {{involves}} optimization of the structure, {{keeping in mind}} that the strength, manufacturability and cost involved in producing such a structure. This project aims at designing <b>pipe</b> <b>holder</b> structure to hold certain number of pipes of standard sizes and analyzed for the available mounting options. The design also involves fixing the bolts number and size used to mount the structure at the finalized mounting point. The material selection process also obtains the reaction load which is described to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} mesh type, mesh size and boundary conditions applied to complete an effective FEA model. At last the design objective could be simply, to minimize cost of the structure by reducing material and improving the structural strength. The results obtained from FEA analysis and numerical calculation values are validated to check the accuracy of the results...|$|E
50|$|The {{gas holder}} or {{gasometer}} was a tank used for storage {{of the gas}} and to maintain even pressure in distribution <b>pipes.</b> The gas <b>holder</b> usually consisted of an upturned steel bell contained within a large frame that guided it as it rose and fell depending {{on the amount of}} gas contained.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the sales}} figures also show, the Bakelite Company {{produced}} [...] "Transparent" [...] cast resin (which {{did not include}} filler) for a small ongoing market during the 1910s and 1920s. Blocks or rods of cast resin, also known as [...] "artificial amber", were machined and carved to create items such as <b>pipe</b> stems, cigarette <b>holders</b> and jewelry. However, the demand for molded plastics led the Bakelite Company to concentrate on molding, rather than developing market opportunities for cast resins.|$|R
50|$|Meerschaum has {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as a substitute for soapstone, fuller's earth, and as a building material; but its chief use is for smoking <b>pipes</b> and cigarette <b>holders.</b> The first recorded use of meerschaum for making pipes was around 1723 and quickly became prized as the perfect material for providing a cool, dry, flavorful smoke. The porous nature of meerschaum draws moisture and tobacco tar into the stone. Meerschaum became a premium substitute for the clay pipes of the day and remains prized to this day, though since the mid-1800s briar pipes have become the most common pipes for smoking.|$|R
50|$|The firm of Dunhill created custom smoking <b>pipes</b> and {{cigarette}} <b>holders</b> out of whangee, lacquering {{the surface of}} the plant stems and adding a black plastic or Bakelite mouthpiece. Terry-Thomas, the well-known British comedic actor, habitually used an 8-inch (200 mm) long custom black lacquered whangee cigarette holder. It became his trademark and is seen in most of his publicity photographs. His collection included a valuable holder that had a spiral of diamonds set in gold over the black lacquered whangee. It was stolen out of his dressing room, and was recovered in a damaged state.|$|R
5000|$|Chaffey's {{master plan}} called for distributing the water over the whole tract to each farm lot in cement <b>pipes,</b> with each <b>holder</b> {{to share in the}} water proportionately to his holding {{irrespective}} of distance from the source. Chaffey also laid out the main thoroughfare which ran {{from one end of the}} settlement to the other. He also named the [...] "main thoroughfare" [...] Euclid in honor of his favorite mathematician. Euclid Avenue was seven miles long, stretching from the colony's [...] "southernmost boundaries to the mountains." [...] Euclid was planned as a [...] "200-foot-wide double drive ... a center parkway to be flanked by a 65-foot-wide drive on each side. Chaffey also planned for electricity in Ontario with street lamps being placed a mile apart on Euclid and an electric streetcar that would travel up and down Euclid daily. Ontario was available for settlement on November 1, 1882. During the first week, Chaffey sold 190 acres for a total value of $28,500.|$|R
