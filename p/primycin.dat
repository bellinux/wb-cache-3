40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>primycin,</b> a potent {{ionophore}} in biological membranes, {{have been studied}} at the neuromuscular junction of the garter snake. <b>Primycin</b> in concentrations greater than 2 X 10 (- 7) M produced a time- and concentration-dependent depolarization of twitch muscle fibres. <b>Primycin</b> (10 (- 7) - 5 X 10 (- 7) M) produced an increased rate of quantal release of acetylcholine, which was not maintained, and a slight reduction in quantal size. Time to onset and to peak effect of <b>primycin</b> were concentration-dependent whereas maximum frequency was not. Absence of extracellular Ca 2 + produced a significant delay in the time to onset and to peak effect of <b>primycin,</b> but {{did not affect the}} peak miniature endplate potential (m. e. p. p.) frequency. Following 60 min exposure to <b>primycin</b> (5 X 10 (- 7) M), introduction of a high concentration of potassium (20 mM) produced no further increase in spontaneous release. In cut muscle preparations, exposure to <b>primycin</b> (10 (- 7) - 5 X 10 (- 7) M) reduced peak endplate current (e. p. c.) amplitude until nerve stimulation resulted in failures or the release of one or two quanta. E. p. c. amplitude was not restored with prolonged washing. The effects of <b>primycin</b> on the nerve terminal are considered to be consistent with its ability to increase the permeability of membranes to calcium ions resulting in an influx of extracellular calcium, an efflux of mitochondrial calcium and eventual depletion of synaptic vesicles...|$|E
40|$|Interaction of <b>primycin</b> {{antibiotic}} with plasma membrane, and its indirect biological {{effects were}} investigated in this study. The antifungal activity of <b>primycin</b> against 13 human pathogenic Candida ATCC and CBS reference species and 74 other Candida albicans clinical isolates was investigated with a microdilution technique. No primycin-resistant strain was detected. Direct interaction of <b>primycin</b> with the plasma membrane was demonstrated {{for the first}} time by using an ergosterol-producing strain 33 erg + and its ergosterol-less mutant erg- 2. In growth inhibition tests, the 33 erg + strain proved to be more sensitive to <b>primycin</b> than its erg- 2 mutant, indicating the importance of the plasma membrane composition in primycin-induced processes. The 64 μg ml − 1 (56. 8 nM) <b>primycin</b> treatment induced an enhanced membrane fluidity and altered plasma membrane dynamics, as measured by steady-state fluorescence anisotropy applying a trimethylammonium-diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH) fluorescence polarization probe. The following consequences were detected. The plasma membrane of the cells lost its barrier function, and the efflux of 260 -nm-absorbing materials from treated cells of both strains was 1. 5 – 1. 8 times more than that for the control. Depending on the <b>primycin</b> concentration, the cells exhibited unipolar budding, pseudohyphae formation, and a rough cell surface visualized by scanning electron microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Bactericidal effect against non-dividing {{bacteria}} {{is a very}} advantageous, but rare characteristic among antimicrobial agents, mostly {{possessed by}} those affecting the cell membrane. These kinds of agents can kill bacterial cells without lysis. We assessed these characteristics on <b>primycin,</b> a topical anti-staphylococcal agent highly effective against prevalent multiresistant strains, as it also acts on the cell membrane. In time-kill studies, <b>primycin</b> preserved its bactericidal activity against growth-arrested Staphylococcus aureus cultures. The bactericidal action was slower against growth-arrested cultures compared to the exponentially growing ones to different extents depending on the manner of arrest. The bactericidal effect was less influenced by stringent response and by protein synthesis inhibition, proving {{that it does not}} depend on metabolic activity. In contrast, uncoupling of the membrane potential predominantly slowed, and low temperature almost stopped killing of bacteria. In consideration of published data, these facts suggest that the antibacterial action of <b>primycin</b> involves disrupting of the membrane potential, and is predominantly influenced by the membrane fluidity. Optical density measurements and transmission electron microscopy verified that <b>primycin</b> kills bacterial cells without lysis. These results reveal favorable characteristics of <b>primycin</b> and point to, and broaden the knowledge on its membrane-targeted effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe direct {{interaction}} of the antibiotic <b>primycin</b> with the plasma membrane was investigated by employing the well-characterized ergosterol-producing, amphotericin B-sensitive parental Candida albicans strain 33 erg+ and its ergosterol-less amphotericin B-resistant plasma membrane mutant erg- 2. The growth inhibition concentration in shaken liquid medium was 64 μgml− 1 for 33 erg+ and 128 μgml− 1 for erg- 2, suggesting that the plasma membrane composition influences the mode of action of <b>primycin.</b> To determine the primycin-induced changes in the plasma membrane dynamic, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy methods were used, the spin-labeled fatty acid 5 -(4, 4 -dimethyloxazolidine-N-oxyl) stearic acid) being applied for the in vivo measurements. The phase transition temperatures of untreated strain 33 erg+ and its mutant erg- 2 were 12. 5 °C and 11 °C, respectively. After 128 μgml− 1 <b>primycin</b> treatment, these values increased to 17. 5 °C and 16 °C, revealing {{a significant reduction in}} the phospholipid flexibility. Saturation transfer EPR measurements demonstrated that, the rotational correlation times of the spin label molecule for the control samples of 33 erg+ and erg- 2 were 60 ns and 100 ns. These correlation times gradually decreased on the addition of increasing <b>primycin</b> concentrations, reaching 8 μs and 1 μs. The results indicate the plasma membrane “rigidizing” effect of <b>primycin,</b> a feature that may stem from its ability to undergo complex formation with membrane constituent fatty acid molecules, causing alterations in the structures of phospholipids in the hydrophobic surface near the fatty acid chain region...|$|E
40|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the complex forming effect of <b>Primycin</b> in DNA solutions observed in vitro may likewise play a role in vivo in the inhibition of the function of the DNA molecule. In this respect, the effect exerted by <b>Primycin</b> {{is similar to that of}} Actinomycin D. The molecular mechanism of complex formation hower, is as yet unknown. We think that the mechanism of complex formation between <b>Primycin</b> and DNA differs basically from the mechanism of Actinomycin A as described by REICH et al [7]. There is no relationship between the chemical structures of the two antibiotics, which fact permits us to assume that the linkage of the two antibiotics with the macromolecule is different. We sonsider our experiments essential for two reasons: 1. It is interesting from a purely theoretical point of viewr to investigate the inhibitory effect of a new drug on protein synthesis. 2. The disclosure of the mechanism of action of toxic antibiotics may prove to be an stimulus for extending their therapeutic utilizatio...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomonospora azurea SZMC 14600 is {{a member}} of the family Pseudonocardiaceae {{exclusively}} used for industrial scale production of <b>primycin</b> a large 36 -membered non-polyene macrolide lactone antibiotic belonging to the polyketide class of natural products. Even though maximum antibiotic yield has been achieved by empirically optimized two-step fermentation process, little is known about the molecular components and mechanisms underlying the efficient antibiotic production. In order to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the pre- and main-fermentation stages of <b>primycin,</b> comparative 2 D-PAGE experiments were performed. In total, 98 DEP spots were reproducibly detected, out of which four spots were excised from gels, and identified through MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis revealed peptide matches to HicB antitoxin for the HicAB toxin-antitoxin system (EHK 86651), to a nucleoside diphosphate kinase regulator ((Ndk; EHK 81899) and two other proteins with unknown function (EHK 88946 and EHK 86777) ...|$|E
40|$|Desertomycin A is an aminopolyol polyketide {{containing}} a macrolactone ring. We {{have proposed that}} desertomycin A and similar compounds (marginolactones) are formed by polyketide synthases primed not with gamma-aminobutanoyl-CoA but with 4 -guanidinylbutanoyl-CoA, to avoid facile cyclization of the starter unit. This hypothesis requires {{that there be a}} final-stage de-amidination of the corresponding guanidino-substituted natural product, but no enzyme for such a process has been described. We have now identified candidate amidinohydrolase genes within the desertomycin and <b>primycin</b> clusters. Deletion of the putative desertomycin amidinohydrolase gene dstH in Streptomyces macronensis led to the accumulation of desertomycin B, the guanidino form of the antibiotic. Also, purified DstH efficiently catalyzed the in vitro conversion of desertomycin B into the A form. Hence this amidinohydrolase furnishes the missing link in this proposed naturally evolved example of protective-group chemistry. BBSRC/BB/J 007250 / 1 BBSRC/BB/K 002341 /...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antifungal}} {{activities of the}} macrolide lactone antibiotic complex <b>primycin</b> (PC) and its main components, A 1 (50 %), A 2 (7. 3 %) and C 1 (13 %), against the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans 33 erg+ were determined by microdilution testing. The MIC 100 values found, A 2 (2 µg ml- 1), PC (32 µg ml- 1), A 1 (32 µg ml- 1) and C 1 (64 µg ml- 1), suggested that the biological activity of PC is highly dependent on the proportions of its constituents. In vivo measurements of the biophysical properties of plasma membranes were carried out by EPR spectroscopic methods, using the spin probe 5 -(4, 4 - dimethyloxazolidine-N-oxyl) stearic acid. Conventional EPR measurements demonstrated altered phase transition temperatures (Tm) of the plasma membrane of strain 33 erg+ {{as a consequence of}} treatment with PC or its constituents: for cells treated with 128 µg ml- 1 PC, A 1, A 2 or C 1 for 15 min, Tm was 17, 21, 14. 5 and 15 °C, respectively, i. e. significantly higher than the Tm of untreated cells, 12 °C. The molecular motions of the near- surface hydrophobic region of the plasma membrane, estimated by saturation transfer EPR spectroscopy, reflected changes in the membrane phases after the treatment. Two physiological membrane phases were detected in control samples: liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered, characterized by molecular movements ~ 10 - 6 - 10 - 8 s and ≥ 10 - 9 s. The cells treated with the investigated compounds showed the strong presence of a non-physiological gel phase additional to the above phases, characterized by movements ≤ 10 - 5 s...|$|E
