5|$|Recent {{improvements}} in targeting and imaging {{have led to}} the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode {{allergenic}} proteins, for example Feld4 is primarily {{produced in the}} submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto dander as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Swiss {{citizens}} are universally required to {{buy health insurance}} from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While {{the cost of the}} system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> citizens have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it. In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women — the highest in the world. However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%). From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided. With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.|$|E
25|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding amitriptyline in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to {{the risk}} {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively.
