Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> is comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E

The Meaning-in-Life Orientations test (MOL) is often used to assess <b>purposes</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and meaningfulness of life and is often used to compare individuals and groups. It is yet unclear whether this test shows measurement invariance across different countries or not, which was the main object of the current study. First, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted separately for data sets with Russian and Ukrainian students. Second, metric and scalar invariance were tested. Finally, comparisons between Russian and Ukrainian students were made on their scores on the MOL. [URL]...|$|R

The sovereign would be {{seated in the}} middle of the throne, which is shaped like a platform or bed that is raised from the ground.

In present-day Zoroastrianism, the Faravahar is said to be a reminder of one's <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> which is to live in such a way that the soul progresses towards frashokereti, or union with Ahura Mazda, the supreme divinity in Zoroastrianism. Although there are a number of interpretations of the individual elements of the symbol, none of them are older than the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Egyptian animal mummies were religious offerings. If an Egyptian sought a favor from a god, he would purchase or make an offering and place it at the appropriate temple of the god he wished to please. Before animal mummification became common, these offerings were usually bronze statues depicting the animals. However, eventually a cheaper alternative to bronze statues—animal mummies—became the most popular form of offering. Literally millions of these mummified animals have been discovered throughout Egypt. Inspection of these mummies, usually done through CT scans which allow researchers to examine the skeletons of the mummies without damaging the outer wrappings, has suggested that these types of animals were bred {{for the sole purpose}} of offerings. As the process of animal mummification for the purpose of offerings grew, mummification techniques became progressively less meticulous. Studies have revealed many of the large-scale animal offerings to be ‘fakes’ — the wrappings containing only a few bones, feathers, reeds, wood, or pieces of pottery. The animals were raised on temple grounds, and then sold to pilgrims or regular citizens. The animals’ necks were often broken, an indication that their sole <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> was to be sacrificed as offerings. When visiting the temples, Egyptians of the general public would purchase these pre-mummified animals and offer them to the gods.|$|E
