Additionally, more than 5, 600 surveys were sent to commercial fishermen, recreational anglers, non-governmental organization leaders, SSC members and MAFMC and NEFMC members in the NE and MA regions about EBFM and over 1, 000 responses were received. Neither low agreement nor low understanding between Council members and stakeholders appeared to be a barrier to NEFMC or MAFMC transition to EBFM. Council members and stakeholders responded that there are needs for social science information for EBFM and that although Council members and stakeholders perceive major barriers to EBFM, Council members and stakeholders do not perceive that these challenges are insurmountable. The study highlights specific barriers, social science needs, time lines and recommendations that MAFMC and NEFMC decision makers could focus on to facilitate the transition from single species fisheries management to EBFM. Specifically, decision makers and stakeholders recommend the development of a pilot plan for EBFM. Overall, managers and stakeholders in both the NE and MA regions generally agreed that EBFM is a holistic approach to fisheries management which includes biological, environmental, and human factors, and that the Councils should gradually transition to a management plan that reflects EBFM...|$|E

STANTA (with surface samples) is a part of Flintham’s on-going examination of the military and surveillance landscapes of the United Kingdom. Because of its historical relationship with the ‘lost’ churches within the Stanford Battle Area, St Peter Hungate is a suggestive and significant site for Flintham’s installation. For the duration of Ministries of Defence exhibition, ecclesiastical and military geographies converge, emphasising the hidden histories of the Stanford Training Area and the ‘lost’ landscapes of the Brecklands...|$|E
40|$|Decentralised {{approaches}} to water governance {{have emerged as}} a common approach to tackle complex environmental management issues in Australia and elsewhere. While decentralisation offers hope for a more holistic, integrated and effective approach to environmental planning decisions and solutions, challenges remain to put these ideals into practice. The present paper focuses on {{a key component of}} this approach to environmental planning and decision-making – the integration of different types of knowledge used to inform planning goals and the design of water quality management programs. The analysis draws on knowledge integration issues surrounding the water quality improvement plan in the Tully–Murray basin in north-eastern Australia. Here, government and non-government stakeholders are coordinating efforts to assess water quality condition and set management priorities for improving the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage coastal lagoon. Our analysis of the kinds of knowledge and mechanisms of translation involved highlights three main points. First, the tensions between the uncertainty and bias in different types of knowledge brought to the <b>planning</b> <b>table.</b> Second, the timing of knowledge contributions that affects if and how knowledge contributions can be debated and integrated. Finally, the challenges faced by local collaborative groups to broker the translation and integration of knowledge needed to inform strategic environmental decisions and programs...|$|E
